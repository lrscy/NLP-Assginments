This/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB also/RB stipulated/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 248/NNP ./.

The/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS ,/, therefore/RB ,/, already/RB has/VBZ all/PDT the/DT instruments/NNS necessary/JJ to/TO carry/VB out/RP its/PRP$ role/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO your/PRP$ suggestion/NN for/IN increasing/VBG the/DT Court/NNP '/POS s/JJ resources/NNS ,/, the/DT Council/NNP considers/VBZ that/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS have/VBP ,/, under/IN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN ,/, the/DT necessary/JJ financial/JJ means/NNS for/IN them/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO properly/RB carry/VB out/RP their/PRP$ respective/JJ remits/NNS ./.

In/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, it/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB desirable/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ financial/JJ resources/NNS to/TO be/VB increased/VBN ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP budgetary/JJ restraints/NNS of/IN which/WDT I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ ./.

If/IN extra/JJ resources/NNS were/VBD given/VBN to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS it/PRP would/MD be/VB money/NN well/RB spent/VBN ,/, because/IN it/PRP would/MD ensure/VB that/IN EU/NNP funding/NN was/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO something/NN that/WDT conflicted/VBN with/IN environmental/JJ concerns/NNS ./.

For/IN years/NNS the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN blocking/VBG the/DT strategic/JJ development/NN impact/NN assessment/NN of/IN plans/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ./.

If/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS were/VBD able/JJ to/TO assess/VB regularly/RB the/DT potential/JJ conflicts/NNS between/IN environmental/JJ concerns/NNS and/CC structural/JJ development/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB important/JJ because/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS could/MD do/VB an/DT extremely/RB good/JJ job/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ pointing/VBG out/RP once/RB more/RBR that/IN this/DT compromise/NN will/MD require/VB the/DT unanimous/JJ support/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Article/CD 190/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT assent/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, to/TO which/WDT it/PRP falls/VBZ to/TO approve/VB this/DT statute/NN ./.

The/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT artificial/JJ separation/NN of/IN Europe/NNP marked/VBD the/DT start/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ era/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, you/PRP are/VBP a/DT symbol/NN of/IN these/DT changes/NNS ./.

You/PRP founded/VBD and/CC signed/VBD Charter/NNP 77/CD ,/, the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS movement/NN which/WDT represented/VBD and/CC called/VBD for/IN fundamental/JJ values/NNS during/IN a/DT dark/JJ period/NN in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN your/PRP$ people/NNS ./.

A/DT Communist/JJ regime/NN sentenced/VBD you/PRP to/TO five/CD years/NNS in/IN prison/NN for/IN defending/VBG human/JJ freedom/NN and/CC dignity/NN ./.

Ten/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT ``/`` velvet/NN revolution/NN ''/'' proclaimed/VBD Havel/NNP na/NNP HRAD/VBD ./.

For/IN ten/CD years/NNS you/PRP represented/VBD democratic/JJ Czechoslovakia/NNP and/CC ,/, later/RB ,/, the/DT Czech/JJ Republic/NN ,/, as/IN its/PRP$ president/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN you/PRP will/MD agree/VB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, and/CC experience/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN us/PRP ,/, that/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ not/RB without/IN its/PRP$ pitfalls/NNS for/IN both/DT parties/NNS and/CC the/DT Czech/NNP Republic/NNP will/MD need/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN effort/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO meet/VB the/DT accession/NN criteria/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, for/IN its/PRP$ part/NN ,/, will/MD need/VB to/TO adapt/VB its/PRP$ institutions/NNS and/CC policies/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN enlargement/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ already/RB taken/VBN a/DT big/JJ step/NN forward/RB with/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ./.

You/PRP are/VBP right/JJ to/TO remind/VB us/PRP that/IN a/DT national/JJ identity/NN is/VBZ perfectly/RB compatible/JJ with/IN a/DT European/JJ identity/NN ./.

And/CC you/PRP have/VBP used/VBN your/PRP$ personal/JJ experience/NN to/TO show/VB us/PRP that/IN your/PRP$ European/JJ identity/NN was/VBD not/RB decreed/VBN ;/: it/PRP was/VBD a/DT spontaneous/JJ and/CC natural/JJ move/NN ./.

You/PRP reminded/VBD us/PRP of/IN your/PRP$ speech/NN in/IN 1994/CD ,/, which/WDT you/PRP yourself/RB qualify/VBP as/RB slightly/RB provocative/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ such/PDT a/DT thing/NN as/IN creative/JJ utopia/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO gauge/VB together/RP how/WRB far/RB we/PRP have/VBP come/VBN ./.

And/CC you/PRP very/RB opportunely/JJ highlighted/VBD the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT civil/JJ society/NN ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT civil/JJ society/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB in/IN the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN all/PDT the/DT countries/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, in/IN restoring/VBG our/PRP$ citizens/NNS '/POS confidence/NN ,/, in/IN restoring/VBG confidence/NN in/IN the/DT social/JJ solidarity/NN which/WDT we/PRP need/VBP ./.

To/TO summarise/VB ,/, perhaps/RB what/WP struck/VBD me/PRP most/RBS in/IN your/PRP$ speech/NN ;/: above/IN all/DT ,/, you/PRP wished/VBD to/TO remind/VB us/PRP that/IN ,/, beyond/IN its/PRP$ economic/JJ aspects/NNS ,/, the/DT task/NN of/IN constructing/VBG Europe/NNP is/VBZ a/DT spiritual/JJ one/NN ./.

ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT annual/JJ report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0032/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Development/NNP and/CC Cooperation/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT ACS-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP in/IN 1999/CD ./.

,/NNP rapporteur/VBP ./.

-/IN Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO be/VB rising/VBG at/IN 9/CD a.m./RB ,/, not/RB 9/CD p.m./RB ,/, to/TO present/VB this/DT report/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT number/NN of/IN Members/NNS in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT indication/NN of/IN the/DT interest/NN in/IN overseas/JJ development/NN work/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ normal/JJ practice/NN that/IN the/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP is/VBZ put/VBN before/IN Members/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC I/PRP have/VBP the/DT pleasant/JJ task/NN of/IN doing/VBG that/DT tonight/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD report/VB two/CD highly/RB successful/JJ Assemblies/NNS having/VBG taken/VBN place/NN ,/, one/CD in/IN Strasbourg/NNP and/CC one/CD in/IN Nassau/NNP ./.

In/IN many/JJ ways/NNS this/DT was/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN an/DT old/JJ era/NN and/CC the/DT start/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ one/NN ./.

The/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP is/VBZ a/DT unique/JJ organisation/NN in/IN world/NN politics/NNS ./.

Where/WRB else/RB do/VBP 86/CD nations/NNS come/VB together/RP to/TO discuss/VB matters/NNS of/IN mutual/JJ concern/NN ?/.

The/DT Strasbourg/NNP Assembly/NNP was/VBD the/DT last/JJ chaired/NN by/IN Lord/NNP Plumb/NNP ./.

In/IN honour/NN of/IN the/DT tremendous/JJ work/NN he/PRP carried/VBD out/RP over/IN a/DT difficult/JJ period/NN the/DT Joint/NNP Bureau/NNP in/IN Nassau/NNP made/VBD him/PRP an/DT honorary/JJ president/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP wish/VBP him/PRP well/RB in/IN his/PRP$ retirement/NN ./.

The/DT two/CD Assemblies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN dominated/VBN by/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS on/IN renewal/NN of/IN the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP and/CC I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT signature/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ Convention/NN and/CC its/PRP$ rapid/JJ ratification/NN by/IN all/PDT the/DT countries/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

I/PRP remember/VBP that/IN at/IN the/DT last/JJ mid-term/JJ review/NN ,/, when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD rapporteur/JJ ,/, the/DT then/JJ Commissioner/NNP Marin/NNP said/VBD that/IN review/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT last/JJ ./.

Well/UH ,/, he/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP pay/VBP tribute/NN to/TO Philip/NNP Lowe/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ team/NN who/WP have/VBP worked/VBN so/RB successfully/RB behind/IN the/DT scenes/NNS to/TO conclude/VB a/DT new/JJ Convention/NN in/IN very/RB difficult/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.

I/PRP was/VBD also/RB delighted/JJ to/TO hear/VB the/DT report/NN this/DT morning/NN from/IN Commissioner/NNP Nielson/NNP who/WP has/VBZ worked/VBN untiringly/RB to/TO get/VB the/DT right/JJ outcome/NN to/TO the/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

I/PRP pay/VBP special/JJ tribute/NN to/TO him/PRP for/IN his/PRP$ success/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB pay/VB tribute/NN to/TO Mrs/NNP Kinnock/NNP and/CC her/PRP$ working/VBG group/NN for/IN the/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN work/NN they/PRP put/VBD in/IN on/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB sure/JJ that/IN Mrs/NNP Kinnock/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN and/CC the/DT one/NN on/IN regional/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC integration/NN had/VBD a/DT major/JJ bearing/NN on/IN the/DT outcome/NN of/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB thank/VBP the/DT Working/JJ Groups/NNS on/IN the/DT small/JJ island/NN states/NNS and/CC climate/NN change/NN and/CC the/DT Follow-up/JJ Group/NNP on/IN Fisheries/NNPS for/IN their/PRP$ excellent/JJ reports/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN question/NN times/CC to/TO the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT ACP/NNP Council/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB those/DT institutions/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ interest/NN in/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ thrust/NN of/IN our/PRP$ work/NN in/IN both/DT Assemblies/NNPS was/VBD poverty/NN eradication/NN ./.

The/DT resolution/NN passed/VBN went/VBD so/RB far/RB as/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN poverty/NN amounted/VBD to/TO a/DT violation/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

It/PRP also/RB emphasised/VBD the/DT importance/NN of/IN abolishing/VBG gender/NN inequalities/NNS and/CC as/IN I/PRP travel/VB through/IN Africa/NNP and/CC see/VB the/DT work/NN done/VBN by/IN women/NNS I/PRP only/RB wish/VBP there/EX were/VBD more/JJR women/NNS in/IN senior/JJ government/NN positions/NNS and/CC in/IN presidential/JJ posts/NNS ./.

We/PRP might/MD then/RB see/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT fraud/NN ,/, corruption/NN and/CC mismanagement/NN that/WDT seem/VBP endemic/JJ in/IN some/DT countries/NNS and/CC that/WDT have/VBP to/TO be/VB stopped/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ reasonable/JJ because/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

But/CC we/PRP should/MD not/RB create/VB the/DT impression/NN that/IN vast/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN European/JJ resources/NNS are/VBP being/VBG put/VBN at/IN risk/NN by/IN carelessness/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB 1/CD %/NN of/IN GDP/NNP ,/, by/IN comparison/NN with/IN national/JJ spending/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN all/PDT that/DT before/IN but/CC some/DT people/NNS in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP are/VBP young/JJ and/CC do/VBP not/RB seem/VB to/TO understand/VB how/WRB small/JJ the/DT financial/JJ resources/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP are/VBP and/CC that/IN 80/CD %/NN of/IN these/DT resources/NNS are/VBP spent/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

So/IN carelessness/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN the/DT spending/NN of/IN money/NN is/VBZ not/RB likely/JJ to/TO put/VB at/IN risk/NN vast/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN money/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD get/VB it/PRP into/IN perspective/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO remember/VB that/DT ./.

The/DT business/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ very/RB little/JJ about/IN spending/NN money/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP very/RB little/RB of/IN it/PRP ./.

They/PRP have/VBP a/DT much/RB wider/JJR responsibility/NN ./.

That/DT wider/JJR responsibility/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT management/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, food/NN safety/NN ,/, foreign/JJ trade/NN ,/, the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC so/RB many/JJ other/JJ responsibilities/NNS we/PRP have/VBP given/VBN them/PRP without/IN the/DT resources/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT people/NNS who/WP agrees/VBZ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT vast/JJ lack/NN of/IN trust/NN ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ ,/, we/PRP have/VBP generated/VBN it/PRP in/IN this/DT House/NNP in/IN the/DT past/JJ year/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN here/RB for/IN 20/CD years/NNS and/CC found/VBD absolute/JJ trust/NN between/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN our/PRP$ problems/NNS and/CC we/PRP recognised/VBD difficulties/NNS but/CC there/EX was/VBD not/RB a/DT situation/NN where/WRB this/DT bureaucratic/JJ Commission/NNP was/VBD mistrusted/VBN ,/, doubted/VBD and/CC feared/VBD by/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP because/IN they/PRP were/VBD mismanaging/VBG our/PRP$ affairs/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT gross/JJ exaggeration/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT difficulties/NNS were/VBD ./.

This/DT Commission/NNP should/MD not/RB have/VB to/TO live/VB forever/RB in/IN the/DT shadow/NN of/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS that/WDT caused/VBD the/DT resignation/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP that/WDT went/VBD before/IN it/PRP ./.

While/IN there/EX were/VBD problems/NNS -/: and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO resolve/VB them/PRP in/IN view/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN -/: we/PRP sometimes/RB take/VBP the/DT negative/JJ side/NN too/RB far/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD very/RB much/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN his/PRP$ splendid/JJ report/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD use/VB it/PRP in/IN its/PRP$ reform/NN work/NN ./.

The/DT process/NN of/IN reform/NN has/VBZ been/VBN going/VBG on/RP for/IN some/DT time/NN ,/, and/CC something/NN like/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN emergency/NN seems/VBZ to/TO prevail/VB in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ administration/NN simply/RB does/VBZ not/RB function/VB particularly/RB well/RB ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP good/JJ ,/, capable/JJ employees/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT majority/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP need/VBP radical/JJ reform/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ too/RB little/JJ action/NN and/CC too/RB much/RB unnecessary/JJ bureaucracy/NN ./.

People/NNS should/MD have/VB clearly-defined/JJ powers/NNS to/TO take/VB decisions/NNS for/IN which/WDT they/PRP should/MD also/RB be/VB accountable/JJ ./.

The/DT Financial/NNP Regulation/NN should/MD be/VB amended/VBN ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD have/VB better/JJR control/NN of/IN the/DT finances/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN completely/RB doing/VBG away/RB with/IN ex/FW ante/FW financial/JJ control/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD be/VB careful/JJ about/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP should/MD retain/VB some/DT form/NN of/IN ex/FW ante/FW financial/JJ control/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/RB simply/RB to/TO carry/VB out/RP spot/NN checks/NNS once/IN the/DT money/NN has/VBZ been/VBN spent/VBN ./.

This/DT would/MD allow/VB too/RB many/JJ anomalous/JJ projects/NNS to/TO slip/VB through/RP ./.

Instead/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB reforming/VBG and/CC decentralising/VBG control/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB enough/JJ staff/NN ./.

As/IN Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, we/PRP must/MD have/VB the/DT courage/NN to/TO explain/VB to/TO our/PRP$ governments/NNS and/CC people/NNS back/RB home/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ staff/NN resources/NNS are/VBP not/RB at/IN all/DT adequate/JJ for/IN the/DT tasks/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN assigned/VBN to/TO it/PRP ./.

And/CC the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO refuse/VB new/JJ tasks/NNS if/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB also/RB get/VB the/DT extra/JJ staff/NN it/PRP needs/VBZ ./.

The/DT staffing/NN system/NN is/VBZ too/RB rigid/JJ ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT more/RBR frequent/JJ rotation/NN of/IN employees/NNS ,/, especially/RB at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT hierarchy/NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD also/RB be/VB much/RB easier/JJR to/TO sack/JJ inefficient/JJ and/CC incompetent/JJ employees/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB very/RB pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT disciplinary/JJ procedure/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB reformed/VBN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT very/RB bad/JJ experiences/NNS so/RB far/RB with/IN disciplinary/JJ proceedings/NNS show/VBP all/DT too/RB clearly/RB how/WRB necessary/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP carry/VBP out/RP reforms/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB help/VB but/CC reflect/VBP upon/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ ,/, on/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, a/DT Dutch-British-Scandinavian/JJ debate/NN where/WRB the/DT speakers/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

Perhaps/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT little/RB worrying/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, like/IN so/RB many/JJ others/NNS ,/, that/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN emergency/NN in/IN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP is/VBZ on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO being/VBG resolved/VBN ./.

We/PRP must/MD get/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP rushing/VBG to/TO put/VB out/RP a/DT fire/NN in/IN one/CD corner/NN ,/, only/RB then/RB to/TO have/VB to/TO rush/VB again/RB to/TO put/VB out/RP the/DT next/JJ one/NN ./.

As/IN Mr/NNP Blak/NNP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP must/MD instead/RB establish/VB a/DT system/NN with/IN clear/JJ roles/NNS ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP need/VBP tough/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB implemented/VBN ./.

Codes/NNS of/IN conduct/NN and/CC ethical/JJ committees/NNS are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ ./.

There/EX need/VBP to/TO be/VB tough/JJ rules/NNS stating/VBG ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, what/WP may/MD be/VB decentralised/VBN ,/, what/WP may/MD be/VB outsourced/VBN and/CC what/WP is/VBZ independent/JJ ./.

I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP a/DT little/RB worrying/JJ that/IN people/NNS are/VBP clamouring/VBG for/IN independence/NN in/IN this/DT debate/NN without/IN defining/VBG what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN relation/NN to/TO which/WDT there/EX is/VBZ to/TO be/VB independence/NN and/CC without/IN defining/VBG what/WP right/NN of/IN decision-making/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB exercised/VBN ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP ,/, then/RB ,/, are/VBP basic/JJ administrative/JJ regulations/NNS for/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, for/IN its/PRP$ institutions/NNS and/CC for/IN the/DT EU/NNP in/IN its/PRP$ relations/NNS with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

These/DT are/VBP what/WP are/VBP missing/VBG ./.

We/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN for/IN a/DT Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP and/CC criminal/JJ law/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP also/RB need/VBP administrative/JJ law/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD make/VB a/DT good/JJ deal/NN of/IN progress/NN if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP were/VBD to/TO adopt/VB ,/, as/IN binding/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, the/DT ombudsman/NN '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN of/IN a/DT code/NN of/IN conduct/NN for/IN good/JJ administrative/JJ practice/NN ./.

The/DT van/NNP Hulten/NNP report/NN is/VBZ a/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD also/RB clarify/VB our/PRP$ own/JJ auditing/NN roles/NNS ./.

The/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS is/VBZ to/TO monitor/VB the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT actions/NNS are/VBP incompatible/JJ with/IN the/DT regulations/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP should/MD not/RB examine/VB the/DT expediency/NN of/IN a/DT particular/JJ action/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ to/TO carry/VB out/RP the/DT political/JJ evaluation/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB hunt/VB down/RP criminals/NNS ./.

Tell/VB me/PRP what/WP national/JJ parliament/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, is/VBZ handed/VBN all/DT preliminary/JJ investigation/NN documents/NNS ./.

Obstinate/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP ,/, I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT regulations/NNS governing/VBG public/JJ access/NN to/TO official/JJ records/NNS must/MD be/VB clearly/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT draft/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN circulating/VBG on/IN the/DT Internet/NN ./.

Otherwise/RB I/PRP probably/RB would/MD have/VB felt/VBN slightly/RB guilty/JJ about/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN this/DT report/NN represents/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ improvement/NN ,/, also/RB with/IN its/PRP$ amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP from/IN the/DT Social/NNP Committee/NNP and/CC rapporteurs/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ committee/NN are/VBP always/RB proud/JJ to/TO receive/VB 100/CD amendments/NNS because/IN then/RB they/PRP know/VBP that/IN they/PRP have/VBP tabled/VBN an/DT interesting/JJ topic/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ also/RB the/DT case/NN here/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN over/IN the/DT top/NN to/TO spend/VB too/RB much/JJ time/NN talking/VBG about/IN these/DT 100/CD amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB point/VB out/RP that/IN our/PRP$ coordinator/NN on/IN the/DT Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP Committee/NNP is/VBZ Mr/NNP Pom脙/NNP 漏/NNP s/NNP Ruiz/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ Spanish/JJ and/CC has/VBZ hence/RB made/VBN a/DT major/JJ contribution/NN to/TO this/DT debate/NN from/IN a/DT Spanish/JJ perspective/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT key/JJ aspects/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN mentioned/VBN is/VBZ ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, the/DT rapporteur/NN '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN for/IN the/DT standing/NN committee/NN on/IN standards/NNS in/IN public/JJ administration/NN ./.

A/DT very/RB important/JJ proposal/NN indeed/VBZ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP only/RB very/RB surprised/JJ that/IN the/DT Socialist/JJ group/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO subordinate/VB this/DT proposal/NN to/TO one/CD tabled/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Morgan/NNP ,/, because/IN she/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO scrap/VB it/PRP altogether/RB ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB fully/RB grasp/VB the/DT underlying/VBG rationale/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB whether/IN this/DT is/VBZ to/TO appease/VB Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP happen/VBP to/TO know/VB Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ./.

He/PRP is/VBZ happy/JJ to/TO hear/VB what/WP our/PRP$ demands/NNS are/VBP and/CC is/VBZ quite/RB prepared/VBN to/TO be/VB flexible/JJ if/IN he/PRP considers/VBZ it/PRP necessary/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, such/PDT a/DT far-reaching/NN scorched/VBD earth/NN policy/NN is/VBZ really/RB unnecessary/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN officials/NNS ./.

Actually/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB entirely/RB share/VB Mr/NNP Haarder/NNP '/POS s/JJ view/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP agree/VB that/IN the/DT section/NN on/IN officials/NNS has/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, been/VBN completed/VBN totally/RB inadequately/RB ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN a/DT public/JJ service/NN in/IN general/NN is/VBZ not/RB at/IN all/DT emphasised/VBN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN proposals/NNS are/VBP nevertheless/RB being/VBG mooted/VBN ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO ask/VB ourselves/PRP whether/IN these/DT are/VBP terribly/RB appropriate/JJ and/CC whether/IN they/PRP would/MD lead/VB to/TO improvement/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP currently/RB looking/VBG into/IN TAOs/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ point/NN but/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO abolish/VB temporary/JJ staff/NN at/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

These/DT two/CD considerations/NNS are/VBP diametrically/RB opposed/VBN to/TO each/DT other/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP really/RB fail/VBP to/TO grasp/VB how/WRB such/PDT a/DT proposal/NN can/MD end/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT table/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ever/RB since/IN Plato/NNP '/POS s/VBZ `/`` Republic/NNP '/'' ,/, the/DT Western/JJ world/NN has/VBZ regularly/RB been/VBN tempted/VBN to/TO replace/VB government/NN by/IN the/DT people/NNS with/IN government/NN by/IN experts/NNS ./.

Our/NNP Parliament/NNP first/RB asked/VBD experts/NNS to/TO help/VB it/PRP evaluate/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP and/CC they/PRP took/VBD advantage/NN of/IN this/DT invitation/NN to/TO determine/VB ,/, themselves/PRP ,/, what/WP its/PRP$ future/NN should/MD be/VB ./.

In/IN this/DT second/JJ report/NN ,/, the/DT experts/NNS have/VBP gone/VBN a/DT step/NN further/RBR and/CC criticised/VBN some/DT of/IN the/DT political/JJ groups/NNS in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT may/MD have/VB hesitated/VBN to/TO remove/VB the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP from/IN office/NN ,/, since/IN they/PRP shared/VBD the/DT political/JJ affiliations/NNS of/IN some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ members/NNS ./.

The/DT experts/NNS think/VBP that/IN this/DT problem/NN will/MD be/VB resolved/VBN by/IN banning/VBG the/DT Commissioners/NNPS from/IN belonging/VBG to/TO political/JJ groups/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT experts/NNS ,/, Parliament/NNP should/MD no/RB longer/RB have/VB the/DT power/NN to/TO supervise/VB the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

This/DT task/NN should/MD be/VB taken/VBN over/RP by/IN a/DT committee/NN which/WDT will/MD guarantee/VB high/JJ standards/NNS in/IN public/JJ life/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT should/MD be/VB a/DT standing/NN committee/NN ,/, not/RB elected/VBN ,/, presumably/RB made/VBN up/RP of/IN another/DT group/NN of/IN experts/NNS ./.

This/DT lesson/NN in/IN wisdom/NN is/VBZ 100/CD %/NN ideology/NN and/CC 0/CD %/NN knowledge/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD not/RB help/VB us/PRP to/TO reform/VB the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS whilst/NN fully/RB respecting/VBG democratic/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

The/DT van/NNP Hulten/NNP report/NN started/VBD out/RP as/IN a/DT brilliant/JJ one/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO pay/VB deep/JJ and/CC sincere/JJ tribute/NN here/RB to/TO what/WP Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP achieved/VBD ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD then/RB changed/VBN ,/, and/CC changed/VBN for/IN the/DT worse/JJR ,/, which/WDT turned/VBD it/PRP into/IN a/DT document/NN which/WDT in/IN fact/NN ,/, proposes/VBZ something/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ,/, your/PRP$ work/NN is/VBZ worthy/JJ of/IN being/VBG qualified/VBN as/IN enterprising/JJ ,/, arduous/JJ and/CC complex/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT is/VBZ important/JJ in/IN a/DT first/JJ report/NN ./.

Please/NNP therefore/RB accept/VBP what/WP I/PRP am/VBP about/IN to/TO say/VB as/IN being/VBG criticism/NN made/VBN in/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN honest/JJ debate/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN in/IN this/DT way/NN our/PRP$ debate/NN here/RB today/NN will/MD be/VB richer/JJR ./.

This/DT report/NN seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO be/VB redundant/JJ ,/, long-winded/JJ ,/, confused/JJ and/CC lacking/VBG in/IN accuracy/NN in/IN the/DT terms/NNS used/VBN ./.

Perhaps/RB `/`` redundant/NN '/'' is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS serious/JJ epithet/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP are/VBP not/RB responsible/JJ for/IN this/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

Clearly/RB we/PRP are/VBP awaiting/VBG this/DT reform/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP awaiting/VBG the/DT proposals/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO make/VB to/TO us/PRP and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO express/VB its/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN them/PRP ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO offer/VB the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT vote/NN of/IN confidence/NN ./.

`/`` Long-winded/NNP '/'' ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO mention/VB the/DT length/NN of/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB if/IN it/PRP breaks/VBZ the/DT record/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT resolutions/NNS presented/VBN here/RB ,/, but/CC ,/, for/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN resolution/NN it/PRP certainly/RB does/VBZ ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN there/EX has/VBZ ever/RB been/VBN a/DT resolution/NN -/: and/CC in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP we/PRP certainly/RB produce/VBP complex/JJ resolutions/NNS -/: which/WDT has/VBZ had/VBN paragraphs/NNS of/IN more/JJR than/IN 16/CD lines/NNS without/IN a/DT single/JJ full/JJ stop/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB `/`` confusing/VBG '/'' ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO return/VB to/TO what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN about/IN the/DT analysis/NN of/IN questions/NNS concerning/VBG Parliament/NNP ./.

That/DT should/MD be/VB the/DT subject/NN of/IN another/DT report/NN and/CC we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO carry/VB one/CD out/RP and/CC consider/VB that/DT issue/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB in/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

And/CC finally/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, frankly/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO give/VB examples/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP many/JJ cases/NNS in/IN which/WDT legal/JJ language/NN is/VBZ used/VBN with/IN an/DT alarming/JJ lack/NN of/IN accuracy/NN ./.

Therefore/CD -/: in/IN summary/NN -/: I/PRP await/VBP ,/, and/CC many/JJ of/IN us/PRP await/VBP ,/, your/PRP$ report/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD really/RB express/VB our/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN it/PRP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT duty/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT scope/NN and/CC highly/RB detailed/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS for/IN necessary/JJ reform/NN measures/NNS show/VBP just/RB how/WRB important/JJ these/DT reforms/NNS are/VBP ./.

When/WRB one/PRP considers/VBZ the/DT events/NNS that/WDT have/VBP set/VBN these/DT endeavours/NNS in/IN motion/NN though/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB too/RB clear/JJ as/IN to/TO why/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN them/PRP ./.

Hopes/NNS and/CC expectations/NNS were/VBD raised/VBN higher/JJR still/RB by/IN the/DT strong/JJ messages/NNS sent/VBN out/RP by/IN Commissioners/NNPS Prodi/NNP and/CC Kinnock/NNP in/IN plenary/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ./.

The/DT concept/NN of/IN transparency/NN stands/VBZ out/RP in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

Securing/VBG this/DT is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ priority/NN ./.

The/DT importance/NN of/IN smooth-running/JJ ,/, comprehensible/JJ work/NN can/MD not/RB possibly/RB be/VB emphasised/VBN enough/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB just/RB about/IN bureaucratic/JJ reform/NN ,/, however/RB ;/: rather/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ about/IN showing/VBG good/JJ will/NN towards/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD win/VB back/RP their/PRP$ faith/NN in/IN EU/NNP politics/NNS ./.

The/DT citizens/NNS demand/VBP rapid/JJ and/CC open/JJ access/NN to/TO the/DT institutions/NNS and/CC call/VBP for/IN EU/NNP provisions/NNS to/TO be/VB comprehensible/JJ to/TO them/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP enables/VBZ them/PRP to/TO understand/VB what/WP is/VBZ going/VBG on/RP ./.

They/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB the/DT politics/NNS of/IN success/NN and/CC believe/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB any/DT politically/RB mature/JJ citizen/NN could/MD expect/VB to/TO be/VB served/VBN ./.

Whether/IN or/CC not/RB the/DT reforms/NNS succeed/VBP depends/VBZ ,/, to/TO a/DT very/RB large/JJ extent/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ initiative/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP annoyed/VBD me/PRP when/WRB I/PRP heard/VBD today/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ now/RB saying/VBG that/IN it/PRP only/RB wishes/VBZ to/TO discuss/VB the/DT interim/JJ report/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN an/DT informal/JJ basis/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, that/IN notwithstanding/IN all/PDT the/DT success/NN achieved/VBN on/IN a/DT personal/JJ level/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP still/RB has/VBZ quite/RB a/DT lot/RB to/TO do/VB to/TO satisfy/VB our/PRP$ justifiably/JJ high/JJ expectations/NNS ./.

So/CC if/IN she/PRP has/VBZ any/DT lectures/NN to/TO offer/VB they/PRP are/VBP best/RBS contained/VBN within/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

She/PRP knows/VBZ me/PRP well/RB enough/RB to/TO understand/VB that/IN at/IN all/DT stages/NNS in/IN the/DT five/CD years/NNS in/IN which/WDT we/PRP worked/VBD together/RB in/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, there/EX has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN a/DT single/JJ occasion/NN on/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP refused/VBN to/TO account/VB in/IN full/JJ ,/, formally/RB and/CC in/IN detail/NN for/IN everything/NN I/PRP have/VBP done/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP begin/VB by/IN paying/VBG tribute/NN to/TO the/DT painstaking/NN and/CC ,/, from/IN what/WP I/PRP hear/VBP ,/, the/DT pains-accepting/JJ work/NN of/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP in/IN preparing/VBG his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP him/PRP and/CC I/PRP wish/VBP him/PRP a/DT long/JJ and/CC distinguished/JJ career/NN as/IN a/DT representative/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN you/PRP will/MD know/VB ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP 's/POS report/NN on/IN the/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS is/VBZ necessarily/RB long/JJ and/CC ,/, since/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT comprehensive/JJ reply/NN ,/, particularly/RB on/IN the/DT issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO financial/JJ management/NN and/CC control/NN ,/, I/PRP seek/VBP your/PRP$ indulgence/NN ./.

Naturally/RB I/PRP will/MD not/RB take/VB up/RP any/DT more/JJR of/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP than/IN is/VBZ absolutely/RB necessary/JJ ./.

When/WRB this/DT House/NNP considered/VBD the/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Experts/NNS last/JJ September/NNP ,/, I/PRP pledged/VBD on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT incoming/JJ Commission/NNP that/IN the/DT report/NN would/MD be/VB treated/VBN as/IN a/DT fundamental/JJ ingredient/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS reform/NN proposals/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO completely/RB honour/VB that/DT pledge/NN will/MD be/VB evident/JJ to/TO the/DT House/NNP when/WRB consideration/NN is/VBZ given/VBN to/TO the/DT reform/NN package/NN that/WDT was/VBD adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP today/NN ,/, well/RB within/IN the/DT demanding/JJ timetable/NN that/IN we/PRP set/VBD for/IN ourselves/PRP four/CD months/NNS ago/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP Pomes/NNPS Ruiz/NNP is/VBZ encouraged/VBN by/IN that/DT ./.

The/DT great/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN 's/POS proposals/NNS are/VBP closely/RB akin/JJ to/TO those/DT put/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP and/CC that/DT paper/NN includes/VBZ -/: I/PRP say/VBP to/TO him/PRP and/CC to/TO Mr/NNP Staes/NNP -/: a/DT very/RB explicit/JJ timetable/NN of/IN actions/NNS to/TO be/VB undertaken/VBN in/IN pursuit/NN of/IN reform/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN therefore/RB that/WDT is/VBZ open-ended/JJ or/CC vague/JJ about/IN the/DT report/NN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT honour/NN to/TO compile/VB ./.

The/DT considered/JJ view/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP in/IN the/DT consultation/NN period/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ four/CD to/TO five/CD weeks/NNS will/MD for/IN obvious/JJ reasons/NNS be/VB of/IN great/JJ significance/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD say/VB to/TO Mr/NNP Elles/NNPS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP most/RBS definitely/RB in/IN listening/VBG mode/NN ./.

But/CC he/PRP will/MD appreciate/VB -/: with/IN his/PRP$ customary/JJ generosity/NN I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ -/: that/IN for/IN us/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO listen/VB to/TO the/DT response/NN to/TO what/WP we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ first/RB necessary/JJ to/TO transmit/VB what/WP we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG ./.

Hence/RB the/DT transmission/NN ./.

Turning/VBG to/TO the/DT main/JJ themes/NNS of/IN the/DT resolution/NN I/PRP offer/VBP the/DT following/JJ observations/NNS ./.

The/DT need/NN for/IN transparency/NN is/VBZ rightly/RB stressed/VBN ,/, not/RB least/JJS because/IN greater/JJR transparency/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP operates/VBZ will/MD improve/VB the/DT efficiency/NN and/CC will/MD also/RB demystify/VB what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN an/DT executive/JJ administration/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB accountable/JJ ,/, not/RB just/RB to/TO this/DT House/NNP ,/, but/CC more/JJR generally/RB to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, sensible/JJ safeguards/NNS are/VBP required/VBN to/TO protect/VB specially/RB sensitive/JJ information/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT cases/NNS where/WRB these/DT are/VBP needed/VBN should/MD be/VB kept/VBN to/TO the/DT minimum/JJ possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP repeatedly/RB emphasised/VBN that/DT ,/, indeed/RB not/RB just/RB as/IN a/DT Commissioner/NNP ,/, but/CC in/IN 25/CD or/CC 30/CD years/NNS of/IN campaigning/NN ./.

That/DT most/RBS certainly/RB is/VBZ the/DT intention/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Financial/NNP management/NN and/CC control/NN is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT crucial/JJ area/NN of/IN reform/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT House/NNP knows/VBZ and/CC has/VBZ repeatedly/RB said/VBN ,/, the/DT scale/NN and/CC scope/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP 's/POS financial/JJ interventions/NNS have/VBP grown/VBN immensely/RB in/IN the/DT past/JJ decade/NN without/IN a/DT proportionate/JJ increase/NN in/IN staffing/NN or/CC an/DT adjustment/NN in/IN procedures/NNS ./.

Several/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP made/VBN that/DT point/NN again/RB in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN today/NN 's/POS debate/NN ./.

We/PRP share/VBP the/DT view/NN ,/, forcefully/RB expressed/VBD by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS ,/, and/CC repeated/VBD in/IN this/DT draft/NN resolution/NN that/IN the/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN for/IN a/DT thorough/JJ overhaul/NN of/IN our/PRP$ rules/NNS and/CC procedures/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT manufacturers/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB financially/RB accountable/JJ until/IN 2006/CD ,/, when/WRB a/DT good/JJ number/NN of/IN the/DT existing/VBG vehicles/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB on/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB bad/JJ directive/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, as/RB my/PRP$ colleague/NN Mr/NNP Bowis/NNPS has/VBZ pointed/VBN out/RP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ retrospective/JJ and/CC that/DT is/VBZ wrong/JJ in/IN principle/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, it/PRP dumps/VBZ huge/JJ costs/NNS on/IN the/DT European/JJ motor/NN industry/NN which/WDT would/MD damage/VB competitiveness/NN and/CC damage/NN employment/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP we/PRP constantly/RB talk/VBP about/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO promote/VB employment/NN and/CC jobs/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC yet/RB we/PRP constantly/RB pass/VBP measures/NNS which/WDT will/MD have/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN reducing/VBG employment/NN ./.

I/PRP suggest/VBP to/TO you/PRP that/IN the/DT directive/NN is/VBZ bad/JJ in/IN another/DT respect/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN examined/VBN well/RB enough/RB in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ like/IN so/RB much/RB European/JJ legislation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ far/RB too/RB prescriptive/JJ ./.

It/PRP sets/VBZ in/IN stone/NN one/CD particular/JJ model/NN of/IN recycling/VBG ./.

The/DT production/NN line/NN was/VBD invented/VBN about/RB a/DT hundred/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, by/IN Henry/NNP Ford/NNP and/CC what/WP we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG to/TO do/VB here/RB is/VBZ to/TO create/VB a/DT sort/NN of/IN nineteenth/JJ century/NN production/NN line/NN in/IN reverse/NN -/: to/TO dismantle/VB vehicles/NNS ,/, to/TO take/VB the/DT pieces/NNS apart/RB and/CC seek/VB to/TO recycle/VB them/PRP ./.

One/CD thing/NN we/PRP should/MD stop/VB and/CC think/VB about/RB is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT very/RB uncertain/JJ market/NN for/IN recycled/JJ plastic/JJ bumpers/NNS of/IN cars/NNS ./.

The/DT plastics/NNS industry/NN for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN does/VBZ not/RB want/VB to/TO take/VB these/DT things/NNS back/RB and/CC can/MD not/RB economically/RB do/VB so/RB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ already/RB a/DT very/RB successful/JJ industry/NN out/IN there/RB which/WDT is/VBZ shredding/VBG cars/NNS ,/, recovering/VBG metals/NNS and/CC recovering/VBG energy/NN by/IN the/DT incineration/NN of/IN the/DT non-metallic/JJ parts/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB environmentally/RB reasonable/JJ approach/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB as/RB good/JJ environmentally/RB to/TO burn/VB old/JJ plastic/NN as/IN to/TO burn/VB new/JJ oil/NN for/IN energy/NN recovery/NN ./.

This/DT method/NN of/IN disposal/NN of/IN cars/NNS carries/VBZ no/DT cost/NN and/CC so/RB would/MD eliminate/VB the/DT whole/JJ issue/NN of/IN who/WP pays/VBZ because/IN the/DT ``/`` dead/JJ ''/'' car/NN would/MD actually/RB have/VB a/DT small/JJ value/NN going/VBG into/IN the/DT recycling/VBG and/CC reclamation/NN process/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD oppose/VB this/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB prescriptive/JJ ,/, it/PRP ignores/VBZ what/WP is/VBZ actually/RB going/VBG on/IN in/IN the/DT car/NN recycling/VBG market/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN and/CC it/PRP sets/VBZ in/IN stone/NN methods/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB necessarily/RB the/DT best/JJS environmentally/RB ,/, and/CC are/VBP certainly/RB very/RB damaging/JJ economically/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ sound/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ up/RB to/TO Parliament/NNP to/TO improve/VB the/DT common/JJ position/NN on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

The/DT Social-Democratic/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ submitted/VBN a/DT few/JJ important/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN improvement/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN days/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD especially/RB draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO Amendment/NNP No/DT 45/CD ,/, in/IN which/WDT a/DT choice/NN is/VBZ made/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN laying/VBG the/DT cost/NN of/IN disassembly/NN and/CC recycling/VBG at/IN the/DT door/NN of/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN ,/, for/IN new/JJ cars/NNS at/IN any/DT rate/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, consideration/NN will/MD also/RB be/VB given/VBN to/TO recycling/VBG during/IN the/DT conception/NN phase/NN and/CC production/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT cars/NNS currently/RB on/IN the/DT road/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB reasonable/JJ to/TO share/VB the/DT cost/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN by/IN setting/VBG up/RP a/DT fund/NN such/JJ as/IN that/DT in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN stipulates/VBZ that/IN manufacturers/NNS should/MD not/RB only/RB bear/VB the/DT cost/NN ,/, they/PRP should/MD also/RB take/VB back/RP end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ problem/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP that/IN car/NN manufacturers/NNS should/MD most/RBS definitely/RB not/RB be/VB given/VBN the/DT task/NN of/IN organising/VBG the/DT dismantling/VBG and/CC recycling/VBG of/IN vehicles/NNS ,/, as/IN they/PRP would/MD gain/VB an/DT excessive/JJ hold/NN over/IN the/DT second-hand/JJ components/NNS market/NN ./.

They/PRP would/MD then/RB determine/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ prices/NNS ./.

Anyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN an/DT old/JJ car/NN knows/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN the/DT consumer/NN and/CC the/DT amateur/JJ mechanic/NN ./.

The/DT European/JJ consumer/NN organisation/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ asked/VBN us/PRP to/TO support/VB the/DT common/JJ position/NN on/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN letting/VBG the/DT consumer/NN down/RP ./.

A/DT second/JJ argument/NN for/IN keeping/VBG the/DT dismantling/NN of/IN cars/NNS out/RP of/IN the/DT manufacturers/NNS '/POS clutches/NNS is/VBZ the/DT cost/NN of/IN transport/NN ./.

If/IN car/NN manufacturers/NNS all/RB set/VB up/RP their/PRP$ own/JJ dismantling/JJ companies/NNS ,/, this/DT will/MD necessitate/VB transporting/VBG end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS over/IN long/JJ distances/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ environmentally/RB unfriendly/JJ but/CC also/RB expensive/JJ and/CC does/VBZ not/RB benefit/VB the/DT consumer/NN either/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB appreciate/VB your/PRP$ support/NN for/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 45/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN to/TO speak/VB again/RB so/RB that/IN I/PRP can/MD say/VB a/DT few/JJ more/JJR words/NNS at/IN the/DT close/NN of/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP travel/VBP to/TO the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, you/PRP will/MD find/VB that/IN every/DT last/JJ owner/NN can/MD get/VB rid/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ car/NN cost-free/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD also/RB find/VB that/IN these/DT cars/NNS are/VBP suitably/RB disposed/JJ of/IN ,/, that/IN new/JJ material/NN flows/NNS have/VBP been/VBN opened/VBN up/RP in/IN order/NN to/TO recycle/VB materials/NNS ,/, that/IN 85/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT weight/NN of/IN a/DT car/NN is/VBZ recycled/VBN and/CC that/IN 92/CD %/NN of/IN all/DT cars/NNS in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS are/VBP recycled/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ financed/VBN by/IN a/DT fund/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT buyer/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ car/NN contributes/VBZ ./.

Should/NNP this/DT be/VB condemned/VBN ecologically/NNS ,/, Frau/NNP Breyer/NNP ?/.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB so/RB ./.

The/DT issue/NN here/RB is/VBZ whether/IN a/DT European/JJ manufacturer/NN should/MD pay/VB EUR/$ 250/CD million/CD or/CC a/DT Korean/JJ manufacturer/NN ,/, say/NN ,/, EUR/$ 2/CD million/CD ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Applause/NN from/IN the/DT PSE/VBZ Group/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT proposal/NN we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG has/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN advantages/NNS ,/, mainly/RB in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN preventing/VBG waste/NN and/CC encouraging/VBG re-use/JJ ,/, the/DT recovery/NN and/CC recycling/VBG of/IN components/NNS and/CC the/DT recovery/NN of/IN materials/NNS ,/, etc./FW ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP tabled/VBN a/DT sound/JJ proposal/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ thread/NN of/IN the/DT discussion/NN is/VBZ about/IN whether/IN or/CC not/RB the/DT manufacturer/NN ,/, the/DT vendor/NN ,/, or/CC whoever/NN ,/, should/MD take/VB the/DT end-of-life/JJ vehicle/NN back/RP without/IN any/DT cost/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD only/RB give/VB the/DT example/NN of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN to/TO illustrate/VB how/WRB this/DT system/NN functions/VBD there/RB without/IN any/DT problems/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN an/DT agreement/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT parties/NNS involved/VBN ./.

These/DT include/VBP car/NN manufacturers/NNS ,/, second-hand/JJ car/NN dealers/NNS ,/, the/DT federation/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN ,/, the/DT metal/NN processing/NN firms/NNS ,/, shredding/VBG firms/NNS and/CC the/DT government/NN ./.

An/DT environmental/JJ policy/NN agreement/NN has/VBZ been/VBN signed/VBN on/IN a/DT voluntary/JJ basis/NN ./.

The/DT car/NN industry/NN -/: and/CC Belgium/NNP produces/VBZ a/DT great/JJ many/JJ cars/NNS -/: did/VBD not/RB have/VB any/DT problem/NN with/IN that/DT ./.

Belgians/NNS can/MD deliver/VB their/PRP$ cars/NNS back/RB to/TO the/DT vendor/NN without/IN any/DT cost/NN ./.

In/IN connection/NN with/IN this/DT ,/, we/PRP have/VBP noticed/VBN how/WRB -/: quite/RB contrary/JJ to/TO what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN here/RB to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN the/DT scheme/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN employment/NN -/: a/DT number/NN of/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN the/DT recycling/NN of/IN materials/NNS to/TO heart/NN and/CC are/VBP doing/VBG very/RB well/RB ./.

Some/DT businesses/NNS have/VBP become/VBN hi-tech/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, because/IN they/PRP managed/VBD to/TO recycle/VB certain/JJ materials/NNS ,/, even/RB materials/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB yet/RB included/VBN in/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

So/IN this/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP developing/VBG a/DT new/JJ sector/NN and/CC new/JJ employment/NN and/CC doing/VBG the/DT environment/NN a/DT huge/JJ favour/NN into/IN the/DT bargain/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN collection/NN free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ./.

It/PRP worked/VBD for/IN us/PRP ./.

Why/WRB would/MD it/PRP not/RB work/VB elsewhere/RB ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, thank/VBP you/PRP for/IN an/DT interesting/JJ debate/NN in/IN which/WDT many/JJ important/JJ arguments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN ./.

Would/MD you/PRP be/VB so/RB kind/JJ as/IN to/TO bear/VB with/IN me/PRP for/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP briefly/RB to/TO comment/VB on/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT assumptions/NNS and/CC principles/NNS behind/IN the/DT present/JJ directive/NN ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP also/RB to/TO begin/VB by/IN commenting/VBG on/RP and/CC responding/VBG to/TO a/DT couple/NN of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ arguments/NNS in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP should/MD repeat/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT basic/JJ facts/NNS which/WDT Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP and/CC others/NNS have/VBP already/RB mentioned/VBN ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG here/RB is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/WDT close/RB on/IN ten/CD million/CD cars/NNS are/VBP scrapped/VBN every/DT year/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN approximately/RB as/RB many/JJ millions/NNS of/IN tons/NNS of/IN waste/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN almost/RB ten/CD million/CD tons/NNS of/IN waste/NN are/VBP created/VBN by/IN these/DT cars/NNS ,/, and/CC approximately/RB seven/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN the/DT latter/NN are/VBP abandoned/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT open/NN ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, they/PRP constitute/VBP environmentally/RB hazardous/JJ substances/NNS of/IN the/DT worst/JJS kind/NN ./.

Approximately/RB ten/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN lead/JJ production/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB found/VBN in/IN cars/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB cadmium/NN ,/, chromium/NN ,/, mercury/NN and/CC other/JJ very/JJ dangerous/JJ substances/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN you/PRP already/RB know/VBP ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD nonetheless/RB also/RB repeat/VB it/PRP for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN those/DT who/WP are/VBP listening/VBG ./.

Cars/NNS are/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT fastest/JJS growing/VBG sources/NNS of/IN waste/NN we/PRP have/VBP in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN waste/NN from/IN cars/NNS exists/VBZ and/CC we/PRP know/VBP how/WRB we/PRP ought/MD to/TO be/VB dealing/VBG with/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT excuse/NN for/IN not/RB taking/VBG action/NN ./.

The/DT present/JJ directive/NN has/VBZ three/CD aims/NNS ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO stop/VB heavy/JJ metals/NNS from/IN being/VBG used/VBN in/IN the/DT manufacture/NN of/IN new/JJ cars/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO establish/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN is/VBZ liable/JJ ./.

We/PRP can/MD no/RB longer/RB take/VB care/NN of/IN these/DT matters/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT product/NN '/POS s/JJ life-cycle/NN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD avoid/VB creating/VBG so/RB much/JJ waste/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD see/VB to/TO it/PRP that/IN we/PRP recycle/VB as/IN much/RB as/RB possible/JJ of/IN the/DT various/JJ contents/NNS of/IN a/DT product/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO achieve/VB the/DT recycling/VBG objectives/NNS specified/VBN in/IN the/DT present/JJ directive/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT three/CD most/JJS important/JJ aims/NNS of/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT waste/NN of/IN resources/NNS for/IN us/PRP not/RB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN materials/NNS in/IN cars/NNS are/VBP recycled/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ resources/NNS we/PRP are/VBP wasting/VBG if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB to/TO grips/NNS with/IN a/DT car/NN '/POS s/JJ life-cycle/NN ./.

Two/CD important/JJ questions/NNS have/VBP arisen/VBN in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

Yes/UH ,/, there/EX are/VBP in/IN fact/NN more/JJR than/IN two/CD questions/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO mention/VB just/RB two/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT :/: who/WP should/MD pay/VB ?/.

And/CC secondly/RB :/: are/VBP we/PRP reducing/VBG the/DT European/JJ car/NN industry/NN '/POS s/JJ competitiveness/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT present/JJ proposal/NN ?/.

The/DT first/JJ question/NN ,/, then/RB ,/, is/VBZ about/IN who/WP should/MD pay/VB ./.

The/DT directive/NN states/VBZ that/IN the/DT polluter/NN should/MD pay/VB and/CC that/IN the/DT cost/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB borne/VBN mainly/RB by/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principles/NNS to/TO be/VB found/VBN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ treaty/NN concerning/VBG the/DT manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB clear/JJ that/IN the/DT cost/NN will/MD be/VB borne/VBN jointly/RB by/IN manufacturers/NNS and/CC consumers/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP calculated/VBN that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN recycling/VBG cars/NNS does/VBZ not/RB constitute/VB more/JJR than/IN one/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ car/NN ./.

Do/VBP we/PRP imagine/VB ,/, then/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT cost/NN would/MD disappear/VB if/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB to/TO adopt/VB this/DT directive/NN ?/.

No/UH ./.

Clearly/RB ,/, we/PRP shall/MD all/RB have/VB to/TO bear/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN serious/JJ damage/NN to/TO the/DT environment/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP will/MD be/VB very/RB much/RB greater/JJR ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT cost/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB borne/VBN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

The/DT cost/NN will/MD not/RB therefore/RB disappear/VB ,/, but/CC now/RB we/PRP are/VBP clarifying/VBG whose/WP$ liability/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ and/CC how/WRB the/DT cost/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB distributed/VBN ./.

Are/VBP we/PRP therefore/RB talking/VBG about/IN a/DT car/NN industry/NN in/IN crisis/NN ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP an/DT unprofitable/JJ industry/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG and/CC which/WDT we/PRP really/RB have/VBP to/TO help/VB by/IN not/RB imposing/VBG more/JJR taxes/NNS upon/IN it/PRP ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP the/DT case/NN that/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN definitely/RB can/MD not/RB afford/VB these/DT ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP the/DT case/NN that/IN the/DT motives/NNS behind/IN the/DT proposed/VBN measures/NNS are/VBP in/IN actual/JJ fact/NN concerned/VBN with/IN reducing/VBG the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ car/NN industry/NN ?/.

No/UH ,/, of/IN course/NN not/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB the/DT opposite/JJ ./.

Do/VBP you/PRP believe/VB that/IN consumer/NN demand/NN for/IN environmentally/RB friendly/JJ cars/NNS and/CC more/JJR fuel-efficient/JJ cars/NNS is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO decline/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN ?/.

What/WDT kind/NN of/IN requirements/NNS do/VBP you/PRP think/VB our/PRP$ children/NNS and/CC grandchildren/NNS and/CC future/JJ legislators/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO make/VB of/IN cars/NNS ?/.

Naturally/RB ,/, that/DT they/PRP should/MD be/VB environmentally/RB friendly/JJ ,/, that/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB recyclable/JJ ,/, that/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB fuel-efficient/JJ and/CC that/IN they/PRP should/MD not/RB pollute/VB our/PRP$ environment/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, only/RB in/IN this/DT way/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD create/VB a/DT future/NN for/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD create/VB forms/NNS of/IN motive/NN power/NN which/WDT are/VBP not/RB damaging/VBG to/TO health/NN and/CC which/WDT are/VBP of/IN such/PDT a/DT kind/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD deal/VB with/IN the/DT relevant/JJ waste/NN ,/, recycle/VB materials/NNS and/CC compete/VB by/IN means/NNS of/IN environmentally/RB friendly/JJ and/CC fuel-efficient/JJ cars/NNS ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT European/JJ car/NN industry/NN which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB made/VBN great/JJ strides/NNS more/RBR than/IN properly/RB compensates/VBZ for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT good/JJ many/JJ cars/NNS on/IN European/JJ roads/NNS for/IN which/WDT they/PRP must/MD take/VB responsibility/NN ./.

The/DT cost/NN is/VBZ not/RB insurmountable/JJ ;/: nor/CC is/VBZ the/DT task/NN an/DT impossible/JJ one/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP develop/VBP motive/NN power/NN of/IN the/DT kind/NN I/PRP have/VBP described/VBN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB certain/JJ that/IN market/NN forces/NNS and/CC commercial/JJ interests/NNS in/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN will/MD ensure/VB that/IN mechanisms/NNS develop/VBP for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN both/PDT the/DT cost/NN and/CC the/DT workload/NN ./.

These/DT will/MD consist/VB of/IN everything/NN from/IN insurance/NN to/TO sensible/JJ and/CC effective/JJ scrapping/NNS and/CC recycling/VBG systems/NNS ./.

The/DT industry/NN itself/PRP will/MD ensure/VB that/IN these/DT systems/NNS are/VBP introduced/VBN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

They/PRP will/MD not/RB represent/VB an/DT insurmountable/JJ cost/NN for/IN the/DT European/JJ car/NN industry/NN ./.

They/PRP will/MD instead/RB help/VB industry/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN the/DT vanguard/NN of/IN eventually/RB producing/VBG environmentally/RB friendly/JJ and/CC more/JJR fuel-efficient/JJ cars/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD do/VB this/DT for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

The/DT costs/NNS will/MD not/RB disappear/VB ./.

Nor/CC will/MD the/DT waste/NN disappear/VB ./.

But/CC ,/, otherwise/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD all/RB of/IN us/PRP ,/, as/IN taxpayers/NNS or/CC citizens/NNS ,/, foot/VB the/DT bill/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ more/JJR ,/, the/DT costs/NNS will/MD be/VB higher/JJR the/DT longer/JJR we/PRP wait/VBP before/IN taking/VBG action/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB by/IN way/NN of/IN introduction/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO comment/VB on/IN the/DT question/NN as/RB to/TO whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ to/TO be/VB any/DT retroactive/JJ legislation/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP assume/VBP that/IN ,/, on/IN average/NN ,/, a/DT car/NN has/VBZ a/DT life/NN of/IN eleven/JJ years/NNS ,/, do/VBP Members/NNS ,/, indeed/RB does/VBZ anyone/NN ,/, believe/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD wait/VB for/IN eleven/JJ years/NNS before/IN we/PRP get/VBP to/TO grips/NNS with/IN this/DT problem/NN ?/.

Do/VBP you/PRP think/VB that/IN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP legislate/VB about/IN chemicals/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD say/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP ignoring/VBG those/DT chemicals/NNS which/WDT are/VBP already/RB on/IN the/DT market/NN and/CC that/IN we/PRP are/VBP legislating/VBG only/RB for/IN what/WP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB produced/VBN in/IN the/DT future/NN ?/.

Clearly/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD consider/VB the/DT problem/NN which/WDT exists/VBZ here/RB and/CC now/RB and/CC the/DT challenge/NN presented/VBN by/IN the/DT existing/VBG range/NN of/IN cars/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ still/RB not/RB an/DT insurmountable/JJ problem/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD deal/VB with/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP already/RB have/VBP an/DT infrastructure/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP what/WP we/PRP require/VBP in/IN order/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN end-of-life/JJ cars/NNS ./.

I/PRP naturally/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT result/NN of/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ vote/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ one/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP have/VBP not/RB already/RB done/VBN so/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB thank/VB Mr/NNP Karl-Heinz/NNP Florenz/NNP for/IN the/DT hard/JJ work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN into/IN this/DT proposal/NN on/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN many/JJ respects/JJ pioneering/JJ work/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO re-use/VB and/CC manufacturer/NN '/POS s/VBN liability/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP will/MD have/VB very/RB positive/JJ and/CC noticeable/JJ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB continue/VB to/TO close/VB our/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO these/DT matters/NNS ./.

As/IN I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP have/VBP both/PDT the/DT knowledge/NN and/CC the/DT resources/NNS to/TO cope/VB with/IN these/DT issues/NNS ./.

After/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN 1999/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN ended/VBD up/RP in/IN an/DT awkward/JJ political/JJ situation/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP obtained/VBD a/DT well-balanced/JJ common/JJ position/NN in/IN July/NNP during/IN the/DT Finnish/JJ Presidency/NNP ./.

Now/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT present/JJ legislative/JJ process/NN is/VBZ concluded/VBN successfully/RB ./.

A/DT total/NN of/IN 48/CD amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN tabled/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD adopt/VB 10/CD amendments/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ entirety/NN ./.

Three/CD amendments/NNS can/MD be/VB partially/RB approved/VBN ,/, and/CC one/PRP can/MD be/VB approved/VBN in/IN principle/NN ./.

Certain/JJ amendments/NNS concern/NN improvements/NNS to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ proposal/NN which/WDT we/PRP adopted/VBD as/RB early/RB as/IN at/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN or/CC else/RB they/PRP reintroduce/VBP into/IN the/DT directive/NN such/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT original/JJ proposal/NN as/IN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ removed/VBN ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ to/TO Amendment/VB No/NNP 5/CD ,/, excluding/CD section/, 1/CD ;/, 8/CD and/CC 9/CD ,/, section/NN 1/CD ;/: 10/CD and/CC 12/CD ,/, section/JJ 3/CD ;/, 15/CD ,/, 16/CD ,/, 20/CD ,/, 22/CD ,/, 24/CD and/CC 25/CD ./.

These/DT amendments/NNS can/MD all/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 6/CD and/CC 21/CD are/VBP new/JJ ;/: the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD approve/VB these/DT ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD also/RB approve/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 26/CD with/IN certain/JJ editorial/NN changes/NNS ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ amendments/NNS affecting/VBG the/DT proposal/NN '/POS s/JJ basic/JJ components/NNS involve/VBP a/DT considerable/JJ watering-down/NN of/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN aimed/VBN at/IN by/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

They/PRP can/MD not/RB therefore/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

It/PRP would/MD amaze/VB and/CC depress/VB me/PRP if/IN it/PRP were/VBD not/RB to/TO do/VB so/RB today/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB concerned/VBN about/IN certain/JJ amendments/NNS from/IN Parliament/NNP which/WDT bring/VBP the/DT absolutely/RB basic/JJ pillars/NNS of/IN the/DT present/JJ proposal/NN into/IN question/NN ./.

These/DT concern/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT phasing-out/NN of/IN heavy/JJ metals/NNS ,/, manufacturer/NN '/'' s/VBZ liability/NN and/CC the/DT requirement/NN for/IN recycling/VBG ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO deal/VB with/IN these/DT amendments/NNS on/IN a/DT group-by-group/JJ basis/NN ./.

Amendments/JJ Nos/JJ 4/CD ,/, 11/CD ,/, 12/CD ,/, 13/CD ,/, 28/CD ,/, 30/CD ,/, 32/CD ,/, 37/CD ,/, 42/CD and/CC 48/CD concern/NN the/DT phasing-out/NN of/IN heavy/JJ metals/NNS ./.

Amendment/NNP No/RB 12/CD involves/VBZ a/DT delay/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS ten/CD years/NNS in/IN bringing/VBG the/DT provision/NN into/IN force/NN ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 13/CD ,/, 28/CD ,/, 32/CD ,/, 37/CD ,/, 42/CD and/CC 48/CD involve/VBP introducing/VBG unnecessary/JJ conditions/NNS and/CC exceptions/NNS ./.

This/DT would/MD mean/VB that/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN replacing/VBG dangerous/JJ substances/NNS would/MD be/VB implemented/VBN more/RBR slowly/RB ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 4/CD ,/, 11/CD and/CC 30/CD mean/VBP that/IN heavy/JJ metals/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB separated/VBN from/IN the/DT waste/NN before/IN recycling/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP considers/VBZ that/IN the/DT type/NN of/IN phasing-out/NN proposed/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ easier/JJR to/TO apply/VB from/IN a/DT technical/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 17/CD ,/, 18/CD ,/, 27/CD ,/, 34/CD ,/, 36/CD ,/, 38/CD ,/, 44/CD and/CC 45/CD relate/VBP to/TO the/DT manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN ./.

The/DT compromise/NN reached/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ fair/JJ but/CC fragile/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB consider/VB that/IN the/DT amendments/NNS would/MD improve/VB the/DT balance/NN without/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, creating/VBG tensions/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP problems/NNS regarding/VBG the/DT term/NN ``/`` author/NN ''/'' ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN defined/VBN ./.

Another/DT issue/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ somewhat/RB problematic/JJ ,/, is/VBZ that/DT of/IN intermediate/JJ storage/NN ./.

This/DT too/RB has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN solved/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ dealt/VBN with/IN by/IN means/NNS of/IN a/DT general/JJ clause/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB provide/VB any/DT definition/NN ./.

If/IN no/DT definitions/NNS are/VBP provided/VBN in/IN questions/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, it/PRP can/MD lead/VB to/TO their/PRP$ being/VBG dealt/VBN with/IN differently/RB around/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, with/IN no/DT uniformity/NN of/IN approach/NN ./.

That/DT would/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN arbitration/NN procedures/NNS is/VBZ still/RB to/TO be/VB resolved/VBN ,/, too/RB ./.

Parliament/NNP can/MD not/RB change/VB these/DT details/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD only/RB say/VB yes/UH or/CC no/UH to/TO the/DT agreement/NN as/IN it/PRP stands/VBZ ./.

Yes/UH or/CC no/RB to/TO an/DT agreement/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ deficiencies/NNS ./.

Both/CC myself/PRP ,/, as/RB rapporteur/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT committee/NN think/VBP we/PRP ought/MD to/TO say/VB yes/UH ./.

We/PRP have/VBP here/RB an/DT agreement/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN its/PRP$ defects/NNS ,/, constitutes/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ step/NN forward/RB for/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN copyright/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP of/IN course/NN discussed/VBN at/IN length/NN whether/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC whether/IN the/DT EU/NN should/MD have/VB powers/NNS in/IN regard/NN to/TO patents/NNS under/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN law/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP should/MD have/VB ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT Community/NNP legislation/NN in/IN the/DT areas/NNS of/IN patent/NN law/NN and/CC protection/NN of/IN designs/NNS ,/, and/CC there/EX needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB ./.

A/DT European/JJ patent/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT offing/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, the/DT Union/NNP and/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP combining/VBG to/TO take/VB the/DT first/JJ steps/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN law/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN us/PRP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT power/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB completely/RB satisfied/VBN ./.

In/IN that/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD act/VB as/IN a/DT model/NN for/IN the/DT applicant/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT direct/JJ financial/JJ interest/NN in/IN these/DT issues/NNS being/VBG settled/VBN before/IN enlargement/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN its/PRP$ efforts/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ officials/NNS ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN quite/RB excellent/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO thank/VB this/DT Chamber/NNP for/IN being/VBG so/RB good/JJ as/IN to/TO listen/VB to/TO these/DT words/NNS at/IN this/DT late/JJ hour/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Cederschi脙/NNP 露/NNP ld/NNP ,/, on/IN her/PRP$ very/RB serious/JJ work/NN ./.

She/PRP has/VBZ clearly/RB identified/VBN the/DT problems/NNS created/VBN by/IN the/DT approval/NN of/IN the/DT World/NNP Intellectual/NNP Property/NNP Organisation/NNP '/POS s/JJ treaties/NNS ./.

Their/PRP$ approval/NN is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB an/DT historic/JJ occasion/NN because/IN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ participating/VBG as/IN a/DT contracting/NN party/NN in/IN an/DT international/JJ treaty/NN that/WDT governs/VBZ the/DT field/NN of/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT road/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT long/JJ one/NN ,/, mainly/RB because/RB of/IN the/DT legal/JJ problem/NN that/WDT arose/VBD in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT Community/NNP could/MD be/VB considered/VBN to/TO have/VB absolute/JJ competence/NN in/IN matters/NNS of/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN ./.

The/DT problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN overcome/VBN ./.

Today/NN we/PRP are/VBP asked/VBN to/TO give/VB our/PRP$ assent/NN in/IN effect/NN to/TO two/CD treaties/NNS :/: the/DT treaty/NN on/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN and/CC the/DT treaty/NN on/IN interpretations/NNS ,/, performances/NNS and/CC phonograms/NNS ./.

In/IN that/DT context/NN a/DT noteworthy/JJ and/CC important/JJ step/NN forward/RB is/VBZ the/DT treaty/NN '/POS s/JJ treatment/NN of/IN the/DT right/NN of/IN reproduction/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, for/IN us/PRP also/RB to/TO mention/VB some/DT points/NNS which/WDT should/MD be/VB at/IN the/DT focus/NN of/IN future/JJ WIPO/NN work/NN or/CC the/DT work/NN of/IN other/JJ diplomatic/JJ conferences/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT right/NN of/IN distribution/NN as/IN referred/VBD to/TO in/IN Article/NNP 8/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ rental/JJ rights/NNS ,/, on/IN interpretation/NN of/IN Article/NNP 9/CD ,/, we/PRP can/MD conclude/VB that/IN the/DT exclusive/JJ right/NN of/IN rental/NN belongs/VBZ to/TO artists/NNS ,/, interpreters/NNS or/CC performers/NNS ,/, only/RB if/IN this/DT is/VBZ laid/VBN down/RP by/IN national/JJ legislation/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP this/DT conflicts/NNS with/IN Article/NNP 13/CD ./.

To/TO conclude/VB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN ratification/NN of/IN these/DT treaties/NNS opens/VBZ a/DT horizon/NN for/IN property/NN rights/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT 21st/JJ century/NN ,/, the/DT century/NN of/IN knowledge/NN and/CC the/DT invisible/JJ economy/NN ,/, intellectual/JJ property/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT dominant/JJ form/NN of/IN property/NN and/CC will/MD ,/, in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, be/VB more/RBR important/JJ than/IN traditional/JJ property/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP at/IN the/DT dawn/NN of/IN an/DT age/NN in/IN which/WDT new/JJ legislation/NN will/MD be/VB created/VBN ,/, where/WRB the/DT right/NN to/TO utilise/VB intellectual/JJ property/NN will/MD clash/VB head/NN on/IN with/IN the/DT public/JJ interest/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ dissemination/NN and/CC exploitation/NN by/IN the/DT public/NN at/IN large/JJ ./.

This/DT ratification/NN is/VBZ also/RB necessary/JJ in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, an/DT objective/NN is/VBZ emerging/VBG behind/IN this/DT issue/NN of/IN Community/NNP accession/CD ,/, one/CD I/PRP find/VBP as/IN yet/RB too/RB theoretical/JJ but/CC one/CD that/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, nonetheless/RB ,/, find/VBP too/RB offensive/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT affirmation/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ cultural/JJ policy/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, I/PRP expect/VBP our/PRP$ three/CD institutions/NNS ,/, Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, to/TO be/VB in/IN agreement/NN ./.

Cultural/NNP policy/NN means/VBZ ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, defending/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT arts/NNS ,/, recognising/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN authors/NNS and/CC setting/VBG high/JJ cultural/JJ standards/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB Europe/NNP faces/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN defining/VBG a/DT new/JJ policy/NN on/IN copyright/NN and/CC neighbouring/NN rights/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ an/DT urgent/JJ need/NN -/: as/IN has/VBZ just/RB been/VBN pointed/VBN out/IN several/JJ times/NNS -/: to/TO define/VB and/CC redefine/VB what/WP exactly/RB an/DT author/NN is/VBZ ./.

Our/PRP$ definitions/NNS are/VBP still/RB too/RB vague/JJ and/CC new/JJ technologies/NNS now/RB make/VBP it/PRP essential/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO clarify/VB them/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT adoption/NN of/IN the/DT WIPO/NNP agreements/NNS was/VBD a/DT very/RB positive/JJ step/NN in/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN the/DT global/JJ information/NN society/NN ./.

The/DT agreements/NNS crystallise/VBP the/DT decades-old/JJ legacy/NN of/IN copyright/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP represent/VBP a/DT precisely/RB considered/JJ and/CC balanced/JJ solution/NN for/IN the/DT regulation/NN of/IN copyright/NN and/CC neighbouring/NN rights/NNS ./.

The/DT entry/NN into/IN force/NN of/IN the/DT treaties/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ final/JJ form/NN is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO this/DT recommendation/NN ,/, dependent/JJ on/IN implementation/NN by/IN the/DT parties/NNS themselves/PRP ./.

In/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS the/DT WIPO/NNP Treaty/NNP has/VBZ already/RB entered/VBN into/IN force/NN ,/, having/VBG been/VBN enacted/VBN into/IN law/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT Digital/NNP Millennium/NNP Corporate/NNP Act/NNP and/CC there/RB they/PRP have/VBP managed/VBN to/TO retain/VB the/DT delicate/JJ balance/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP by/IN means/NNS of/IN this/DT legislation/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP too/RB must/MD proceed/VB in/IN its/PRP$ legislative/JJ work/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN what/WP is/VBZ agreed/VBN in/IN the/DT WIPO/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ worrying/VBG that/IN the/DT position/NN adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT previous/JJ Parliament/NNP does/VBZ not/RB support/VB this/DT balanced/JJ WIPO/NN system/NN ./.

The/DT opinion/NN on/IN the/DT copyright/NN directive/NN at/IN first/JJ reading/NN was/VBD very/RB distorted/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT balance/NN is/VBZ moving/VBG in/IN a/DT harmful/JJ direction/NN from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN Europeans/NNPS ./.

The/DT recommendations/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN will/MD not/RB improve/VB the/DT status/NN of/IN culture/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT contrary/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS would/MD mainly/RB improve/VB opportunities/NNS for/IN the/DT media/NNS enterprises/NNS that/WDT are/VBP well/RB established/VBN in/IN the/DT market/NN to/TO move/VB their/PRP$ old/JJ ,/, in/IN excess/NN of/IN 80/CD %/NN market/NN share/NN to/TO a/DT new/JJ environment/NN with/IN rigid/JJ ,/, excessive/JJ copyright/NN regulations/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB now/RB speaking/VBG of/IN Charlotte/NNP Cederschi脙/NNP 露/NNP ld/NN '/POS s/JJ recommendation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ paper/NN ,/, but/CC of/IN the/DT matters/NNS of/IN copyright/NN that/IN the/DT previous/JJ Parliament/NNP discussed/VBD ./.

On/IN one/CD point/NN of/IN detail/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mrs/NNP Cederschi脙/NNP 露/NNP ld/NNP for/IN having/VBG clarified/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT concept/NN of/IN so-called/JJ temporary/JJ copies/NNS in/IN her/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT consciously/RB adopted/VBN position/NN in/IN the/DT WIPO/NNP Treaty/NNP on/IN temporary/JJ copies/NNS ./.

If/IN these/DT ,/, which/WDT technically/RB speaking/VBG are/VBP copies/NNS ,/, were/VBD covered/VBN by/IN the/DT protection/NN in/IN force/NN it/PRP would/MD make/VB the/DT transfer/NN of/IN information/NN -/: as/IN the/DT recommendation/NN quite/RB rightly/RB states/VBZ -/: expensive/JJ and/CC complicated/JJ for/IN no/DT good/JJ reason/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB as/RB if/IN the/DT deliveryman/NN had/VBD to/TO pay/VB a/DT copyright/NN fee/NN whenever/WRB he/PRP carried/VBD a/DT book/NN to/TO be/VB read/VBN by/IN the/DT purchaser/NN ./.

The/DT real/JJ benefit/NN of/IN culture/NN is/VBZ that/IN art/NN and/CC knowledge/NN can/MD be/VB transferred/VBN safely/RB and/CC easily/RB from/IN the/DT artist/NN directly/RB to/TO the/DT user/NN ,/, the/DT consumer/NN ./.

The/DT new/JJ operational/JJ environment/NN is/VBZ ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT huge/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO create/VB and/CC spread/VB culture/NN in/IN a/DT different/JJ way/NN than/IN ever/RB before/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN all/DT parties/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN into/IN account/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ tried/VBN to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN this/DT in/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ recommendation/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- NL/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN congratulating/NN the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN the/DT work/NN that/IN she/PRP has/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ under/IN the/DT impression/NN that/IN she/PRP has/VBZ worked/VBN fast/RB and/CC effectively/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

It/PRP befits/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO express/VB its/PRP$ gratitude/NN towards/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO present/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ conclusion/NN to/TO you/PRP without/IN any/DT further/JJ ado/NN :/: it/PRP agrees/VBZ with/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT draft/NN recommendation/NN and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, with/IN ratification/NN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN both/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

Both/DT the/DT WIPO/NNP Copyright/NNP Treaty/NNP and/CC the/DT WIPO/NNP Performances/NNPS and/CC Phonograms/NNPS Treaty/NNP constitute/VBP progress/NN in/IN the/DT international/JJ protection/NN of/IN copyright/NN and/CC neighbouring/NN rights/NNS and/CC are/VBP ,/, as/IN such/JJ ,/, a/DT considerable/JJ improvement/NN on/IN the/DT Berne/NNP Convention/NNP and/CC the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP ./.

Both/DT Treaties/NNPS contribute/VBP towards/IN a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN protection/NN for/IN works/NNS and/CC other/JJ matters/NNS ,/, but/CC offer/VBP the/DT public/JJ access/NN to/TO the/DT contents/NNS of/IN these/DT via/IN electronic/JJ networks/NNS ./.

The/DT two/CD Treaties/NNS explicitly/RB permit/VBP the/DT Community/NNP to/TO become/VB a/DT party/NN to/TO the/DT Treaties/NNPS and/CC to/TO play/VB an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN managing/VBG them/PRP ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, approval/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS by/IN the/DT Community/NNP is/VBZ of/IN major/JJ importance/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP illustrates/VBZ that/IN the/DT Community/NNP sets/VBZ great/JJ store/NN by/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN rights/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, assent/NN leads/VBZ to/TO more/RBR widespread/JJ international/JJ recognition/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN copyright/NN ./.

At/IN international/JJ level/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN support/NN for/IN treaties/NNS entering/VBG into/IN force/NN more/RBR swiftly/RB ./.

These/DT have/VBP now/RB been/VBN ratified/VBN by/IN twelve/CD or/CC thirteen/VBN WIPO/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, including/VBG the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT developing/JJ countries/NNS ,/, too/RB ,/, expect/VBP the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO bring/VB about/IN ratification/NN swiftly/RB because/IN this/DT would/MD give/VB a/DT strong/JJ signal/NN worldwide/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ already/RB played/VBN a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT discussions/NNS on/IN the/DT draft/NN directive/NN on/IN copyright/NN in/IN the/DT Information/NNP Society/NNP ,/, which/WDT led/VBD to/TO the/DT approval/NN of/IN the/DT Barzanti/NNP report/NN in/IN February/NNP 1999/CD ./.

This/DT directive/NN is/VBZ the/DT necessary/JJ counterpart/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN decision/NN and/CC largely/RB embraces/VBZ the/DT key/JJ principles/NNS of/IN the/DT WIPO/NNP Treaties/NNPS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP must/MD now/RB follow/VB once/RB again/RB the/DT exceptional/JJ assent/NN procedure/NN of/IN Article/NNP 300/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 3/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ vitally/RB important/JJ to/TO give/VB the/DT correct/JJ signal/NN to/TO the/DT outside/JJ world/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN this/DT recommendation/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT nutshell/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO reiterate/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ conclusion/NN here/RB :/: it/PRP supports/VBZ the/DT draft/NN recommendation/NN and/CC hopes/VBZ that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB of/IN key/JJ importance/NN to/TO anyone/NN with/IN an/DT interest/NN in/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/DT ,/, as/IN I/PRP was/VBD walking/VBG in/IN this/DT morning/NN ,/, I/PRP noticed/VBD two/CD people/NNS smoking/VBG outside/IN the/DT Hemicycle/NNP ./.

The/DT smell/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB disgusting/JJ !/. ./.

Can/MD you/PRP please/VB do/VB something/NN about/IN it/PRP ?/.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB do/VB anything/NN about/IN it/PRP myself/PRP ,/, but/CC you/PRP are/VBP quite/RB right/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT quick/JJ way/NN of/IN educating/VBG people/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT who/WP do/VBP not/RB obey/VB the/DT rules/NNS decided/VBN upon/RP in/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

Regarding/VBG the/DT problems/NNS caused/VBN by/IN air/NN travel/NN delays/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB everybody/NN who/WP has/VBZ had/VBN difficulty/NN reaching/VBG Strasbourg/NNP for/IN the/DT present/JJ part-session/NN should/MD form/VB a/DT small/JJ group/NN -/: although/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB small/JJ -/: to/TO discuss/VB the/DT precise/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT problems/NNS encountered/VBN ./.

Coherence/NNP of/IN EU/NNP policies/NNS with/IN development/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT statement/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN the/DT coherence/NN of/IN EU/JJ policies/NNS with/IN development/NN ./.

The/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT statement/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP the/DT honour/NN of/IN presenting/VBG to/TO you/PRP today/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT coherence/NN of/IN different/JJ Union/NNP policies/NNS with/IN development/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT endangers/VBZ the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ system/NN and/CC jeopardises/NNS peace/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB therefore/RB duty-bound/JJ to/TO seek/VB to/TO match/VB our/PRP$ policies/NNS better/RBR to/TO this/DT objective/NN of/IN achieving/VBG greater/JJR stability/NN and/CC greater/JJR balance/NN in/IN the/DT various/JJ parts/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ planet/NN ./.

The/DT consequence/NN of/IN all/PDT this/DT is/VBZ a/DT reassessment/NN of/IN development/NN policies/NNS in/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT globalisation/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

A/DT serious/JJ imbalance/NN in/IN the/DT functioning/NN of/IN these/DT markets/NNS has/VBZ emerged/VBN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ of/IN course/NN made/VBN it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO make/VB important/JJ adjustments/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN turn/NN inevitably/RB mean/VBP new/JJ options/NNS as/IN regards/JJ development/NN policies/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD therefore/RB find/VB ourselves/PRP on/IN the/DT threshold/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ model/NN for/IN development/NN policies/NNS which/WDT -/: and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB this/DT -/: will/MD require/VB action/NN on/IN our/PRP$ part/NN in/IN four/CD essential/JJ areas/NNS :/: ./.

The/DT second/JJ aspect/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ model/NN for/IN development/NN policies/NNS relates/VBZ to/TO the/DT need/NN for/IN a/DT more/RBR integrated/JJ approach/NN to/TO development/NN ./.

A/DT third/JJ aspect/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ model/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB is/VBZ a/DT policy/NN aimed/VBN at/IN achieving/VBG our/PRP$ objectives/NNS ./.

Since/IN 1995/CD ,/, following/VBG a/DT concerted/JJ international/JJ effort/NN between/IN the/DT main/JJ donor/NN states/NNS ,/, involving/VBG in/IN particular/JJ a/DT reflection/NN paper/NN produced/VBN by/IN the/DT OECD/NNP '/POS s/NNP Development/NNP Assistance/NNP Committee/NNP ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN possible/JJ to/TO establish/VB some/DT important/JJ objectives/NNS by/IN way/NN of/IN guidelines/NNS for/IN development/NN policies/NNS ,/, both/DT at/IN national/JJ and/CC international/JJ level/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP will/MD know/VB ,/, the/DT aim/NN of/IN these/DT objectives/NNS is/VBZ to/TO cut/VB poverty/NN by/IN 50/CD %/NN by/IN 2015/CD ,/, by/IN increasing/VBG compulsory/JJ schooling/NN ,/, by/IN significantly/RB reducing/VBG child/NN mortality/NN rates/NNS ,/, and/CC by/IN implementing/VBG a/DT raft/NN of/IN social/JJ welfare/NN measures/NNS with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO effectively/RB achieving/VBG this/DT objective/NN ./.

And/CC that/DT brings/VBZ me/PRP to/TO the/DT fourth/JJ aspect/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ development/NN model/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB ./.

Particularly/RB in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, development/NN policies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN regarded/VBN as/IN an/DT increasingly/RB global/JJ matter/NN ,/, and/CC yet/RB there/EX is/VBZ apparently/RB a/DT lack/NN of/IN strong/JJ international/JJ leadership/NN ./.

The/DT concerted/JJ actions/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS institutions/NNS have/VBP played/VBN an/DT important/JJ role/NN here/RB ,/, as/IN has/VBZ the/DT Bretton/NNP Woods/NNP system/NN ./.

This/DT new/JJ role/NN for/IN international/JJ organisations/NNS on/IN development/NN issues/NNS is/VBZ also/RB a/DT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO consider/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN this/DT context/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN in/IN international/JJ development/NN policies/NNS ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ basically/RB necessary/JJ to/TO take/VB three/CD kinds/NNS of/IN action/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ development/NN policy/NN more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, an/DT exercise/NN was/VBD carried/VBN out/RP in/IN 1995/CD involving/VBG an/DT overall/JJ assessment/NN of/IN development/NN policies/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT results/NNS of/IN this/DT overall/JJ assessment/NN exercise/NN were/VBD presented/VBN during/IN the/DT German/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

The/DT main/JJ conclusions/NNS emphasised/VBD the/DT need/NN for/IN a/DT more/JJR coherent/JJ EU/NN policy/NN and/CC a/DT more/RBR strategic/JJ overall/JJ EU/NN approach/NN to/TO development/NN issues/NNS ./.

A/DT second/JJ aspect/NN worth/NN highlighting/VBG underscores/VBZ the/DT need/NN for/IN EU/NNP policy/NN and/CC the/DT policies/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO complement/VB each/DT other/JJ more/JJR ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB absolutely/RB vital/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD do/VB our/PRP$ utmost/NN ,/, as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ,/, to/TO create/VB stronger/JJR mechanisms/NNS for/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT policies/NNS adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC European/NNP Union/NNP policies/NNS are/VBP coordinated/VBN and/CC complementary/JJ ./.

The/DT third/JJ aspect/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO highlight/VB is/VBZ the/DT strengthening/NN and/CC coherence/NN of/IN EU/JJ policies/NNS ,/, the/DT central/JJ theme/NN of/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT Council/NNP Resolution/NNP was/VBD approved/VBN ,/, in/IN June/NNP 1997/CD ,/, under/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD required/VBN to/TO present/VB evaluation/NN reports/NNS ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT need/NN to/TO implement/VB an/DT integrated/JJ approach/NN to/TO new/JJ EU/NNP Structural/NNP Fund/NNP plans/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS ./.

They/PRP must/MD promote/VB a/DT decentralised/JJ ,/, efficient/JJ and/CC comprehensive/JJ partnership/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT skills/NNS and/CC commitment/NN of/IN all/DT sectors/NNS in/IN regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB sensible/JJ because/IN key/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ difficulties/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ country/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB overcome/VBN unless/IN there/EX is/VBZ key/JJ integration/NN between/IN national/JJ ,/, European/JJ and/CC local/JJ funding/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- This/DT report/NN takes/VBZ us/PRP back/RP to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN why/WRB we/PRP even/RB have/VBP a/DT regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO reduce/VB disparities/NNS between/IN regions/NNS ,/, of/IN course/NN ./.

But/CC more/RBR especially/RB because/IN ,/, even/RB though/IN at/IN first/JJ sight/NN the/DT European/JJ market/NN guarantees/VBZ us/PRP improved/VBD functioning/VBG of/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, it/PRP may/MD also/RB be/VB a/DT source/NN of/IN inequality/NN ./.

Jacques/NNP Delors/NNP was/VBD accustomed/JJ to/TO saying/VBG that/IN the/DT market/NN was/VBD short-sighted/JJ and/CC hence/RB the/DT political/JJ need/VBP to/TO reduce/VB disparities/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB this/DT phenomenon/NN of/IN solidarity/NN which/WDT lies/VBZ behind/IN the/DT European/JJ social/JJ model/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP all/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN ,/, and/CC which/WDT gave/VBD rise/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP shall/MD support/VB this/DT report/NN ,/, despite/IN regretting/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, for/IN timetabling/VBG reasons/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP was/VBD only/RB consulted/VBN at/IN a/DT very/RB late/JJ date/NN on/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS intended/VBN to/TO assist/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, regions/NNS and/CC local/JJ communities/NNS in/IN the/DT programming/NN of/IN Objectives/NNP 1/CD ,/, 2/CD and/CC 3/CD ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB urge/VB this/DT House/NNP to/TO take/VB into/IN consideration/NN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, adding/VBG a/DT whole/JJ raft/NN of/IN thoughts/NNS on/IN key/JJ areas/NNS such/JJ as/IN combating/VBG social/JJ exclusion/NN ,/, support/NN for/IN the/DT social/JJ economy/NN and/CC the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT employment/NN strategy/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN marks/VBZ a/DT further/JJ step/NN towards/IN the/DT transparency/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN of/IN structural/JJ aid/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT request/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP putting/VBG forward/RB again/RB to/TO establish/VB a/DT management/NN unit/NN for/IN structural/JJ assistance/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, which/WDT would/MD coordinate/VB the/DT implementation/NN and/CC administration/NN of/IN aid/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB ,/, the/DT monitoring/NN committees/NNS must/MD be/VB opened/VBN to/TO include/VB Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, associations/NNS and/CC industrialists/NNS concerned/VBN by/IN the/DT projects/NNS and/CC also/RB civil/JJ society/NN ./.

These/DT guidelines/NNS represent/VBP a/DT step/NN towards/IN the/DT improved/VBN effectiveness/NN of/IN Community/NNP structural/JJ aid/NN ./.

Amended/VBN again/RB as/RB such/JJ by/IN the/DT Schroedter/NNP report/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP a/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

They/PRP also/RB call/VBP for/IN a/DT general/JJ debate/NN on/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT cohesion/NN policy/NN after/IN 2006/CD ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ another/DT subject/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, let/VB us/PRP support/VB this/DT first/JJ step/NN ./.

-/: This/DT report/NN calls/VBZ for/IN drastic/JJ cuts/NNS in/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN illegal/JJ state/NN aid/NN dished/VBN out/RP by/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Although/IN I/PRP wholeheartedly/RB support/VB this/DT aim/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD much/RB rather/RB see/VB such/JJ aid/NN eliminated/VBN altogether/RB ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, illegal/JJ state/NN aid/NN amounts/VBZ to/TO little/RB more/JJR than/IN state-sponsored/JJ social/JJ dumping/NNS ./.

We/PRP all/DT oppose/VBP social/JJ dumping/VBG when/WRB perpetrated/VBN by/IN fat/JJ cat/NN industry/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD also/RB oppose/VB it/PRP when/WRB perpetrated/VBN by/IN governments/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO have/VB an/DT effective/JJ single/JJ market/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ European/JJ industry/NN globally/RB competitive/JJ and/CC generates/VBZ wealth/NN and/CC employment/NN for/IN all/DT Europeans/NNPS ,/, then/RB we/PRP must/MD have/VB a/DT level/NN playing/NN field/NN ./.

Illegal/JJ state/NN aid/NN ,/, by/IN contrast/NN ,/, destroys/VBZ competitive/JJ companies/NNS and/CC creates/VBZ unemployment/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, cases/NNS when/WRB state/NN aid/NN can/MD be/VB necessary/JJ and/CC legitimate/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN helping/VBG companies/NNS restructure/VB ./.

In/IN all/DT such/JJ cases/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, strict/JJ criteria/NNS must/MD be/VB met/VBN and/CC prior/JJ approval/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP gained/VBD ./.

Whether/IN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN beef/NN to/TO France/NNP or/CC about/IN backhanders/NNS to/TO industry/NN ,/, EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD not/RB be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO flout/VB the/DT law/NN ./.

I/PRP enthusiastically/RB support/VBP the/DT report/NN 's/POS proposal/NN to/TO publish/VB a/DT ``/`` scoreboard/NN ''/'' showing/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN per/IN Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

Countries/NNPS that/WDT claim/VBP to/TO be/VB at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Europe/NNP but/CC which/WDT systematically/RB break/VBP its/PRP$ rules/NNS should/MD be/VB named/VBN and/CC shamed/VBN and/CC their/PRP$ hypocrisy/NN revealed/VBD ./.

Member/NNP States/NNPS can/MD not/RB be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO proclaim/VB European/JJ solidarity/NN in/IN public/JJ while/NN trying/VBG to/TO undermine/VB the/DT single/JJ market/NN in/IN private/JJ ./.

I/PRP take/VBP some/DT mild/JJ encouragement/NN from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN levels/NNS of/IN state/NN aid/NN to/TO industry/NN in/IN Europe/NNP appear/VBP to/TO be/VB falling/VBG ./.

Much/RB remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN ,/, however/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP call/VBP on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB far/RB tougher/JJR in/IN exposing/VBG the/DT subsidy/NN junkies/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ already/RB moved/VBN ahead/RB with/IN its/PRP$ guidelines/NNS and/CC Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT programmes/NNS for/IN 2000-2006/CD does/VBZ not/RB carry/VB much/JJ weight/NN ./.

The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ though/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ guidelines/NNS do/VBP not/RB fully/RB meet/VB these/DT objectives/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ,/, if/IN administrative/JJ procedures/NNS are/VBP not/RB simplified/JJ ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB hard/JJ to/TO attain/VB Community/NNP objectives/NNS on/IN reform/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO greater/JJR efficiency/NN and/CC concentration/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP document/NN has/VBZ shortcomings/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ no/DT recommendation/NN to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO simplify/VB procedures/NNS and/CC national/JJ legislation/NN for/IN the/DT presentation/NN and/CC examination/NN of/IN projects/NNS by/IN the/DT national/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, and/CC for/IN their/PRP$ funding/NN ,/, execution/NN and/CC monitoring/NN ./.

SMEs/NNS ,/, micro-enterprises/NNS and/CC craft/NN businesses/NNS in/IN particular/NN are/VBP still/RB ``/`` weak/JJ operators/NNS ''/'' ,/, given/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB for/IN them/PRP that/IN the/DT regulatory/JJ and/CC administrative/JJ constraints/NNS imposed/VBN by/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, including/VBG Italy/NNP ,/, are/VBP major/JJ obstacles/NNS to/TO accessing/VBG Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

A/DT considerable/JJ stumbling/JJ block/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT regions/NNS and/CC other/JJ operators/NNS find/VBP it/PRP impossible/JJ and/CC are/VBP incapable/JJ of/IN making/VBG plans/NNS in/IN time/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT mid-term/JJ review/NN ,/, provided/VBN for/IN under/IN Article/NNP 42/CD of/IN Regulation/NNP 1260/99/CD ,/, will/MD be/VB of/IN considerable/JJ importance/NN ./.

In/IN general/NN ,/, the/DT current/JJ guidelines/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB considered/VBN as/RB clear/JJ or/CC transparent/JJ ./.

That/DT said/VBD ,/, the/DT differing/VBG approach/NN adopted/VBD in/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP not/RB geared/VBN to/TO geographical/JJ objectives/NNS ,/, but/CC rather/RB to/TO policy/NN areas/NNS ,/, can/MD be/VB considered/VBN as/RB positive/JJ ./.

While/IN in/IN theory/NN this/DT may/MD meet/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN concentration/NN and/CC therefore/RB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN interventions/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB help/VB wondering/VBG whether/IN the/DT current/JJ situation/NN of/IN the/DT Objective/JJ 1/CD zones/NNS allows/VBZ ,/, in/IN practice/NN ,/, a/DT policy/NN of/IN integrated/VBN interventions/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT an/DT operational/JJ instrument/NN to/TO coordinate/VB the/DT appropriations/NNS is/VBZ necessary/JJ ./.

We/PRP could/MD say/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP once/RB again/RB missed/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO really/RB strengthen/VB sustainable/JJ urban/JJ development/NN by/IN ring-fencing/JJ ever-increasing/JJ urbanisation/NN and/CC ,/, hence/RB the/DT destruction/NN of/IN the/DT countryside/NN ./.

Rural/JJ areas/NNS must/MD truly/RB be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT resource/NN which/WDT should/MD be/VB increasingly/RB invested/VBN in/RP ,/, by/IN encouraging/VBG young/JJ people/NNS to/TO remain/VB in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB their/PRP$ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ disintegration/NN ./.

A/DT genuine/JJ flaw/NN in/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS are/VBP specific/JJ guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT orchestration/NN of/IN coordination/NN between/IN the/DT ESF/NN and/CC employment/NN strategy/NN ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT coordination/NN is/VBZ being/VBG put/VBN into/IN effect/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN during/IN the/DT 2000-2006/CD programme/NN period/NN implies/VBZ that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS really/RB do/VBP need/NN ``/`` guidelines/NNS ''/'' ./.

I/PRP must/MD also/RB stress/VB that/IN once/RB again/RB the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, skirting/VBG the/DT issue/NN of/IN practical/JJ action/NN on/IN equal/JJ opportunities/NNS ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, the/DT document/NN is/VBZ not/RB particularly/RB satisfactory/JJ ,/, and/CC in/IN some/DT aspects/NNS is/VBZ disappointing/JJ ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- PT/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- We/PRP basically/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT assessment/NN and/CC the/DT thoughts/NNS put/VBD forward/RB by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN concerning/VBG the/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ situation/NN and/CC development/NN of/IN the/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP shall/MD therefore/RB confine/VB ourselves/PRP to/TO highlighting/VBG a/DT few/JJ issues/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, and/CC as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP states/VBZ ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB understood/VBN that/IN the/DT great/JJ improvement/NN seen/VBN by/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT poorest/JJS regions/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ per/IN capita/NN GDP/NN between/IN 1991/CD and/CC 1996/CD was/VBD largely/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ German/NNP L脙/NNP 鈧?NNP nder/NN in/IN calculating/VBG the/DT Community/NNP average/NN from/IN 1991/CD onwards/NNS ./.

This/DT damaging/JJ situation/NN for/IN employment/NN raises/VBZ many/JJ questions/NNS ,/, particularly/RB regarding/VBG the/DT information/NN given/VBN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Works/NNP Council/NNP ,/, in/IN existence/NN since/IN 1996/CD ./.

It/PRP suggests/VBZ that/IN the/DT Community/NNP directive/NN on/IN European/NNP Works/NNP Councils/NNP must/MD be/VB updated/VBN and/CC strengthened/VBN ./.

The/DT most/RBS remarkable/JJ thing/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT message/NN conveyed/VBD by/IN this/DT proposal/NN :/: that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ anticipating/VBG the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN enlargement/NN and/CC realising/VBG that/IN this/DT necessarily/NN ,/, and/CC virtually/RB automatically/RB ,/, requires/VBZ reform/NN of/IN the/DT centralised/JJ system/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ too/RB often/RB a/DT tendency/NN to/TO criticise/VB state/NN aid/NN harshly/RB as/IN a/DT measure/NN causing/VBG distortion/NN in/IN competition/NN ./.

Just/RB as/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP recognised/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ order/NN of/IN 3/CD May/NNP 1996/CD ,/, the/DT iron/NN and/CC steel/NN industry/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB sensitive/JJ to/TO disturbances/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ competitive/JJ operation/NN ./.

Establishing/VBG a/DT system/NN of/IN aids/NNS to/TO this/DT sector/NN intended/VBN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT survival/NN of/IN successful/JJ firms/NNS was/VBD therefore/RB justifiable/JJ ,/, even/RB though/IN Article/NNP 4/CD -LRB-/-LRB- c/SYM -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, of/IN the/DT ECSC/NNP Treaty/NNP prohibited/VBD any/DT sort/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN to/TO the/DT steel/NN industry/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD have/VB more/JJR equality/NN between/IN our/PRP$ ACP/NNP partners/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ European/JJ members/NNS and/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN the/DT ``/`` them/PRP and/VB us/PRP ''/'' syndrome/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT Joint/NNP Parliamentary/NNP Assembly/NNP of/IN elected/VBN members/NNS from/IN ACP/NNP countries/NNS and/CC not/RB ambassadors/NNS or/CC government/NN ministers/NNS sitting/VBG there/RB as/IN delegates/NNS ./.

This/DT I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN allows/VBZ for/IN regional/JJ assemblies/NNS in/IN the/DT six/CD regions/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD allow/VB us/PRP to/TO be/VB much/RB more/RBR specific/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ./.

These/DT assemblies/NNS would/MD report/VB back/RP to/TO the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

We/PRP had/VBD a/DT regional/JJ debate/NN in/IN Nassau/NNP in/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP and/CC this/DT was/VBD extremely/RB productive/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB one/CD in/IN Abuja/NNP in/IN West/NNP Africa/NNP too/RB ./.

I/PRP want/VBP the/DT Assembly/NN to/TO stop/VB being/VBG just/RB a/DT talk-shop/NN and/CC become/VB a/DT work-shop/NN for/IN the/DT betterment/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT people/NNS in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB civil/JJ society/NN given/VBN a/DT louder/VBN voice/NN ./.

But/CC to/TO do/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO see/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO corruption/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO face/VB this/DT head-on/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD reward/VB those/DT nations/NNS which/WDT are/VBP making/VBG the/DT effort/NN to/TO live/VB by/IN the/DT rules/NNS of/IN good/JJ governance/NN ./.

Equally/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD come/VB down/RB hard/JJ on/IN those/DT who/WP are/VBP corrupt/JJ or/CC whose/WP$ constitutions/NNS do/VBP not/RB allow/VB the/DT pluralist/JJ governments/NNS that/IN we/PRP demand/VBP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT result/NN in/IN Zimbabwe/NNP ./.

European/JJ taxpayers/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB accept/VB their/PRP$ taxes/NNS being/VBG fraudulently/RB used/VBN ./.

A/DT new/JJ wind/NN of/IN change/NN must/MD blow/VB through/IN Africa/NNP and/CC new/JJ standards/NNS must/MD be/VB set/VBN and/CC lived/VBD up/RP to/TO ./.

The/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP should/MD play/VB a/DT leading/VBG role/NN in/IN monitoring/VBG the/DT enactment/NN of/IN good/JJ governance/NN ,/, human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC democracy/NN in/IN cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN as/IN equal/JJ partners/NNS the/DT EU/JJ -/: and/CC ACP-elected/JJ delegates/NNS are/VBP up/RP to/TO that/DT task/NN ./.

I/PRP beg/VBZ to/TO move/VB acceptance/NN of/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VB me/PRP begin/VB by/IN congratulating/NNP Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ excellent/JJ and/CC comprehensive/JJ report/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ approach/NN to/TO development/NN policy/NN must/MD always/RB be/VB based/VBN on/IN respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT fight/NN against/IN poverty/NN ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT crass/JJ contradiction/NN between/IN fighting/VBG poverty/NN and/CC the/DT cuts/NNS in/IN development/NN aid/NN appropriations/NNS in/IN many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO financing/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD look/VB to/TO the/DT future/NN and/CC provide/VB the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP with/IN additional/JJ funds/NNS so/RB that/IN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD send/VB delegations/NNS to/TO the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS to/TO oversee/VB electoral/JJ processes/NNS ,/, at/IN their/PRP$ invitation/NN ./.

In/IN future/NN ,/, the/DT EU/NNP must/MD take/VB a/DT far/RB more/JJR multilateral/JJ approach/NN when/WRB it/PRP agrees/VBZ development/NN projects/NNS and/CC ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, must/MD coordinate/VB more/RBR closely/RB with/IN the/DT individual/JJ states/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB efficiency/NN and/CC use/VB the/DT funding/NN more/RBR effectively/RB ./.

An/DT example/NN here/RB could/MD be/VB the/DT field/NN of/IN education/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD deserve/VB and/CC need/VB special/JJ support/NN in/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS in/IN future/NN ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT very/RB rapidly/RB growing/VBG educational/JJ and/CC technological/JJ potential/NN of/IN the/DT Internet/NN offers/VBZ entirely/RB new/JJ means/NNS of/IN helping/VBG the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, which/WDT at/IN present/JJ still/RB have/VBP modest/JJ resources/NNS ,/, to/TO move/VB towards/IN a/DT global/JJ approach/NN ,/, as/RB opposed/VBN to/TO globalisation/NN ./.

I/PRP see/VBP it/PRP as/IN a/DT future/JJ task/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP to/TO contribute/VB in/IN this/DT way/NN to/TO the/DT establishment/NN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS in/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD promote/VB self-help/NN ./.

An/DT example/NN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT problem/NN in/IN Nigeria/NNP ,/, which/WDT imports/VBZ industrial/JJ finished/VBN products/NNS from/IN all/DT over/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC then/RB has/VBZ to/TO spend/VB substantial/JJ resources/NNS on/IN product/NN maintenance/NN by/IN foreign/JJ workers/NNS ./.

One/CD way/NN forward/RB to/TO promote/VB the/DT setting/NN up/RP of/IN SMEs/NNP could/MD be/VB to/TO train/VB the/DT Nigerian/NNP population/NN adequately/RB ./.

Thank/NNP you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP Zimmerling/NNP :/: If/IN I/PRP am/VBP informed/VBN correctly/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN you/PRP are/VBP addressing/VBG this/DT House/NNP ./.

Congratulations/NNS on/IN your/PRP$ maiden/JJ speech/NN :/: It/PRP went/VBD really/RB well/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB repeated/VBN often/RB enough/RB :/: since/IN 1975/CD ,/, the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP has/VBZ constituted/VBD an/DT important/JJ pillar/NN of/IN European/JJ development/NN cooperation/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT pilot/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN many/JJ respects/NNS ./.

Based/VBN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ on/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN partnership/NN and/CC equality/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN parliamentary/JJ control/NN by/IN the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT example/NN to/TO the/DT world/NN ./.

Most/RBS appropriately/RB ,/, given/VBN that/IN this/DT year/NN we/PRP are/VBP celebrating/VBG 25/CD years/NNS of/IN cooperation/NN under/IN Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP ,/, we/PRP will/MD shortly/RB be/VB signing/VBG a/DT new/JJ and/CC more/RBR advanced/JJ partnership/NN agreement/NN ,/, which/WDT also/RB upgrades/VBD the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP into/IN a/DT genuine/JJ parliamentary/JJ assembly/NN on/IN both/DT sides/NNS ./.

So/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO look/VB back/RP only/RB to/TO the/DT year/NN 1999/CD ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP ,/, has/VBZ already/RB done/VBN so/RB most/RBS expertly/JJ ./.

Much/RB of/IN what/WP concerns/VBZ us/PRP today/NN is/VBZ the/DT outcome/NN of/IN fundamental/JJ processes/NNS of/IN transformation/NN in/IN all/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN since/IN the/DT late/JJ 1980s/NNS ./.

They/PRP also/RB had/VBD strong/JJ repercussions/NNS in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

The/DT after-shocks/NNS can/MD still/RB be/VB felt/VBN ./.

ACP/NNP cooperation/NN is/VBZ a/DT dynamic/JJ process/NN ./.

The/DT content/NN of/IN the/DT agreements/NNS has/VBZ progressed/VBN steadily/RB between/IN Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP I/NNP and/CC Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP VI/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN the/DT number/NN of/IN partner/NN states/NNS has/VBZ increased/VBN considerably/RB ,/, now/RB standing/VBG at/IN 71/CD ./.

All/PDT those/DT involved/VBD were/VBD particularly/RB moved/VBN by/IN the/DT enlargement/NN to/TO Namibia/NNP and/CC South/NNP Africa/NNP ./.

Cuba/NNP has/VBZ just/RB knocked/VBN at/IN the/DT door/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, if/IN Cuba/NNP is/VBZ also/RB accepted/VBN into/IN the/DT ACP-EU/JJ community/NN ,/, that/WDT will/MD be/VB a/DT momentous/JJ step/NN and/CC will/MD bring/VB in/IN its/PRP$ wake/NN processes/NNS of/IN change/NN in/IN Cuba/NNP itself/PRP ./.

So/IN ACP/NNP cooperation/NN remains/VBZ very/RB exciting/JJ ,/, and/CC not/RB only/JJ because/RB of/IN the/DT new/JJ emphases/NNS introduced/VBN in/IN the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN ./.

Fighting/VBG poverty/NN and/CC promoting/VBG sustained/JJ economic/JJ ,/, cultural/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN are/VBP important/JJ objectives/NNS in/IN the/DT endeavour/NN to/TO build/VB up/RP democratic/JJ societies/NNS ,/, based/VBN on/IN respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS ./.

That/DT also/RB means/VBZ strengthening/VBG the/DT democratic/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

The/DT history/NN of/IN the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP provides/VBZ impressive/JJ evidence/NN of/IN a/DT positive/JJ trend/NN in/IN that/DT direction/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS tended/VBD to/TO be/VB government/NN members/NNS ,/, government/NN officials/NNS or/CC ambassadors/NNS ;/: but/CC today/NN at/IN least/JJS three/CD quarters/NNS of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP delegates/NNS are/VBP elected/VBN members/NNS of/IN parliament/NN ./.

We/PRP ought/MD to/TO throw/VB a/DT big/JJ party/NN when/WRB the/DT figure/NN reaches/VBZ 100/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ indeed/RB what/WP the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN is/VBZ aiming/VBG at/IN ./.

Unfortunately/RB there/EX is/VBZ far/RB too/RB little/JJ appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT steady/JJ advance/NN of/IN processes/NNS of/IN democratisation/NN which/WDT ,/, unlike/IN the/DT various/JJ crises/NNS that/WDT arise/VBP ,/, largely/RB pass/VBP unnoticed/NNS ./.

One/CD special/JJ aspect/NN of/IN multilateral/JJ cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS is/VBZ regional/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC integration/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD wish/NN on/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ long/JJ wish/NN list/NN that/WDT will/MD be/VB fulfilled/VBN :/: as/IN we/PRP have/VBP already/RB heard/VBN ,/, the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP will/MD soon/RB also/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO hold/VB regional/JJ assemblies/NNS ./.

Enhanced/JJ regional/JJ cooperation/NN can/MD help/VB prevent/VB the/DT outbreak/NN of/IN conflicts/NNS based/VBN on/IN ethnic/JJ ,/, economic/JJ ,/, social/JJ or/CC religious/JJ factors/NNS ,/, i.e./NNP have/VBP a/DT preventive/JJ effect/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT same/JJ reason/NN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ always/RB called/VBN for/IN civil/JJ society/NN to/TO be/VB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ processes/NNS and/CC in/IN cooperation/NN management/NN ,/, and/CC emphasised/VBD the/DT importance/NN of/IN decentralised/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

The/DT enhanced/JJ contacts/NNS between/IN the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP and/CC the/DT social/JJ partners/NNS provided/VBN for/IN in/IN the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN are/VBP another/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP am/VBP a/DT little/RB sad/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP has/VBZ still/RB not/RB been/VBN incorporated/VBN in/IN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB take/VB another/DT 25/CD years/NNS before/IN we/PRP finally/RB achieve/VB that/RB too/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

The/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT expression/NN of/IN a/DT real/JJ partnership/NN between/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS for/IN over/IN 25/CD years/NNS ./.

That/DT it/PRP has/VBZ continued/VBN at/IN all/DT in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN overwhelming/JJ pressure/NN against/IN it/PRP from/IN many/JJ quarters/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT WTO/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT triumph/NN of/IN sorts/NNS ./.

But/CC of/IN course/NN the/DT new/JJ Convention/NN must/MD be/VB measured/VBN not/RB by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP exists/VBZ but/CC by/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT it/PRP can/MD contribute/VB to/TO the/DT EU/NNP commitment/NN to/TO poverty/NN eradication/NN and/CC the/DT achievement/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ development/NN targets/NNS ./.

Measured/VBN by/IN this/DT yardstick/NN there/EX are/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN serious/JJ shortcomings/NNS in/IN the/DT new/JJ arrangements/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT agreement/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB disappointing/JJ for/IN those/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS suffering/VBG from/IN short-term/JJ fluctuations/NNS in/IN export/NN earnings/NNS ./.

During/IN a/DT marathon/NN negotiating/VBG session/NN in/IN December/NNP a/DT compromise/NN was/VBD reached/VBN which/WDT provided/VBD that/IN ,/, in/IN respect/NN of/IN least-developed/JJ ,/, landlocked/JJ and/CC island/NN states/NNS ,/, assistance/NN would/MD be/VB provided/VBN in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN a/DT minimum/JJ 2/CD %/NN loss/NN of/IN export/NN earnings/NNS rather/RB than/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN 10/CD %/NN for/IN the/DT other/JJ ACP/NNP states/NNS ./.

But/CC at/IN the/DT final/JJ negotiating/NN session/NN the/DT EU/NNP claimed/VBD that/IN it/PRP had/VBD never/RB actually/RB agreed/VBN to/TO the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN islands/JJ and/CC landlocked/JJ states/NNS among/IN those/DT which/WDT would/MD qualify/VB for/IN the/DT support/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT 2/CD %/NN threshold/NN ./.

This/DT change/NN has/VBZ been/VBN devastating/JJ for/IN the/DT Windward/NNP Islands/NNPS in/IN particular/JJ which/WDT may/MD be/VB the/DT only/JJ ACP/NNP state/NN which/WDT will/MD actually/RB lose/VB massively/RB from/IN the/DT new/JJ arrangements/NNS ./.

This/DT seems/VBZ a/DT particularly/RB perverse/JJ outcome/NN since/IN the/DT Windward/NNP Islands/NNPS are/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT smallest/JJS and/CC most/JJS vulnerable/JJ of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP now/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO pay/VB the/DT highest/JJS price/NN for/IN this/DT new/JJ Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP arrangement/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT trade/NN side/NN ,/, pressure/NN from/IN the/DT WTO/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN any/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP is/VBZ WTO-compatible/JJ has/VBZ meant/VBN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ momentum/NN behind/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT so-called/JJ regional/JJ economic/JJ partnership/NN arrangements/NNS or/CC free-trade/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

Non-least-developed/JJ countries/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO face/VB considerable/JJ pressure/NN to/TO accept/VB these/DT arrangements/NNS ./.

Yet/CC it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB clear/JJ that/IN even/RB after/IN a/DT transitional/JJ period/NN a/DT number/NN of/IN countries/NNS will/MD simply/RB be/VB unable/JJ to/TO open/VB their/PRP$ markets/NNS yet/RB to/TO the/DT chill/NN winds/NNS of/IN free/JJ trade/NN without/IN wrecking/VBG their/PRP$ own/JJ domestic/JJ economy/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB particularly/RB vigilant/JJ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN genuine/JJ options/NNS are/VBP open/JJ to/TO those/DT countries/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB yet/RB ready/JJ for/IN free-trade/JJ arrangements/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN strategies/NNS for/IN promoting/VBG regional/JJ integration/NN within/IN the/DT ACP/NNP are/VBP pursued/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ right/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, during/IN any/DT new/JJ trade/NN round/NN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS should/MD press/VB jointly/RB for/IN a/DT reform/NN of/IN GATT/NNP Article/NNP 24/CD in/IN order/NN to/TO explicitly/RB provide/VB regional/JJ non-reciprocal/JJ trade/NN agreements/NNS between/IN structurally/JJ and/CC economically/RB dissimilar/JJ groups/NNS of/IN countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP is/VBZ a/DT unique/JJ partnership/NN ;/: but/CC if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB truly/RB effective/JJ it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO extend/VB beyond/IN the/DT discussions/NNS within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP and/CC involve/VB a/DT participation/NN of/IN the/DT WTO/NNP and/CC a/DT partnership/NN in/IN all/DT other/JJ international/JJ negotiating/NN fora/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, what/WP I/PRP want/VBP to/TO do/VB in/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ condemn/VB the/DT fate/NN reserved/VBN for/IN the/DT poor/JJ countries/NNS of/IN Africa/NNP ,/, the/DT Caribbean/NNP and/CC the/DT Pacific/NNP ./.

People/NNS have/VBP the/DT gall/NN to/TO say/VB they/PRP benefit/VB from/IN the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, but/CC even/RB looking/VBG at/IN trading/NN relations/NNS alone/RB ,/, the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP has/VBZ done/VBN nothing/NN to/TO protect/VB those/DT countries/NNS ;/: their/PRP$ already/RB feeble/JJ share/NN in/IN trade/NN with/IN Europe/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN halved/VBN ./.

That/DT reflects/VBZ the/DT growth/NN of/IN inequality/NN between/IN EU/NNP and/CC ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP essentially/RB benefits/VBZ a/DT few/JJ large/JJ industrial/JJ or/CC financial/JJ conglomerates/NNS ,/, which/WDT continue/VBP to/TO pillage/VB those/DT countries/NNS and/CC perpetuate/VB their/PRP$ economic/JJ dependence/NN ,/, notably/RB on/IN the/DT former/JJ colonial/NN powers/NNS ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO so-called/JJ development/NN aid/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN underdevelopment/NN in/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN these/DT countries/NNS is/VBZ getting/VBG worse/JJR rather/RB than/IN better/JJR ,/, development/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB not/RB what/WP the/DT aid/NN is/VBZ for/IN ,/, even/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT disguised/JJ export/NN subsidy/NN for/IN European/JJ manufacturers/NNS ./.

The/DT aid/NN is/VBZ primarily/RB a/DT windfall/NN for/IN incumbent/JJ regimes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT poor/JJ majority/NN does/VBZ not/RB benefit/VB at/IN all/DT ./.

Even/RB if/IN it/PRP were/VBD properly/RB redirected/VBN this/DT aid/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB enough/JJ to/TO finance/VB the/DT most/RBS basic/JJ infrastructure/NN for/IN health/NN care/NN ,/, education/NN or/CC drinking/NN water/NN supply/NN ./.

For/IN some/DT years/NNS now/RB the/DT great/JJ powers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN reducing/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN this/DT already/RB derisory/JJ aid/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT height/NN of/IN cynicism/NN when/WRB this/DT is/VBZ done/VBN on/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS violations/NNS or/CC corruption/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, who/WP protects/VBZ these/DT deeply/RB corrupt/JJ regimes/NNS ,/, if/IN not/RB the/DT governments/NNS of/IN the/DT rich/JJ countries/NNS ?/.

They/PRP turn/VBP a/DT blind/JJ eye/NN to/TO the/DT masters/NNS of/IN corruption/NN ,/, the/DT big/JJ groups/NNS controlling/NN oil/NN ,/, water/NN supply/NN ,/, or/CC public/JJ works/NNS ./.

They/PRP could/MD clamp/VB down/RP on/IN them/PRP since/IN their/PRP$ head/NN offices/NNS are/VBP here/RB in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP protest/VB against/IN an/DT ignoble/JJ and/CC inhuman/JJ organisation/NN which/WDT literally/RB condemns/VBZ hundreds/NNS of/IN millions/NNS of/IN human/JJ beings/NNS to/TO a/DT wretched/JJ death/NN to/TO enrich/VB a/DT minority/NN ./.

A/DT mere/JJ fraction/NN of/IN the/DT fantastic/JJ wealth/NN accumulated/VBN by/IN the/DT big/JJ groups/NNS could/MD lift/VB these/DT poor/JJ countries/NNS out/RP of/IN extreme/JJ poverty/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, until/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT courage/NN to/TO take/VB on/IN those/DT big/JJ capitalist/JJ groups/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP just/RB covering/VBG up/RP the/DT real/JJ problems/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB the/DT Co-President/NN of/IN the/DT Joint/NNP ACP-EU/NNP Assembly/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD no/DT easy/JJ task/NN to/TO draw/VB up/RP a/DT report/NN on/IN a/DT complicated/JJ forum/NN like/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

In/IN this/DT speech/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD confine/VB myself/PRP to/TO addressing/VBG certain/JJ points/NNS I/PRP consider/VBP fundamental/JJ ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP should/MD call/VB for/IN the/DT Assembly/NN to/TO become/VB truly/RB parliamentary/JJ ,/, urging/VBG all/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS to/TO send/VB members/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ national/JJ parliaments/NNS as/IN their/PRP$ representatives/NNS ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO strengthen/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ democratic/JJ fabric/NN ./.

My/PRP$ next/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN is/VBZ to/TO turn/VB my/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO globalisation/NN and/CC the/DT WTO/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ seen/VBN by/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS as/IN an/DT enormous/JJ danger/NN to/TO their/PRP$ development/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD put/VB the/DT people/NNS of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS first/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN their/PRP$ rulers/NNS ,/, who/WP need/VBP to/TO be/VB fully/RB aware/JJ that/IN development/NN aid/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ intended/VBN for/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC not/RB for/IN the/DT oligarchies/NNS that/WDT handle/VBP all/PDT the/DT internal/JJ and/CC external/JJ resources/NNS in/IN some/DT countries/NNS ./.

Fourthly/NNP ,/, and/CC finally/RB ,/, the/DT prevention/NN of/IN inter-ethnic/JJ conflicts/NNS between/IN States/NNPS must/MD be/VB our/PRP$ constant/JJ concern/NN and/CC to/TO some/DT extent/NN this/DT can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN either/CC through/IN a/DT strong/JJ and/CC authoritative/JJ diplomatic/JJ offensive/NN or/CC with/IN the/DT proposals/NNS I/PRP have/VBP set/VBN out/RP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT positive/JJ evaluation/NN Mrs/NNP Junker/NNP has/VBZ just/RB made/VBN and/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO add/VB that/IN Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP has/VBZ started/VBN his/PRP$ term/NN as/IN Co-President/NNP of/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP with/IN effective/JJ and/CC impartial/JJ work/NN deserving/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ full/JJ appreciation/NN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD restrict/VB my/PRP$ speech/NN to/TO one/CD particular/JJ act/NN which/WDT took/VBD place/NN a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/RB ,/, partly/RB as/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN events/NNS alluded/VBD to/TO in/IN the/DT report/NN we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG here/RB ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP to/TO Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ expression/NN of/IN intent/NN ,/, of/IN 2/CD February/NNP ,/, to/TO become/VB a/DT full/JJ member/NN of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP group/NN of/IN countries/NNS ./.

A/DT Cuban/JJ delegation/NN attended/VBD the/DT last/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP in/IN Nassau/NNP ,/, and/CC Vice-Chancellor/NNP Dalmau/NNP spoke/VBD in/IN the/DT plenary/JJ session/NN ,/, engaging/JJ in/IN a/DT lively/JJ debate/NN ,/, and/CC afterwards/RB held/VBD conversations/NNS with/IN many/JJ of/IN us/PRP ./.

Following/VBG Nassau/NNP ,/, a/DT delegation/NN from/IN Parliament/NNP led/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP and/CC the/DT Chairman/NNP of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Development/NNP and/CC Cooperation/NNP ,/, Joaqu脙n/NNP Miranda/NNP ,/, visited/NNP Havana/NNP and/CC a/DT series/NN of/IN very/RB illuminating/JJ exchanges/NNS of/IN opinion/NN took/VBD place/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ impression/NN that/IN this/DT mission/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP was/VBD the/DT final/JJ push/NN which/WDT convinced/VBD our/PRP$ Cuban/JJ friends/NNS that/IN the/DT time/NN had/VBD come/VBN to/TO move/VB forward/RB on/IN mechanisms/NNS of/IN cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG events/NNS of/IN great/JJ political/JJ significance/NN and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP can/MD promote/VB the/DT appropriate/JJ favourable/NN view/NN and/CC a/DT generous/JJ attitude/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, so/CC that/IN Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ aspirations/NNS can/MD meet/VB with/IN a/DT positive/JJ response/NN as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, for/IN at/IN least/JJS three/CD reasons/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN Cuba/NNP ,/, to/TO bring/VB its/PRP$ people/NNS development/NN and/CC prosperity/NN and/CC finally/RB break/VB the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS blockade/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN repeatedly/RB condemned/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ application/NN has/VBZ the/DT support/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT ACP/NN countries/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP responds/VBZ positively/RB to/TO the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ associates/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB proving/VBG our/PRP$ respect/NN and/CC consideration/NN for/IN those/DT associates/NNS and/CC this/DT will/MD have/VB positive/JJ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT whole/JJ framework/NN of/IN our/PRP$ cooperation/NN with/IN them/PRP ./.

Nor/CC can/MD we/PRP ignore/VB the/DT value/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT decision/NN in/IN demonstrating/VBG the/DT consistency/NN and/CC autonomy/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB bow/VB to/TO pressure/VB from/IN any/DT quarter/NN ./.

The/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP meets/VBZ again/RB in/IN a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS time/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ this/DT subject/NN will/MD be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN there/RB ./.

Ideally/RB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ representatives/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO support/VB Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ intent/NN at/IN those/DT proceedings/NNS ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ parliamentary/JJ colleagues/NNS from/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS will/MD no/DT doubt/NN be/VB doing/VBG ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, Cuba/NNP must/MD meet/VB all/PDT the/DT standard/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, just/RB like/IN any/DT other/JJ member/NN ./.

The/DT Cubans/NNPS know/VBP that/IN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ they/PRP accept/VBP it/PRP ./.

It/PRP must/MD also/RB be/VB made/VBN clear/JJ that/IN Cuba/NNP is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB asked/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN has/VBZ been/VBN asked/VBN of/IN our/PRP$ other/JJ partners/NNS ./.

Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ wish/NN to/TO join/VB is/VBZ welcome/JJ and/CC Cuba/NNP will/MD be/VB welcome/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ circle/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO begin/VB by/IN thanking/VBG and/CC congratulating/VBG the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP ,/, for/IN an/DT excellent/JJ report/NN which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP very/RB well/RB describes/VBZ and/CC summarises/VBZ the/DT work/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN in/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN 1999/CD ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB very/RB long/JJ in/IN which/WDT to/TO speak/VB ,/, and/CC I/PRP really/RB only/RB want/VBP to/TO take/VB up/RP two/CD questions/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ about/IN the/DT fight/NN against/IN poverty/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ becoming/VBG an/DT embarrassment/NN both/DT for/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP must/MD put/VB a/DT stop/NN to/TO this/DT trend/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD begin/VB by/IN writing/VBG off/RP debts/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD follow/VB up/RP words/NNS with/IN action/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB us/PRP to/TO take/VB a/DT leading/VBG role/NN in/IN this/DT work/NN ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, in/IN many/JJ contexts/NNS ,/, we/PRP talk/VBP about/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS having/VBG to/TO learn/VB the/DT principles/NNS of/IN democracy/NN ./.

Paragraphs/NNS 2/CD and/CC 3/CD of/IN the/DT resolution/NN demand/VBP ,/, within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ agreement/NN ,/, that/IN working/VBG methods/NNS should/MD be/VB developed/VBN and/CC optimised/VBN ./.

The/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB urged/VBN to/TO allow/VB a/DT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN political/JJ opinions/NNS to/TO come/VB up/RP for/IN discussion/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ idea/NN indeed/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP fully/RB subscribe/VBP to/TO it/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD also/RB ask/VB ourselves/PRP about/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ democratic/JJ arrangements/NNS ./.

How/WRB do/VBP these/DT operate/VB within/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ delegation/NN to/TO the/DT ACP-EU/NN '/POS s/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP ?/.

In/IN order/NN to/TO change/VB this/DT undemocratic/JJ arrangement/NN ,/, we/PRP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/European/NNP Free/NNP Alliance/NNP ,/, have/VBP tabled/VBN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 6/CD in/IN which/WDT we/PRP request/VBP that/IN the/DT rapporteurs/NNS appointed/VBD to/TO produce/VB reports/NNS and/CC consultative/NN documents/NNS ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT members/NNS of/IN working/JJ parties/NNS ,/, should/MD be/VB appointed/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN clear/JJ ,/, democratic/JJ rules/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, account/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB taken/VBN of/IN the/DT smaller/JJR groups/NNS ,/, and/CC consideration/NN given/VBN to/TO introducing/VBG more/JJR representative/NN arrangements/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ,/, which/WDT appropriately/RB reflects/VBZ the/DT tenor/NN of/IN the/DT debates/NNS in/IN the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP he/PRP so/RB effectively/RB co-chaired/VBD ./.

The/DT eradication/NN of/IN poverty/NN was/VBD central/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ work/NN and/CC many/JJ speakers/NNS highlighted/VBN the/DT need/NN to/TO preserve/VB an/DT essential/JJ tool/NN for/IN achieving/VBG that/DT ambitious/JJ aim/NN ,/, to/TO whit/VB ,/, preferential/JJ agreements/NNS between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Conventions/NNP ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, an/DT issue/NN for/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP increasingly/RB responsible/JJ ,/, as/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/VBZ foremost/RB economic/JJ and/CC commercial/JJ power/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, Europe/NNP '/POS s/VBZ voice/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB simply/RB mean/VB adopting/VBG an/DT active/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT Millennium/NNP Round/NNP ./.

It/PRP means/VBZ the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC the/DT international/JJ financial/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT Europe/NNP has/VBZ an/DT enormous/JJ responsibility/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ way/NN to/TO increase/VB and/CC strengthen/VB their/PRP$ confidence/NN in/IN us/PRP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP this/DT will/MD be/VB demonstrated/VBN when/WRB we/PRP hold/VBP the/DT next/JJ European/JJ elections/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP say/VBP to/TO you/PRP on/IN behalf/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN that/IN we/PRP very/RB much/RB support/VB the/DT point/NN of/IN departure/NN ,/, the/DT core/NN of/IN the/DT analysis/NN and/CC the/DT strategy/NN that/IN you/PRP bring/VBP to/TO this/DT House/NNP today/NN :/: that/DT is/VBZ that/IN the/DT stakes/NNS now/RB are/VBP irrefutably/RB political/JJ ./.

They/PRP are/VBP political/JJ because/IN we/PRP are/VBP moving/VBG on/RP ./.

Even/RB though/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB finished/VBN constructing/VBG all/PDT the/DT economic/JJ building/NN blocks/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP moving/VBG on/RP from/IN that/DT kind/NN of/IN functionalist/JJ building/NN of/IN Europe/NNP to/TO a/DT much/RB more/RBR challenging/JJ political/JJ perspective/NN ./.

The/DT challenge/NN of/IN enlargement/NN is/VBZ political/JJ ./.

The/DT challenge/NN of/IN creating/VBG an/DT area/NN of/IN justice/NN and/CC home/NN affairs/NNS ,/, of/IN dealing/VBG with/IN asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN and/CC crime/NN ,/, is/VBZ very/RB political/JJ ./.

The/DT challenge/NN of/IN a/DT common/JJ foreign/JJ security/NN and/CC defence/NN policy/NN is/VBZ very/RB political/JJ ./.

Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ political/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR complex/JJ ./.

Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ political/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR sovereignty-sensitive/JJ ./.

Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR sovereignty-sensitive/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR voter-and/JJ citizen-sensitive/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, to/TO find/VB a/DT way/NN forward/RB towards/IN these/DT political/JJ ends/NNS and/CC objectives/NNS ,/, to/TO address/NN ,/, not/RB merely/RB the/DT scepticism/NN but/CC the/DT greatest/JJS enemy/NN ,/, the/DT apathy/NN which/WDT you/PRP identify/VBP ./.

The/DT means/NN of/IN achieving/VBG this/DT are/VBP difficult/JJ but/CC they/PRP are/VBP real/JJ ./.

I/PRP applaud/VBP your/PRP$ view/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP more/JJR synergy/NN between/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS ,/, not/RB just/RB between/IN Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB between/IN these/DT and/CC the/DT Council/NN to/TO underscore/VB the/DT extent/NN of/IN the/DT political/JJ challenge/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP more/JJR dialogue/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB with/IN each/DT other/JJ but/CC also/RB with/IN civil/JJ society/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP more/JJR explanation/NN of/IN what/WP Europe/NNP is/VBZ about/IN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO confront/VB fears/NNS and/CC anxieties/NNS ,/, because/IN in/IN many/JJ instances/NNS the/DT greatest/JJS fear/NN is/VBZ fear/NN itself/PRP ./.

Perhaps/RB with/IN more/JJR dialogue/NN and/CC explanation/NN we/PRP can/MD overcome/VB some/DT of/IN that/DT ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ especially/RB attracted/VBN to/TO the/DT creative/JJ possibilities/NNS you/PRP signal/VBP in/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT prospect/NN of/IN a/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP next/JJ spring/NN addressing/VBG the/DT issue/NN of/IN governance/NN ./.

As/IN we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT Europe/NNP of/IN networking/NN which/WDT you/PRP describe/VBP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ that/IN Europe/NNP concentrates/VBZ on/IN its/PRP$ core/NN business/NN ,/, that/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT courage/NN to/TO suggest/VB areas/NNS where/WRB Europe/NNP may/MD perhaps/RB stand/VB back/RB ./.

That/DT could/MD convince/VB people/NNS that/IN Europe/NNP ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ governance/NN ,/, is/VBZ not/RB something/NN run/VBN exclusively/RB from/IN Brussels/NNP ,/, which/WDT concentrates/VBZ and/CC soaks/VBZ up/RP more/JJR powers/NNS ,/, more/JJR decisions/NNS ,/, more/JJR authority/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT political/JJ core/NN of/IN the/DT challenge/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN it/PRP well/RB before/IN this/DT House/NNP today/NN ./.

For/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, enlargement/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ priority/NN against/IN which/WDT all/PDT the/DT other/JJ possibilities/NNS for/IN reform/NN must/MD be/VB measured/VBN ,/, be/VB they/PRP governance/NN ,/, be/VB they/PRP the/DT intergovernmental/JJ conference/NN ,/, be/VB they/PRP reform/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ./.

We/PRP see/VBP enlargement/NN as/IN a/DT process/NN of/IN partnership/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT process/NN of/IN ``/`` them/PRP and/CC us/PRP ''/'' ./.

We/PRP see/VBP enlargement/NN as/IN a/DT positive/JJ sum/NN gain/NN for/IN member/NN and/CC candidate/NN states/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO prepare/VB that/DT ground/NN carefully/RB ./.

On/IN south-eastern/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN your/PRP$ view/NN that/IN we/PRP measure/VB political/JJ institutions/NNS through/IN their/PRP$ achievements/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT lifetime/NN of/IN this/DT Commission/NNP and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP we/PRP must/MD succeed/VB in/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN winning/VBG the/DT difficult/JJ and/CC uneasy/JJ peace/NN in/IN south-eastern/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP applaud/VBP the/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreements/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB more/JJR ./.

We/PRP will/MD publish/VB this/DT material/NN and/CC bring/VB it/PRP forward/RB in/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT Swoboda/NNP report/NN later/RBR this/DT week/NN ./.

The/DT strategic/JJ paper/NN emphasises/VBZ the/DT global/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ central/JJ aim/NN must/MD be/VB to/TO give/VB the/DT Union/NNP a/DT weight/NN in/IN global/JJ affairs/NNS commensurate/JJ with/IN its/PRP$ weight/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN aid/NN ,/, trade/NN and/CC finance/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN this/DT decade/NN we/PRP must/MD foresee/VB how/WRB our/PRP$ institutions/NNS will/MD develop/VB internationally/RB by/IN its/PRP$ end/NN ,/, and/CC notably/RB where/WRB we/PRP fit/VBP into/IN international/JJ monetary/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, where/WRB we/PRP fit/VBP into/IN UN/NNP agencies/NNS and/CC so/RB on/IN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO open/VB that/DT debate/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, this/DT morning/NN ,/, the/DT day/NN after/IN St/NNP Valentine/NNP 's/POS Day/NN ,/, the/DT newspapers/NNS are/VBP saying/VBG that/IN your/PRP$ honeymoon/NN period/NN is/VBZ over/RP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB whether/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT romantic/JJ or/CC not/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ./.

Perhaps/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB unromantic/JJ thing/NN to/TO say/VB on/IN such/PDT a/DT morning/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP in/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Group/NNP welcome/VBP this/DT because/IN it/PRP means/VBZ we/PRP are/VBP now/RB settling/VBG down/RP to/TO business/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN it/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP greatly/RB admire/VBP the/DT openness/NN with/IN which/WDT you/PRP admit/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD change/VB fundamentally/RB ./.

You/PRP gave/VBD consideration/NN to/TO important/JJ questions/NNS of/IN principle/NN in/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT public/NN will/MD start/VB to/TO show/VB more/JJR interest/NN in/IN politics/NNS if/IN we/PRP can/MD tackle/VB the/DT major/JJ issues/NNS alongside/IN the/DT day-to-day/JJ ones/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB said/VBN that/IN ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, your/PRP$ programme/NN reminds/VBZ me/PRP in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS of/IN a/DT party/NN manifesto/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN good/JJ intentions/NNS in/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC it/PRP very/RB much/RB lacks/VBZ concrete/JJ proposals/NNS concerning/VBG how/WRB this/DT can/MD all/RB be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

As/IN in/IN any/DT other/JJ party/NN manifesto/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN contradictions/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO help/VB you/PRP recognise/VB them/PRP ./.

First/NNP let/VBD me/PRP speak/VBP about/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC social/JJ development/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO think/VB hard/JJ about/IN how/WRB we/PRP can/MD coordinate/VB the/DT aim/NN of/IN competitiveness/NN with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN full/JJ employment/NN ;/: that/DT is/VBZ what/WP was/VBD mentioned/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN ./.

Should/MD we/PRP at/RB long/RB last/RB be/VB drafting/VBG convergence/JJ criteria/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT -/: as/IN you/PRP in/IN fact/NN hint/VBP at/IN in/IN this/DT programme/NN -/: the/DT aim/NN would/MD be/VB that/IN unemployment/NN in/IN no/DT Member/NNP State/NNP should/MD be/VB higher/JJR than/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, the/DT three/CD most/JJS successful/JJ countries/NNS in/IN this/DT matter/NN ?/.

Ecological/NNP tax/NN reform/NN is/VBZ what/WP my/PRP$ group/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN ,/, because/IN we/PRP can/MD only/RB create/VB employment/JJ and/CC sustainable/JJ development/NN by/IN changing/VBG our/PRP$ taxation/NN structure/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, as/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT area/NN where/WRB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ totally/RB unable/JJ to/TO act/VB ./.

Do/NNP please/VBP raise/VB this/DT issue/NN at/IN the/DT intergovernmental/JJ conference/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP can/MD only/RB achieve/VB authority/NN in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP focuses/VBZ on/IN tasks/NNS that/IN individual/JJ countries/NNS can/MD not/RB attend/VB to/TO alone/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP will/MD definitely/RB defend/VB ,/, along/RB with/IN yourselves/NNS ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN supranational/JJ decision-making/NN ./.

One/CD contradiction/NN within/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN relates/VBZ to/TO globalisation/VB ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB creditable/JJ that/IN you/PRP should/MD mention/VB the/DT concept/NN of/IN `/`` global/JJ administration/NN '/'' ,/, as/IN others/NNS too/RB have/VBP said/VBN here/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, please/NNP learn/VBP from/IN the/DT events/NNS of/IN Seattle/NNP :/: we/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO combine/VB the/DT freedom/NN in/IN world/NN trade/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, with/IN all/PDT those/DT values/NNS of/IN human/JJ importance/NN that/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO defend/VB ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.

You/PRP must/MD embark/VB on/IN a/DT dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN ./.

Do/NNP please/NNP try/VBP to/TO make/VB the/DT international/JJ organisations/NNS democratic/JJ ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP could/MD be/VB critically/RB important/JJ in/IN a/DT process/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC the/DT WTO/NNP really/RB do/VBP become/VB subject/JJ to/TO democratic/JJ monitoring/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD submit/VB motions/NNS for/IN this/DT together/RB with/IN you/PRP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP a/DT very/RB positive/JJ sign/NN that/IN you/PRP speak/VBP so/RB often/RB about/IN the/DT civil/JJ society/NN ,/, although/IN ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ another/DT contradiction/NN ./.

You/PRP ought/MD to/TO also/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO draw/VB conclusions/NNS at/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO table/NN motions/NNS proposing/VBG that/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS might/MD really/RB have/VB a/DT direct/JJ impact/NN on/IN decision-making/NN ./.

What/WP you/PRP just/RB said/VBD is/VBZ absolutely/RB true/JJ :/: people/NNS want/VBP more/RBR engaged/VBN democracy/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN if/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO gain/VB the/DT approval/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO Europe/NNP and/CC their/PRP$ interest/NN in/IN Europe/NNP too/RB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN was/VBD one/CD of/IN those/DT which/WDT wanted/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT document/NN allowing/VBG an/DT exchange/NN of/IN views/NNS on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS within/IN the/DT group/NN before/IN this/DT debate/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN being/VBG reduced/VBN to/TO an/DT on-the-spot/JJ reaction/NN in/IN plenary/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ merit/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN of/IN this/DT communication/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP exists/VBZ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB certain/JJ statements/NNS and/CC intentions/NNS which/WDT it/PRP contains/VBZ and/CC which/WDT Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP has/VBZ just/RB underlined/VBD and/CC ,/, in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, usefully/RB clarified/VBN ./.

The/DT current/JJ globalisation/NN process/NN is/VBZ -/: and/CC I/PRP quote/VBP -/: `/`` exclusive/JJ rather/RB than/IN inclusive/NN and/CC has/VBZ widened/VBN the/DT inequalities/NNS '/'' ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ objective/NN must/MD therefore/RB be/VB to/TO help/VB define/VB new/JJ ground/NN rules/NNS within/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC in/IN international/JJ relations/NNS ./.

Clearly/RB ,/, many/JJ citizens/NNS are/VBP `/`` disenchanted/JJ and/CC anxious/JJ '/'' about/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN real/JJ and/CC lasting/JJ solutions/NNS to/TO basic/JJ problems/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN unemployment/NN and/CC social/JJ exclusion/NN ,/, which/WDT affect/VBP our/PRP$ very/JJ existence/NN ./.

This/DT must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ absolute/JJ priorities/NNS ./.

We/PRP do/VBP need/VB to/TO rethink/VB many/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN current/JJ Community/NNP policy/NN if/IN the/DT important/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ project/NN of/IN enlargement/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT success/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP `/`` distinctive/JJ strategic/JJ partnerships/NNS '/'' with/IN our/PRP$ neighbours/NNS to/TO the/DT south/NN and/CC east/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB stability/NN and/CC peace/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP plenty/RB of/IN areas/NNS for/IN serious/JJ discussion/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD carefully/RB study/VB the/DT planned/VBN White/NNP Papers/NNP and/CC will/MD participate/VB constructively/RB in/IN the/DT work/NN begun/VBN or/CC promised/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN this/DT spirit/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP three/CD criticisms/NNS to/TO make/VB ./.

These/DT must/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP truly/RB to/TO shape/VB the/DT new/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, as/IN proclaimed/VBD ambitiously/RB by/IN the/DT title/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP document/NN and/CC Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP '/POS s/JJ speech/NN and/CC do/VBP so/RB in/IN reality/NN not/RB rhetoric/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJS and/CC most/JJS serious/JJ criticism/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ propensity/NN for/IN rather/RB grandiloquent/JJ self-satisfaction/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC for/IN a/DT cursory/JJ and/CC even/RB condescending/JJ view/NN of/IN our/PRP$ partners/NNS ./.

The/DT perfect/JJ illustration/NN of/IN this/DT crippling/JJ flaw/NN lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT opening/VBG sentence/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP communication/NN ./.

A/DT more/RBR balanced/JJ and/CC more/JJR rigorous/JJ diagnosis/NN would/MD be/VB welcome/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ./.

Similarly/RB ,/, the/DT idea/NN that/IN the/DT euro/NN has/VBZ fostered/VBN a/DT consensus/NN on/IN wage/NN moderation/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB borne/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT repeated/VBN nervous/JJ orders/NNS issued/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Central/NNP Bank/NNP to/TO the/DT trade/NN unions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP deemed/VBN to/TO be/VB too/RB demanding/VBG ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ criticism/NN follows/VBZ on/RP from/IN the/DT first/JJ ./.

This/DT extreme/JJ difficulty/NN in/IN seeing/VBG the/DT contradictions/NNS of/IN the/DT current/JJ situation/NN and/CC ,/, where/WRB necessary/JJ ,/, confronting/VBG these/DT is/VBZ seriously/RB limiting/VBG the/DT will/NN ,/, duly/RB confirmed/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, to/TO grant/VB public/JJ demands/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ third/JJ criticism/NN stems/VBZ from/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD ./.

The/DT weakness/NN of/IN the/DT analysis/NN and/CC the/DT obstacles/NNS to/TO the/DT necessary/JJ changes/NNS have/VBP resulted/VBN in/IN a/DT project/NN whose/WP$ scope/NNS is/VBZ severely/RB limited/VBN by/IN an/DT overabundance/NN of/IN generalisations/NNS ,/, a/DT rather/RB indecisive/JJ approach/NN and/CC therefore/RB a/DT lack/NN of/IN impetus/NN ./.

But/CC all/DT is/VBZ not/RB lost/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT starting/VBG point/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP five/CD years/NNS to/TO succeed/VB ,/, provided/VBN that/IN the/DT political/JJ will/NN exists/VBZ and/CC is/VBZ expressed/VBN with/IN sufficient/JJ force/NN and/CC clarity/NN ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ fully/RB intent/JJ on/IN helping/VBG with/IN this/DT work/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, reforming/VBG and/CC democratising/VBG the/DT institutions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP are/VBP central/JJ to/TO the/DT historic/JJ and/CC moral/JJ challenge/NN of/IN the/DT enlargement/JJ process/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD the/DT opening/VBG statement/NN of/IN Commission/NNP President/NNP ,/, Prodi/NNP ,/, when/WRB he/PRP presented/VBD the/DT strategic/JJ objectives/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./.

We/PRP await/VBP the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN the/DT governance/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN balance/NN between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS governments/NNS and/CC the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP institutions/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ to/TO be/VB published/VBN this/DT summer/NN ./.

On/IN this/DT specific/JJ point/NN I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN we/PRP address/VBP the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ decision-making/JJ procedures/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ proposals/NNS to/TO the/DT forthcoming/JJ intergovernmental/JJ conference/NN ,/, has/VBZ indicated/VBN that/IN its/PRP$ preference/NN lies/VBZ in/IN seeing/VBG smaller/JJR Member/NNP States/NNPS lose/VBP their/PRP$ automatic/JJ right/NN to/TO nominate/VB a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT scenario/NN whereby/WRB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ a/DT membership/NN of/IN over/IN 25/CD Member/NNP States/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT two-tier/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP built/VBN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT would/MD fly/VB in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN the/DT spirit/NN and/CC objective/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP and/CC all/DT subsequent/JJ treaties/NNS ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB equality/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN national/JJ representation/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC within/IN all/PDT the/DT other/JJ European/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB those/DT who/WP seek/VBP to/TO eliminate/VB the/DT right/NN of/IN small/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO nominate/VB a/DT European/NNP Commissioner/NNP that/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS of/IN America/NNP gives/VBZ smaller/JJR states/NNS the/DT same/JJ recognition/NN as/IN larger/JJR states/NNS in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS Senate/NNP ./.

More/RBR or/CC less/RBR each/DT of/IN the/DT 50/CD states/NNS in/IN the/DT US/NNP has/VBZ two/CD elected/VBN positions/NNS in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS Senate/NNP ,/, regardless/RB of/IN its/PRP$ population/NN ./.

Any/DT future/JJ reforms/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP treaties/NNS will/MD require/VB a/DT referendum/NN to/TO be/VB held/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB difficult/JJ for/IN those/DT who/WP propose/VBP a/DT `/`` yes/UH '/'' vote/NN in/IN any/DT such/JJ future/JJ treaty/NN to/TO win/VB the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT Irish/JJ people/NNS if/IN we/PRP lose/VBP our/PRP$ right/NN to/TO have/VB our/PRP$ nominee/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

Undoubtedly/RB ,/, reform/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Council/NN is/VBZ also/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB included/VBN in/IN this/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN the/DT governance/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP which/WDT will/MD be/VB published/VBN this/DT summer/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB there/EX are/VBP special/JJ areas/NNS of/IN policy-making/NN which/WDT should/MD be/VB left/VBN to/TO the/DT domain/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ broad/JJ support/NN in/IN Europe/NNP for/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN qualified/JJ majority/NN voting/NN on/IN taxation/NN ,/, justice/NN and/CC home/NN affairs/NNS ,/, and/CC foreign/JJ affairs/NNS at/IN European/JJ Union/NNP level/NN ./.

At/IN present/JJ ,/, under/IN Article/NNP 99/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP ,/, decisions/NNS taken/VBN at/IN EU/JJ level/NN concerning/VBG tax/NN changes/NNS must/MD be/VB by/IN unanimity/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT proposal/NN should/MD remain/VB ,/, as/IN a/DT common/JJ European/JJ taxation/NN code/NN would/MD diminish/VB rather/RB than/IN enhance/VB the/DT workings/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP support/VBP the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP support/VBP institutional/JJ changes/NNS so/RB as/RB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN a/DT streamlined/JJ and/CC structured/JJ manner/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD remember/VB that/IN the/DT public/JJ opinion/NN of/IN 370/CD million/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ a/DT vital/JJ factor/NN in/IN changing/VBG the/DT EU/NNP treaties/NNS ./.

Changes/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB brought/VBN about/IN too/RB quickly/RB and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB too/RB sweeping/JJ ,/, otherwise/RB public/JJ opinion/NN will/MD make/VB ratification/NN of/IN any/DT future/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP treaty/NN very/RB difficult/JJ indeed/RB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Italian/JJ Radical/CD Members/NNS ./.

President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, a/DT short/JJ while/NN ago/IN you/PRP said/VBD that/IN no/DT political/JJ structure/NN sets/VBZ out/RP five-year/JJ plans/NNS ./.

There/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD point/NN that/IN you/PRP really/RB stressed/VBD -/: too/RB much/RB in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN -/: and/CC that/WDT was/VBD that/IN it/PRP looks/VBZ almost/RB as/RB if/IN the/DT highest/JJS priority/NN task/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP setting/VBG yourself/PRP is/VBZ to/TO cease/VB ``/`` unnecessary/JJ ''/'' activities/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP consider/VB the/DT scenario/NN whereby/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, not/RB believing/VBG itself/PRP to/TO be/VB equal/JJ to/TO the/DT task/NN ,/, wishes/VBZ ,/, or/CC proposes/VBZ to/TO shed/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, its/PRP$ powers/NNS to/TO implement/VB common/JJ policies/NNS ,/, which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ nevertheless/RB accorded/VBN by/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

What/WP do/VBP we/PRP expect/VB from/IN a/DT government/NN in/IN any/DT case/NN ?/.

What/WP do/VBP we/PRP ask/VB of/IN this/DT structure/NN -/: the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP -/: which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, so/RB to/TO speak/VB ,/, ambiguous/VBG and/CC unique/JJ ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ for/IN joint/JJ resources/NNS to/TO be/VB controlled/VBN supranationally/RB and/CC not/RB to/TO be/VB delegated/VBN to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS or/CC the/DT TAOs/NNPS ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT case/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN you/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG the/DT same/JJ old/JJ menu/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN more/RBR unsatisfactory/JJ implications/NNS ,/, restricting/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, so/IN you/PRP say/VBP ,/, to/TO the/DT task/NN of/IN drawing/VBG up/RP a/DT few/JJ White/NNP Papers/NNP ,/, as/IN you/PRP proposed/VBD ./.

My/PRP$ fear/NN -/: even/RB if/IN you/PRP shake/VBP your/PRP$ head/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP -/: is/VBZ that/IN this/DT will/MD translate/VB into/IN what/WP some/DT countries/NNS have/VBP thought/VBN for/IN years/NNS ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD be/VB a/DT simple/JJ secretariat/NN for/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ./.

If/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT role/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO play/VB over/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ,/, we/PRP federalists/RB are/VBP convinced/JJ ,/, we/PRP are/VBP certain/JJ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT right/JJ path/NN to/TO take/VB and/CC we/PRP shall/MD send/VB for/IN you/PRP and/CC judge/VB what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO do/VB in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

The/DT reform/NN is/VBZ important/JJ but/CC ,/, if/IN it/PRP aggravates/VBZ the/DT situation/NN ,/, reduces/VBZ or/CC weakens/VBZ the/DT supranational/JJ powers/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, then/RB the/DT structure/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN ,/, as/IN planned/VBD by/IN the/DT founding/VBG fathers/NNS for/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, will/MD be/VB at/IN risk/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP continue/VBP to/TO get/VB bogged/VBD down/IN with/IN proposals/NNS that/IN have/VBP given/VBN extremely/RB poor/JJ results/NNS so/RB far/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP we/PRP or/CC the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO do/VB ./.

The/DT same/JJ goes/VBZ for/IN enlargement/NN as/IN an/DT end/NN in/IN itself/PRP ,/, without/IN it/PRP being/VBG linked/VBN to/TO a/DT reform/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ structures/NNS much/RB more/RBR efficient/JJ ,/, and/CC to/TO proposals/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD have/VB made/VBN at/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ one/CD positive/JJ thing/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB to/TO you/PRP ,/, perhaps/RB contrary/JJ to/TO the/DT opinion/NN of/IN some/DT Members/NNS ,/, regarding/VBG the/DT telegram/NN that/IN you/PRP sent/VBD to/TO the/DT Austrian/JJ Government/NN ./.

We/PRP approve/VBP of/IN your/PRP$ position/NN on/IN this/DT :/: you/PRP did/VBD well/RB not/RB to/TO isolate/VB that/DT country/NN any/DT further/RBR ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD see/VB what/WP specific/JJ steps/NNS transpire/VBP when/WRB the/DT time/NN comes/VBZ for/IN practical/JJ action/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, I/PRP repeat/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, a/DT slightly/RB short-sighted/JJ view/NN ./.

Above/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP lacks/VBZ drive/NN in/IN the/DT sectors/NNS I/PRP have/VBP mentioned/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

Can/MD we/PRP really/RB continue/VB to/TO leave/VB the/DT Balkans/NNPS out/RP of/IN the/DT enlargement/JJ process/NN ,/, disregarding/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN Croatia/NNP ,/, Macedonia/NNP and/CC other/JJ countries/NNS also/RB have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO a/DT place/NN in/IN this/DT House/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ open/JJ to/TO all/DT ?/.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO applaud/VB your/PRP$ proposal/NN for/IN a/DT radical/JJ decentralisation/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ activities/NNS and/CC ask/VB why/WRB ,/, then/RB ,/, you/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG a/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN which/WDT would/MD lead/VB to/TO centralisation/NN ./.

I/PRP remember/VBP your/PRP$ predecessor/NN '/POS s/JJ speech/NN five/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.

Like/IN yourself/PRP ,/, he/PRP promised/VBD ``/`` less/JJR and/CC better/JJR ''/'' ,/, but/CC Mr/NNP Santer/NNP finished/VBD up/RP by/IN having/VBG delivered/VBN ``/`` much/RB more/JJR and/CC much/RB worse/JJR ''/'' ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN you/PRP ,/, either/RB ,/, can/MD deliver/VB the/DT goods/NNS you/PRP promise/VBP ./.

You/PRP talk/VBP about/IN decentralisation/NN but/CC practise/NN centralisation/NN ./.

The/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT litany/NN of/IN subjects/NNS over/IN which/WDT the/DT people/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB deprived/VBN of/IN influence/NN and/CC in/IN connection/NN with/IN which/WDT ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, you/PRP are/VBP to/TO take/VB influence/NN away/RP from/IN the/DT people/NNS ,/, even/RB on/IN social/JJ questions/NNS ./.

Your/PRP$ Commission/NN consists/VBZ of/IN the/DT only/JJ 20/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT EU/NNP who/WP can/MD propose/VB that/IN the/DT quantity/NN of/IN legislation/NN should/MD be/VB reduced/VBN ./.

The/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ought/MD at/IN least/JJS ,/, therefore/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB accompanied/VBN by/IN as/IN long/RB a/DT list/NN of/IN tasks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB referred/VBN back/RP to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC to/TO the/DT processes/NNS of/IN popular/JJ democracy/NN ./.

Otherwise/RB ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN laws/NNS produced/VBN in/IN Brussels/NNP will/MD just/RB keep/VB on/IN growing/VBG ./.

Even/RB by/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ already/RB too/RB many/JJ by/IN far/RB ./.

It/PRP was/VBD clear/JJ too/RB on/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO separate/VB internal/JJ audit/NN from/IN financial/JJ control/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN paragraph/NN 10/CD fully/RB reflects/VBZ the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS in/IN 1997/CD ./.

Naturally/RB the/DT Court/NNP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO give/VB its/PRP$ considered/JJ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT proposed/VBN changes/NNS to/TO the/DT Financial/NNP Regulation/NNP but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ useful/JJ to/TO recall/VB Mr/NNP Karlsson/NNP '/POS s/JJ comments/NNS to/TO this/DT House/NNP last/JJ month/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT Commission/NNP 's/VBZ internal/JJ control/NN ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ``/`` is/VBZ not/RB forceful/JJ enough/RB in/IN preventing/VBG incorrect/JJ operation/NN ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT Financial/NNP Controller/NNP granted/VBD a/DT positive/JJ a/DT priori/JJ visa/NN in/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT cases/NNS of/IN mismanagement/NN or/CC irregularities/NNS recently/RB uncovered/VBN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT internal/JJ audit/NN function/NN is/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP in/IN an/DT uncoordinated/JJ way/NN by/IN several/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, notably/RB the/DT same/JJ Financial/NNP Controller/NNP ,/, the/DT Inspectorate/NNP General/NNP and/CC by/IN some/DT units/NNS operating/VBG Directorates-General/NNP ./. ''/'' ./.

The/DT centralised/NN ex/FW ante/FW approval/NN system/NN was/VBD doubtlessly/RB originally/RB designed/VBN to/TO ensure/VB carefulness/NNS but/CC ,/, over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN the/DT perverse/JJ effect/NN of/IN reducing/VBG the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT managers/NNS feel/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ decisions/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ any/DT real/JJ disagreement/NN between/IN us/PRP on/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP take/VBP it/PRP from/IN paragraph/NN 10/CD that/IN the/DT underlying/VBG preoccupation/NN of/IN honourable/JJ Members/NNS is/VBZ that/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT carefully/RB managed/VBN transition/NN ./.

That/DT will/MD most/RBS certainly/RB be/VB the/DT character/NN of/IN the/DT change/NN as/IN honourable/JJ Members/NNS will/MD see/VB when/WRB they/PRP read/VBP the/DT reform/NN strategy/NN document/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ objective/NN ,/, the/DT committee/NN '/POS s/JJ objective/NN ,/, the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS '/POS objective/NN is/VBZ not/RB to/TO abolish/VB financial/JJ control/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN and/CC improve/VB upon/IN centralised/JJ financial/JJ control/NN ./.

Before/IN leaving/VBG this/DT area/NN I/PRP would/MD add/VB that/IN we/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN that/IN the/DT existing/JJ internal/JJ audit/NN function/NN must/MD be/VB maintained/VBN pending/VBG the/DT establishment/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ independent/JJ internal/JJ audit/NN service/NN in/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN months/NNS ./.

Turning/VBG quickly/RB to/TO the/DT section/NN of/IN the/DT resolution/NN on/IN fighting/VBG fraud/NN ,/, corruption/NN ,/, mismanagement/NN and/CC nepotism/NN :/: the/DT major/JJ new/JJ proposal/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN concerns/NNS reporting/VBG by/IN Commission/NNP officials/NNS of/IN perceived/VBN wrong-doing/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP made/VBD clear/JJ in/IN the/DT hearings/NNS last/JJ September/NNP and/CC on/IN other/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP at/IN one/CD in/IN the/DT belief/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ value/NN in/IN defining/VBG the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ mechanisms/NNS for/IN this/DT purpose/NN although/IN obviously/RB we/PRP all/DT hope/VBP that/IN it/PRP will/MD rarely/RB be/VB needed/VBN ./.

Since/IN June/NNP of/IN last/JJ year/NN ,/, the/DT OLAF/NNP regulation/NN has/VBZ given/VBN better/JJR guidance/NN to/TO staff/NN about/IN reporting/VBG possible/JJ irregularities/NNS ./.

We/PRP propose/VBP to/TO complement/VB those/DT provisions/NNS by/IN defining/VBG the/DT rights/NNS and/CC obligations/NNS for/IN officials/NNS to/TO report/VB suspected/VBN wrong-doing/NN through/IN internal/JJ channels/NNS but/CC not/RB exclusively/RB within/IN the/DT same/JJ hierarchical/JJ line/NN ./.

The/DT possibility/NN of/IN using/VBG specified/VBN external/JJ channels/NNS will/MD also/RB be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP seeking/VBG to/TO implement/VB best/RBS practice/NN ./.

Serious/JJ response/NN to/TO reports/NNS ,/, confidentiality/NN at/IN early/JJ stages/NNS and/CC career/NN protection/NN will/MD be/VB assured/VBN for/IN people/NNS who/WP report/VBP wrong-doing/NN in/IN good/JJ faith/NN and/CC in/IN ways/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB compromise/VB investigations/NNS by/IN untimely/JJ disclosure/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT corollary/NN ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB safeguards/NNS for/IN officials/NNS who/WP are/VBP the/DT subject/NN of/IN false/JJ allegations/NNS ./.

A/DT communication/NN later/RBR this/DT year/NN will/MD give/VB full/JJ details/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB Parliament/NNP will/MD be/VB disappointed/VBN by/IN what/WP we/PRP will/MD propose/VB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP persuaded/VBN ,/, however/RB ,/, by/IN the/DT suggestion/NN in/IN paragraph/NN 34/CD of/IN the/DT report/NN on/IN using/VBG external/JJ bodies/NNS to/TO enforce/VB existing/VBG provisions/NNS on/IN financial/JJ liability/NN ./.

We/PRP already/RB plan/VBP to/TO reform/VB the/DT existing/JJ disciplinary/JJ procedures/NNS to/TO ensure/VB thoroughness/NNS ,/, fairness/NN ,/, consistency/NN and/CC professionalism/NN ./.

And/CC we/PRP will/MD propose/VB the/DT establishment/NN of/IN an/DT interinstitutional/JJ Disciplinary/NNP Board/NNP -/: something/NN else/RB on/IN which/WDT we/PRP will/MD need/VB the/DT support/NN and/CC understanding/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

A/DT communication/NN in/IN June/NNP will/MD set/VB out/RP the/DT full/JJ proposal/NN for/IN change/NN ./.

Standards/NNP in/IN public/JJ life/NN is/VBZ the/DT next/JJ main/JJ section/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN before/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.

With/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN codes/NNS of/IN conduct/NN the/DT current/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ begun/VBN to/TO develop/VB an/DT explicit/JJ ethical/JJ framework/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD be/VB taken/VBN a/DT step/NN further/RBR with/IN a/DT proposal/NN in/IN June/NNP for/IN an/DT interinstitutional/JJ agreement/NN on/IN a/DT committee/NN on/IN standards/NNS in/IN public/JJ life/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT draft/NN resolution/NN ./.

An/DT important/JJ role/NN for/IN the/DT committee/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO give/VB advice/NN on/IN ethics/NNS and/CC standards/NNS and/CC to/TO supervise/VB common/JJ and/CC separate/JJ codes/NNS of/IN conduct/NN for/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP Parliament/NNP 's/POS support/NN for/IN that/DT ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB currently/RB examining/VBG how/WRB we/PRP can/MD most/RBS effectively/RB implement/VB the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT classification/NN system/NN for/IN documents/NNS ,/, made/VBN in/IN paragraph/NN 50/CD of/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP 's/POS report/NN ./.

The/DT draft/NN resolution/NN rightly/RB recalls/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS accountability/NN to/TO this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

President/NNP Prodi/NNP and/CC Vice-President/NNP de/IN Palacio/NNP and/CC other/JJ colleagues/NNS have/VBP demonstrated/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS practical/JJ commitment/NN to/TO that/DT ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP will/MD soon/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO agree/VB a/DT code/NN of/IN conduct/NN on/IN relations/NNS between/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS which/WDT will/MD include/VB updated/VBN rules/NNS on/IN access/NN to/TO documents/NNS ./.

The/DT point/NN was/VBD very/RB properly/RB raised/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Elles/NNPS and/CC referred/VBD to/TO by/IN Mrs/NNP Thors/NNPS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ they/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ that/IN in/IN mid-December/NN we/PRP officially/RB received/VBD the/DT draft/NN framework/NN agreement/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB waiting/VBG for/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO decide/VB when/WRB it/PRP wishes/VBZ to/TO begin/VB negotiations/NNS on/IN the/DT text/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP very/RB happy/JJ to/TO proceed/VB as/RB rapidly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

The/DT report/NN rightly/RB emphasises/VBZ the/DT central/JJ importance/NN that/IN human/JJ resources/NNS policy/NN must/MD have/VB in/IN reform/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO say/VB to/TO Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Haarder/NNP that/IN the/DT detailed/JJ recommendations/NNS on/IN recruitment/NN ,/, training/NN ,/, appraisal/NN and/CC the/DT appointment/NN to/TO management/NN positions/NNS are/VBP very/RB much/JJ in/IN line/NN with/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ thinking/NN and/CC our/PRP$ own/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO move/VB towards/IN a/DT linear/JJ career/NN system/NN because/IN the/DT current/JJ category/NN system/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB adapted/VBN to/TO the/DT needs/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS ./.

It/PRP certainly/RB blocks/VBZ the/DT advance/NN and/CC mobility/NN of/IN people/NNS with/IN proven/VBN capabilities/NNS ./.

Members/NNS ,/, who/WP ,/, in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN this/DT debate/NN ,/, have/VBP properly/RB praised/VBN Commission/NNP officials/NNS ,/, who/WP in/IN the/DT great/JJ majority/NN and/CC typically/RB are/VBP of/IN high/JJ integrity/NN ,/, hard-working/VBG and/CC of/IN great/JJ capability/NN ,/, are/VBP absolutely/RB right/JJ in/IN the/DT comments/NNS that/IN they/PRP have/VBP made/VBN ./.

While/IN the/DT reform/NN strategy/NN White/NNP Paper/NNP will/MD clearly/RB outline/VB our/PRP$ ideas/NNS on/IN these/DT and/CC other/JJ points/NNS ,/, detail/NN and/CC precision/NN are/VBP obviously/RB essential/JJ ./.

A/DT series/NN of/IN communications/NNS will/MD therefore/RB follow/VB in/IN the/DT coming/VBG months/NNS ./.

Each/DT of/IN them/PRP will/MD be/VB available/JJ for/IN reflection/NN and/CC response/NN by/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, very/RB obvious/JJ that/IN we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO work/VB closely/RB with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN an/DT institution/NN ,/, on/IN central/JJ matters/NNS of/IN common/JJ interest/NN ,/, notably/RB pay/NN and/CC pensions/NNS and/CC the/DT revision/NN of/IN the/DT staff/NN regulations/NNS ./.

On/IN this/DT latter/JJ point/NN we/PRP are/VBP reflecting/VBG on/RP whether/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB useful/JJ to/TO adopt/VB a/DT framework/NN regulation/NN which/WDT makes/VBZ common/JJ provision/NN on/IN leading/VBG issues/NNS like/IN pay/NN ,/, conditions/NNS ,/, staff/NN representation/NN rights/NNS and/CC so/RB on/RB ,/, but/CC enables/VBZ the/DT different/JJ institutions/NNS to/TO operate/VB implementing/VBG rules/NNS on/IN other/JJ matters/NNS ./.

The/DT early/JJ thoughts/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN this/DT consultative/JJ idea/NN would/MD be/VB especially/RB welcome/JJ ./.

I/PRP conclude/VBP by/IN referring/VBG to/TO paragraph/NN 15/CD of/IN the/DT resolution/NN before/IN the/DT House/NNP relating/VBG to/TO the/DT resource/NN requirements/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ policies/NNS for/IN change/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ most/RBS certainly/RB relevant/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP sure/JJ that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB an/DT important/JJ ``/`` reform/NN dividend/NN ''/'' as/IN the/DT modernisation/NN measures/NNS begin/VBP to/TO foster/VB increased/VBN efficiency/NN and/CC better/JJR management/NN in/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB clear/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP services/NNS are/VBP already/RB very/RB stretched/JJ ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ frequently/RB made/VBN that/DT point/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB clear/JJ that/IN reform/NN will/MD require/VB some/DT new/JJ investment/NN in/IN training/NN for/IN skills/NNS and/CC in/IN technology/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB clear/JJ that/IN increased/VBN preparations/NNS for/IN enlargement/NN must/MD be/VB undertaken/VBN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP already/RB having/VBG implications/NNS for/IN resource/NN availability/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB clear/JJ that/IN if/IN we/PRP take/VBP on/IN new/JJ tasks/NNS -/: which/WDT we/PRP will/MD surely/RB be/VB asked/VBN to/TO do/VB by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP -/: we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO identify/VB so-called/JJ ``/`` negative/JJ priorities/NNS ''/'' and/CC drop/VB those/DT negative/JJ priorities/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO create/VB spare/JJ capacity/NN ./.

A/DT central/JJ feature/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN will/MD therefore/RB be/VB a/DT more/JJR rigorous/JJ process/NN for/IN tying/VBG the/DT process/NN of/IN priority-setting/NN into/IN resource/NN allocation/NN under/IN a/DT system/NN of/IN activity-based/JJ management/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN whilst/IN internal/JJ discipline/NN on/IN priority-setting/NN will/MD certainly/RB be/VB introduced/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, it/PRP can/MD only/RB be/VB fully/RB effective/JJ if/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP share/VBP it/PRP and/CC take/VB an/DT equally/RB stringent/JJ attitude/NN to/TO the/DT demands/NNS made/VBN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP therefore/RB welcomes/VBZ paragraph/NN 15/CD of/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP 's/POS report/NN ./.

I/PRP conclude/VBP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, by/IN thanking/VBG the/DT House/NNP for/IN its/PRP$ attention/NN during/IN an/DT unavoidably/RB lengthy/JJ speech/NN and/CC by/IN expressing/VBG sincere/JJ gratitude/NN to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT other/JJ committees/NNS which/WDT gave/VBD their/PRP$ opinions/NNS ./.

We/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO working/VBG closely/RB with/IN this/DT House/NNP on/IN the/DT finalisation/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN strategy/NN package/NN and/CC then/RB ,/, most/RBS important/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, working/VBG together/RB with/IN this/DT House/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ implementation/NN continually/RB through/IN the/DT years/NNS that/WDT will/MD be/VB required/VBN on/IN such/JJ complexities/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB something/NN ,/, I/PRP assure/VB you/PRP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP would/MD wish/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT practice/NN of/IN ./.

A/DT fair/JJ and/CC ,/, indeed/RB ,/, generous/JJ deal/NN with/IN them/PRP remains/VBZ the/DT key/JJ to/TO lasting/JJ peace/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

A/DT solution/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO the/DT Palestinian/JJ refugee/NN problem/NN -/: these/DT are/VBP the/DT largest/JJS group/NN of/IN refugees/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, numbering/NN nearly/RB 5/CD million/CD people/NNS -/: an/DT indication/NN of/IN the/DT enormous/JJ challenges/NNS ahead/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP made/VBN progress/NN in/IN recent/JJ months/NNS and/CC weeks/NNS ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Gama/NNP mentioned/VBN earlier/RBR ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO tell/VB him/PRP that/IN communications/NNS with/IN Madrid/NNP are/VBP usually/RB more/RBR fluid/JJ and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP to/TO see/VB him/PRP there/RB soon/RB ./.

The/DT statements/NNS we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN today/NN on/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP peace/NN process/NN are/VBP very/RB opportune/JJ at/IN the/DT moment/NN because/RB of/IN the/DT hurried/JJ tour/NN which/WDT Minister/NNP Gama/NNP -/: whose/WP$ absence/NN from/IN this/DT debate/NN I/PRP also/RB regret/VBP -/: has/VBZ made/VBN of/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, accompanied/VBN by/IN other/JJ Council/NNP representatives/NNS ./.

The/DT tone/NN of/IN the/DT news/NN in/IN the/DT media/NNS on/IN the/DT recent/JJ events/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN could/MD lead/VB us/PRP to/TO take/VB a/DT pessimistic/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN ./.

I/PRP honestly/RB believe/VBP that/IN an/DT evaluation/NN of/IN this/DT type/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT reality/NN of/IN that/DT situation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, I/PRP share/VBP Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP '/POS s/JJ positive/JJ attitude/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP explain/VB :/: it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ Government/NN has/VBZ delayed/VBN the/DT third/JJ hand-over/NN of/IN West/NNP Bank/NNP territory/NN to/TO the/DT Palestinian/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN ,/, as/RB early/RB as/IN 1997/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP proposed/VBD a/DT special/JJ clause/NN concerning/VBG manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP entirely/RB supports/VBZ the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB impose/VB disproportionate/JJ costs/NNS upon/IN manufacturers/NNS ./.

Far/NNP from/IN it/PRP ./.

Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 39/CD ,/, 40/CD ,/, 46/CD and/CC 47/CD concern/NN quantified/VBN objectives/NNS ./.

The/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN protection/NN aimed/VBN at/IN by/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN would/MD be/VB very/RB much/RB undermined/VBN if/IN the/DT recycling/VBG objective/NN for/IN the/DT year/NN 2006/CD were/VBD removed/VBN ./.

These/DT amendments/NNS would/MD also/RB make/VB the/DT objectives/NNS awkward/VBG to/TO deal/VB with/IN and/CC difficult/JJ to/TO supervise/VB ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP also/RB -/: listen/VB carefully/RB to/TO what/WP I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG now/RB ,/, because/IN I/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN this/DT reiterated/VBD in/IN the/DT debate/NN -/: allow/VBP me/PRP to/TO comment/VB on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN vintage/NN and/CC ``/`` cherished/JJ ''/'' cars/NNS as/IN mentioned/VBN in/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 3/CD ,/, 7/CD ,/, and/CC 9/CD ,/, section/NN 2/CD ,/, and/CC 35/CD ./.

Such/JJ vehicles/NNS are/VBP not/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN waste/NN and/CC are/VBP not/RB therefore/RB included/VBN under/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

So/IN ,/, whatever/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN stated/VBN in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, vintage/JJ cars/NNS and/CC motorcycles/NNS are/VBP not/RB included/VBN under/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB that/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 2/CD and/CC 14/CD add/VBP anything/NN to/TO the/DT directive/NN ./.

Amendment/NNP No/RB 23/CD involves/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN having/VBG to/TO adopt/VB quality/NN standards/NNS for/IN reusable/JJ components/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

An/DT ad/FW hoc/FW directive/NN should/MD therefore/RB be/VB demanded/VBN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 29/CD ,/, 31/CD and/CC 41/CD water/VB down/RP the/DT requirements/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT dismantling/VBG of/IN vehicles/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT danger/NN of/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 31/CD and/CC 41/CD reducing/VBG the/DT chances/NNS of/IN recycling/VBG plastic/JJ ,/, tyres/NNS and/CC glass/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB approve/VB Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 1/CD and/CC 33/CD for/IN reasons/NNS to/TO do/VB with/IN legal/JJ clarity/NN ;/: nor/CC Amendment/NNP No/VBZ 19/CD ,/, which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP considers/VBZ to/TO be/VB unnecessary/JJ at/IN this/DT stage/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, Amendment/NNP No/NNP 43/CD does/VBZ not/RB fall/VB within/IN the/DT directive/NN '/POS s/JJ area/NN of/IN applicability/NN ./.

Relatively/RB few/JJ women/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, are/VBP active/JJ in/IN scientific/JJ disciplines/NNS despite/IN the/DT excellent/JJ results/NNS they/PRP achieve/VBP in/IN their/PRP$ studies/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ for/IN women/NNS to/TO continue/VB to/TO be/VB underrepresented/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB delighted/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT proposals/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP document/NN sets/VBZ out/RP to/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT initiatives/NNS to/TO be/VB taken/VBN at/IN Community/NNP level/NN ,/, especially/RB through/IN the/DT fifth/JJ framework/NN programme/NN for/IN research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB obviously/RB something/NN I/PRP approve/VBP of/IN ./.

The/DT goal/NN for/IN the/DT years/NNS to/TO come/VB is/VBZ to/TO increase/VB women/NNS '/POS s/JJ participation/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT rate/NN of/IN 40/CD %/NN female/JJ participation/NN in/IN the/DT Marie/NNP Curie/NNP grants/NNS ,/, in/IN consultative/JJ assemblies/NNS and/CC in/IN evaluation/NN panels/NNS for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT fifth/JJ framework/NN programme/NN for/IN research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, like/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN studies/NNS must/MD be/VB undertaken/VBN to/TO analyse/VB the/DT reasons/NNS for/IN the/DT gap/NN between/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN women/NNS with/IN science/NN degrees/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN women/NNS who/WP manage/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT career/NN in/IN these/DT fields/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO enlist/VB the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT many/JJ existing/VBG networks/NNS of/IN women/NNS scientists/NNS and/CC to/TO obtain/VB their/PRP$ assistance/NN in/IN framing/VBG a/DT joint/JJ research/NN policy/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO carefully/RB monitor/VB the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT fifth/JJ framework/NN programme/NN for/IN research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT promotion/NN of/IN women/NNS and/CC to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN ideas/NNS for/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT fifth/JJ framework/NN programme/NN for/IN research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD incorporate/VB the/DT gender/NN factor/NN in/IN science/NN ,/, research/NN and/CC all/DT other/JJ European/JJ Union/NNP policies/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT structural/JJ discrimination/NN which/WDT prevents/VBZ women/NNS competing/VBG on/IN equal/JJ terms/NNS in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ communication/NN ``/`` Women/NNP and/CC Science/NNP ''/'' ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP informs/VBZ us/PRP of/IN its/PRP$ good/JJ intentions/NNS of/IN enlisting/VBG the/DT support/NN of/IN women/NNS to/TO enrich/JJ research/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB it/PRP ./.

The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ there/EX are/VBP too/RB few/JJ women/NNS involved/VBN in/IN research/NN work/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ patently/RB not/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, since/IN such/PDT a/DT quota/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB realistic/JJ ./.

Indeed/RB the/DT report/NN does/VBZ not/RB mention/VB the/DT time/NN limit/NN for/IN this/DT quota/NN to/TO be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

And/CC why/WRB should/MD we/PRP not/RB note/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ communication/NN stipulates/VBZ specifically/RB that/IN it/PRP considers/VBZ a/DT 40/CD %/NN minimum/JJ level/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT crucial/JJ goal/NN for/IN women/NNS '/POS s/JJ participation/NN at/IN all/DT levels/NNS in/IN the/DT implementation/NN and/CC management/NN of/IN research/NN programmes/NNS ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT quota/NN !/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT perfectly/RB legitimate/JJ declaration/NN of/IN intent/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, insofar/VBN as/IN it/PRP concerns/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ programmes/NNS and/CC not/RB those/DT of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

People/NNS must/MD realise/VB this/DT !/. ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN Mrs/NNP McNally/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO increasing/VBG and/CC facilitating/VBG women/NNS '/'' s/VBZ participation/NN in/IN professions/NNS in/IN research/NN and/CC science/NN ,/, met/VBN with/IN a/DT fairly/RB wide/JJ consensus/NN ./.

Second/JJ reading/NN of/IN the/DT Florenz/NNP report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0006/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, today/NN in/IN the/DT second/JJ reading/NN we/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN on/IN the/DT amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT Directive/NNP on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP rejected/VBN the/DT entire/JJ directive/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS because/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 34/CD to/TO Article/NNP 12/CD and/CC the/DT amendments/NNS to/TO Article/NNP 5/4/CD have/VBP not/RB received/VBN an/DT adequate/JJ majority/NN here/RB in/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.

I/PRP come/VBP from/IN a/DT country/NN which/WDT manufactures/VBZ 50/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT cars/NNS in/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT free/JJ collection/NN of/IN end-of-life/JJ cars/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ so/RB financially/RB onerous/JJ and/CC unacceptable/JJ ./.

Here/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT labour/NN market/NN is/VBZ also/RB considerably/RB burdened/VBN by/IN the/DT costs/NNS arising/VBG to/TO these/DT companies/NNS ./.

This/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN in/IN a/DT European/NNP Union/NNP where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP ever/RB mindful/JJ of/IN employment/NN ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT serious/JJ defect/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB befit/VB our/PRP$ legal/JJ system/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ for/IN this/DT reason/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO comment/VB on/IN the/DT Florenz/NNP report/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT vote/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN although/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN toned/VBN down/RP ,/, the/DT major/JJ groups/NNS here/RB -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC above/IN all/DT the/DT German/JJ delegates/NNS of/IN the/DT major/JJ groups/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- have/VBP not/RB ,/, thank/VBP God/NNP ,/, succeeded/VBN in/IN destroying/VBG the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT directive/NN ,/, namely/RB manufacturer/NN responsibility/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT toning/VBG down/RP of/IN the/DT effective/JJ ecological/JJ material/NN flow/NN policy/NN ,/, i.e./VBN through/IN the/DT obligatory/JJ risk/NN assessment/NN of/IN materials/NNS whose/WP$ harmful/JJ effect/NN on/IN health/NN has/VBZ been/VBN known/VBN for/IN years/NNS ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN lead/NN ,/, mercury/NN ,/, cadmium/NN and/CC hexavalent/NN chromium/NN present/JJ high/JJ toxic/NN and/CC health/NN risks/NNS and/CC numerous/JJ Community/NNP directives/NNS have/VBP succeeded/VBN in/IN restricting/VBG their/PRP$ usage/NN without/IN any/DT risk/NN assessment/NN being/VBG made/VBN ./.

Here/RB ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ bowed/VBD to/TO the/DT interests/NNS of/IN industry/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP nevertheless/RB extremely/RB pleased/JJ that/IN there/EX was/VBD no/DT majority/NN for/IN the/DT amendments/NNS of/IN Florenz/NNP ,/, Lange/NNP and/CC others/NNS who/WP have/VBP actually/RB sought/VBN to/TO lever/VB out/RP manufacturer/NN responsibility/NN and/CC make/VB consumers/NNS solely/RB responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN environmentally/RB compatible/JJ disposal/NN of/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, although/IN I/PRP too/RB have/VBP spent/VBN most/JJS of/IN my/PRP$ life/NN in/IN fast/JJ cars/NNS ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT directive/NN on/IN scrapping/VBG cars/NNS must/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN vintage/JJ cars/NNS are/VBP not/RB included/VBN ./.

These/DT splendid/JJ cars/NNS do/VBP not/RB constitute/VB waste/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP voted/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS ./.

Neither/DT can/MD we/PRP fix/VB what/WP the/DT age/NN for/IN a/DT vintage/JJ car/NN should/MD be/VB as/IN there/EX are/VBP very/RB great/JJ differences/NNS from/IN one/CD country/NN '/POS s/JJ statutes/NNS to/TO another/DT '/'' s/VBZ ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN vehicles/NNS of/IN historic/JJ value/NN can/MD be/VB preserved/VBN for/IN future/JJ generations/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB forget/VB old/JJ car/NN enthusiasts/NNS either/RB ,/, of/IN whom/WP there/EX are/VBP more/JJR than/IN 50/CD 000/CD in/IN Finland/NNP alone/RB ./.

They/PRP are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN low-profile/JJ work/NN of/IN valuable/JJ cultural/JJ importance/NN ./.

-/: -LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- The/DT parliamentary/JJ process/NN concerning/VBG this/DT question/NN has/VBZ been/VBN confusing/JJ ,/, to/TO say/VB the/DT least/JJS ./.

Before/IN the/DT vote/NN at/IN the/DT plenary/NN sitting/VBG ,/, new/JJ amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN tabled/VBN such/JJ as/IN have/VBP already/RB been/VBN voted/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP ./.

In/IN the/DT divided/VBN situation/NN which/WDT has/VBZ now/RB arisen/VBN ,/, we/PRP therefore/RB consider/VBP that/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ wordings/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/JJS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT directive/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP also/RB therefore/RB want/VBP to/TO avoid/VB a/DT complicated/JJ conciliation/NN procedure/NN ./.

The/DT directive/NN concerning/VBG end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS will/MD stand/VB as/IN an/DT example/NN for/IN future/JJ legislation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ that/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN should/MD be/VB clear/JJ ./.

This/DT should/MD not/RB in/IN any/DT way/NN be/VB jeopardised/VBN ./.

Today/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP is/VBZ examining/VBG ,/, for/IN the/DT last/JJ time/NN ,/, this/DT text/NN on/IN `/`` end-of-life/JJ '/'' vehicles/NNS and/CC what/WP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN with/IN them/PRP :/: their/PRP$ destruction/NN ,/, a/DT commendable/JJ intention/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO our/PRP$ environment/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, two/CD considerations/NNS which/WDT must/MD certainly/RB be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN within/IN this/DT text/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, who/WP is/VBZ to/TO bear/VB the/DT financial/JJ costs/NNS of/IN this/DT destruction/NN ?/.

We/PRP must/MD all/RB ensure/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB always/RB the/DT same/JJ person/NN ,/, i.e./VBZ the/DT vehicle/NN owner/NN ,/, who/WP pays/VBZ ./.

He/PRP or/CC she/PRP already/RB pays/VBZ enough/RB in/IN taxes/NNS for/IN this/DT vehicle/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT bottomless/JJ pit/NN in/IN financial/JJ terms/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP recently/RB had/VBN cause/NN to/TO talk/VB about/IN the/DT `/`` polluter/NN pays/VBZ '/'' principle/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD apply/VB this/DT principle/NN rationally/RB and/CC calmly/RB ,/, correctly/RB targeted/JJ and/CC without/IN ideology/NN ./.

Another/DT essential/JJ point/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN this/DT text/NN is/VBZ the/DT express/JJ exclusion/NN of/IN vintage/JJ vehicles/NNS from/IN its/PRP$ scope/NN ./.

One/PRP might/MD make/VB the/DT claim/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN to/TO state/VB it/PRP explicitly/RB in/IN writing/VBG because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT obvious/JJ point/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT point/NN that/WDT should/MD be/VB made/VBN in/IN writing/VBG because/IN there/EX is/VBZ every/DT interest/NN in/IN adopting/VBG clear/JJ texts/NNS ./.

So/RB let/VB us/PRP vote/VB for/IN these/DT amendments/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO preserve/VB these/DT gems/NNS of/IN the/DT automobile/NN industry/NN ./.

These/DT old/JJ vehicles/NNS are/VBP testimony/NN to/TO a/DT culture/NN and/CC a/DT passion/NN which/WDT should/MD be/VB recognised/VBN and/CC respected/VBN by/IN Europe/NNP ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB to/TO water/VB down/RP each/DT of/IN our/PRP$ specific/JJ identities/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT lack/NN of/IN examples/NNS amongst/IN European/JJ texts/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP all/DT know/VBP how/WRB much/JJ debate/NN and/CC argument/NN is/VBZ caused/VBN by/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN clarity/NN and/CC precision/NN ./.

I/PRP only/RB need/VBP to/TO mention/VB the/DT case/NN of/IN Directives/NNP 79/409/CD and/CC 92/43/CD ./.

The/DT precise/JJ wording/NN of/IN texts/NNS provides/VBZ a/DT guarantee/NN and/CC legal/JJ certainty/NN for/IN those/DT people/NNS who/WP will/MD have/VB to/TO apply/VB or/CC live/VB by/IN these/DT texts/NNS on/IN a/DT daily/JJ basis/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT job/NN of/IN the/DT MEP/NNP to/TO generate/VB litigation/NN or/CC legal/JJ proceedings/NNS for/IN judges/NNS in/IN any/DT arena/NN ./.

That/DT would/MD not/RB be/VB fulfilling/VBG our/PRP$ mission/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD adopt/VB crystal-clear/JJ texts/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO limit/VB legal/JJ disputes/NNS ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- NL/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- That/IN the/DT Florenz/NNP report/NN has/VBZ caused/VBN such/PDT a/DT stir/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proven/VBN by/IN the/DT powerful/JJ lobby/NN machine/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN in/IN motion/NN by/IN both/DT industry/NN and/CC the/DT environmental/JJ movement/NN ./.

But/CC as/IN you/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB aware/JJ ,/, we/PRP are/VBP waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT Commission/NNP communication/NN on/IN coherence/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT communication/NN on/IN development/NN policy/NN ./.

Over/IN the/DT coming/VBG months/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB during/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, this/DT debate/NN will/MD of/IN course/NN be/VB enriched/VBN by/IN the/DT contributions/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ undertaken/VBN to/TO present/VB to/TO us/PRP ./.

By/IN this/DT I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT internal/JJ dynamics/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ dynamics/NNS ,/, which/WDT stem/VBP above/IN all/DT from/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ reinforced/VBD its/PRP$ political/JJ dimension/NN ./.

This/DT inevitably/RB has/VBZ important/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN coherence/NN in/IN policies/NNS relating/VBG to/TO development/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ aspect/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO consider/VB ,/, in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT coherence/NN of/IN policies/NNS ,/, is/VBZ development/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ foreign/JJ policy/NN ./.

There/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT doubt/NN that/IN implementing/VBG and/CC developing/VBG all/PDT these/DT aspects/NNS will/MD inevitably/RB make/VB an/DT important/JJ contribution/NN to/TO strengthening/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN development/NN policies/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ foreign/JJ policy/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB said/VBN that/IN ,/, in/IN approaching/VBG development/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN foreign/JJ policy/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ bound/VBN to/TO go/VB down/RP the/DT same/JJ road/NN as/IN many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP done/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ development/NN policies/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN their/PRP$ individual/JJ foreign/JJ policies/NNS ./.

The/DT success/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ bound/VBN to/TO involve/VB a/DT need/NN to/TO strengthen/VB decision-making/JJ mechanisms/NNS and/CC institutional/JJ structures/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO secure/VB better/JJR coordination/NN between/IN instruments/NNS of/IN development/NN policy/NN and/CC instruments/NNS of/IN foreign/JJ policy/NN ./.

The/DT third/JJ aspect/NN that/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB considered/VBN is/VBZ European/NNP Union/NNP policy/NN and/CC Member/NNP States/NNP '/POS policy/NN ./.

Coherence/NNP of/IN policies/NNS at/IN European/JJ level/NN certainly/RB means/VBZ better/JJR coordination/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS policies/NNS with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB establish/VB improved/JJ mechanisms/NNS to/TO ensure/VB coherence/NN between/IN national/JJ policies/NNS ,/, it/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB more/RBR difficult/JJ to/TO deliberate/VB against/IN a/DT background/NN of/IN greater/JJR coherence/NN in/IN European/JJ Union/NNP development/NN policy/NN ./.

Ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT fourth/JJ and/CC final/JJ aspect/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB to/TO your/PRP$ attention/NN ,/, regarding/VBG development/NN policy/NN ,/, is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT Development/NNP Council/NNP ./.

There/EX have/VBP been/VBN discussions/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN recent/JJ months/NNS ,/, about/IN the/DT role/NN the/DT Development/NNP Council/NNP could/MD play/VB in/IN relation/NN to/TO EU/NNP policies/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT glaring/VBG difference/NN between/IN the/DT status/NN of/IN development/NN policies/NNS and/CC other/JJ EU/NNP policies/NNS -/: you/PRP only/RB have/VBP to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT difficult/JJ circumstances/NNS surrounding/VBG the/DT EDF/NNP '/POS s/JJ financing/NN ,/, or/CC rather/RB lack/NN of/IN financing/NN ./.

The/DT views/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP on/IN this/DT issue/NN too/RB ,/, will/MD certainly/RB be/VB both/DT timely/JJ and/CC welcome/JJ ./. ./.

Let/VB me/PRP start/VB by/IN saying/VBG something/NN about/IN the/DT successfully/CD concluded/VBN negotiations/NNS between/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remark/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB positive/JJ experience/NN taking/VBG part/NN in/IN those/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

I/PRP saw/VBD Member/NNP States/NNPS working/VBG as/IN a/DT team/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD indeed/RB a/DT wonderful/JJ experience/NN ./.

There/EX was/VBD also/RB deep/JJ satisfaction/NN on/IN both/DT sides/NNS when/WRB this/DT was/VBD over/RB ,/, not/RB just/RB because/IN it/PRP was/VBD over/RP ,/, but/CC because/IN we/PRP all/DT knew/VBD that/IN we/PRP had/VBD achieved/VBN something/NN together/RB ,/, the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT 71/CD ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/IN the/DT world/NN needs/VBZ and/CC is/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ signal/NN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ discussion/NN of/IN globalisation/NN ./.

We/PRP create/VBP an/DT investment/NN facility/NN to/TO support/VB the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT private/JJ sector/NN ./.

We/PRP rationalise/VB instruments/NNS and/CC introduce/VB a/DT new/JJ system/NN of/IN rolling/JJ programming/NN ,/, allowing/VBG the/DT Community/NNP and/CC the/DT beneficiary/NN country/NN to/TO regularly/RB adjust/VB their/PRP$ cooperation/NN programme/NN ./.

We/PRP decentralise/VBP administrative/JJ and/CC ,/, in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, financial/JJ responsibilities/NNS to/TO local/JJ level/NN with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN making/VBG cooperation/NN more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, a/DT new/JJ procedure/NN has/VBZ been/VBN drawn/VBN up/RP for/IN cases/NNS of/IN violations/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, democratic/JJ principles/NNS and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

In/IN comparison/NN with/IN the/DT current/JJ procedure/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ one/NN puts/VBZ more/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN concerned/VBN and/CC allows/VBZ for/IN greater/JJR flexibility/NN in/IN the/DT consultation/NN process/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO conducting/VBG an/DT effective/JJ dialogue/NN leading/VBG to/TO measures/NNS to/TO be/VB taken/VBN to/TO redress/VB the/DT situation/NN ./.

In/IN cases/NNS of/IN special/JJ urgency/NN involving/VBG serious/JJ violations/NNS of/IN one/CD of/IN these/DT essential/JJ elements/NNS ,/, measures/NNS will/MD be/VB taken/VBN immediately/RB and/CC the/DT other/JJ party/NN will/MD be/VB notified/VBN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP have/VBP also/RB agreed/VBN on/IN a/DT new/JJ specific/JJ procedure/NN to/TO be/VB launched/VBN in/IN serious/JJ cases/NNS of/IN corruption/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ innovation/NN ,/, both/DT in/IN the/DT EU/ACP/NNP context/NN and/CC in/IN international/JJ relations/NNS in/IN general/NN ./.

This/DT procedure/NN will/MD be/VB applied/VBN ,/, not/RB only/RB in/IN cases/NNS of/IN corruption/NN involving/VBG EDF/NNP money/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB more/RBR widely/RB in/IN any/DT country/NN where/WRB the/DT EC/NNP is/VBZ financially/RB involved/VBN and/CC where/WRB corruption/NN constitutes/VBZ an/DT obstacle/NN to/TO development/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ thus/RB not/RB confined/VBN to/TO EC/NNP activities/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ aspect/NN ,/, taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT fundability/NN of/IN public/JJ finances/NNS ./.

By/IN adopting/VBG such/PDT a/DT provision/NN in/IN the/DT partnership/NN agreement/NN ,/, the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP together/RB sending/VBG a/DT clear/JJ and/CC positive/JJ signal/NN that/WDT will/MD doubtless/RB be/VB appreciated/VBN by/IN European/JJ taxpayers/NNS and/CC hopefully/RB also/RB by/IN European/JJ investors/NNS ./.

Another/DT new/JJ theme/NN in/IN the/DT ACP-EU/JJ agreement/NN is/VBZ migration/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN a/DT balanced/JJ agreement/NN on/IN cooperation/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

This/DT new/JJ dimension/NN to/TO the/DT partnership/NN agreement/NN reflects/VBZ the/DT guidelines/NNS espoused/VBD by/IN the/DT EU/NNP in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP and/CC with/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN Tampere/NNP in/IN Finland/NNP in/IN October/NNP 1999/CD ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP undertakes/VBZ to/TO develop/VB and/CC implement/VB an/DT immigration/NN and/CC asylum/NN policy/NN founded/VBN on/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN partnership/NN with/IN the/DT originating/JJ countries/NNS and/CC regions/NNS ./.

The/DT agreement/NN concluded/VBD with/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS paves/NNS the/DT way/NN for/IN new/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ on/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN third/JJ country/NN citizens/NNS within/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, and/CC measures/NNS facilitating/VBG their/PRP$ integration/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB agreed/VBD on/IN provisions/NNS to/TO address/VB questions/NNS related/VBN to/TO illegal/JJ immigration/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS will/MD initiate/VB the/DT process/NN aimed/VBN ultimately/RB at/IN defining/NN ,/, within/IN a/DT framework/NN to/TO be/VB negotiated/VBN with/IN each/DT and/CC every/DT ACP/NNP country/NN ,/, the/DT ways/NNS and/CC means/NNS of/IN repatriating/JJ immigrants/NNS illegally/RB present/VBP on/IN the/DT territories/NNS of/IN each/DT party/NN ./.

This/DT also/RB covers/VBZ persons/NNS from/IN third/JJ countries/NNS and/CC stateless/NNS persons/NNS ./.

These/DT very/RB innovative/JJ approaches/NNS provide/VBP a/DT good/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO improve/VB governance/NN ./.

The/DT agreement/NN also/RB offers/VBZ a/DT good/JJ framework/NN to/TO underpin/VB the/DT mutually/RB reinforcing/JJ effects/NNS of/IN trade/NN cooperation/NN and/CC development/NN aid/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP agreed/VBN on/IN a/DT process/NN to/TO establish/VB new/JJ trading/NN arrangements/NNS that/WDT will/MD pursue/VB trade/NN liberalisation/NN between/IN the/DT parties/NNS and/CC to/TO formulate/VB provisions/NNS on/IN trade-related/JJ matters/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP met/VBN the/DT concerns/NNS of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP states/NNS as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT time-frame/NN of/IN the/DT trade/NN negotiations/NNS is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

Negotiations/NNS will/MD start/VB no/RB later/RB than/IN 2002/CD ./.

This/DT two-year/JJ preparatory/NN period/NN will/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO strengthen/VB regional/JJ integration/NN processes/NNS and/CC the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS '/POS capacity/NN to/TO conduct/VB trade/NN negotiations/NNS ./.

A/DT six-year/JJ period/NN is/VBZ programmed/VBN for/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

This/DT approach/NN will/MD lead/VB us/PRP to/TO a/DT fully/RB WTO/RB compatible/JJ regime/NN ./.

Economic/NNP operators/NNS will/MD be/VB more/RBR inclined/JJ to/TO establish/VB closer/JJR relations/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ ACP/NNP partners/NNS ./.

Domestic/JJ and/CC foreign/JJ investment/NN will/MD grow/VB and/CC more/JJR know-how/NN and/CC technology/NN will/MD be/VB transferred/VBN ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT will/MD boost/VB the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS '/POS competitiveness/NN and/CC ease/VB their/PRP$ gradual/JJ integration/NN into/IN the/DT world/NN economy/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT agreements/NNS with/IN the/DT EU/NNP will/MD act/VB as/IN an/DT anchor/NN ./.

They/PRP will/MD lock/VB in/IN the/DT economic/JJ reforms/NNS ,/, just/RB as/IN national/JJ and/CC economic/JJ reforms/NNS will/MD be/VB stabilised/VBN by/IN both/DT parties/NNS '/POS commitments/NNS under/IN the/DT agreements/NNS ./.

The/DT rationale/NN behind/IN this/DT new/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ also/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN open/JJ trade/NN policies/NNS combined/VBN with/IN social/JJ development/NN policies/NNS will/MD lead/VB to/TO economic/JJ growth/NN and/CC poverty/NN reduction/NN ./.

Another/DT important/JJ aspect/NN is/VBZ the/DT improvement/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ trade/NN regime/NN for/IN all/DT least-developed/JJ countries/NNS ,/, 39/CD of/IN which/WDT are/VBP actually/RB in/IN the/DT ACP/NNP group/NN ./.

This/DT process/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN in/IN the/DT coming/JJ five/CD years/NNS so/IN that/DT ,/, by/IN 2005/CD ,/, the/DT LDCs/NNPS '/POS exporters/NNS will/MD have/VB free/JJ access/NN for/IN essentially/RB all/DT their/PRP$ products/NNS on/IN the/DT EU/NNP market/NN ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT volume/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ EDF/NN ,/, the/DT EU/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN its/PRP$ financial/JJ proposal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN reconciling/VBG the/DT need/NN to/TO maintain/VB a/DT substantial/JJ amount/NN of/IN financial/JJ resources/NNS in/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN limited/JJ official/JJ development/NN assistance/NN budgets/NNS with/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO make/VB Community/NNP aid/NN more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

Today/NN about/RB EUR/$ 9.5/CD billion/CD of/IN previous/JJ EDF/NNP resources/NNS are/VBP uncommitted/VBN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ committed/VBN to/TO mobilising/VBG these/DT remaining/VBG balances/NNS ,/, plus/CC the/DT new/JJ EDF/NNP resources/NNS ,/, over/IN a/DT seven-year/JJ period/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, before/IN the/DT entry/NN into/IN force/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ financial/JJ protocol/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD enable/VB the/DT Community/NNP to/TO substantially/RB increase/VB annual/JJ flows/NNS of/IN commitments/NNS and/CC payments/NNS during/IN this/DT period/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP thus/RB not/RB moving/VBG into/IN a/DT period/NN in/IN the/DT coming/JJ years/NNS of/IN reduced/JJ activity/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP moving/VBG into/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN increased/VBN activity/NN ./.

Such/PDT a/DT commitment/NN entails/VBZ an/DT in-depth/JJ reform/NN of/IN procedures/NNS and/CC implementation/NN modalities/NNS on/IN both/DT sides/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT very/RB real/JJ link/NN between/IN the/DT reform/NN process/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP as/RB such/JJ ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO deliver/VB on/IN the/DT ground/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT deal/NN with/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

Turning/VBG to/TO our/PRP$ development/NN policy/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT global/JJ context/NN has/VBZ changed/VBN drastically/RB ./.

The/DT marginalisation/NN of/IN many/JJ economies/NNS ,/, increased/JJ poverty/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, the/DT need/NN for/IN better/JJR management/NN of/IN environmental/JJ interdependence/NN ,/, the/DT destabilising/JJ effects/NNS of/IN migration/NN and/CC the/DT worrying/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN armed/JJ conflicts/NNS and/CC pandemic/JJ diseases/NNS are/VBP all/RB major/JJ concerns/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ within/IN this/DT changing/VBG global/JJ framework/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO position/VB ourselves/PRP ./.

Fortunately/RB evaluations/NNS of/IN EC/NNP aid/NN give/VBP us/PRP a/DT meaningful/JJ tool/NN to/TO improve/VB what/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG and/CC also/RB hopefully/RB to/TO meet/VB the/DT challenges/NNS I/PRP have/VBP just/RB mentioned/VBN ./.

To/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT input/NN coming/VBG from/IN the/DT evaluations/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD mention/VB the/DT following/VBG problems/NNS :/: the/DT objections/NNS of/IN Community/NNP policy/NN are/VBP too/RB numerous/JJ and/CC too/RB vague/JJ and/CC this/DT adversely/RB affects/VBZ coherence/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO the/DT complexity/NN of/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ structures/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO very/RB real/JJ inconsistencies/NNS between/IN sector/NN policies/NNS and/CC interests/NNS in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ an/DT aid/NN system/NN that/WDT is/VBZ too/RB complex/JJ and/CC fragmented/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN instruments/NNS ,/, procedures/NNS and/CC institutional/JJ mechanisms/NNS ./.

Often/RB policies/NNS are/VBP more/RBR determined/JJ by/IN the/DT instruments/NNS available/JJ ,/, than/IN by/IN policy/NN objectives/NNS and/CC clearly-defined/JJ priorities/NNS ./.

Human/NNP resources/NNS are/VBP too/RB thin/JJ in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT volume/NN of/IN aid/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO manage/VB ./.

On/IN average/NN ,/, to/TO manage/VB $/$ US/CD 10/CD million/CD of/IN aid/NN there/RB are/VBP 2.9/CD staff/NN at/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, compared/VBN with/IN 4.3/CD at/IN the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP and/CC between/IN 4/CD and/CC 9/CD in/IN major/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ problem/NN :/: there/EX are/VBP too/RB many/JJ different/JJ financial/JJ instruments/NNS ,/, each/DT with/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ characteristics/NNS and/CC in/IN particular/JJ a/DT series/NN of/IN different/JJ budget/NN headings/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO reconcile/VB with/IN the/DT needs/NNS of/IN an/DT effective/JJ management/NN system/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO face/VB and/CC solve/VB these/DT problems/NNS the/DT Community/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO engage/VB in/IN an/DT effective/JJ dialogue/NN with/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC Parliament/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB crucial/JJ that/IN we/PRP tackle/VBP the/DT coherence/NN issue/NN in/IN a/DT realistic/JJ and/CC pragmatic/JJ way/NN ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ holding/VBG the/DT debate/NN in/IN the/DT appropriate/JJ institutional/JJ framework/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT lack/NN of/IN concerted/JJ action/NN among/IN the/DT 15/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS themselves/PRP and/CC between/IN them/PRP and/CC the/DT Community/NNP also/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

By/IN focusing/VBG the/DT Community/NNP 's/POS development/NN policy/NN on/IN internationally/RB agreed/VBN targets/NNS and/CC strategies/NNS we/PRP will/MD pave/VB the/DT way/NN for/IN better/JJR complementarity/NN with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ the/DT line/NN also/RB just/RB presented/VBN by/IN Minister/NNP Amado/NNP ./.

When/WRB we/PRP talk/VBP policies/NNS nowadays/RB ,/, we/PRP engage/VBP in/IN a/DT process/NN of/IN convergence/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT solution/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN formulating/VBG new/JJ policy/NN guidelines/NNS and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO identify/VB priority/NN areas/NNS for/IN Community/NNP action/NN ./.

Everything/NNP has/VBZ become/VBN more/JJR and/CC more/RBR complex/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB true/JJ of/IN development/NN cooperation/NN ./.

No/DT single/JJ donor/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT whole/JJ spectrum/NN of/IN themes/NNS ,/, ranging/VBG from/IN macro-economic/JJ issues/NNS to/TO the/DT regulatory/JJ framework/NN or/CC from/IN sectoral/JJ policies/NNS to/TO a/DT variety/NN of/IN new/JJ cross-cutting/JJ themes/NNS such/JJ as/IN gender/NN ,/, environment/NN ,/, good/JJ governance/NN and/CC institutional/JJ reforms/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO find/VB flexible/JJ mechanisms/NNS that/WDT accommodate/VBP a/DT division/NN of/IN labour/NN according/VBG to/TO the/DT expertise/NN and/CC capacity/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ donors/NNS in/IN each/DT developing/VBG country/NN ./.

This/DT should/MD be/VB done/VBN at/IN Member/NNP State/NNP level/NN and/CC should/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT formulation/NN of/IN sector/NN policies/NNS for/IN Community/NNP action/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ where/WRB we/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB ./.

To/TO identify/VB the/DT EC/NNP 's/POS priority/NN areas/NNS of/IN support/NN ,/, account/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB taken/VBN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP 's/POS specific/JJ features/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC to/TO international/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

Also/RB ,/, our/PRP$ presence/NN on/IN the/DT ground/NN :/: basically/RB ,/, I/PRP find/VBP the/DT biggest/JJS value/NN we/PRP represent/VBP is/VBZ the/DT very/JJ fact/NN that/WDT being/VBG a/DT successful/JJ regional/JJ cooperation/NN endeavour/NN ourselves/PRP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP seen/VBN as/IN a/DT neutral/JJ ,/, welcome/JJ partner/NN for/IN this/DT experiment/NN world-wide/RB -/: something/NN which/WDT nobody/NN else/RB can/MD claim/VB to/TO be/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO make/VB Community/NNP policy/NN more/RBR effective/JJ and/CC to/TO develop/VB a/DT more/RBR operational/JJ strategic/JJ framework/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ this/DT dual/JJ challenge/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ to/TO take/VB up/RP ,/, by/IN framing/VBG in/IN the/DT months/NNS ahead/RB a/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT general/JJ policy/NN statement/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD launch/VB a/DT broad/JJ and/CC open/JJ consultation/NN process/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT views/NNS of/IN all/PDT the/DT different/JJ parties/NNS interested/JJ ./.

I/PRP see/VBP the/DT process/NN not/RB quite/RB but/CC almost/RB as/RB important/JJ as/IN the/DT content/NN and/CC we/PRP will/MD put/VB all/PDT our/PRP$ resources/NNS into/IN participating/VBG actively/RB and/CC we/PRP invite/VB everybody/NN to/TO participate/VB ./.

Parallel/RB to/TO this/DT we/PRP have/VBP also/RB embarked/VBN on/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN improving/VBG coherence/NN and/CC clarifying/VBG and/CC bringing/VBG to/TO the/DT surface/NN and/CC into/IN the/DT open/NN the/DT real/JJ or/CC imaginary/JJ problems/NNS we/PRP are/VBP having/VBG in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD be/VB an/DT ongoing/JJ process/NN which/WDT I/PRP see/VBP as/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN continued/VBN quality/NN control/NN effort/NN and/CC I/PRP invite/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO participate/VB in/IN this/DT ongoing/JJ effort/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT coherence/NN of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Amado/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP Amado/NNP talked/VBD about/IN the/DT EDF/NNP ./.

The/DT problem/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, should/MD not/RB be/VB sought/VBN within/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP or/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP that/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO make/VB a/DT decision/NN on/IN the/DT EDF/NNP budget/NN ./.

This/DT sermon/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, really/RB belongs/VBZ in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP thank/VBP Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ talked/VBN extensively/RB about/IN the/DT new/JJ Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, although/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB really/RB the/DT topic/NN of/IN this/DT morning/NN '/POS s/JJ meeting/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO talk/VB about/IN coherence/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT topic/NN ./.

Ever/RB since/IN the/DT early/JJ nineties/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT European/JJ Council/NN of/IN Ministers/NNP have/VBP recognised/VBN that/IN this/DT coherence/NN of/IN European/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ leaves/VBZ something/NN to/TO be/VB desired/JJ ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN development/NN cooperation/NN and/CC in/IN other/JJ EU/NNP policies/NNS ./.

This/DT problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN highlighted/VBN on/IN several/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, to/TO whit/VB in/IN 1992/CD ,/, in/IN 1995/CD and/CC 1997/CD ./.

The/DT examples/NNS are/VBP all/RB quoted/VBN in/IN a/DT resolution/NN which/WDT lies/VBZ before/IN us/PRP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP raised/VBN questions/NNS regarding/VBG this/DT issue/NN for/IN years/NNS now/RB ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT obligation/NN for/IN coherence/NN of/IN policy/NN was/VBD even/RB included/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP in/IN 1997/CD ./.

In/IN 1998/CD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD agreed/VBN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP should/MD publish/VB an/DT annual/JJ report/NN which/WDT highlights/VBZ any/DT improvements/NNS ./.

But/CC what/WP have/VBP we/PRP seen/VBN since/IN then/RB ?/.

Fine/JJ words/NNS ,/, as/IN is/VBZ the/DT case/NN again/RB today/NN ,/, but/CC no/RB report/VBP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ too/RB crazy/JJ for/IN words/NNS ,/, really/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN contradictory/JJ policy/NN ./.

Time/NN and/CC time/NN again/RB ,/, good/JJ intentions/NNS are/VBP formulated/VBN but/CC nothing/NN is/VBZ implemented/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, with/IN good/JJ reason/NN that/IN we/PRP bring/VB this/DT up/RP here/RB today/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO give/VB you/PRP a/DT few/JJ examples/NNS to/TO illustrate/VB these/DT contradictions/NNS ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS grow/VBP sugar/NN cane/NN for/IN sugar/NN production/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, sugar/NN is/VBZ produced/VBN from/IN sugar/NN beet/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB this/DT cheap/JJ sugar/NN from/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS from/IN competing/VBG with/IN the/DT more/RBR expensive/JJ EU/NN sugar/NN ,/, a/DT considerable/JJ import/NN levy/NN is/VBZ imposed/VBN on/IN cane/NN sugar/NN ./.

The/DT result/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT export/NN of/IN cane/NN sugar/NN from/IN the/DT relevant/JJ countries/NNS to/TO the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ significantly/RB restricted/VBN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP give/VBP these/DT countries/NNS an/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN development/NN aid/NN ./.

A/DT Minister/NNP from/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT Caribbean/JJ islands/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP sugar/NN cane/NN once/RB told/VBD me/PRP :/: If/IN you/PRP just/RB allowed/VBD our/PRP$ sugar/NN access/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, we/PRP would/MD not/RB need/VB your/PRP$ development/NN aid/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

Another/DT example/NN is/VBZ cacao/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO permit/VB 5/CD %/NN of/IN alternative/JJ fats/NNS in/IN chocolate/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO harmonise/VB the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

This/DT could/MD just/RB as/RB well/RB be/VB 0/CD %/NN -/: the/DT internal/JJ market/NN would/MD still/RB be/VB harmonised/VBN ./.

By/IN pitching/VBG the/DT percentage/NN level/NN at/IN 5/CD %/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ now/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB the/DT case/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ almost/RB certain/JJ that/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN small/JJ cacao/NN farmers/NNS in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS will/MD be/VB put/VBN at/IN a/DT disadvantage/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB heading/VBG this/DT way/NN nevertheless/RB ./.

What/WP are/VBP we/PRP actually/RB doing/VBG then/RB ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB typical/JJ of/IN a/DT policy/NN which/WDT makes/VBZ citizens/NNS wonder/VBP what/WP Brussels/NNP actually/RB does/VBZ ?/.

It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN European/JJ industry/NN is/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ here/RB than/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ principles/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ own/JJ coherences/NNS and/CC the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB shocking/JJ examples/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN sanctions/NNS and/CC embargoes/NNS ./.

Why/WRB institute/VB an/DT oil/NN boycott/NN against/IN Haiti/NNP and/CC not/RB against/IN Burma/NN ,/, where/WRB an/DT elected/VBN President/NNP is/VBZ imprisoned/VBN ,/, parliament/NN has/VBZ been/VBN sent/VBN home/RB and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT MPs/NNP have/VBP been/VBN put/VBN in/IN jail/NN or/CC even/RB murdered/VBN ?/.

Globalisation/NNP ,/, free/JJ trade/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT hegemony/NN of/IN the/DT WTO/NNP with/IN its/PRP$ internationalist/JJ philosophy/NN ,/, were/VBD imperilling/VBG the/DT very/JJ essence/NN of/IN the/DT North-South/JJ dialogue/NN ./.

So/IN we/PRP can/MD only/RB applaud/VB the/DT conclusion/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ partnership/NN agreement/NN for/IN development/NN ,/, and/CC personally/RB I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP did/VBD have/VB a/DT decisive/JJ influence/NN on/IN breaking/VBG the/DT deadlock/NN in/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS ,/, as/IN did/VBD the/DT new/JJ climate/NN created/VBN by/IN the/DT events/NNS at/IN Seattle/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, while/IN I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT renewal/NN of/IN the/DT agreements/NNS ,/, what/WP I/PRP find/VBP most/RBS interesting/JJ is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ wind/NN blowing/VBG through/IN our/PRP$ relationships/NNS and/CC finding/VBG expression/NN in/IN the/DT balanced/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS now/RB drawing/VBG to/TO a/DT close/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO have/VB finally/RB emerged/VBN from/IN the/DT old/JJ paternalist/JJ ,/, or/CC frankly/RB neo-colonialist/JJ ,/, logic/NN where/WRB those/DT giving/VBG aid/NN are/VBP all/RB too/RB eager/JJ to/TO start/VB giving/VBG lessons/NNS ,/, following/VBG a/DT formula/NN our/PRP$ friend/NN Michel/NNP Rocard/NNP is/VBZ so/RB keen/JJ on/IN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB accepted/VBN the/DT idea/NN that/IN dialogue/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB genuine/JJ or/CC effective/JJ unless/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT expression/NN of/IN a/DT contract/NN which/WDT respects/VBZ the/DT dignity/NN of/IN the/DT partners/NNS ./.

By/IN refusing/VBG to/TO allow/VB the/DT idea/NN of/IN good/JJ governance/NN to/TO become/VB a/DT tool/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN technocrats/NNS ,/, for/IN imposing/VBG new/JJ sets/NNS of/IN conditions/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ demonstrating/VBG wisdom/NN and/CC modesty/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP spent/VBN two/CD centuries/NNS laying/VBG the/DT foundations/NNS of/IN a/DT democracy/NN whose/WP$ fragility/NNS is/VBZ constantly/RB brought/VBN home/NN to/TO us/PRP by/IN events/NNS ./.

Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP prefer/VBP the/DT willingness/NN that/WDT is/VBZ clearly/RB flagged/VBN up/RP in/IN these/DT agreements/NNS to/TO extend/VB the/DT partnership/NN to/TO new/JJ agents/NNS -/: local/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS -/: which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO represent/VB the/DT only/RB possible/JJ way/NN the/DT people/NNS of/IN these/DT countries/NNS can/MD progressively/RB achieve/VB ownership/NN cooperation/NN ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN they/PRP can/MD emerge/VB from/IN humiliating/JJ and/CC childlike/JJ dependence/NN on/IN aid/NN and/CC take/VB responsibility/NN for/IN themselves/PRP ,/, the/DT proof/NN of/IN success/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT ACP-European/NNP Union/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP has/VBZ always/RB had/VBN a/DT major/JJ impact/NN ,/, undeniably/RB contributing/VBN to/TO a/DT consistent/JJ policy/NN and/CC role/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN development/NN and/CC cooperation/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP agrees/VBZ with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN that/IN combating/VBG poverty/NN continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT central/JJ objective/NN for/IN development/NN policy/NN and/CC will/MD always/RB play/VB a/DT key/JJ role/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO develop/VB ,/, the/DT countries/NNS concerned/VBN must/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, become/VB actively/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT global/JJ economic/JJ system/NN ./.

With/IN regard/VBP to/TO trade/VB with/IN our/PRP$ partners/NNS in/IN development/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ quite/RB prepared/JJ to/TO guarantee/VB that/IN any/DT new/JJ arrangement/NN will/MD take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS '/POS special/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ limitations/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB ./.

That/DT system/NN has/VBZ proved/VBN itself/PRP to/TO be/VB inappropriate/JJ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, in/IN actual/JJ fact/NN ,/, of/IN use/NN only/RB to/TO relatively/RB few/JJ of/IN the/DT 71/CD countries/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

It/PRP operates/VBZ too/RB slowly/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP therefore/RB stands/VBZ to/TO reason/VB that/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS should/MD have/VB said/VBD yes/UH to/TO the/DT new/JJ system/NN of/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, because/IN this/DT will/MD operate/VB more/JJR flexibly/NN ./.

Regarding/VBG the/DT future/JJ accession/NN of/IN countries/NNS such/JJ as/IN East/NNP Timor/NNP to/TO the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD only/RB repeat/VB what/WP I/PRP recently/RB said/VBD to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Development/NNP and/CC Cooperation/NNP ,/, namely/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT door/NN is/VBZ open/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT applicants/NNS themselves/PRP who/WP are/VBP to/TO decide/VB whether/IN they/PRP want/VBP to/TO knock/VB on/IN the/DT door/NN ./.

Once/IN they/PRP have/VBP done/VBN so/RB ,/, we/PRP shall/MD adopt/VB a/DT position/NN on/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ application/NN for/IN accession/NN to/TO the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP notes/VBZ that/IN ,/, according/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ recent/JJ declaration/NN ,/, the/DT ACP/NNP States/NNPS support/VBP Cuba/NNP '/POS s/JJ application/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO financing/VBG the/DT European/JJ Development/NNP Fund/NNP by/IN an/DT amount/NN in/IN excess/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ being/VBG considered/VBN ./.

For/IN its/PRP$ part/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP supports/VBZ this/DT ,/, but/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB at/IN this/DT point/NN produce/VB new/JJ reports/NNS on/IN the/DT whys/NNS and/CC wherefores/NNS ./.

Concerning/VBG Article/NNP 366A/CD ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB that/IN ,/, during/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS for/IN a/DT new/JJ partnership/NN agreement/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ procedure/NN was/VBD established/VBN for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN instances/NNS where/WRB human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT principles/NNS of/IN democracy/NN and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN are/VBP infringed/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ now/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, following/VBG adoption/NN of/IN the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, that/IN Parliament/NNP wishes/VBZ ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN Article/NNP 300/CD ,/, to/TO be/VB kept/VBN fully/RB informed/JJ of/IN all/DT decisions/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ decisions/NNS on/IN this/DT subject/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP no/DT plans/NNS to/TO follow/VB the/DT procedure/NN involving/VBG concurrent/JJ statements/NNS in/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN connection/NN with/IN such/JJ decisions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/VBG Patten/NNP ,/, today/NN we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG a/DT country/NN that/WDT really/RB has/VBZ suffered/VBN hard/JJ times/NNS ,/, a/DT country/NN that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, moving/JJ in/IN a/DT very/RB promising/JJ direction/NN ,/, thanks/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ own/JJ efforts/NNS and/CC resolve/NN and/CC certainly/RB also/RB thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN ./.

For/IN it/PRP is/VBZ no/DT small/JJ thing/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT minority/NN of/IN 33/CD %/NN or/CC even/RB 35/CD %/NN in/IN one/CD '/POS s/JJ own/JJ country/NN ./.

That/DT country/NN and/CC its/PRP$ politicians/NNS -/: no/DT doubt/NN with/IN some/DT differences/NNS here/RB and/CC there/RB -/: have/VBP always/RB done/VBN very/RB good/JJ work/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP should/MD recognise/VB that/DT ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ proposing/VBG that/IN we/PRP should/MD conclude/VB an/DT agreement/NN jointly/RB with/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Let/VB me/PRP make/VB a/DT few/JJ comments/NNS on/IN aspects/NNS on/IN which/WDT views/NNS may/MD differ/VB somewhat/RB ,/, although/IN ,/, even/RB in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO strongly/RB emphasise/VB and/CC acknowledge/VB Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP '/POS s/JJ activities/NNS and/CC interest/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO FYROM/NNP and/CC the/DT region/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT regional/JJ approach/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ understood/VBN properly/RB ,/, the/DT regional/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ both/DT important/JJ and/CC necessary/JJ ./.

There/EX has/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT willingness/NN to/TO cooperate/VB ./.

Provided/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB seen/VBN as/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN constraint/NN but/CC as/RB a/DT willingness/NN to/TO cooperate/VB ,/, as/IN an/DT opportunity/NN that/IN each/DT country/NN should/MD grasp/VB ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ the/DT right/JJ approach/NN ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP look/VBP at/IN FYROM/NNP ,/, we/PRP can/MD see/VB how/WRB very/RB difficult/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO cooperate/VB economically/RB with/IN some/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Kosovo/NNP and/CC Albania/NNP ,/, or/CC to/TO cooperate/VB politically/RB with/IN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, cooperation/NN with/IN Bulgaria/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ with/IN Greece/NNP ,/, has/VBZ made/VBN good/JJ progress/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP should/MD acknowledge/VB that/DT too/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD consider/VB ,/, as/IN it/PRP began/VBD to/TO do/VB early/RB this/DT week/NN ,/, how/WRB to/TO include/VB the/DT neighbouring/VBG Yugoslavia/NN in/IN regional/JJ cooperation/NN in/IN spite/NN of/IN everything/NN ,/, i.e./VBG without/IN taking/VBG back/RP any/DT of/IN our/PRP$ criticism/NN of/IN this/DT terrible/JJ regime/NN ./.

Tomorrow/JJ morning/NN I/PRP will/MD therefore/RB table/VB an/DT amendment/NN urging/VBG that/IN we/PRP concentrate/VBP the/DT sanctions/NNS on/IN the/DT regime/NN itself/PRP while/IN easing/VBG them/PRP somewhat/RB for/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC for/IN the/DT economy/NN in/IN a/DT spirit/NN of/IN economic/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, this/DT regional/JJ approach/NN ,/, provided/VBN it/PRP is/VBZ understood/VBN correctly/RB ,/, i.e./RB as/IN a/DT method/NN of/IN contributing/VBG to/TO economic/JJ recovery/NN in/IN the/DT region/NN itself/PRP ,/, is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN the/DT right/JJ one/NN to/TO adopt/VB ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, it/PRP must/MD not/RB be/VB perceived/VBN as/IN a/DT constraint/NN nor/CC must/MD it/PRP be/VB set/VBN as/IN a/DT precondition/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP say/VBP quite/RB clearly/RB and/CC plainly/RB that/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO open/VB the/DT way/NN to/TO and/CC offer/VB FYROM/NNP accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ view/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB an/DT illusion/NN to/TO think/VB there/EX was/VBD any/DT point/NN in/IN FYROM/NNP applying/VBG for/IN accession/NN right/RB now/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP would/MD also/RB be/VB wrong/JJ to/TO delay/VB discussing/VBG it/PRP until/IN some/DT later/JJ date/NN ./.

FYROM/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO be/VB told/VBN here/RB and/CC now/RB that/IN ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, accession/NN will/MD be/VB possible/JJ when/WRB the/DT time/NN is/VBZ right/JJ ./.

This/DT country/NN is/VBZ afraid/JJ it/PRP will/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT sense/NN sidelined/VBN ./.

It/PRP sees/VBZ ,/, in/IN the/DT whole/JJ readjustment/NN of/IN aid/NN instruments/NNS ,/, a/DT risk/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB the/DT last/JJ carriage/NN of/IN a/DT train/NN heading/VBG towards/IN Europe/NNP but/CC that/IN this/DT train/NN will/MD continue/VB through/IN Europe/NNP while/IN leaving/VBG FYROM/NNP on/IN a/DT siding/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP understands/VBZ that/DT too/RB ./.

So/CC I/PRP very/RB strongly/RB urge/VBP him/PRP to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ in/IN the/DT appropriate/JJ talks/NNS ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, so/RB far/RB at/IN least/JJS ,/, FYROM/NNP has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN using/VBG the/DT various/JJ instruments/NNS properly/RB ./.

Even/RB though/IN there/EX will/MD of/IN course/NN be/VB readjustments/JJ here/RB ,/, FYROM/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO show/VB that/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT tasks/NNS that/WDT are/VBP still/RB being/VBG dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN Brussels/NNP today/NN can/MD in/IN future/NN be/VB handled/VBN in/IN Skopje/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT country/NN itself/PRP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Members/NNS will/MD agree/VB to/TO support/VB these/DT proposals/NNS as/IN a/DT sign/NN of/IN goodwill/NN towards/IN FYROM/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, since/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT Yugoslav/NNP wars/NNS ,/, the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP -/: I/PRP prefer/VBP to/TO use/VB this/DT abbreviation/NN -/: has/VBZ behaved/VBD as/IN a/DT constructive/JJ peace-keeper/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT governments/NNS of/IN Macedonia/NNP and/CC Bosnia/NNP and/CC Herzegovina/NNP at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD non-violent/JJ liberalisation/NN and/CC a/DT non-violent/JJ separation/NN from/IN the/DT Yugoslav/NNP federal/JJ structure/NN in/IN view/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB ,/, our/PRP$ Macedonian/JJ friends/NNS have/VBP always/RB played/VBN a/DT very/RB positive/JJ role/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN this/DT reason/NN that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB pointed/VBN out/RP at/IN this/DT stage/NN that/IN Macedonia/NNP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT pawn/NN in/IN our/PRP$ so-called/JJ strive/NN towards/IN stability/NN ,/, but/CC actually/RB took/VBD the/DT initiative/NN ./.

The/DT former/JJ President/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Gligorov/NNP ,/, can/MD take/VB special/JJ credit/NN for/IN this/DT ,/, and/CC the/DT current/JJ President/NNP too/RB has/VBZ already/RB adopted/VBN the/DT profile/NN of/IN President/NNP of/IN all/DT Macedonian/NNP citizens/NNS ,/, so/RB much/RB so/RB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD only/RB be/VB grateful/JJ to/TO have/VB him/PRP as/IN interlocutor/NN in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

Despite/IN the/DT obvious/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN any/DT internal/JJ tension/NN ,/, both/DT population/NN groups/NNS have/VBP struck/VBN a/DT reasonable/JJ modus/NN vivendi/NN and/CC the/DT outlook/NN for/IN reaching/VBG a/DT sound/JJ solution/NN to/TO the/DT remaining/VBG problems/NNS is/VBZ good/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, in/IN Macedonia/NNP that/IN I/PRP heard/VBD at/IN the/DT time/NN about/IN the/DT Roma/NNP population/NN actually/RB not/RB having/VBG too/RB bad/JJ a/DT time/NN there/RB ./.

I/PRP was/VBD unaccustomed/JJ to/TO hearing/VBG this/DT type/NN of/IN comment/NN about/IN the/DT Roma/NNP in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT problems/NNS afflicting/VBG Macedonia/NNP ,/, higher/JJR education/NN for/IN the/DT Albanian-speaking/JJ citizens/NNS deserves/VBZ our/PRP$ special/JJ attention/NN ./.

Accessible/RB higher/JJR education/NN ,/, with/IN which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP a/DT certain/JJ affinity/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ instrument/NN in/IN the/DT emancipation/NN of/IN population/NN groups/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG from/IN personal/JJ experience/NN as/IN someone/NN who/WP attended/VBD the/DT Protestant/JJ university/NN in/IN Amsterdam/NNP ./.

I/PRP might/MD never/RB have/VB studied/VBN otherwise/RB ./.

Such/PDT an/DT affinity/NN and/CC this/DT type/NN of/IN higher/JJR education/NN is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT constitutional/JJ state/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT aptly/RB termed/RB mainstream/JJ society/NN which/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB strengthened/VBN in/IN countries/NNS like/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP should/MD partly/RB compensate/VB for/IN the/DT damage/NN which/WDT this/DT country/NN incurred/VBD following/VBG the/DT boycott/NN we/PRP instituted/VBD against/IN Serbia/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN no/DT cost/NN to/TO us/PRP but/CC costs/VBZ Serbia/NNP '/POS s/VBZ neighbouring/VBG states/NNS all/PDT the/DT more/JJR ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB beneficial/JJ if/IN we/PRP could/MD reorganise/VB this/DT ,/, especially/RB vis-脙/JJ -/: vis/VBG the/DT neighbouring/VBG states/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB fair/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD regulate/VB aid/NN to/TO Macedonia/NNP properly/RB now/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB quite/RB prepared/VBN to/TO support/VB the/DT liberals/NNS '/POS amendment/NN to/TO keep/VB aid/NN independent/JJ from/IN the/DT donor/NN states/NNS '/POS interests/NNS ,/, for/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO give/VB industry/NN in/IN Macedonia/NNP and/CC the/DT region/NN the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ opportunities/NNS with/IN the/DT aid/NN money/NN available/JJ for/IN reconstruction/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP more/RBR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO include/VB Bulgaria/NNP and/CC Romania/NNP in/IN this/DT ,/, as/IN it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP a/DT tactical/JJ and/CC psychological/JJ error/NN only/RB to/TO talk/VB about/RB the/DT five/CD countries/NNS of/IN former/JJ Yugoslavia/NNP ,/, plus/CC Albania/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO us/PRP that/IN the/DT economies/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN can/MD stand/VB on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ two/CD feet/NNS again/RB ,/, which/WDT can/MD quite/RB easily/RB be/VB done/VBN with/IN the/DT aid/NN money/NN ./.

The/DT agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP should/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT door/NN opening/VBG to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, allowing/VBG this/DT country/NN to/TO join/VB ,/, even/RB though/IN this/DT will/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN in/IN the/DT foreseeable/JJ future/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, we/PRP constantly/RB need/VBP to/TO start/VB from/IN the/DT premise/NN in/IN our/PRP$ policy/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ desirable/JJ for/IN Macedonian/NNP legislation/NN to/TO resemble/VB that/DT of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ policy/NN should/MD reflect/VB this/DT ,/, even/RB in/IN the/DT naming/NN of/IN aid/NN programmes/NNS for/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD quote/VB the/DT PHARE/JJ programme/NN as/IN an/DT example/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT name/NN of/IN the/DT republic/NN is/VBZ still/RB a/DT problem/NN on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT Greek/JJ sensitivities/NNS surrounding/VBG it/PRP ./.

I/PRP assume/VBP that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS will/MD feel/VB increasingly/RB freer/JJR to/TO use/VB the/DT name/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ language/NN which/WDT fits/VBZ the/DT republic/NN ./.

If/IN certain/JJ countries/NNS wish/VBP to/TO use/VB the/DT words/NNS ``/`` former/JJ Yugoslavia/NNS ''/'' ,/, then/RB that/DT is/VBZ their/PRP$ business/NN ;/: others/NNS need/VBP not/RB feel/VB obliged/JJ to/TO copy/VB them/PRP ./.

It/PRP will/MD not/RB do/VB to/TO keep/VB us/PRP under/IN constant/JJ pressure/NN ./.

Hence/RB my/PRP$ support/NN for/IN the/DT sound/NN report/VBP by/IN Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP ;/: we/PRP have/VBP come/VBN to/TO expect/VB nothing/NN less/RBR of/IN him/PRP ,/, and/CC hence/RB also/RB my/PRP$ words/NNS of/IN appreciation/NN for/IN the/DT respected/VBN Republic/NN of/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VB me/PRP begin/VB by/IN expressing/VBG my/PRP$ personal/JJ appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN as/IN rapporteur/NN ./.

Today/NN we/PRP are/VBP expressing/VBG a/DT positive/JJ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS for/IN a/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

We/PRP do/VBP so/RB in/IN the/DT awareness/NN that/IN this/DT decision/NN ,/, the/DT very/RB first/JJ relating/NN to/TO that/DT area/NN ,/, is/VBZ actually/RB set/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN an/DT entirely/RB new/JJ phase/NN of/IN our/PRP$ relations/NNS with/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

This/DT new/JJ phase/NN ,/, or/CC rather/RB policy/NN ,/, identifies/VBZ the/DT prospect/NN of/IN integrating/VBG the/DT region/NN into/IN Europe/NNP as/IN the/DT only/JJ option/NN for/IN settling/VBG its/PRP$ conflicts/NNS peacefully/RB ./.

And/CC there/EX are/VBP several/JJ reasons/NNS why/WRB our/PRP$ opinion/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB positive/JJ ./.

As/IN we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO ascertain/VB during/IN our/PRP$ missions/NNS to/TO Skopje/NNP ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN considerable/JJ progress/NN in/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslav/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP ,/, as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT economy/NN ,/, movement/NN towards/IN democracy/NN and/CC -/: an/DT area/NN which/WDT is/VBZ difficult/JJ and/CC contentious/JJ enough/RB in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS -/: multi-ethnic/JJ coexistence/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT price/NN Macedonia/NN has/VBZ been/VBN paying/VBG for/IN the/DT war/NN in/IN neighbouring/VBG Kosovo/NNP is/VBZ very/RB high/JJ ,/, both/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN logistic/JJ availability/NN of/IN NATO/NNP forces/NNS and/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN reduced/VBN exports/NNS to/TO Northern/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP conclude/VBP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, by/IN affirming/VBG that/IN this/DT progress/NN is/VBZ indeed/RB difficult/JJ ,/, fragile/JJ ,/, and/CC uncertain/JJ and/CC it/PRP calls/VBZ for/IN constant/JJ vigilance/NN on/IN our/PRP$ part/NN during/IN the/DT various/JJ stages/NNS of/IN close/JJ and/CC precise/JJ inspection/NN that/WDT have/VBP long/RB been/VBN advocated/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP rise/VBP to/TO express/VB the/DT warmth/NN and/CC optimism/NN with/IN which/WDT the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/NNP ,/, Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP welcomes/VBZ the/DT start/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS with/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslav/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP extremely/RB hopeful/JJ that/IN ,/, along/IN the/DT lines/NNS set/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP ,/, this/DT agreement/NN can/MD represent/VB an/DT example/NN to/TO be/VB rapidly/RB extended/VBN to/TO the/DT other/JJ countries/NNS ,/, especially/RB Albania/NNP ,/, Bosnia/NNP and/CC Herzegovina/NNP ,/, Croatia/NNP ,/, Montenegro/NNP and/CC Kosovo/NNP and/CC ,/, as/RB soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ,/, Serbia/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN that/DT quasi-provocative/JJ spirit/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP presented/VBN an/DT amendment/NN suggesting/VBG the/DT transfer/NN of/IN responsibility/NN for/IN south-east/JJ Europe/NNP from/IN Foreign/NNP Affairs/NNPS to/TO Enlargement/NNP ./.

But/CC if/IN the/DT development/NN in/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN a/DT more/RBR democratic/JJ society/NN and/CC largely/RB market-based/JJ economy/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB encouraged/VBN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN immediate/JJ and/CC concrete/JJ steps/NNS must/MD be/VB taken/VBN to/TO intensify/VB the/DT struggle/NN against/IN corruption/NN and/CC to/TO make/VB international/JJ aid/NN more/RBR effective/JJ for/IN reconstruction/NN and/CC development/NN ./.

With/IN this/DT in/IN mind/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP presented/VBN some/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT I/PRP hope/VBP Parliament/NNP will/MD accept/VB ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT former/JJ Yugoslav/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP should/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN ,/, with/IN adequate/JJ financial/JJ support/NN ,/, to/TO gradually/RB link/VB its/PRP$ currency/NN to/TO the/DT euro/NN as/IN the/DT first/JJ step/NN towards/IN the/DT Europeanisation/NNP of/IN the/DT whole/JJ Macedonian/NNP economy/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT additional/JJ aim/NN of/IN eliminating/VBG any/DT possible/JJ corruption/NN in/IN the/DT banking/NN system/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, world/NN aid/NN and/CC assistance/NN coming/VBG into/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, and/CC hence/RB into/IN Macedonia/NNP as/RB well/RB ,/, should/MD be/VB clearly/RB multilateral/JJ ,/, and/CC should/MD not/RB subject/VB the/DT beneficiary/NN country/NN to/TO direct/JJ obligations/NNS towards/IN the/DT donor/NN country/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, we/PRP hope/VBP the/DT agreement/NN can/MD achieve/VB all/PDT its/PRP$ objectives/NNS but/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB delude/VB ourselves/PRP that/IN peace/NN ,/, stability/NN and/CC prosperity/NN in/IN south-east/JJ Europe/NNP can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN without/IN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT very/JJ wide-ranging/JJ problems/NNS we/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO eliminate/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT war/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP has/VBZ knocked/VBN everything/NN off/IN balance/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB true/JJ for/IN the/DT relations/NNS between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT western/JJ Balkans/NNS ./.

Since/IN then/RB ,/, expectations/NNS have/VBP been/VBN high/JJ ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ to/TO them/PRP and/CC us/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ true/JJ on/IN their/PRP$ part/NN because/IN -/: whether/IN we/PRP like/VBP it/PRP or/CC not/RB -/: they/PRP are/VBP asking/VBG us/PRP for/IN direct/JJ aid/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP wondering/VBG what/WP Europe/NNP wants/VBZ from/IN them/PRP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ?/.

Is/VBZ there/EX any/DT prospect/NN of/IN membership/NN ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ on/IN their/PRP$ minds/NNS ./.

But/CC here/RB too/RB ,/, within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, expectations/NNS are/VBP high/JJ ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP things/NNS properly/RB ,/, this/DT may/MD well/RB be/VB a/DT first/JJ taster/NN of/IN a/DT genuine/JJ common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN ./.

Will/MD the/DT Union/NNP manage/VB to/TO display/VB a/DT united/VBN front/NN and/CC develop/VB a/DT common/JJ policy/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, concerning/VBG such/PDT a/DT difficult/JJ regulation/NN ?/.

It/PRP also/RB remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen/VBN whether/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ learnt/VBN any/DT lessons/NNS from/IN the/DT bad/JJ experiences/NNS in/IN Bosnia/NNP when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO providing/VBG aid/NN and/CC the/DT slightly/RB better/JJR experiences/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

Can/RB we/PRP ,/, based/VBN on/IN the/DT experiences/NNS in/IN Macedonia/NNP and/CC in/IN four/CD other/JJ countries/NNS ,/, improve/VBP on/IN this/DT ?/.

Against/IN this/DT background/NN of/IN extremely/RB high/JJ expectations/NNS ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP exaggerating/VBG if/IN I/PRP say/VBP that/IN this/DT first/JJ step/NN ,/, namely/RB the/DT stability/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP ,/, is/VBZ vitally/RB important/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ only/JJ contribution/NN ./.

The/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP ,/, the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT CARA/NNP programme/NN and/CC the/DT financing/NN arrangements/NNS in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN are/VBP all/RB pending/VBG ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreements/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB a/DT medium-term/JJ issue/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT first/JJ agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP is/VBZ so/RB crucial/JJ ,/, because/IN it/PRP serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT model/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN on/IN the/DT oil/NN slick/NN off/IN the/DT French/JJ coast/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP de/FW Palacio/NNP will/MD open/VB the/DT debate/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB speaking/VBG on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT PPE-DE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB as/IN an/DT elected/VBN representative/NN for/IN Brittany/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB directly/RB concerned/JJ and/CC shocked/JJ by/IN these/DT events/NNS ./.

Together/RB with/IN Mrs/NNP Grosset脙陋te/NNP and/CC the/DT PPE-DE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, we/PRP tabled/VBD a/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP today/NN arrived/VBN at/IN a/DT compromise/NN motion/NN ./.

A/DT disaster/NN of/IN this/DT scale/NN could/MD almost/RB certainly/RB not/RB have/VB occurred/VBN along/IN the/DT American/JJ coastline/NN ,/, and/CC why/WRB ?/.

If/IN ,/, I/PRP repeat/VB ,/, we/PRP had/VBD had/VBN regulations/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT disaster/NN would/MD surely/RB not/RB have/VB occurred/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT applicable/JJ legislation/NN must/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN ,/, particularly/RB the/DT 1992/CD protocol/NN which/WDT has/VBZ exempted/VBN the/DT shipowners/NNS ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN the/DT oil/NN tanker/NN charterer/NN ,/, from/IN any/DT liability/NN ./.

Well/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT charterer/NN is/VBZ exonerated/JJ ,/, then/RB of/IN course/NN he/PRP is/VBZ less/RBR concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT inspections/NNS which/WDT oil/NN companies/NNS are/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN ./.

The/DT regulations/NNS must/MD therefore/RB be/VB reviewed/VBN ,/, and/CC I/PRP thank/VBP you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, for/IN highlighting/VBG the/DT inadequate/JJ features/NNS of/IN current/JJ European/JJ regulations/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, as/IN you/PRP said/VBD ,/, monitoring/NN must/MD above/IN all/DT be/VB stepped/VBN up/IN :/: that/DT of/IN the/DT flag/NN state/NN ,/, that/DT of/IN the/DT classification/NN societies/NNS ./.

You/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/IN RINA/NNP was/VBD an/DT Italian/JJ classification/NN register/NN recognised/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT conditions/NNS for/IN this/DT recognition/NN ?/.

What/WDT guarantees/NN are/VBP there/EX of/IN its/PRP$ reliability/NN ?/.

You/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO commission/VB a/DT fact-finding/JJ mission/NN ./.

We/PRP await/VBP the/DT outcome/NN with/IN great/JJ interest/NN ./.

Inspections/NNS by/IN the/DT maritime/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC supervision/NN within/IN European/JJ ports/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB tightened/VBN up/RP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT Paris/NNP Memorandum/NNP in/IN existence/NN ,/, let/VBD me/PRP remind/VB you/PRP ,/, which/WDT stipulates/VBZ a/DT minimum/NN for/IN inspection/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, one/CD in/IN four/CD of/IN the/DT vessels/NNS putting/VBG into/IN European/JJ ports/NNS must/MD be/VB inspected/VBN by/IN the/DT maritime/JJ authorities/NNS of/IN the/DT country/NN concerned/VBN ./.

This/DT obligation/NN is/VBZ not/RB respected/VBN either/CC in/IN France/NNP or/CC in/IN many/JJ other/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Why/WRB not/RB ?/.

What/WP conclusions/VBD has/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP already/RB drawn/VBN or/CC what/WP conclusions/NNS is/VBZ it/PRP going/VBG to/TO draw/VB ?/.

I/PRP also/RB think/VBP it/PRP essential/JJ to/TO step/VB up/RP the/DT level/NN of/IN inspection/NN that/IN the/DT charterer/NN is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT oil/NN company/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT charterer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN entails/VBZ a/DT financial/JJ commitment/NN ,/, then/RB doubtless/VBD the/DT inspection/NN will/MD be/VB enforced/VBN to/TO a/DT greater/JJR extent/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP some/DT coordination/NN of/IN national/JJ maritime/NN authorities/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN European/JJ facility/NN comparable/JJ to/TO the/DT coastguards/NNS who/WP supervise/VBP the/DT coasts/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT environment/NN colleagues/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ group/NN who/WP approached/VBD this/DT particular/JJ problem/NN jointly/RB with/IN their/PRP$ transport/NN team/NN ./.

This/DT disaster/NN is/VBZ both/PDT a/DT transport/NN and/CC environmental/JJ one/NN and/CC is/VBZ not/RB confined/VBN to/TO one/CD area/NN ./.

Here/RB we/PRP are/VBP here/RB again/RB in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP discussing/VBG yet/RB another/DT maritime/JJ disaster/NN ./.

I/PRP could/MD reel/VB off/RP the/DT list/NN of/IN disasters/NNS that/WDT have/VBP afflicted/VBN this/DT industry/NN in/IN my/PRP$ 10/CD years/NNS in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP but/CC I/PRP only/RB have/VBP three/CD minutes/NNS ./.

How/WRB many/JJ more/JJR Erikas/NNP do/VBP we/PRP have/VB to/TO endure/VB before/IN the/DT powers/NNS that/IN be/VB deliver/VB to/TO us/PRP a/DT proper/JJ port/JJ state/NN control/NN that/WDT is/VBZ effective/JJ throughout/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, not/RB just/RB certain/JJ areas/NNS of/IN it/PRP ?/.

How/WRB much/JJ more/JJR pollution/NNS do/VBP we/PRP have/VB to/TO endure/VB before/IN the/DT industry/NN delivers/VBZ us/PRP tankers/NNS with/IN segregated/JJ tanks/NNS and/CC double/RB holds/VBZ ?/.

How/WRB many/JJ more/JJR seabirds/NNS are/VBP to/TO die/VB before/IN shipping/VBG companies/NNS end/VB the/DT practice/NN of/IN cleaning/VBG their/PRP$ tanks/NNS at/IN sea/NN which/WDT ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ resolution/NN points/VBZ out/RP ,/, causes/VBZ far/RB more/JJR pollution/NN than/IN any/DT Erika-type/JJ disaster/NN ?/.

While/IN I/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN some/DT progress/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN in/IN areas/NNS like/IN port/JJ state/NN control/NN and/CC minimal/JJ crewing/NN standards/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP still/RB faced/VBN with/IN what/WP our/PRP$ late/JJ colleague/NN Ken/NNP Stewart/NNP used/VBD to/TO call/VB `/`` ships/NNS of/IN shame/NN sailing/VBG in/RP and/CC out/RP of/IN our/PRP$ European/JJ Union/NNP waters/NNS :/: rust/NN buckets/NNS badly/RB crewed/JJ '/'' ./.

We/PRP need/VBP the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO act/VB quickly/RB and/CC decisively/RB ./.

We/PRP need/VBP our/PRP$ governments/NNS to/TO put/VB up/RP the/DT financial/JJ resources/NNS needed/VBN to/TO give/VB us/PRP effective/JJ control/NN and/CC we/PRP need/VBP them/PRP also/RB to/TO stop/VB dragging/VBG their/PRP$ feet/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO maritime/VB safety/NN ./.

In/IN reality/NN we/PRP can/MD never/RB stop/VB accidents/NNS happening/VBG at/IN sea/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ incumbent/JJ upon/IN us/PRP all/RB to/TO learn/VB the/DT lessons/NNS whenever/WRB an/DT incident/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN takes/VBZ place/NN and/CC apply/VB those/DT lessons/NNS to/TO reduce/VB risks/NNS in/IN future/NN ./.

The/DT ``/`` Erika/NN ''/'' incident/NN was/VBD serious/JJ especially/RB for/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Brittany/NNP most/RBS closely/RB affected/VBN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD devastating/JJ for/IN the/DT wildlife/NN of/IN much/RB of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Some/DT say/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT worst/JJS accident/NN that/WDT has/VBZ ever/RB befallen/VBN the/DT bird/NN life/NN of/IN this/DT part/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Royal/NNP Society/NNP for/IN the/DT Protection/NNP of/IN Birds/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN as/RB many/JJ as/IN 400,000/CD birds/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB mainly/RB guillemots/NNS ,/, may/MD have/VB died/VBN ./.

The/DT pictures/NNS many/DT of/IN us/PRP will/MD have/VB seen/VBN of/IN oil-soaked/JJ birds/NNS being/VBG put/VBN down/RP by/IN veterinary/JJ officials/NNS were/VBD both/DT distressing/JJ and/CC tragic/JJ ./.

We/PRP all/DT want/VBP the/DT highest/JJS standards/NNS for/IN ships/NNS whatever/WDT flag/VBD they/PRP may/MD be/VB flying/VBG ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO enforce/VB the/DT regulations/NNS and/CC ensure/VB that/IN the/DT ``/`` polluter/JJ pays/NN ''/'' principle/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN so/RB that/IN financial/JJ penalties/NNS and/CC some/DT incentives/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO put/VB pressure/NN on/IN both/DT ship/NN operators/NNS and/CC oil/NN companies/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN best/JJS practice/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN every/DT word/NN the/DT Commissioner/NNP said/VBD in/IN her/PRP$ remarks/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT question/NN is/VBZ ,/, how/WRB long/RB will/MD it/PRP take/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN measures/NNS are/VBP introduced/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT problem/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN she/PRP proposes/VBZ ?/.

The/DT thought/NN of/IN an/DT incident/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN occurring/VBG in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN should/MD concentrate/VB her/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC the/DT minds/NNS of/IN her/PRP$ officials/NNS wonderfully/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP brought/VBN you/PRP a/DT small/JJ gift/NN ./.

Here/RB is/VBZ a/DT cake/NN of/IN oil/NN sent/VBN by/IN someone/NN living/NN on/IN the/DT French/JJ island/NN of/IN Noirmoutier/NNP who/WP wrote/VBD to/TO me/PRP as/IN follows/VBZ :/: ``/`` With/IN every/DT tide/NN ,/, the/DT beach/NN is/VBZ covered/VBN with/IN heavy/JJ fuel/NN oil/NN which/WDT has/VBZ leaked/VBN out/RP of/IN the/DT Erika/NNP ./.

With/IN every/DT tide/NN ,/, the/DT volunteers/NNS ,/, members/NNS of/IN the/DT armed/VBN forces/NNS and/CC firemen/NNS remove/VB great/JJ pancakes/NNS of/IN this/DT thick/JJ ,/, sticky/JJ ,/, black/JJ tar/NN ./.

When/WRB will/MD we/PRP see/VB a/DT return/NN to/TO cleanliness/NN and/CC the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT devastating/JJ accident/NN ?/. ''/'' ./.

Indeed/RB this/DT disaster/NN involving/VBG the/DT Erika/NNP ,/, like/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT Russian/JJ vessel/NN in/IN Turkey/NNP ,/, moreover/RB ,/, is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ and/CC intolerable/JJ at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB the/DT ultimate/JJ hi-tech/JJ technology/NN is/VBZ available/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ all/PDT the/DT more/RBR unacceptable/JJ for/IN such/PDT a/DT thing/NN to/TO occur/VB twenty/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP disaster/NN ,/, despite/IN our/PRP$ saying/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN and/CC many/JJ times/NNS since/IN ,/, ``/`` Never/RB again/RB !/. ''/'' ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN policies/NNS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB our/PRP$ responsibility/NN ,/, to/TO guarantee/VB the/DT safety/NN of/IN sea/NN transport/NN ./.

We/PRP absolutely/RB have/VBP to/TO guarantee/VB our/PRP$ citizens/NNS that/IN a/DT disaster/NN of/IN this/DT type/NN will/MD never/RB happen/VB again/RB ./.

But/CC ,/, listening/VBG to/TO you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP somewhat/RB frustrated/JJ because/IN anyone/NN already/RB involved/VBN in/IN these/DT matters/NNS knows/VBZ that/IN in/IN 1992/CD ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP drew/VBD up/RP a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ text/NN which/WDT already/RB contained/VBD all/PDT the/DT proposals/NNS included/VBD in/IN the/DT resolution/NN drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT transport/NN committee/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD say/VB and/CC keep/VB saying/VBG that/IN the/DT Erika/NNP is/VBZ one/CD disaster/NN too/RB many/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO undertake/VB a/DT radical/JJ review/NN of/IN its/PRP$ directives/NNS on/IN sea/NN transport/NN to/TO make/VB them/PRP more/RBR restrictive/JJ and/CC to/TO establish/VB clear/JJ and/CC specific/JJ regulations/NNS determining/VBG the/DT responsibilities/NNS of/IN the/DT owners/NNS of/IN the/DT cargoes/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD be/VB aware/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN Shell/NNP and/CC British/NNP Petroleum/NNP refused/VBD to/TO use/VB the/DT Erika/NNP to/TO transport/VB their/PRP$ oil/NN ./.

Why/WRB ,/, in/IN these/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, is/VBZ the/DT liability/NN of/IN Total/NNP as/IN charterer/NN not/RB recognised/VBN ?/.

Your/PRP$ proposals/NNS must/MD also/RB include/VB making/VBG double/JJ hulls/NNS mandatory/JJ and/CC enforcing/VBG observance/NN ,/, at/IN last/JJ ,/, of/IN the/DT ban/NN on/IN degassing/VBG at/IN sea/NN ./.

A/DT European/JJ inspection/NN body/NN must/MD be/VB established/VBN which/WDT can/MD monitor/VB the/DT condition/NN of/IN vessels/NNS effectively/RB and/CC efficiently/RB ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB essential/JJ for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO undertake/VB to/TO reform/VB the/DT IMO/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

What/WDT point/NN is/VBZ there/RB in/IN issuing/VBG restrictive/JJ directives/NNS if/IN ,/, once/IN they/PRP are/VBP at/IN sea/NN ,/, most/JJS vessels/NNS do/VBP just/RB what/WP they/PRP wish/VBP ?/.

Finally/RB ,/, a/DT compassionate/NN thought/VBD for/IN all/PDT the/DT volunteers/NNS ,/, nature/NN lovers/NNS and/CC bird/NN lovers/NNS ,/, who/WP spontaneously/RB and/CC generously/RB are/VBP coming/VBG through/RP to/TO the/DT aid/NN of/IN the/DT oil-covered/JJ birds/NNS ,/, organising/VBG rescue/NN operation/NN with/IN the/DT means/NNS available/JJ ./.

I/PRP can/MD testify/VB to/TO this/DT remarkable/JJ work/NN ./.

You/PRP are/VBP no/DT doubt/NN aware/JJ that/IN approximately/RB 200/CD 000/CD birds/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO die/VB as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT oil/NN slick/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ ecological/JJ disaster/NN ,/, practically/RB unprecedented/JJ in/IN scale/NN ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT ,/, you/PRP are/VBP no/DT doubt/NN also/RB aware/JJ how/WRB difficult/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ nowadays/RB to/TO preserve/VB natural/JJ species/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN natural/JJ spaces/NNS ./.

And/CC ,/, on/IN this/DT subject/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, you/PRP did/VBD not/RB mention/VB how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO contribute/VB to/TO the/DT restoration/NN of/IN the/DT natural/JJ environment/NN and/CC the/DT natural/JJ habitats/NNS ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB no/RB clearly/RB defined/VBN party/NN responsible/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ nature/NN that/WDT is/VBZ taking/VBG the/DT rap/NN ,/, as/IN always/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN asked/VBD that/IN this/DT debate/NN be/VB set/VBN up/RP in/IN order/NN to/TO provide/VB Parliament/NNP with/IN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO express/VB its/PRP$ solidarity/NN with/IN the/DT people/NNS directly/RB affected/VBN by/IN this/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN ,/, affected/VBD both/DT in/IN terms/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ economic/JJ activities/NNS and/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ attachment/NN to/TO their/PRP$ natural/JJ environment/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP ,/, in/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, welcome/VB the/DT presence/NN in/IN the/DT visitors/NNS '/POS gallery/NN of/IN Mrs/NNP Javette-Le/NNP Besque/NNP ,/, spokesperson/NN for/IN the/DT oil/NN slick/NN action/NN group/NN ``/`` Mar脙/NNP 漏/NNP e/NNP noire/VBP ''/'' ,/, made/VBN up/RP of/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS from/IN the/DT French/JJ department/NN of/IN Morbihan/NNP ./.

Many/JJ volunteers/NNS from/IN France/NNP and/CC other/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS have/VBP expressed/VBN their/PRP$ solidarity/NN by/IN lending/VBG a/DT hand/NN to/TO the/DT victims/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ proposals/NNS are/VBP particularly/RB concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS ./.

Among/IN those/DT inspected/VBN and/CC found/VBN to/TO be/VB in/IN contravention/NN of/IN regulations/NNS last/JJ year/NN ,/, 15/CD were/VBD at/IN least/JJS 20/CD years/NNS old/JJ and/CC some/DT were/VBD 30/CD and/CC more/JJR ./.

This/DT is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR tolerable/JJ ./.

Next/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT International/NNP Transport/NNP Federation/NNP ,/, over/IN 40/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT ships/NNS wrecked/VBD in/IN 1998/CD were/VBD sailing/VBG under/IN flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ,/, the/DT symbol/NN of/IN profit/NN and/CC the/DT exploitation/NN of/IN human/JJ beings/NNS at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN safety/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR tolerable/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN transparency/NN ./.

Everything/NNP is/VBZ done/VBN to/TO make/VB the/DT lines/NNS of/IN responsibility/NN ,/, the/DT identity/NN of/IN the/DT owners/NNS and/CC real/JJ decision-makers/NNS as/IN impenetrable/JJ as/RB possible/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR tolerable/JJ ./.

In/IN all/PDT these/DT respects/NNS we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB real/JJ ,/, significant/JJ change/NN ,/, including/VBG setting/VBG a/DT time/NN limit/NN for/IN the/DT switch/NN to/TO new/JJ standards/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT mandatory/JJ double/JJ hull/NN ,/, on/IN pain/NN of/IN being/VBG banned/VBN from/IN the/DT ports/NNS or/CC the/DT territorial/JJ waters/NNS of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB ensure/VB increased/VBN strictness/NNS both/DT in/IN issuing/VBG sea-worthiness/JJ certificates/NNS and/CC in/IN monitoring/NN the/DT condition/NN and/CC the/DT maintenance/NN of/IN vessels/NNS ./.

Finally/RB we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN all/PDT the/DT parties/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN disasters/NNS contribute/VBP to/TO repairing/VBG the/DT damage/NN caused/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG specifically/RB of/IN Total-Fina/NNP in/IN the/DT present/JJ instance/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT approach/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP can/MD develop/VB with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT International/NNP Maritime/NNP Organisation/NNP ./.

In/IN so/RB doing/VBG ,/, it/PRP will/MD have/VB proved/VBN its/PRP$ usefulness/NN to/TO public/JJ opinion/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN this/DT instance/NN ,/, is/VBZ awaiting/VBG clear/JJ ,/, tangible/JJ action/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT emergency/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT ordeal/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN a/DT magnificent/JJ display/NN of/IN solidarity/NN :/: local/JJ solidarity/NN ,/, national/JJ solidarity/NN ,/, and/CC intergovernmental/JJ solidarity/NN ./.

Quite/VBG clearly/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP now/RB paying/VBG the/DT price/NN for/IN our/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN concern/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB essential/JJ to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO this/DT floodtide/NN of/IN irresponsibility/NN ,/, irresponsible/JJ charterers/NNS ,/, untraceable/JJ shipowners/NNS and/CC lenient/JJ certification/NN companies/NNS ./.

So/CC today/NN we/PRP find/VBP ourselves/PRP in/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN utter/JJ confusion/NN ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, such/JJ matters/NNS should/MD be/VB handled/VBN at/IN world/NN level/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT current/JJ international/JJ regulations/NNS of/IN the/DT IMO/NNP are/VBP far/RB from/IN adequate/JJ and/CC are/VBP far/RB too/RB loose/JJ ,/, and/CC neither/CC our/PRP$ own/JJ countries/NNS nor/CC the/DT Community/NNP have/VBP tried/VBN determinedly/RB to/TO make/VB them/PRP stricter/JJ ,/, despite/IN previous/JJ disasters/NNS ./.

Admittedly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT International/NNP Oil/NNP Pollution/NNP Compensation/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, IOPCF/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP waters/VBZ down/RP the/DT issue/NN of/IN liability/NN and/CC sets/VBZ its/PRP$ ceiling/NN at/IN a/DT quite/RB inadequate/JJ level/NN ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN must/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN within/IN the/DT IMO/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ up/IN to/TO the/DT Members/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT Community/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT necessary/JJ initiatives/NNS to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ./.

Let/VB me/PRP remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT Erika/NNP was/VBD sailing/VBG under/IN a/DT flag/NN of/IN convenience/NN ,/, that/DT of/IN a/DT state/NN applying/VBG for/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP Community/NNP directives/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP seldom/RB applied/VBN ,/, if/IN at/IN all/DT ,/, due/JJ to/TO the/DT insufficient/JJ number/NN of/IN national/JJ inspectors/NNS ./.

This/DT omission/NN must/MD be/VB remedied/VBN as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

A/DT directive/NN on/IN maritime/JJ safety/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN preparation/NN for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ making/VBG very/RB slow/JJ progress/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ displaying/VBG intolerable/JJ inertia/JJ and/CC unacceptable/JJ shortcomings/NNS ./.

The/DT date/NN when/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO present/VB its/PRP$ communication/NN devoted/VBN to/TO this/DT key/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ put/VBN off/IN time/NN and/CC again/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ now/RB scheduled/VBN for/IN July/NNP ./.

This/DT must/MD be/VB brought/VBN forward/RB ./.

The/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT regulations/NNS to/TO be/VB enforced/VBN must/MD be/VB particularly/RB clear/JJ and/CC strict/JJ ./.

I/PRP shall/MD mention/VB three/CD issues/NNS that/IN our/PRP$ group/NN feels/VBZ are/VBP priorities/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT liability/NN of/IN owners/NNS of/IN oil/NN cargoes/NNS must/MD be/VB clearly/RB established/VBN and/CC the/DT victims/NNS of/IN pollution/NN incidents/NNS must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO claim/VB on/IN this/DT liability/NN unequivocally/RB ./.

The/DT best/JJS form/NN of/IN prevention/NN we/PRP can/MD offer/VB for/IN the/DT future/NN is/VBZ the/DT sure/JJ knowledge/NN we/PRP can/MD offer/VB charterers/NNS that/IN they/PRP will/MD be/VB heavily/RB penalised/VBN in/IN civil/JJ ,/, criminal/JJ and/CC financial/JJ terms/NNS if/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB extremely/RB vigilant/JJ regarding/VBG the/DT matter/NN of/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN the/DT vessels/NNS they/PRP select/VBP ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT requirement/NN of/IN the/DT double/JJ hull/NN as/IN a/DT condition/NN for/IN access/NN to/TO Community/NNP waters/NNS must/MD be/VB enforced/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ and/CC cease/VB to/TO be/VB put/VBN off/RP indefinitely/RB ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, a/DT strict/JJ age/NN limit/NN on/IN vessels/NNS to/TO be/VB given/VBN access/NN to/TO Community/NNP waters/NNS must/MD be/VB established/VBN in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ./.

This/DT could/MD be/VB of/IN a/DT maximum/NN of/IN 15/CD years/NNS of/IN age/NN ./.

Thus/RB ,/, the/DT Erika/NNP was/VBD refused/VBN access/NN to/TO American/JJ waters/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP had/VBD done/VBN the/DT same/JJ ,/, a/DT great/JJ disaster/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN avoided/VBN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP ensure/VB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, that/IN this/DT time/NN we/PRP really/RB do/VBP learn/VBP the/DT lesson/NN ,/, even/RB after/IN the/DT media/NNS hype/NN and/CC the/DT shock/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP have/VBP died/VBN down/RP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Torrey/NNP Canyon/NNP ,/, Olympic/NNP Bravery/NNP ,/, Haven/NNP ,/, Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP ,/, Gino/NNP ,/, Tanio/NNP ,/, so/RB many/JJ names/NNS we/PRP remember/VBP with/IN horror/NN ./.

And/CC now/RB the/DT Erika/NN ./.

Whose/JJ turn/NN is/VBZ next/JJ ?/.

Twenty/CD one/NN years/NNS after/IN Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP ,/, this/DT umpteenth/JJ oil/NN slick/NN ,/, the/DT seventh/JJ since/IN 1967/CD ,/, shows/VBZ the/DT irresponsibility/NN of/IN our/PRP$ successive/JJ rulers/NNS ./.

The/DT Atlantic/NNP West/NNP Coast/NNP once/RB again/RB is/VBZ paying/VBG a/DT high/JJ price/NN for/IN their/PRP$ inability/NN to/TO react/VB ,/, for/IN their/PRP$ capitulation/NN to/TO the/DT multinationals/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO understand/VB why/WRB the/DT French/JJ and/CC the/DT Europeans/NNPS allow/VBP something/NN which/WDT the/DT Americans/NNPS refuse/VBP to/TO accept/VB ,/, and/CC why/WRB Europe/NNP ,/, normally/RB so/RB quick/JJ to/TO pass/VB environmental/JJ legislation/NN ,/, has/VBZ chosen/VBN to/TO overlook/VB the/DT matter/NN of/IN maritime/JJ safety/NN ./.

And/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT result/NN ./.

The/DT Erika/NNP ,/, a/DT vessel/NN flying/VBG a/DT Maltese/JJ flag/NN ,/, a/DT floating/VBG rust/NN bucket/NN ,/, classed/VBN amongst/IN the/DT most/RBS dangerous/JJ type/NN of/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS ,/, has/VBZ contaminated/VBN more/JJR than/IN 400/CD km/NN of/IN our/PRP$ coastline/NN ,/, a/DT case/NN of/IN pollution/NN even/RB worse/JJR than/IN that/DT caused/VBN by/IN the/DT Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP ./.

As/IN an/DT elected/VBN representative/NN for/IN the/DT Loire-Atlantique/JJ region/NN ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD testify/VB to/TO this/DT ./.

There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN natural/JJ about/IN these/DT recurring/VBG disasters/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP the/DT result/NN of/IN fate/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP the/DT result/NN of/IN human/JJ thoughtlessness/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP have/VBP here/RB is/VBZ an/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN ./.

Only/RB the/DT people/NNS cut/VBN off/RP from/IN the/DT harsh/JJ reality/NN of/IN the/DT grass/NN roots/NNS could/MD have/VB any/DT doubt/NN about/IN that/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB an/DT economic/JJ disaster/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT people/NNS who/WP make/VBP their/PRP$ living/NN from/IN the/DT sea/NN and/CC from/IN tourism/NN ,/, fishermen/NNS ,/, oyster/NN farmers/NNS ,/, shellfish/JJ farmers/NNS ,/, people/NNS who/WP make/VBP a/DT living/NN from/IN the/DT salt/NN marshes/NNS ,/, shopkeepers/NNS ,/, etc./FW ./.

The/DT Erika/NNP disaster/NN must/MD be/VB the/DT last/JJ in/IN the/DT series/NN ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP must/MD shed/VB some/DT light/NN on/IN this/DT shipwreck/NN ./.

Why/WRB do/VBP we/PRP not/RB appoint/VB a/DT parliamentary/JJ committee/NN of/IN inquiry/NN or/CC get/VB Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP involved/VBN in/IN the/DT team/NN of/IN experts/NNS which/WDT has/VBZ just/RB been/VBN announced/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ?/.

Next/RB ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ,/, we/PRP muss/VBZ pass/VB legislation/NN ,/, firstly/RB ,/, regarding/VBG identification/NN of/IN the/DT exact/JJ characteristics/NNS of/IN goods/NNS transported/VBN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT experts/NNS ,/, the/DT oil/NN the/DT Erika/NNP was/VBD carrying/VBG was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO sink/VB to/TO the/DT bottom/NN and/CC should/MD never/RB have/VB reached/VBN the/DT coast/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP what/WP actually/RB happened/VBD ./.

Next/RB ,/, reliable/JJ technical/JJ inspection/NN must/MD be/VB established/VBN like/IN the/DT technical/JJ inspection/NN compulsory/NN in/IN France/NNP for/IN vehicles/NNS more/JJR than/IN five/CD years/NNS old/JJ ./.

We/PRP must/MD regulate/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ,/, make/VB double/RB hulls/NN mandatory/JJ for/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN polluting/JJ or/CC dangerous/JJ materials/NNS ,/, work/VB on/IN technological/JJ innovations/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO process/VB or/CC recover/VB hydrocarbons/NNS at/IN sea/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT minimum/JJ requirement/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, on/IN the/DT dawn/NN of/IN the/DT third/JJ millennium/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN to/TO delay/VB the/DT second/JJ round/NN of/IN talks/NNS ,/, initiated/VBN in/IN Shepherdstown/NNP by/IN the/DT Syrian/JJ Arab/NNP Republic/NNP ,/, is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB significant/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN the/DT hopes/NNS which/WDT were/VBD raised/VBN on/IN 3/CD January/NNP in/IN that/DT town/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB dashed/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT different/JJ groups/NNS in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP are/VBP tabling/VBG a/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT ever/RB controversial/JJ debate/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT broad/JJ consensus/NN ,/, seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT clear/JJ political/JJ will/NN to/TO decisively/RB support/VB open/JJ peace/NN processes/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB ,/, equally/RB firmly/RB ,/, to/TO express/VB our/PRP$ rejection/NN of/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN violence/NN to/TO resolve/VB differences/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP still/RB no/DT doubt/NN profound/JJ ,/, between/IN the/DT parties/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ judgement/NN ,/, this/DT constitutes/VBZ a/DT guarantee/NN to/TO both/DT sides/NNS ,/, both/DT from/IN a/DT political/JJ and/CC a/DT financial/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT commitment/NN they/PRP can/MD expect/VB from/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT peace/NN which/WDT we/PRP all/RB long/JJ for/IN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ to/TO everyone/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO guaranteeing/VBG security/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC to/TO cooperating/VBG in/IN the/DT development/NN which/WDT is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO heal/VB the/DT serious/JJ social/JJ differences/NNS which/WDT exist/VBP ./.

But/CC this/DT also/RB serves/VBZ to/TO make/VB a/DT claim/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, for/IN a/DT degree/NN of/IN political/JJ participation/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN which/WDT is/VBZ consistent/JJ with/IN its/PRP$ economic/JJ contribution/NN -/: we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB aspirations/NNS to/TO be/VB bankers/NNS -/: and/CC which/WDT will/MD be/VB suitably/RB visible/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ absolutely/RB no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ trip/NN by/IN the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP to/TO the/DT region/NN will/MD contribute/VB to/TO this/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ detailed/JJ account/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT tone/NN which/WDT Galeote/NNP Quecedo/NNP '/POS s/JJ speech/NN set/VBD here/RB ./.

We/PRP in/IN Parliament/NNP strongly/RB support/VB the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP peace/NN process/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT peace/NN process/NN which/WDT is/VBZ finally/RB under/IN way/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP think/VBP of/IN how/WRB the/DT process/NN was/VBD looking/VBG a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, the/DT difference/NN between/IN then/RB and/CC now/RB is/VBZ like/IN that/DT between/IN night/NN and/CC day/NN ,/, despite/IN difficulties/NNS and/CC delays/NNS ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB four/CD points/NNS ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT Sharm/NNP el-Sheikh/JJ Agreement/NN contains/VBZ ,/, as/IN everyone/NN knows/VBZ ,/, a/DT concrete/JJ timetable/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN Israel/NNP '/POS s/JJ commitments/NNS ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ both/DT to/TO the/DT interim/JJ agreement/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT Hebron/NNP and/CC Wye/NNP Agreements/NNP ./.

While/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS on/IN the/DT final/JJ peace/NN settlement/NN have/VBP begun/VBN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO keep/VB the/DT two/CD processes/NNS apart/RB ./.

A/DT lack/NN of/IN progress/NN in/IN the/DT final/JJ status/NN negotiations/NNS should/MD not/RB jeopardise/VB implementation/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD above-mentioned/JJ interim/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO look/VB out/RP for/IN in/IN this/DT context/NN is/VBZ how/WRB matters/NNS develop/VBP in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT harbours/NNS in/IN Gaza/NNP ,/, the/DT northern/JJ transit/NN route/NN between/IN Gaza/NNP and/CC the/DT West/NNP Bank/NNP ,/, further/JJ releases/NNS of/IN political/JJ prisoners/NNS and/CC implementation/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ commitments/NNS ./.

The/DT second/JJ point/NN relates/VBZ to/TO Syria/NNP ./.

There/RB ,/, the/DT border/NN question/NN is/VBZ obviously/RB central/JJ ./.

How/WRB negotiations/NNS are/VBP proceeding/VBG there/RB ,/, we/PRP still/RB do/VBP not/RB know/VB ./.

What/WP is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP begun/VBN ./.

An/DT important/JJ question/NN in/IN this/DT context/NN is/VBZ the/DT future/JJ distribution/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

As/IN things/NNS are/VBP at/IN present/JJ ,/, the/DT Golan/NNP Heights/NNP account/VBP for/IN between/IN a/DT third/NN and/CC a/DT sixth/NN of/IN Israel/NNP 's/POS water/NN supply/NN ./.

The/DT third/JJ aspect/NN is/VBZ the/DT peace/NN negotiations/NNS in/IN Syria/NNP which/WDT are/VBP closely/RB linked/VBN to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN Israeli/JJ withdrawal/NN from/IN Southern/NNP Lebanon/NNP ./.

According/VBG to/TO UNIFIL/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP now/RB concrete/JJ signs/NNS that/IN Israel/NNP is/VBZ preparing/VBG to/TO withdraw/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN we/PRP welcome/VBP ./.

There/EX too/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, outstanding/JJ matters/NNS in/IN dispute/NN are/VBP the/DT water/NN problem/NN and/CC the/DT situation/NN of/IN the/DT Lebanese/JJ Palestinian/JJ refugees/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ last/JJ point/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT future/JJ Palestinian/JJ State/NN ./.

This/DT may/MD be/VB proclaimed/VBN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, with/IN or/CC without/IN Israel/NNP '/POS s/JJ support/NN ./.

The/DT Barak/NNP government/NN has/VBZ given/VBN to/TO understand/VB that/IN it/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO conclude/VB a/DT peace/NN agreement/NN with/IN a/DT state/NN as/IN the/DT other/JJ party/NN ./.

Even/RB if/IN negotiations/NNS are/VBP not/RB completed/VBN by/IN September/NNP of/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN in/IN the/DT relevant/JJ treaties/NNS to/TO prevent/VB a/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN from/IN being/VBG proclaimed/VBD after/IN that/DT date/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP support/VBP the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN that/IN the/DT latter/NN should/MD be/VB as/IN Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP said/VBD ,/, namely/RB a/DT state/NN subject/NN to/TO public/JJ control/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB a/DT democratic/JJ state/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN to/TO which/WDT we/PRP all/DT want/VBP to/TO contribute/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO refer/VB ,/, firstly/RB and/CC above/IN all/DT ,/, to/TO the/DT joint/JJ resolution/NN which/WDT will/MD be/VB laid/VBN down/RP to/TO round/VB off/RP this/DT debate/NN ./.

My/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT contribution/NN to/TO this/DT resolution/NN and/CC ,/, needless/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, approves/VBZ of/IN it/PRP ./.

More/RBR specifically/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB our/PRP$ delight/NN at/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, after/IN such/PDT a/DT long/JJ time/NN ,/, Israel/NNP and/CC Syria/NNP are/VBP on/IN speaking/VBG terms/NNS again/RB to/TO resolve/VB their/PRP$ differences/NNS of/IN opinion/NN ./.

The/DT recent/JJ negotiations/NNS are/VBP already/RB an/DT important/JJ step/NN towards/IN a/DT permanent/JJ peace/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, regrettable/JJ that/IN these/DT peace/NN talks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN suspended/VBN for/IN the/DT time/NN being/VBG ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, both/DT parties/NNS will/MD need/VB to/TO make/VB huge/JJ efforts/NNS ./.

Lasting/VBG peace/NN in/IN the/DT region/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB achieved/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN an/DT agreement/NN which/WDT guarantees/VBZ the/DT security/NN of/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ borders/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN Syria/NNP '/POS s/JJ integrity/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB necessary/JJ to/TO initiate/VB permanent/JJ diplomatic/JJ relations/NNS and/CC to/TO establish/VB constant/JJ dialogue/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT bilateral/JJ meetings/NNS with/IN Syria/NNP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Israel/NNP will/MD also/RB enter/VB into/IN negotiations/NNS with/IN Lebanon/NNP within/IN the/DT foreseeable/JJ future/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC regional/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, a/DT multilateral/JJ approach/NN will/MD appear/VB possible/JJ ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB regrettable/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ financial/JJ donors/NNS ,/, is/VBZ still/RB unable/JJ to/TO play/VB a/DT major/JJ political/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ./.

This/DT peace/NN process/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT priorities/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ where/WRB Mr/NNP Solana/NNP ,/, the/DT High/NNP Representative/NNP to/TO the/DT Council/NNP ,/, could/MD come/VB into/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Member/NNP States/NNP also/RB have/VBP to/TO be/VB encouraged/VBN to/TO support/VB projects/NNS which/WDT can/MD help/VB develop/VB understanding/NN and/CC partnership/NN between/IN the/DT different/JJ nations/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO the/DT significance/NN of/IN the/DT Barcelona/NNP process/NN which/WDT should/MD have/VB a/DT beneficial/JJ impact/NN on/IN regional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, we/PRP support/VBP Libya/NNP '/POS s/JJ participation/NN ,/, provided/VBN that/IN it/PRP recognises/VBZ human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, renounces/VBZ support/NN for/IN terrorists/NNS and/CC fully/RB supports/VBZ the/DT peace/NN process/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP still/RB ,/, needless/NNS to/TO say/VB ,/, many/JJ unresolved/JJ problems/NNS and/CC unanswered/JJ questions/NNS ,/, also/RB involving/VBG the/DT Palestinians/NNPS ./.

Everyone/NN knows/VBZ that/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN is/VBZ a/DT protracted/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ affair/NN but/CC we/PRP are/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN ,/, with/IN the/DT necessary/JJ trust/NN ,/, perseverance/JJ and/CC indispensable/JJ political/JJ will/NN ,/, our/PRP$ common/JJ goal/NN ,/, namely/RB a/DT peaceful/JJ and/CC prosperous/JJ Middle/NNP East/NNP ,/, will/MD be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ pleasing/VBG that/IN ,/, despite/IN certain/JJ delays/NNS and/CC problems/NNS ,/, the/DT peace/NN negotiations/NNS are/VBP going/VBG on/RP both/DT between/IN Israel/NNP and/CC Palestine/NNP and/CC between/IN Israel/NNP and/CC Syria/NNP ./.

The/DT moment/NN of/IN truth/NN is/VBZ approaching/VBG ./.

Is/VBZ Israel/NNP prepared/VBN to/TO comply/VB with/IN the/DT UN/NNP '/POS s/JJ resolutions/NNS and/CC ,/, in/IN exchange/NN for/IN peace/NN and/CC security/NN ,/, hand/VB back/RP the/DT Arab/JJ areas/NNS which/WDT were/VBD conquered/VBN in/IN 1967/CD ?/.

Will/MD Israel/NNP let/VB Palestinian/JJ refugees/NNS return/NN or/CC be/VB given/VBN compensation/NN ?/.

Will/MD Israel/NNP share/VB Jerusalem/NNP and/CC the/DT water/NN of/IN the/DT River/NNP Jordan/NNP ?/.

Will/MD a/DT free/JJ Palestine/NNP be/VB a/DT truly/RB democratic/JJ state/NN and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, reliable/JJ as/IN a/DT partner/NN in/IN peace/NN ?/.

Will/MD Syria/NNP fully/RB accept/VB Israel/NNP '/POS s/JJ existence/NN and/CC introduce/VB democracy/NN and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ?/.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT main/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN lies/VBZ with/IN the/DT occupying/JJ country/NN ,/, Israel/NNP ,/, does/VBZ not/RB prevent/VB the/DT Arab/JJ partners/NNS from/IN also/RB having/VBG a/DT considerable/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT responsibility/NN ./.

Peace/NNP in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP concerns/VBZ us/PRP all/DT ,/, however/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB good/JJ that/IN the/DT EU/NNP should/MD act/VB as/IN a/DT godparent/NN to/TO the/DT Palestinian/JJ state/NN ./.

Against/IN this/DT background/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO conclude/VB with/IN a/DT remarkable/JJ story/NN from/IN Sweden/NNP where/WRB an/DT international/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NN on/IN Hitler/NNP '/POS s/JJ extermination/NN of/IN the/DT Jews/NNPS is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT welcome/JJ initiative/NN ./.

Of/IN 47/CD states/NNS invited/VBN from/IN all/DT corners/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, not/RB one/CD of/IN them/PRP ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ an/DT Arab/JJ state/NN included/VBN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/NNP Barcelona/NNP process/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN interpreted/VBN as/IN indicating/VBG that/IN the/DT Arab/JJ attitude/NN towards/IN Israel/NNP should/MD be/VB regarded/VBN by/IN Europeans/NNPS as/IN being/VBG similar/JJ to/TO the/DT Nazis/NNPS '/POS anti-Semitism/NNP ,/, which/WDT of/IN course/NN is/VBZ completely/RB incorrect/JJ ./.

The/DT Arab/JJ world/NN '/POS s/JJ criticism/NN of/IN Israel/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN founded/VBN upon/IN the/DT same/JJ sort/NN of/IN anti-colonialism/NN as/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Algeria/NNP '/POS s/VBZ fight/NN for/IN freedom/NN against/IN France/NNP ./.

But/CC today/NN ,/, Egypt/NNP ,/, Jordan/NNP and/CC Palestine/NNP have/VBP peace/NN treaties/NNS with/IN Israel/NNP ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB wonder/VBP whether/IN Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP does/VBZ not/RB agree/VB with/IN me/PRP that/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN only/RB right/JJ and/CC proper/JJ to/TO have/VB invited/VBN at/IN least/JJS one/CD Arab/JJ state/NN to/TO the/DT holocaust/JJ conference/NN in/IN Stockholm/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP very/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT awareness/NN he/PRP has/VBZ demonstrated/VBN of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS inherent/JJ in/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN and/CC the/DT challenge/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG on/RP to/TO bring/VB it/PRP to/TO completion/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ high/JJ time/NN there/EX was/VBD peace/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP principally/RB to/TO the/DT Palestine-Israel/JJ question/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT same/JJ also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT territories/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN occupied/VBN in/IN the/DT Golan/NNP since/IN 1967/CD and/CC in/IN southern/JJ Lebanon/NNP since/IN 1982/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, Israel/NNP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT only/JJ country/NN concerned/VBN with/IN security/NN ./.

Trees/NNP have/VBP been/VBN uprooted/VBN ,/, houses/NNS are/VBP still/RB being/VBG demolished/VBN and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, water/NN supplies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN reduced/VBN or/CC refused/VBN ,/, especially/RB in/IN East/NNP Jerusalem/NNP ,/, while/IN the/DT settlements/NNS continue/VBP and/CC are/VBP growing/VBG constantly/RB ./.

All/PDT the/DT international/JJ community/NN has/VBZ to/TO do/VB is/VBZ implement/VB Resolutions/JJ 332/CD ,/, 248/CD ,/, 245/CD and/CC 194/CD ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN by/IN the/DT deferment/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN of/IN relations/NNS with/IN Syria/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN Mr/NNP Barak/NNP '/POS s/JJ decision/NN to/TO postpone/VB the/DT withdrawal/NN of/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ army/NN and/CC the/DT Sharm/NNP el脗-Sheikh/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

We/PRP feel/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO play/VB a/DT political/JJ role/NN in/IN negotiations/NNS which/WDT matches/VBZ its/PRP$ economic/JJ aid/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB content/JJ with/IN a/DT role/NN backstage/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB leading/JJ protagonists/NNS while/IN staying/VBG off/RP a/DT collision/NN course/NN with/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, as/IN Minister/NNP Gama/NNP said/VBD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, firstly/VB my/PRP$ thanks/NNS and/CC appreciation/NN to/TO Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ comments/NNS here/RB today/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN reaffirming/VBG that/IN our/PRP$ role/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB that/DT of/IN ``/`` banker/NN ''/'' for/IN the/DT entire/JJ operation/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD deeply/RB disappointed/JJ at/IN the/DT news/NN this/DT week/NN that/IN the/DT peace/NN talks/NNS between/IN Israel/NNP and/CC Syria/NNP had/VBD been/VBN suspended/VBN ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB hope/VBP that/IN a/DT compromise/NN can/MD be/VB reached/VBN to/TO overcome/VB this/DT so/RB that/IN the/DT peace/NN negotiations/NNS can/MD be/VB resumed/VBN at/IN a/DT very/RB early/JJ date/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB deny/VB that/IN some/DT positive/JJ political/JJ progress/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP of/IN late/JJ ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Syrian/JJ Foreign/NNP Minister/NNP and/CC the/DT Israeli/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP were/VBD recently/RB sitting/VBG around/IN the/DT same/JJ table/NN in/IN America/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN their/PRP$ respective/JJ histories/NNS is/VBZ an/DT indication/NN that/IN old/JJ hatreds/NNS and/CC animosities/NNS can/MD be/VB overcome/VBN ./.

Political/NNP leaders/NNS must/MD show/VB real/JJ courage/NN to/TO put/VB in/IN place/NN a/DT framework/NN which/WDT can/MD lead/VB to/TO an/DT overall/JJ peace/NN settlement/NN within/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN if/IN agreement/NN can/MD be/VB reached/VBN between/IN Syria/NNP and/CC Israel/NNP ,/, the/DT Israeli/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP will/MD still/RB face/VB real/JJ opposition/NN to/TO any/DT new/JJ agreement/NN with/IN Syria/NNP in/IN any/DT future/JJ referendum/NN ./.

The/DT settlers/NNS at/IN the/DT Golan/NNP Heights/NNPS will/MD demand/VB to/TO be/VB compensated/VBN and/CC there/EX will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB guarantees/NNS of/IN security/NN ./.

If/IN Syria/NNP would/MD be/VB willing/JJ to/TO offer/VB concessions/NNS on/IN the/DT security/NN question/NN then/RB the/DT prospects/NNS of/IN a/DT successful/JJ resolution/NN to/TO the/DT Israel/Syria/NNP question/NN might/MD be/VB promising/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN Palestine/NNP ,/, I/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP still/RB some/DT difficulties/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT implementation/NN of/IN some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT Wye/NNP Agreement/NNP ./.

The/DT key/JJ problem/NN areas/NNS at/IN the/DT moment/NN include/VBP the/DT difficulties/NNS of/IN redeployment/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT transfer/NN of/IN territories/NNS ./.

The/DT low/JJ level/NN of/IN releases/NNS of/IN Palestinian/JJ prisoners/NNS and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ Government/NN appears/VBZ to/TO intend/VB halting/VBG implementation/NN of/IN building/NN permits/NNS already/RB granted/VBN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN not/RB approving/VBG new/JJ ones/NNS ,/, pose/VBP further/JJ obstacles/NNS ./.

These/DT issues/NNS have/VBP clearly/RB been/VBN holding/VBG up/RP progress/NN on/IN the/DT permanent/JJ status/NN negotiations/NNS ,/, although/IN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, these/DT talks/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB held/VBN up/RP indefinitely/RB ./.

At/IN present/JJ ,/, the/DT main/JJ difficulty/NN in/IN approaching/VBG the/DT negotiations/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB that/IN the/DT Palestinians/NNPS are/VBP insisting/VBG that/IN the/DT border/NN issue/NN must/MD be/VB agreed/VBN upon/IN first/JJ ,/, while/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ Government/NN says/VBZ that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB settled/VBN only/RB if/IN a/DT solution/NN is/VBZ reached/VBN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN settlements/NNS and/CC security/NN ./.

Currently/RB ,/, both/DT sides/NNS seem/VBP to/TO have/VB accepted/VBN that/IN nothing/NN will/MD be/VB agreed/VBN until/IN everything/NN is/VBZ agreed/VBN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, while/IN other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP have/VBP had/VBN reservations/NNS about/IN the/DT overall/JJ direction/NN of/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ,/, now/RB that/IN the/DT Syrian/JJ Government/NN has/VBZ been/VBN brought/VBN into/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN ,/, Egypt/NNP and/CC other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO move/VB forward/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT various/JJ motions/NNS for/IN resolutions/NNS tabled/VBN in/IN Parliament/NNP more/RBR or/CC less/RBR represent/VBP the/DT situation/NN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ statements/NNS ,/, especially/RB Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ analysis/NNS I/PRP fully/RB share/VBP and/CC I/PRP shall/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, repeat/VB any/DT of/IN his/PRP$ ideas/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO make/VB three/CD comments/NNS which/WDT Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP will/MD perhaps/RB see/VB as/RB similar/JJ but/CC which/WDT ,/, for/IN various/JJ reasons/NNS ,/, a/DT Member/NNP can/MD formulate/VB more/JJR openly/RB ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP enough/JJ agreements/NNS now/RB :/: Oslo/NNP ,/, Wye/NNP Plantation/NNP ,/, Sharm/NNP el-Sheikh/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP enough/JJ agreements/NNS ;/: they/PRP just/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT regard/NN I/PRP share/VBP Mr/NNP Salafranca/NNP '/POS s/JJ scepticism/NN when/WRB he/PRP says/VBZ that/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN bad/JJ news/NN from/IN Israel/NNP this/DT week/NN ,/, namely/RB that/IN the/DT Sharm/NNP el-Sheikh/NNP Memorandum/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB implemented/VBN within/IN the/DT set/VBN timeframe/NN ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT resumption/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS between/IN Syria/NNP and/CC Israel/NNP ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP this/DT to/TO be/VB very/RB encouraging/JJ news/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP also/RB learned/VBN this/DT week/NN that/IN Mr/NNP Barak/NNP will/MD not/RB be/VB travelling/VBG to/TO Washington/NNP and/CC that/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS can/MD not/RB therefore/RB be/VB continued/VBN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB it/PRP quite/RB clear/JJ :/: if/IN the/DT Golan/NNP Heights/NNP are/VBP returned/VBN to/TO Syria/NNP ,/, the/DT problem/NN in/IN this/DT region/NN will/MD be/VB solved/VBN ./.

On/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT referendum/NN which/WDT various/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP referred/VBN to/TO :/: we/PRP must/MD consider/VB if/IN a/DT referendum/NN always/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB held/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO honour/VB obligations/NNS under/IN international/JJ law/NN and/CC under/IN the/DT law/NN of/IN nations/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ third/JJ and/CC last/JJ point/NN concerns/NNS the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP should/MD really/RB like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT excellent/JJ role/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Moratinos/NNP '/POS special/JJ mission/NN has/VBZ played/VBN in/IN the/DT region/NN and/CC the/DT funding/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP provided/VBN there/EX ,/, Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP ./.

You/PRP know/VBP that/IN you/PRP will/MD always/RB have/VB our/PRP$ support/NN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, and/CC that/WDT includes/VBZ your/PRP$ proposal/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP shall/MD be/VB behind/IN you/PRP when/WRB the/DT time/NN comes/VBZ to/TO finance/VB it/PRP ./.

Then/RB we/PRP will/MD have/VB played/VBN the/DT role/NN which/WDT is/VBZ commensurate/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ participation/NN and/CC our/PRP$ contribution/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP ,/, the/DT recent/JJ peace/NN talks/NNS begun/VBN in/IN the/DT USA/NNP between/IN Israel/NNP and/CC Syria/NNP mark/VBP a/DT turning/NN point/NN in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN fifty/JJ years/NNS to/TO reach/VB this/DT point/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD involve/VB some/DT particularly/RB difficult/JJ negotiations/NNS ./.

There/EX will/MD be/VB no/DT meeting/NN today/NN in/IN Shepherdstown/NNP but/CC we/PRP must/MD hope/VB ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Patten/NNP said/VBD just/RB now/RB ,/, that/IN this/DT postponement/NN of/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS due/JJ to/TO Syrian/JJ requirements/NNS will/MD only/RB represent/VB one/CD more/JJR step/NN on/IN the/DT road/NN to/TO a/DT peace/NN agreement/NN which/WDT will/MD change/VB the/DT face/NN of/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ./.

This/DT hope/NN is/VBZ contained/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP for/IN a/DT fair/JJ and/CC balanced/JJ agreement/NN based/VBN on/IN respect/NN for/IN sovereignties/NNS and/CC the/DT right/NN to/TO live/VB securely/RB within/IN safe/JJ and/CC recognised/VBN borders/NNS ./.

Dare/RB we/PRP hope/VBP for/IN an/DT Israeli/JJ withdrawal/NN from/IN South/NNP Lebanon/NNP by/IN July/NNP 2000/CD ,/, the/DT date/NN promised/VBD by/IN Ehud/NNP Barak/NNP ?/.

I/PRP dare/MD say/VB this/DT because/IN I/PRP took/VBD the/DT trouble/NN to/TO go/VB into/IN the/DT field/NN and/CC collect/VB information/NN from/IN ,/, among/IN others/NNS ,/, scrapyards/NNS which/WDT already/RB recycle/VB car/NN components/NNS successfully/RB ./.

They/PRP made/VBD it/PRP clear/JJ to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT arguments/NNS concerning/VBG lack/NN of/IN safety/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, are/VBP nonsense/NN ./.

The/DT car/NN lobby/NN was/VBD unsuccessful/JJ today/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP pleased/VBN about/IN that/DT ./.

The/DT directive/NN remains/VBZ in/IN place/NN ./.

I/PRP expect/VBP that/IN we/PRP will/MD achieve/VB an/DT excellent/JJ result/NN in/IN the/DT reconciliation/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT efforts/NNS to/TO achieve/VB a/DT better/JJR living/NN environment/NN will/MD triumph/VB over/RP unreasonable/JJ industrial/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP few/JJ things/NNS more/RBR certain/JJ in/IN life/NN than/IN taxes/NNS ,/, death/NN and/CC pollution/NN ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO pollution/NN ,/, like/IN sin/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP all/DT against/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC from/IN there/RB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT far/JJ cry/NN from/IN believing/VBG that/IN just/RB because/IN a/DT measure/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN against/IN this/DT evil/NN it/PRP is/VBZ necessarily/RB good/JJ ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, this/DT directive/NN ,/, like/IN so/RB many/JJ others/NNS addressing/VBG environmental/JJ issues/NNS ,/, is/VBZ not/RB good/JJ ./.

As/IN is/VBZ so/RB often/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, it/PRP merely/RB provides/VBZ yet/RP another/DT massive/JJ bureaucratic/JJ structure/NN to/TO control/VB a/DT problem/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD only/RB serve/VB to/TO create/VB more/JJR jobs/NNS for/IN officials/NNS ,/, and/CC cost/VBD the/DT motor/NN industries/NNS and/CC consumers/NNS a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN money/NN ./.

The/DT one/CD thing/NN it/PRP will/MD not/RB do/VB is/VBZ solve/VB the/DT problem/NN -/: it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT massive/JJ sledgehammer/NN to/TO miss/VB a/DT nut/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS my/JJ party/NN ,/, could/MD begin/VB to/TO disagree/VB that/IN recycling/NN should/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO achieve/VB that/DT is/VBZ to/TO work/VB with/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, not/RB to/TO create/VB another/DT bureaucratic/JJ monstrosity/NN ./.

The/DT elections/NNS to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN 1999/CD showed/VBD perfectly/RB clearly/RB that/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP do/VBP not/RB fall/VB in/IN with/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN an/DT ever/RB more/RBR federalist/JJ EU/NN centred/VBN upon/IN Brussels/NNP ./.

Social/NNP Europe/NNP ,/, used/VBN as/IN a/DT foil/NN by/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, has/VBZ simply/RB been/VBN eliminated/VBN from/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

All/PDT this/DT does/VBZ is/VBZ to/TO legitimise/VB the/DT development/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT European/JJ scale/NN ,/, of/IN resistance/NN movements/NNS anxious/JJ to/TO bring/VB in/IN a/DT social/JJ charter/NN which/WDT would/MD harmonise/VB workers/NNS '/POS main/JJ claims/NNS towards/IN the/DT highest/JJS common/JJ denominator/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT present/JJ crisis/NN involving/VBG Austria/NNP has/VBZ demonstrated/VBN ,/, the/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ the/DT right/NN to/TO protect/VB itself/PRP ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT legal/JJ mechanisms/NNS that/WDT exist/VBP in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP are/VBP weak/JJ ,/, difficult/JJ to/TO apply/VB politically/RB and/CC legally/RB ,/, do/VBP not/RB define/VB the/DT powers/NNS of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS and/CC do/VBP not/RB guarantee/VB fair/JJ legal/JJ treatment/NN for/IN processes/NNS of/IN major/JJ importance/NN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD also/RB mention/VB the/DT German/NNP Socialist/NNP Party/NNP which/WDT dares/VBZ to/TO preach/VB to/TO us/PRP about/IN the/DT second/JJ world/NN war/NN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ international/JJ socialist/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN its/PRP$ peers/NNS were/VBD National/NNP Socialists/NNPS ,/, still/RB goose-stepping/NN ,/, the/DT party/NN of/IN the/DT Waffen/NNP SS/NNP .../: -LRB-/-LRB- The/DT President/NNP cut/VBD the/DT speaker/NN off/RP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP had/VBD a/DT major/JJ problem/NN with/IN this/DT resolution/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP abstained/VBD on/IN the/DT vote/NN for/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN reasons/NNS ./.

I/PRP was/VBD in/IN sympathy/NN with/IN the/DT EDD/NNP Group/NNP amendment/NN ,/, talking/VBG about/IN rejecting/VBG the/DT interference/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP in/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN governments/NNS of/IN Members/NNP States/NNPS but/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO abstain/VB because/IN it/PRP just/RB followed/VBD on/IN the/DT condemnation/NN of/IN xenophobia/NN ,/, racism/NN ,/, etc./FW and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB misinterpreted/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP wonder/NN about/IN the/DT wisdom/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT succession/NN of/IN serious/JJ tanker/NN disasters/NNS world-wide/JJ and/CC the/DT countermeasures/NNS taken/VBN have/VB either/RB been/VBN ineffective/JJ or/CC not/RB worth/JJ mentioning/VBG ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ particularly/RB bad/JJ this/DT time/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ affected/VBN a/DT major/JJ European/JJ State/NN ;/: an/DT incident/NN which/WDT could/MD happen/VB again/RB at/IN any/DT time/NN ./.

We/PRP urgently/RB require/VBP a/DT directive/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO reduce/VB these/DT risks/NNS ./.

The/DT 15/CD clearly/RB do/VBP not/RB suffice/VB ./.

These/DT guarantee/NN -/: making/VBG no/DT claim/NN to/TO be/VB exhaustive/JJ -/: a/DT minimum/NN of/IN 3/CD things/NNS ./.

No/DT tanker/NN or/CC freighter/NN fit/NN only/RB for/IN the/DT scrap/NN heap/NN must/MD ever/RB put/VB into/IN any/DT harbour/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP again/RB ./.

All/PDT those/DT involved/VBN ,/, including/VBG the/DT transport/NN agent/NN ,/, are/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN any/DT ensuing/VBG damage/NN ,/, and/CC these/DT individuals/NNS are/VBP to/TO provide/VB satisfactory/JJ assurances/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN of/IN affording/VBG the/DT victims/NNS the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ claims/NNS for/IN compensation/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD aim/VB higher/JJR in/IN the/DT long-term/JJ ,/, let/VB there/RB be/VB no/DT mistake/NN about/IN that/DT ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP real/JJ cost-effectiveness/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ entire/JJ energy/NN supply/NN system/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP start/VBP by/IN saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Commissioner/NNP Palacio/NNP very/RB much/JJ for/IN her/PRP$ clear/JJ ,/, adequate/JJ and/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, very/JJ firm/NN response/NN ./.

Many/JJ thanks/NNS for/IN this/DT ./.

This/DT also/RB means/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN respect/NN for/IN the/DT briefing/NN note/NN which/WDT she/PRP sent/VBD on/IN 10/CD January/NNP but/CC also/RB for/IN the/DT action/NN points/NNS which/WDT she/PRP announced/VBD today/NN ./.

The/DT Erika/NNP disaster/NN shows/VBZ that/IN when/WRB sound/JJ traffic/NN and/CC transport/NN regulations/NNS are/VBP lacking/VBG at/IN international/JJ and/CC European/JJ level/NN ,/, nature/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN come/VBP off/RP second-best/NN ./.

The/DT damage/NN suffered/VBN ,/, also/RB in/IN ecological/JJ terms/NNS ,/, can/MD not/RB be/VB expressed/VBN in/IN money/NN ./.

Hence/RB also/RB this/DT joint/JJ debate/NN involving/VBG transport/NN and/CC environmental/JJ management/NN Members/NNS ./.

What/WP I/PRP learned/VBD is/VBZ that/IN ,/, actually/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ sufficient/JJ legislation/NN in/IN place/NN but/CC the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN supervision/NN ./.

Could/MD I/PRP highlight/VB a/DT few/JJ points/NNS which/WDT have/VBP also/RB been/VBN touched/VBN upon/RP by/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP ?/.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT port-state/JJ control/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO which/WDT 25/CD %/NN of/IN all/DT ships/NNS require/VBP inspection/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT 25/CD %/NN should/MD not/RB only/RB be/VB enforced/VBN but/CC that/IN it/PRP should/MD also/RB be/VB ensured/VBN that/IN more/JJR inspections/NNS take/VBP place/NN ./.

So/IN this/DT 25/CD %/NN should/MD be/VB increased/VBN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, if/IN a/DT ship/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR seaworthy/JJ ,/, not/RB only/JJ should/MD the/DT facts/NNS be/VB examined/VBD ,/, but/CC a/DT legal/JJ system/NN should/MD be/VB introduced/VBN which/WDT states/VBZ or/CC recommends/VBZ that/IN the/DT vessel/NN should/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB used/VBN ./.

But/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN place/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD welcome/VB some/DT action/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT technical/JJ requirements/NNS for/IN ships/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, some/DT Members/NNS have/VBP already/RB mentioned/VBN just/RB now/RB that/IN ,/, since/IN 1999/CD in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, ships/NNS should/MD in/IN any/DT case/NN be/VB double-hulled/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD look/VB further/RBR into/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP also/RB think/VBP that/IN the/DT Marpol/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, which/WDT comes/VBZ into/IN effect/NN in/IN 2001/CD ,/, should/MD be/VB looked/VBN at/IN very/RB closely/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO take/VB a/DT brief/JJ ,/, critical/JJ look/NN at/IN the/DT accession/NN negotiations/NNS with/IN Malta/NNP and/CC would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ gratitude/NN to/TO ,/, and/CC admiration/VB for/IN ,/, the/DT many/JJ NGOs/NNS that/WDT have/VBP at/IN least/JJS rolled/VBN up/RP their/PRP$ sleeves/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO save/VB animals/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP already/RB had/VBN this/DT discussion/NN so/RB many/JJ times/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP achieved/VBN nothing/NN so/RB far/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN unable/JJ to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO say/VB first/RB that/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN is/VBZ an/DT environmental/JJ catastrophe/NN ,/, which/WDT also/RB impacts/VBZ on/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC threatens/VBZ livelihoods/NNS ./.

So/RB what/WP are/VBP we/PRP to/TO do/VB now/RB ?/.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT intention/NN of/IN talking/VBG about/IN past/JJ events/NNS ;/: rather/RB I/PRP want/VBP to/TO look/VB to/TO the/DT future/NN ./.

What/WP are/VBP we/PRP to/TO do/VB now/RB ?/.

I/PRP will/MD tell/VB you/PRP a/DT few/JJ things/NNS we/PRP should/MD do/VB ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP double-hulled/JJ vessels/NNS ./.

That/DT goes/VBZ without/IN saying/VBG ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT will/MD only/RB work/VB through/RP in/IN the/DT medium/NN and/CC long/JJ term/NN ./.

So/RB what/WP do/VBP we/PRP need/VB to/TO happen/VB immediately/RB ?/.

We/PRP need/VBP technical/JJ testing/NN of/IN ships/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ obligatory/JJ technical/JJ testing/NN every/DT two/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC no/DT ship/NN to/TO be/VB operated/VBN without/IN the/DT accompanying/VBG certificate/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP this/DT at/IN European/JJ level/NN and/CC internationally/RB ;/: we/PRP need/VBP something/NN like/IN a/DT T脙/NNP V/NNP ,/, an/DT organisation/NN that/WDT undertakes/VBZ technical/JJ testing/NN of/IN motor/NN vehicles/NNS in/IN Germany/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ compulsory/RB every/DT two/CD years/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT certificate/NN then/RB you/PRP are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO operate/VB the/DT vehicle/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP need/VBP for/IN ships/NNS ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO carry/VB out/RP checks/NNS on/IN these/DT safety/NN and/CC insurance/NN certificates/NNS in/IN the/DT ports/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ in/IN every/DT port/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Any/DT failure/NN to/TO produce/VB these/DT certificates/NNS must/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT ship/NN being/VBG laid/VBN up/RP and/CC prohibited/VBN from/IN leaving/VBG the/DT port/NN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN all/PDT the/DT port/NN charges/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD reach/VB agreement/NN here/RB ,/, in/IN all/PDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/'' s/NN ports/NNS ,/, from/IN Marseilles/NNP ,/, through/IN to/TO Rotterdam/NNP ,/, to/TO Wilhelmshaven/NNP ,/, Cuxhaven/NNP ,/, and/CC wherever/NNP ships/NNS drop/VBP anchor/VB ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP the/DT shipowner/NN to/TO bear/VB liability/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB just/RB to/TO the/DT tune/NN of/IN a/DT derisory/JJ USD/NN 12/CD million/CD ,/, but/CC to/TO the/DT value/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS USD/CD 400/CD million/CD ,/, to/TO be/VB covered/VBN per/IN insurance/NN certificate/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP the/DT country/NN whose/WP$ flag/NN the/DT ship/NN flies/VBZ to/TO bear/VB liability/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB sure/JJ that/IN if/IN need/MD be/VB ,/, the/DT country/NN whose/WP$ flag/NNS the/DT ship/NN is/VBZ flying/VBG will/MD accept/VB liability/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT marvellous/JJ exercise/NN in/IN supervision/UH !/. ./.

I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN those/DT countries/NNS awarding/NN flags/NNS would/MD then/RB take/VB great/JJ care/NN to/TO avoid/VB having/VBG to/TO accept/VB liability/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT fifth/JJ place/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP there/EX to/TO be/VB a/DT guarantee/NN that/IN these/DT demands/NNS will/MD apply/VB to/TO all/DT ships/NNS using/VBG the/DT ports/NNS and/CC waterways/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, and/CC incidentally/RB ,/, that/DT includes/VBZ the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

Last/JJ but/CC not/RB least/JJS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP a/DT long/JJ memory/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN legislation/NN will/MD crop/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT agenda/NN more/RBR frequently/RB in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ./.

Environmental/JJ standards/NNS will/MD be/VB a/DT recurring/VBG theme/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD not/RB like/VB to/TO have/VB someone/NN coming/VBG and/CC saying/VBG that/IN these/DT requirements/NNS will/MD lead/VB to/TO job/NN losses/NNS in/IN the/DT ports/NNS ./.

The/DT unions/NNS will/MD have/VB something/NN to/TO say/VB as/IN will/NN industry/NN ./.

A/DT long/JJ memory/NN will/MD serve/VB us/PRP well/RB ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP looking/VBG at/IN all/DT those/DT of/IN you/PRP who/WP have/VBP not/RB exactly/RB been/VBN at/IN the/DT forefront/NN of/IN the/DT environmental/JJ movement/NN ./.

Just/RB you/PRP go/VBP home/NN and/CC say/VBP :/: ''/'' we/PRP have/VBP not/RB concerned/VBN ourselves/PRP with/IN standards/NNS to/TO date/NN ''/'' ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT long/JJ memory/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT demands/NNS being/VBG made/VBN in/IN the/DT ports/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT long/JJ memory/NN when/WRB we/PRP say/VBP :/: ''/'' for/IN once/IN we/PRP are/VBP united/JJ ,/, at/RB last/JJ as/RB far/RB as/IN port/JJ charges/NNS and/CC requirements/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, and/CC will/MD not/RB play/VB one/CD off/RP against/IN the/DT other/JJ in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./. ''/'' ./.

If/IN we/PRP succeed/VBP in/IN this/DT then/RB perhaps/RB we/PRP will/MD be/VB better/JJR off/RP in/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS '/POS time/NN !/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP expressed/VBD very/RB many/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ thoughts/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP now/RB obtained/VBN a/DT first-rate/JJ enumeration/NN of/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN measures/NNS ./.

But/CC how/WRB do/VBP we/PRP make/VB use/NN of/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN crisis/NN to/TO which/WDT this/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN has/VBZ led/VBN ?/.

I/PRP would/MD compare/VB the/DT situation/NN with/IN an/DT earlier/JJR generation/NN '/POS s/JJ introduction/NN of/IN the/DT Plimsoll/JJ line/NN ,/, a/DT marking/NN which/WDT was/VBD introduced/VBN to/TO prevent/VB insurance/NN fraud/NN involving/VBG inferior/JJ vessels/NNS ./.

Where/WRB is/VBZ the/DT sense/NN of/IN crisis/NN which/WDT generations/VBZ before/IN us/PRP had/VBD ?/.

I/PRP consider/VBP that/IN what/WP we/PRP should/MD adopt/VB is/VBZ the/DT form/NN of/IN certification/NN that/IN Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP speaks/VBZ about/IN ,/, the/DT identification/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN green/JJ marks/NNS on/IN tankers/NNS which/WDT certain/JJ harbours/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP have/VBP brought/VBN up/RP for/IN discussion/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB critically/RB examine/VB the/DT classification/NN societies/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN we/PRP can/MD accept/VB their/PRP$ procedures/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP independent/JJ procedures/NNS and/CC procedures/NNS involving/VBG public/JJ control/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN ,/, when/WRB my/PRP$ country/NN provides/VBZ environmental/JJ aid/NN to/TO shipowners/NNS who/WP wish/VBP to/TO improve/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP units/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP who/WP regard/VBP this/DT as/RB prohibited/JJ aid/NN to/TO shipyards/NNS ./.

Within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, the/DT one/CD hand/NN does/VBZ not/RB know/VB what/WP the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT acceptable/JJ procedure/NN that/WDT measures/VBZ to/TO improve/VB the/DT environment/NN ,/, which/WDT are/VBP in/IN keeping/VBG with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ guidelines/NNS ,/, can/MD not/RB be/VB taken/VBN because/IN these/DT are/VBP considered/VBN to/TO constitute/VB prohibited/JJ aid/NN to/TO shipyards/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT GUE/NGL/NNP Group/NNP resolution/NN because/IN it/PRP denounces/VBZ Total-Fina/NNP '/POS s/JJ responsibility/NN in/IN this/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN and/CC I/PRP endorse/VBP the/DT proposal/NN that/IN flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN and/CC the/DT use/NN of/IN superannuated/JJ vessels/NNS should/MD be/VB prohibited/VBN ,/, or/CC that/IN double/JJ hulls/NNS should/MD be/VB mandatory/JJ for/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD only/RB add/VB that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB the/DT least/JJS that/IN Total/NNP could/MD do/VB to/TO compensate/VB for/IN the/DT direct/JJ and/CC indirect/JJ damage/NN caused/VBN by/IN the/DT oil/NN slick/NN ./.

How/WRB can/MD we/PRP stop/VB similar/JJ disasters/NNS occurring/VBG in/IN future/NN if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB institute/VB draconian/JJ measures/NNS against/IN the/DT major/JJ oil/NN corporations/NNS ,/, and/CC indeed/RB many/JJ others/NNS who/WP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB more/JJR profit/NN ,/, take/VBP the/DT risk/NN of/IN making/VBG the/DT world/NN uninhabitable/NN ?/.

How/WRB is/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ not/RB to/TO be/VB outraged/VBN when/WRB a/DT bank/NN refuses/VBZ to/TO divulge/VB the/DT names/NNS of/IN the/DT Erika/NNP '/POS s/JJ owners/NNS on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN professional/JJ confidentiality/NN ,/, without/IN governments/NNS reacting/VBG ?/.

The/DT crux/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN all/DT governments/NNS ,/, and/CC indeed/RB all/PDT the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, acknowledge/VBP the/DT right/NN of/IN major/JJ corporations/NNS such/JJ as/IN Total-Fina/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ ilk/NN to/TO maximise/VB profits/NNS whether/IN it/PRP be/VB harmful/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ employees/NNS or/CC to/TO the/DT environment/NN ./.

They/PRP accept/VBP the/DT professional/JJ confidentiality/NN of/IN business/NN and/CC banks/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN this/DT same/JJ confidentiality/NN serves/VBZ to/TO conceal/VB what/WP are/VBP essentially/RB criminal/JJ actions/NNS ./.

In/IN these/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, even/RB the/DT best/JJS resolutions/NNS will/MD remain/VB little/RB more/JJR than/IN appeals/NNS to/TO principle/NN which/WDT are/VBP powerless/JJ to/TO limit/VB the/DT great/JJ corporations/NNS '/POS capacity/NN to/TO cause/VB damage/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN tightening/VBG up/RP the/DT legislation/NN on/IN port/JJ state/NN control/NN and/CC on/IN classification/NN societies/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD stick/VB to/TO the/DT facts/NNS ./.

The/DT ship/NN Erika/NN has/VBZ been/VBN investigated/VBN four/CD times/NNS in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD years/NNS ./.

The/DT answer/NN can/MD not/RB lie/VB in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN investigations/NNS but/CC rather/RB in/IN guaranteeing/VBG the/DT rigour/NN with/IN which/WDT the/DT controls/NNS are/VBP undertaken/VBN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT discussions/NNS that/WDT have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS do/VBP not/RB have/VB enough/JJ money/NN to/TO undertake/VB the/DT controls/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB this/DT ./.

If/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS decide/VBP ,/, in/IN agreement/NN with/IN ourselves/PRP ,/, that/IN 25/CD %/NN of/IN ships/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB monitored/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN port/JJ state/NN control/NN ,/, then/RB they/PRP must/MD also/RB make/VB the/DT necessary/JJ personnel/NNS available/JJ ./.

The/DT controls/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT inspector/NN does/VBZ not/RB just/RB go/VB on/IN board/NN and/CC check/NN whether/IN there/EX are/VBP any/DT fire/NN extinguishers/JJ missing/VBG ,/, rather/RB there/EX must/MD be/VB materials/NNS testing/VBG ,/, for/IN this/DT ship/NN obviously/RB broke/VBD up/RP on/IN account/NN of/IN material/NN fatigue/NN ./.

This/DT can/MD only/RB be/VB detected/VBN if/IN controls/NNS undertaken/VBN are/VBP more/RBR rigorous/JJ ./.

It/PRP should/MD be/VB our/PRP$ goal/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN port/JJ state/NN controls/NNS are/VBP not/RB superficial/JJ ,/, but/CC include/VBP materials/NNS testing/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP also/RB share/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP '/POS s/JJ observations/NNS and/CC would/MD like/VB to/TO encourage/VB her/PRP to/TO continue/VB down/RP this/DT path/NN ./.

If/IN it/PRP should/MD become/VB apparent/JJ that/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR classification/NN companies/NNS have/VBP provided/VBN reports/NNS by/IN way/NN of/IN favours/NNS then/RB they/PRP should/MD be/VB struck/VBN off/RP the/DT list/NN of/IN authorised/JJ classification/NN companies/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ deterrent/NN we/PRP have/VBP for/IN preventing/VBG other/JJ classification/NN companies/NNS from/IN following/JJ suit/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP ,/, we/PRP already/RB have/VBP a/DT T脙/NNP V/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- organisation/NN for/IN safety/NN testing/NN -RRB-/-RRB- for/IN ships/NNS in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN the/DT classification/NN companies/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP reputable/JJ companies/NNS too/RB ./.

You/PRP will/MD be/VB familiar/JJ with/IN some/DT reputable/JJ companies/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ French/JJ fellow/JJ MEPs/NNS will/MD be/VB familiar/JJ with/IN some/DT reputable/JJ companies/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD look/VB carefully/RB at/IN exactly/RB which/WDT companies/NNS do/VBP not/RB fulfil/VB requirements/NNS ,/, and/CC these/DT must/MD be/VB struck/VBN off/RP the/DT list/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT Erika/NNP sank/VBD near/IN my/PRP$ home/NN and/CC is/VBZ still/RB there/RB ,/, with/IN 20/CD 000/CD tonnes/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ hold/NN ,/, the/DT fate/NN of/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP waiting/VBG to/TO discover/VB ./.

It/PRP could/MD have/VB sunk/VBN anywhere/RB ./.

It/PRP happened/VBD to/TO sink/VB there/RB ,/, and/CC Brittany/NNP ,/, where/WRB I/PRP come/VBP from/IN ,/, should/MD not/RB apologise/VB for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN geography/NN has/VBZ made/VBN it/PRP a/DT peninsula/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT result/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB forced/VBN to/TO clear/VB up/RP after/IN shipwrecks/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ first/JJ thoughts/NNS are/VBP for/IN the/DT 26/CD Indian/JJ sailors/NNS ,/, who/WP were/VBD saved/VBN but/CC of/IN whom/WP nothing/NN has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN ./.

By/IN now/RB they/PRP are/VBP far/RB away/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT miracle/NN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD saved/VBN ./.

So/IN we/PRP are/VBP now/RB experiencing/VBG the/DT same/JJ thing/NN that/WDT happened/VBD 20/CD years/NNS ago/RB with/IN the/DT Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP ;/: a/DT wreck/NN on/IN the/DT North/NNP coast/NN ,/, a/DT wreck/NN on/IN the/DT South/NNP coast/NN ,/, a/DT wreck/NN on/IN the/DT West/NNP coast/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, sanctions/NNS must/MD be/VB harmonised/VBN between/IN the/DT 15/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS ;/: they/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB different/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT same/JJ throughout/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB tougher/JJR on/IN vessels/NNS flying/VBG flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ,/, not/RB because/IN they/PRP are/VBP necessarily/RB bad/JJ boats/NNS ,/, but/CC because/RB amongst/IN these/DT boats/NNS there/EX are/VBP many/JJ bad/JJ ones/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD improve/VB information/NN on/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ ships/NNS ,/, but/CC provision/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN made/VBN for/IN this/DT ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT matter/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB who/WP owns/VBZ the/DT Erika/NNP ,/, because/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT legal/JJ person/NN under/IN our/PRP$ law/NN is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP always/RB real/JJ shareholders/NNS in/IN the/DT background/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB they/PRP are/VBP in/IN lovely/JJ villas/NNS by/IN lovely/JJ beaches/NNS ,/, getting/VBG a/DT nice/JJ tan/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB their/PRP$ names/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ faces/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, there/EX must/MD be/VB improvements/NNS in/IN the/DT training/NN of/IN crews/NNS ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ society/NN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT such/JJ thing/NN as/IN zero-risk/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD at/IN least/JJS ensure/VB the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ levels/NNS of/IN safety/NN ./.

Having/VBG spent/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN at/IN sea/NN myself/NNS I/PRP am/VBP well/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT sea/NN 's/POS power/NN and/CC destructive/JJ force/NN ,/, which/WDT make/VBP a/DT proper/JJ design/NN and/CC maintenance/NN of/IN ships/NNS and/CC boats/NNS essential/JJ ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT environmental/JJ disaster/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT deplorable/JJ waste/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN that/IN the/DT oil/NN industry/NN ,/, through/IN the/DT International/NNP Oil/NNP Pollution/NNP Compensation/NNP Funds/NNPS ,/, regards/VBZ itself/PRP as/RB liable/JJ under/IN the/DT 1969/CD Convention/NN and/CC its/PRP$ 1992/CD Protocol/NNP ,/, for/IN over/IN 90/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT estimated/VBN cost/NN of/IN this/DT incident/NN ,/, or/CC some/DT USD/JJ 170/CD million/CD ./.

This/DT suggests/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN we/PRP should/MD also/RB look/VB to/TO the/DT shipowners/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT flag/NN state/NN and/CC the/DT inspection/NN authorities/NNS to/TO shoulder/VB their/PRP$ share/NN of/IN the/DT responsibility/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, before/IN we/PRP rush/VBP in/IN with/IN a/DT whole/JJ raft/NN of/IN new/JJ measures/NNS and/CC new/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, let/VBD us/PRP look/VBP carefully/RB at/IN the/DT existing/JJ arrangements/NNS to/TO be/VB sure/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP being/VBG properly/RB implemented/VBN ./.

Better/NNP to/TO heed/VB calls/VBZ to/TO amend/VB and/CC improve/VB existing/JJ legislation/NN than/IN to/TO embark/VB on/IN new/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

In/IN that/DT context/NN I/PRP support/VBP calls/NNS to/TO strengthen/VB port/JJ state/NN control/NN to/TO ensure/VB full/JJ and/CC effective/JJ inspection/NN ./.

I/PRP support/VBP calls/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT classification/NN societies/NNS effectively/RB monitor/VBP vessels/NNS '/POS structural/JJ conditions/NNS and/CC are/VBP held/VBN accountable/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ actions/NNS ./.

Calls/NNS for/IN design/NN improvements/NNS in/IN hull/JJ construction/NN ,/, especially/RB double-hulled/JJ vessels/NNS ,/, are/VBP sensible/JJ but/CC take/VBP time/NN to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN throughout/IN the/DT fleet/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP no/DT substitute/NN for/IN rigorous/JJ regular/JJ inspection/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB my/PRP$ Socialist/JJ colleagues/NNS ,/, mainly/RB in/IN the/DT committees/NNS on/IN transport/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN ,/, who/WP have/VBP not/RB forgotten/VBN that/IN this/DT disaster/NN also/RB affects/VBZ the/DT fishing/NN industry/NN ./.

Because/IN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT irreparable/JJ damage/NN to/TO the/DT environment/NN ,/, the/DT damage/NN to/TO the/DT ecosystem/NN and/CC losses/NNS in/IN the/DT tourist/NN industry/NN ,/, the/DT oil/NN slick/NN dealt/VBD a/DT huge/JJ blow/NN to/TO the/DT fishing/NN industry/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT conservation/NN of/IN marine/JJ resources/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT damaged/VBN coast/NN lines/NNS will/MD take/VB years/NNS to/TO recover/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ no/DT accident/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT affected/VBN areas/NNS are/VBP always/RB those/DT European/JJ regions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP least/JJS developed/VBN ,/, those/DT which/WDT eke/VBP out/RP a/DT meagre/JJ existence/NN from/IN tourism/NN and/CC fishing/NN and/CC which/WDT ,/, in/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN cases/NNS ,/, do/VBP not/RB have/VB any/DT other/JJ resources/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT same/JJ areas/NNS ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, which/WDT already/RB have/VBP to/TO put/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT disrespectful/JJ activities/NNS of/IN certain/JJ shipowners/NNS who/WP empty/VBP the/DT bilges/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ vessels/NNS off/IN their/PRP$ coasts/NNS ,/, without/IN any/DT control/NN whatsoever/RB ./.

I/PRP come/VBP from/IN a/DT region/NN ,/, Galicia/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ suffered/VBN similar/JJ accidents/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

Brittany/NNP and/CC Galicia/NNP ,/, two/CD European/JJ `/`` Lands/NNP Ends/NNS '/'' ,/, fall/VBP constant/JJ prey/NN to/TO the/DT irresponsibility/NN of/IN those/DT who/WP prefer/VBP not/RB to/TO comply/VB with/IN safety/NN regulations/NNS and/CC transport/VB crude/JJ oil/NN in/IN vessels/NNS which/WDT in/IN themselves/PRP constitute/VBP potential/JJ oil/NN slicks/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO act/VB in/IN two/CD ways/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, the/DT current/JJ process/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS on/IN Malta/NNP '/POS s/JJ accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN this/DT country/NN rigorously/RB monitors/VBZ the/DT oil/NN tankers/NNS which/WDT sail/VBP under/IN its/PRP$ flag/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, prevention/NN is/VBZ essential/JJ ./.

Portugal/NNP is/VBZ a/DT country/NN which/WDT has/VBZ clearly/RB demonstrated/VBN its/PRP$ sensitivity/NN to/TO issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT sea/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP to/TO study/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN implementing/VBG a/DT complete/JJ strategy/NN for/IN the/DT prevention/NN of/IN maritime/JJ accidents/NNS at/IN European/JJ level/NN ,/, using/VBG all/PDT the/DT means/NNS at/IN our/PRP$ disposal/NN -/: technological/JJ ,/, structural/JJ and/CC socio-economic/JJ -/: to/TO prevent/VB a/DT disaster/NN such/JJ as/IN this/DT from/IN happening/VBG again/RB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO highlight/VB the/DT work/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT volunteers/NNS and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, who/WP reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN old/JJ times/NNS when/WRB ,/, as/IN the/DT then/JJ Mayoress/NNS ,/, I/PRP lived/VBD through/IN similar/JJ situations/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD thank/VB those/DT who/WP ,/, while/IN defenceless/NNS and/CC lacking/NNS in/IN resources/NNS ,/, have/VBP battled/VBN courageously/RB against/IN the/DT grave/JJ effects/NNS that/IN this/DT disaster/NN has/VBZ had/VBN on/IN coastal/JJ regions/NNS ,/, the/DT marine/JJ ecosystem/NN and/CC European/JJ fishing/NN stocks/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC in/RB particular/JJ Commissioner/NNP Loyola/NNP de/IN Palacio/NNP ,/, for/IN her/PRP$ reaction/NN to/TO this/DT incident/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ really/RB shaken/VBN the/DT whole/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP ,/, as/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Transport/NNP ,/, are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO discuss/VB the/DT Commission/NNP communication/NN on/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN safety/NN at/IN sea/NN and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP likewise/RB prepared/JJ to/TO discuss/VB ,/, at/IN a/DT later/JJ date/NN ,/, the/DT legal/JJ implications/NNS of/IN this/DT communication/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN comments/NNS :/: ./.

First/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD right/JJ to/TO concentrate/VB its/PRP$ investigation/NN on/IN the/DT liability/NN of/IN RINA/NNP ,/, the/DT Italian/JJ shipping/NN register/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB if/IN Community/NNP law/NN was/VBD applied/VBN ./.

That/DT should/MD be/VB the/DT starting/JJ point/NN for/IN our/PRP$ efforts/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, apart/RB from/IN the/DT shipowners/NNS '/POS liability/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ idea/NN in/IN such/JJ cases/NNS to/TO examine/VB the/DT liability/NN of/IN the/DT charterers/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN the/DT oil/NN companies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP also/RB responsible/JJ for/IN causing/VBG ecological/JJ disasters/NNS like/IN this/DT and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, for/IN restoring/VBG the/DT damage/NN ./.

Once/IN we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN that/DT ,/, our/PRP$ reaction/NN to/TO the/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN is/VBZ fully/RB justified/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT should/MD not/RB lead/VB us/PRP to/TO accuse/VB the/DT whole/JJ merchant/NN marine/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ sector/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, covering/VBG as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ 1/3/CD of/IN transport/NN requirements/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB our/PRP$ reaction/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB measured/VBN :/: strict/VBN ,/, but/CC correct/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT objection/NN to/TO examining/VBG an/DT amendment/NN making/VBG Community/NNP law/NN stricter/NNS but/CC ,/, as/IN other/JJ members/NNS have/VBP stressed/VBN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO start/VB with/IN application/NN ,/, because/IN there/EX is/VBZ already/RB a/DT legal/JJ framework/NN at/IN European/JJ Union/NNP level/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD not/RB lose/VB sight/NN of/IN that/DT fact/NN ./.

This/DT legal/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB advanced/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS if/IN you/PRP compare/VBP it/PRP with/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG at/IN worldwide/JJ level/NN and/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, under/IN the/DT supervision/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, should/MD endeavour/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Community/NNP law/NN is/VBZ actually/RB applied/VBN ./.

What/WP does/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP intend/VB to/TO do/VB with/IN Macedonia/NNP ?/.

Will/MD it/PRP do/VB the/DT same/JJ to/TO us/PRP ?/.

This/DT first/JJ step/NN is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ because/RB of/IN this/DT model/NN function/NN ./.

Macedonia/NNP also/RB serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT model/NN for/IN another/DT reason/NN ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ already/RB hinted/VBN at/IN this/DT in/IN no/DT uncertain/JJ terms/NNS ,/, namely/RB ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN interethnic/JJ relations/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN to/TO paint/VB too/RB much/RB of/IN an/DT idealistic/JJ picture/NN ./.

During/IN the/DT presidential/JJ elections/NNS ,/, it/PRP appeared/VBD that/IN things/NNS were/VBD not/RB running/VBG too/RB smoothly/RB ,/, but/CC compared/VBN to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, Macedonia/NNP could/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT model/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD gain/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN if/IN we/PRP managed/VBD to/TO export/VB this/DT model/NN to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT western/JJ Balkans/NNS with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN the/DT Macedonians/NNPS ./.

This/DT model/NN function/NN also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO regional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

I/PRP could/MD not/RB agree/VB more/JJR with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN :/: a/DT balance/NN must/MD be/VB struck/VBN between/IN promoting/VBG regional/JJ cooperation/NN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN and/CC maintaining/VBG the/DT openness/NN towards/IN Bulgaria/NNP and/CC Greece/NNP ,/, and/CC not/RB cutting/VBG them/PRP off/RP on/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, if/IN we/PRP manage/VBP this/DT first/JJ step/NN successfully/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB gained/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP mess/VBZ it/PRP up/RP ,/, then/RB we/PRP will/MD have/VB lost/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN more/RBR ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VB me/PRP begin/VB by/IN saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP have/VBP no/DT problem/NN with/IN approving/VBG this/DT very/RB sound/JJ report/NN in/IN principle/NN ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO point/VB to/TO one/CD issue/NN which/WDT in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN is/VBZ not/RB considered/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN and/CC which/WDT raises/VBZ a/DT major/JJ problem/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO Macedonia/NNP and/CC the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN EU/NNP financial/JJ and/CC other/JJ support/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO the/DT sanctions/NNS against/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

Do/VBP not/RB misunderstand/VB me/PRP :/: I/PRP too/RB believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB effective/JJ action/NN against/IN the/DT Milosevic/JJ regime/NN ./.

But/CC firstly/RB ,/, these/DT sanctions/NNS have/VBP a/DT far-reaching/JJ and/CC adverse/JJ impact/NN on/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT neighbouring/JJ states/NNS too/RB ,/, including/VBG Macedonia/NNP ,/, which/WDT find/VBP themselves/PRP in/IN an/DT extremely/RB difficult/JJ economic/JJ situation/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT entire/JJ population/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN accountable/JJ for/IN the/DT actions/NNS of/IN Milosevic/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ circle/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ wrong/JJ on/IN humanitarian/JJ grounds/NNS and/CC politically/RB counterproductive/JJ ./.

So/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD take/VB today/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN as/IN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO call/VB for/IN a/DT rapid/JJ end/NN to/TO the/DT policy/NN of/IN sanctions/NNS ,/, as/IN stated/VBN in/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 10/CD ./.

This/DT strategy/NN ,/, which/WDT took/VBD shape/NN in/IN the/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP adopted/VBD on/IN 10/CD June/NNP 1999/CD in/IN Cologne/NNP ,/, considers/VBZ south-east/JJ Europe/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, but/CC simultaneously/RB recognises/VBZ the/DT diversity/NN and/CC unequal/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ countries/NNS that/WDT compose/VBP the/DT region/NN ./.

The/DT assumption/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT countries/NNS are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO accept/VB a/DT certain/JJ set/NN of/IN conditions/NNS ./.

The/DT expectation/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP send/VB them/PRP a/DT politically/RB relevant/JJ signal/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO join/VB us/PRP one/CD day/NN ,/, maintaining/VBG respect/NN for/IN their/PRP$ sovereignty/NN of/IN course/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP suffered/VBN enough/RB ,/, first/RB under/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ yoke/NN and/CC then/RB from/IN the/DT high/JJ price/NN they/PRP paid/VBD for/IN being/VBG forced/VBN to/TO become/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT communist/JJ bloc/NN ./.

The/DT various/JJ references/NNS made/VBN to/TO regional/JJ cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS in/IN fact/NN become/VBP politically/RB relevant/JJ in/IN this/DT context/NN ./.

This/DT agreement/NN can/MD and/CC must/MD become/VB an/DT example/NN to/TO the/DT other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ ./.

The/DT point/NN is/VBZ that/IN underlying/JJ this/DT whole/JJ process/NN is/VBZ an/DT effective/JJ political/JJ will/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO draw/VB closer/RBR to/TO these/DT countries/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO join/VB in/IN the/DT unanimous/JJ chorus/NN from/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ Members/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP this/DT report/NN is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ masterpiece/NN of/IN hypocrisy/NN ./.

Paragraph/NNP 5/CD holds/VBZ up/RP this/DT agreement/NN as/IN an/DT example/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP there/EX are/VBP 13/CD applicant/NN countries/NNS ,/, from/IN Lithuania/NNP to/TO Turkey/NNP ,/, and/CC just/RB one/CD black/JJ hole/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, the/DT Balkans/NNPS ,/, but/CC because/IN these/DT countries/NNS are/VBP denied/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO become/VB applicants/NNS ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO make/VB them/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT agreement/NN is/VBZ a/DT miracle/NN ./.

Paragraph/NNP 11/CD indicates/VBZ that/IN symbolic/JJ measures/NNS can/MD replace/VB the/DT shared/VBN political/JJ outlook/NN represented/VBN by/IN applicant/NN status/NN ./.

But/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT masterpiece/NN of/IN hypocrisy/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB an/DT aberration/NN ,/, because/IN ,/, if/IN negotiations/NNS begin/VBP tomorrow/NN ,/, this/DT agreement/NN will/MD be/VB signed/VBN in/IN a/DT year/NN and/CC will/MD come/VB into/IN force/NN in/IN three/CD years/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP defy/VBP you/PRP to/TO imagine/VB that/IN there/EX will/MD not/RB be/VB membership/NN applications/NNS in/IN due/JJ form/NN from/IN Croatia/NNP ,/, Macedonia/NNP and/CC Bosnia/NNP ,/, amongst/IN the/DT Balkan/NNP countries/NNS ,/, three/CD years/NNS hence/RB ./.

A/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/RB Mr/NNP Racan/NNP announced/VBD that/IN Croatia/NNP '/POS s/JJ formal/JJ membership/NN application/NN would/MD be/VB presented/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2000/CD ./.

There/EX are/VBP bound/VBN to/TO be/VB other/JJ applications/NNS and/CC this/DT great/JJ work/NN ,/, this/DT fine/JJ intellectual/JJ architecture/NN ,/, will/MD crumble/VB ,/, left/VBD behind/RP by/IN events/NNS just/RB as/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN left/VBN behind/RP by/IN everything/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN happening/VBG in/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslavia/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ 20/CD years/NNS ./.

After/IN nearly/RB 10/CD years/NNS ,/, Greece/NNP continues/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB this/DT country/NN being/VBG called/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ name/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT interpreters/NNS have/VBP not/RB used/VBN the/DT term/NN FYROM/NN when/WRB I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN saying/VBG Macedonia/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB absurd/JJ ./.

Apart/RB from/IN anything/NN else/RB it/PRP is/VBZ offensive/JJ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT Greek/JJ MEPs/NNS and/CC the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Greece/NNP ./.

This/DT question/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB resolved/VBN urgently/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, by/IN happy/JJ chance/NN ,/, a/DT letter/NN from/IN Mr/NNP Georgievski/NNP ,/, President/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP to/TO Mr/NNP Fischler/NNP ,/, dated/JJ 8/CD March/NNP ,/, has/VBZ come/VBN into/IN my/PRP$ hands/NNS ./.

In/IN it/PRP ,/, referring/VBG to/TO Article/NNP O/NNP ,/, now/RB Article/NNP 49/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, he/PRP asks/VBZ if/IN Macedonia/NNP can/MD join/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Why/WRB has/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP not/RB informed/VBD us/PRP of/IN this/DT ?/.

Why/WRB has/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP not/RB informed/VBD us/PRP of/IN this/DT formal/JJ request/NN from/IN Macedonia/NNP ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT Balkans/NNPS are/VBP not/RB purely/RB a/DT dark/JJ cave/NN ,/, politically/RB speaking/NN ./.

The/DT decidedly/RB positive/JJ developments/NNS in/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP over/IN the/DT past/JJ critical/JJ years/NNS speak/VBP for/IN themselves/PRP ./.

The/DT gruesome/JJ escalation/NN of/IN ethnic/JJ violence/NN in/IN neighbouring/VBG Kosovo/NNP did/VBD not/RB reach/VB its/PRP$ territory/NN ./.

Paradoxically/RB ,/, but/CC truly/RB ,/, the/DT war/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP Polje/NNP generated/VBD exactly/RB the/DT opposite/JJ effect/NN :/: the/DT perilous/JJ gap/NN of/IN confidence/NN between/IN the/DT Macedonian/NNP majority/NN and/CC the/DT Albanian/NNP minority/NN became/VBD decidedly/RB smaller/JJR ./.

From/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT Macedonian/NNP majority/NN ,/, the/DT Albanian/NNP minority/NN behaved/VBD loyally/RB towards/IN the/DT common/JJ state/NN during/IN the/DT international/JJ explosion/NN of/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP conflict/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT eyes/NNS of/IN the/DT Albanian/NNP minority/NN ,/, the/DT Macedonians/NNPS and/CC the/DT Macedonian/JJ state/NN have/VBP more/RBR than/IN met/VBN their/PRP$ neighbourly/JJ obligations/NNS in/IN respect/NN of/IN Kosovo/NNP '/POS s/NNP Albanian/NNP majority/NN who/WP were/VBD persecuted/VBN to/TO the/DT extreme/NN ./.

This/DT remarkable/JJ upshot/NN of/IN the/DT Kosovar/NNP war/NN negotiations/NNS can/MD therefore/RB justifiably/RB be/VB seen/VBN as/IN the/DT internal/JJ ,/, political/JJ establishment/NN of/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP the/DT second/JJ time/NN round/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP '/POS s/CD well-balanced/JJ and/CC laudable/JJ report/NN fits/VBZ in/IN with/IN this/DT unexpected/JJ and/CC delightful/JJ upshot/NN on/IN a/DT very/RB practical/JJ level/NN ./.

In/IN brief/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP knows/VBZ what/WP to/TO do/VB in/IN Macedonia/NNP :/: to/TO help/VB this/DT local/JJ port/NN of/IN refuge/NN -/: recently/RB used/VBN by/IN scores/NNS of/IN war/NN refugees/NNS -/: to/TO fulfil/VB its/PRP$ role/NN properly/RB as/IN a/DT catalyst/NN for/IN the/DT planned/VBN Stability/NNP Pact/NNP in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN one/CD who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN concerned/VBN with/IN Macedonia/NNP for/IN eight/CD years/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO contradict/VB Mr/NNP Dupuis/NNP ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG here/RB is/VBZ not/RB hypocritical/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN a/DT propitious/JJ moment/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP the/DT Macedonians/NNPS are/VBP glad/JJ about/IN it/PRP ./.

Please/UH stop/VB being/VBG so/RB unpleasant/JJ and/CC pouring/VBG cold/JJ water/NN on/IN everything/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP should/MD take/VB a/DT more/RBR positive/JJ approach/NN here/RB ./.

Macedonia/NNP did/VBD not/RB go/VB through/IN a/DT war/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP suffered/VBD from/IN the/DT war/NN in/IN its/PRP$ vicinity/NN and/CC from/IN the/DT sanctions/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB suffering/VBG from/IN the/DT sanctions/NNS that/WDT were/VBD rightly/RB imposed/VBN on/IN the/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS ./.

It/PRP suffered/VBD enormously/RB from/IN the/DT influx/NN of/IN refugees/NNS during/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP war/NN ./.

So/IN we/PRP must/MD admit/VB that/IN developments/NNS in/IN Macedonia/NNP have/VBP followed/VBN surprisingly/RB continuous/JJ democratic/JJ lines/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT country/NN that/WDT has/VBZ difficult/JJ inter-ethnic/JJ problems/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN at/IN home/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ resolving/VBG them/PRP with/IN increasing/VBG success/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP emphasise/JJ that/IN we/PRP can/MD congratulate/VB Macedonia/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ exemplary/JJ legislation/NN on/IN ethnic/JJ minorities/NNS and/CC the/DT way/NN it/PRP applies/VBZ it/PRP and/CC that/IN the/DT consistent/JJ policy/NN of/IN integrating/VBG the/DT 30/CD %/NN of/IN ethnic/JJ Albanians/NNS in/IN government/NN activity/NN ,/, in/IN government/NN policy/NN and/CC in/IN society/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT precondition/NN for/IN peaceful/JJ coexistence/NN in/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT hope/NN Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP expressed/VBD in/IN his/PRP$ report/NN will/MD be/VB fulfilled/VBN early/RB in/IN March/NNP ,/, i.e./VBG that/IN we/PRP will/MD finally/RB have/VB an/DT EU/NNP delegation/NN there/RB and/CC that/IN we/PRP ,/, as/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, will/MD finally/RB have/VB a/DT greater/JJR role/NN to/TO play/VB there/RB ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS on/IN the/DT stability/NN and/CC association/NN process/NN is/VBZ the/DT logical/JJ conclusion/NN of/IN a/DT salutary/JJ and/CC positive/JJ trend/NN in/IN that/DT country/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT sign/NN of/IN our/PRP$ political/JJ commitment/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD finally/RB show/VB Macedonia/NNP in/IN practice/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP indeed/RB rewarding/VBG its/PRP$ own/JJ welcome/JJ regional/JJ cooperation/NN by/IN genuinely/RB embarking/JJ on/IN regional/JJ projects/NNS ./.

Let/VB me/PRP name/VB just/RB two/CD small/JJ ones/NNS :/: the/DT rapid/JJ resolution/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT frontier/NN crossing/VBG with/IN Kosovo/NNP in/IN Blace/NNP and/CC the/DT creation/NN of/IN Corridor/NNP 8/CD ,/, from/IN Albania/NNP via/IN Macedonia/NNP to/TO Bulgaria/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP has/VBZ drafted/VBN an/DT excellent/JJ report/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ my/PRP$ wholehearted/JJ support/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO compliment/NNP Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN that/IN so/RB many/JJ of/IN us/PRP are/VBP expressing/VBG support/NN for/IN the/DT approach/NN he/PRP has/VBZ adopted/VBN in/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT report/NN tackles/VBZ stability/NN in/IN the/DT region/NN in/IN a/DT structural/JJ manner/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB the/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT pending/VBG agreement/NN with/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG today/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT actual/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB started/VBN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ already/RB developed/VBN the/DT new/JJ instrument/NN ,/, entitled/VBN the/DT Stabilisation/NNP and/CC Association/NNP Agreement/NNP ./.

This/DT marks/VBZ the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT treaty-based/JJ stabilising/VBG process/NN for/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslavia/NN ./.

These/DT countries/NNS do/VBP not/RB yet/RB qualify/VB for/IN a/DT pre-accession/JJ agreement/NN ./.

The/DT present/JJ agreement/NN is/VBZ a/DT kind/NN of/IN pre-pre-agreement/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO joining/VBG in/IN future/NN ./.

The/DT instrument/NN of/IN joining/VBG countries/NNS together/RB by/IN means/NNS of/IN active/JJ treaties/NNS is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, provided/VBD that/IN the/DT agreements/NNS stipulated/VBD in/IN them/PRP are/VBP implemented/VBN dynamically/RB ,/, so/CC that/IN the/DT required/VBN stabilisation/NN can/MD actually/RB be/VB attained/VBN ./.

Macedonia/NNP remains/VBZ a/DT potential/JJ minefield/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT history/NN to/TO match/VB ./.

It/PRP does/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, have/VB the/DT ambition/NN to/TO break/VB free/JJ from/IN this/DT image/NN ./.

This/DT requires/VBZ internal/JJ stability/NN ./.

The/DT new/JJ government/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO tackle/VB this/DT matter/NN and/CC the/DT agreement/NN could/MD be/VB an/DT agenda/NN for/IN reforms/NNS ,/, including/VBG a/DT direct/JJ role/NN and/CC equality/NN for/IN the/DT Albanian/NNP minority/NN ./.

More/RBR than/IN anything/NN ,/, the/DT country/NN needs/VBZ peace/NN and/CC quiet/NN now/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO put/VB its/PRP$ internal/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN and/CC to/TO find/VB the/DT road/NN to/TO greater/JJR prosperity/NN ./.

We/PRP ,/, the/DT social/JJ democrats/NNS ,/, would/MD urge/VB the/DT opposition/NN to/TO back/VB these/DT ideas/NNS ./.

They/PRP need/VBP to/TO help/VB support/VB the/DT much-praised/JJ Macedonian/NNP model/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT country/NN also/RB -/: and/CC especially/RB -/: needs/VBZ external/JJ stability/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT point/NN of/IN having/VBG internal/JJ stability/NN if/IN the/DT surrounding/VBG environment/NN is/VBZ unstable/JJ ?/.

This/DT stability/NN is/VBZ required/VBN in/IN the/DT relations/NNS with/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ,/, Kosovo/NNP ,/, Albania/NNP and/CC Bulgaria/NNP ./.

The/DT region/NN should/MD recognise/VB that/IN Macedonia/NNP exists/VBZ and/CC that/IN it/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO exist/VB ./.

External/NNP stability/NN also/RB means/VBZ open/JJ borders/NNS and/CC regional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Minorities/NNS and/CC majorities/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB given/VBN room/NN for/IN human/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ exchange/NN ./.

Macedonia/NNP '/POS s/JJ stability/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/RB linked/VBN with/IN the/DT developments/NNS in/IN the/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Kosovo/NNP problem/NN is/VBZ well-known/JJ and/CC the/DT international/JJ community/NN is/VBZ present/JJ there/RB on/IN a/DT massive/JJ scale/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN the/DT Albania/NNP factor/NN is/VBZ being/VBG underestimated/VBN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP considers/VBZ it/PRP untimely/RB to/TO reach/VB a/DT stability/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN with/IN this/DT country/NN ./.

But/CC what/WP then/RB instead/RB ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT very/JJ argument/NN to/TO conclude/VB an/DT agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP and/CC not/RB yet/RB with/IN Albania/NNP that/RB cause/VB us/PRP so/RB much/JJ concern/NN ,/, so/RB much/RB so/RB that/IN a/DT passive/JJ stance/NN from/IN the/DT Union/NNP vis-脙/NNP -/: vis/NNP Albania/NNP is/VBZ really/RB not/RB acceptable/JJ ./.

What/WP does/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP intend/VB to/TO do/VB regarding/VBG this/DT issue/NN ?/.

Yugoslavia/NNP is/VBZ just/RB as/RB much/RB a/DT weak/JJ link/NN in/IN the/DT stability/NN process/NN and/CC ,/, as/RB such/JJ ,/, a/DT threat/NN to/TO Macedonia/NNP '/POS s/JJ stability/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO wait/VB and/CC see/VB what/WP happens/VBZ there/RB ./.

The/DT mood/NN in/IN Belgrade/NNP is/VBZ becoming/VBG less/RBR predictable/JJ by/IN the/DT day/NN ./.

We/PRP ,/, however/RB ,/, second/RB the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/VBZ decision/NN to/TO give/VB the/DT sanctions/NNS a/DT different/JJ focus/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS a/DT serious/JJ attempt/NN is/VBZ being/VBG made/VBN to/TO give/VB the/DT opposition/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ preparing/VBG for/IN a/DT new/JJ round/NN of/IN demonstrations/NNS ,/, a/DT shot/NN in/IN the/DT arm/NN ./.

What/WP else/RB will/MD the/DT Union/NNP undertake/VB in/IN this/DT respect/NN if/IN the/DT demand/NN from/IN the/DT opposition/NN -/: bringing/VBG forward/RP elections/NNS -/: is/VBZ met/VBN ?/.

What/WP else/RB can/MD we/PRP do/VB to/TO support/VB this/DT opposition/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Kosovo/NNP was/VBD hopefully/RB the/DT last/JJ occasion/NN on/IN which/WDT international/JJ law/NN could/MD be/VB interpreted/VBN as/IN saying/VBG that/IN dictators/NNS could/MD persecute/VB minorities/NNS in/IN the/DT most/RBS repellent/JJ way/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN ``/`` it/PRP is/VBZ happening/VBG within/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ nation/NN ''/'' ./.

When/WRB the/DT USA/NNP and/CC NATO/NNP and/NNP ,/, finally/RB ,/, also/RB the/DT EU/NNP ,/, reacted/VBD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD already/RB late/JJ ,/, in/IN fact/NN very/RB late/JJ ./.

A/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN suffering/NN could/MD have/VB been/VBN avoided/VBN if/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, among/IN others/NNS ,/, has/VBZ acted/VBN earlier/RBR and/CC more/RBR decisively/RB ./.

We/PRP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, therefore/RB have/VBP a/DT special/JJ responsibility/NN to/TO help/VB ,/, support/VB and/CC rebuild/VB the/DT Balkans/NNPS now/RB ./.

Our/PRP$ absolute/JJ objective/NN must/MD be/VB to/TO create/VB the/DT prior/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN all/DT countries/NNS in/IN south-east/JJ Europe/NNP to/TO be/VB integrated/VBN with/IN other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT EU/NNP -/: economically/RB ,/, politically/RB and/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN trade/NN ./.

Fertile/JJ soil/NN for/IN the/DT growth/NN of/IN democracy/NN in/IN this/DT war-ravaged/JJ part/NN of/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ best/RBS provided/VBN through/IN trade/NN and/CC economic/JJ integration/NN ./.

We/PRP Liberals/RB are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN and/CC to/TO do/VB so/RB quickly/RB ,/, just/RB as/IN Paolo/NNP Costa/NNP reported/VBD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB with/IN great/JJ satisfaction/NN that/IN we/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT proposal/NN that/WDT is/VBZ now/RB being/VBG made/VBN for/IN a/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN with/IN Macedonia/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP thank/VBP Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP for/IN a/DT very/RB good/JJ report/NN ./.

Macedonia/NNP deserves/VBZ our/PRP$ support/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT self-sacrificial/JJ ,/, disinterested/JJ work/NN which/WDT the/DT people/NNS and/CC leaders/NNS of/IN Macedonia/NNP undertook/VBD during/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP war/NN ./.

Now/RB that/IN Macedonia/NNP is/VBZ prising/VBG itself/PRP loose/RB from/IN the/DT crushing/VBG embrace/NN of/IN Communism/NNP and/CC nationalism/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ duty/NN to/TO act/VB and/CC provide/VB support/NN in/IN no/DT uncertain/JJ terms/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD do/VB exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ for/IN the/DT other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT urgent/JJ duty/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

The/DT man/NN who/WP is/VBZ accused/VBN of/IN genocide/NN and/CC who/WP ought/MD to/TO be/VB brought/VBN before/IN the/DT war/NN crimes/NNS tribunal/NN in/IN the/DT Hague/NNP still/RB goes/VBZ free/JJ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN Milosevic/NNP ./.

As/IN long/RB as/RB Milosevic/NNP is/VBZ still/RB there/RB and/CC Serbia/NNP is/VBZ not/RB pursuing/VBG a/DT democratic/JJ path/NN ,/, Serbia/NNP constitutes/VBZ a/DT constant/JJ threat/NN to/TO peace/NN throughout/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ,/, including/VBG in/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT agreement/NN being/VBG promoted/VBN will/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ application/NN of/IN the/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP in/IN south-eastern/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, ./.

All/DT this/DT ,/, in/IN exchange/NN for/IN the/DT promise/NN of/IN future/JJ accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT report/NN accepts/VBZ these/DT attitudes/NNS along/RP with/IN the/DT more/RBR general/JJ policy/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP on/IN south-eastern/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS basic/JJ aims/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ stability/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT Former/NNP Yugoslav/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP is/VBZ to/TO establish/VB stability/NN and/CC peace/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, presupposes/VBZ developing/VBG and/CC maintaining/VBG good/JJ neighbourly/NN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT countries/NNS involved/VBN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT demand/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB considered/VBN satisfied/JJ by/IN a/DT de/JJ jure/JJ full/JJ normalisation/NN of/IN FYROM/NNP '/POS s/JJ relations/NNS with/IN all/PDT its/PRP$ neighbours/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT agreement/NN we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG today/NN ,/, as/IN analysed/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP hope/VBP we/PRP will/MD adopt/VB tomorrow/NN ,/, constitutes/VBZ the/DT second/JJ politically/RB positive/JJ step/NN ,/, after/IN the/DT stability/NN pact/NN for/IN the/DT area/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ another/DT small/JJ step/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ related/VBN to/TO the/DT recent/JJ partial/JJ lifting/NN of/IN the/DT embargo/NN decided/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ 15/CD governments/NNS for/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

For/IN about/RB 10/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT situation/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN has/VBZ been/VBN fluid/JJ ./.

Both/DT as/IN an/DT historical/JJ period/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN particular/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT political/JJ period/NN ,/, 10/CD years/NNS is/VBZ a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN ./.

Under/IN those/DT conditions/NNS ,/, then/RB ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT real/JJ failure/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT sense/NN ,/, the/DT agreement/NN we/PRP will/MD be/VB voting/VBG on/IN tomorrow/NN ,/, which/WDT contributes/VBZ towards/IN stability/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, is/VBZ de/FW facto/FW a/DT move/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

In/IN essence/NN ,/, FYROM/NNP is/VBZ a/DT miniature/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslavia/NN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN where/WRB one/CD or/CC another/DT minority/NN holds/VBZ supremacy/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT area/NN ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN various/JJ policies/NNS from/IN time/NN to/TO time/NN ,/, and/CC what/WP the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD guard/VB against/IN is/VBZ the/DT risk/NN that/IN ,/, for/IN ultimately/RB superficial/JJ reasons/NNS ,/, it/PRP may/MD help/VB to/TO create/VB banana/NN republics/NNS elsewhere/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB sure/JJ that/IN ,/, in/IN seeking/VBG allies/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD not/RB always/RB choose/VB anyone/NN who/WP offers/VBZ ./.

Never/RB have/VBP the/DT parties/NNS been/VBN so/RB determined/VBN ./.

One/CD fundamental/JJ point/NN to/TO be/VB stressed/VBN is/VBZ the/DT balance/NN which/WDT must/MD be/VB expressed/VBN in/IN the/DT message/NN from/IN Europe/NNP and/CC which/WDT must/MD exist/VB between/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.

Following/VBG the/DT attack/NN in/IN Hadera/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, we/PRP must/MD repeat/VB our/PRP$ condemnation/NN of/IN any/DT form/NN of/IN terrorism/NN ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN balance/NN ,/, or/CC should/MD I/PRP say/VB imbalance/NN ,/, I/PRP must/MD add/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB regretted/VBN that/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ still/RB playing/VBG a/DT minor/JJ political/JJ role/NN in/IN resolving/VBG this/DT conflict/NN ./.

At/IN midday/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Gama/NNP referred/VBD to/TO the/DT financial/JJ and/CC commercial/JJ support/NN provided/VBN by/IN Europe/NNP to/TO the/DT region/NN ./.

Like/IN other/JJ Arab/JJ countries/NNS before/IN them/PRP ,/, the/DT Syrians/NNPS chose/VBD the/DT Americans/NNPS to/TO sponsor/VB the/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

Still/RB on/IN judicial/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, considerable/JJ progress/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN on/IN the/DT legal/JJ protection/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG consulted/VBN on/IN a/DT framework/NN decision/NN which/WDT is/VBZ of/IN fundamental/JJ strategic/JJ importance/NN ./.

The/DT French/NNP Presidency/NNP has/VBZ passed/VBN an/DT important/JJ working/VBG document/NN to/TO us/PRP which/WDT sets/VBZ out/RP various/JJ scenarios/NNS for/IN addressing/VBG and/CC resolving/VBG the/DT issues/NNS of/IN democratic/JJ control/NN and/CC judicial/JJ control/NN of/IN Europol/NNP ./.

The/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP will/MD shortly/RB be/VB presenting/VBG a/DT working/VBG document/NN on/IN the/DT Eurojust/NNP network/NN ,/, since/IN although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB obviously/RB necessary/JJ for/IN judicial/JJ control/NN of/IN Europol/NNP to/TO be/VB a/DT matter/NN for/IN Eurojust/NNP ,/, this/DT option/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB ruled/VBN out/RP at/IN present/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT first/JJ speech/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO share/VB with/IN Parliament/NNP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ events/NNS in/IN 1999/CD ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN I/PRP can/MD say/VB with/IN conviction/NN and/CC also/RB with/IN satisfaction/NN that/IN 1999/CD was/VBD both/DT a/DT turning/NN point/NN and/CC a/DT year/NN of/IN consolidation/NN by/IN the/DT Union/NNP on/IN issues/NNS of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN that/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP came/VBD into/IN force/NN in/IN May/NNP and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP stated/VBD that/IN the/DT most/RBS far-reaching/JJ innovation/NN in/IN this/DT Treaty/NNP was/VBD its/PRP$ recognition/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO establish/VB an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ commitment/NN to/TO establishing/VBG an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN was/VBD confirmed/VBN at/IN Tampere/NNP ./.

1999/CD was/VBD also/RB marked/VBN by/IN the/DT German/NNP Presidency/NNP '/POS s/JJ initiative/NN to/TO draw/VB up/RP a/DT European/NNP Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN at/IN the/DT present/JJ stage/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ development/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ to/TO bring/VB together/RP the/DT fundamental/JJ rights/NNS in/IN force/NN at/IN European/JJ Union/NNP level/NN in/IN a/DT charter/NN ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO make/VB them/PRP as/RB visible/JJ and/CC accessible/JJ as/IN possible/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ capacity/NN as/IN a/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT charter/NN and/CC the/DT actions/NNS stemming/VBG from/IN it/PRP represent/VBP an/DT affirmation/NN of/IN a/DT Union/NNP based/VBN on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN fundamental/JJ rights/NNS which/WDT are/VBP an/DT integral/JJ part/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ heritage/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO these/DT events/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB Parliament/NNP of/IN some/DT items/NNS that/WDT were/VBD approved/VBN in/IN 1999/CD ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB call/VBP on/IN the/DT Council/NNP representatives/NNS to/TO look/VB beyond/IN their/PRP$ national/JJ boundaries/NNS and/CC bring/VB about/IN a/DT uniform/JJ asylum/NN procedure/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ Union/NNP ./.

Similarly/RB ,/, it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB right/RB for/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ Member/JJ States/NNPS willing/JJ to/TO provide/VB help/VB to/TO bear/VB the/DT entire/JJ burden/NN of/IN refugee/NN misery/NN on/IN our/PRP$ continent/NN ./.

Agreement/NNP on/IN burden/NN sharing/NN must/MD therefore/RB be/VB at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Secondly/NNP :/: the/DT introduction/NN of/IN a/DT Europe-wide/JJ fight/NN against/IN organised/JJ crime/NN ,/, including/VBG by/IN Europol/NNP and/CC Eurojust/NNP ./.

The/DT planned/VBN introduction/NN of/IN Eurojust/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ significant/JJ successes/NNS from/IN Tampere/NNP and/CC must/MD now/RB be/VB implemented/VBN forthwith/RB ./.

We/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN Europol/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO start/VB work/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB just/RB calling/VBG for/IN more/JJR control/NN ,/, and/CC more/JJR control/NN over/IN Europol/NNP ;/: our/PRP$ motto/NN here/RB is/VBZ ``/`` Less/NNP is/VBZ sometimes/RB more/JJR !/. ''/'' ./.

With/IN most/JJS of/IN Europol/JJ employees/NNS currently/RB engaged/VBN in/IN self-control/NN for/IN the/DT purposes/NNS of/IN data/NN protection/NN laws/NNS and/CC questions/NNS being/VBG asked/VBN by/IN 15/CD national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, we/PRP may/MD have/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN control/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ inefficient/JJ control/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP less/RBR confusing/JJ control/NN and/CC more/JJR parliamentary/JJ control/NN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, without/IN hampering/VBG the/DT work/NN of/IN Europol/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP support/VBP the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ police/NN academy/NN as/IN suggested/VBD in/IN Tampere/NNP as/IN a/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

Thirdly/NNP :/: the/DT extension/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ rights/NNS in/IN this/DT context/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ therefore/RB an/DT urgent/JJ need/NN to/TO grant/VB Parliament/NNP codecision/NN rights/NNS in/IN this/DT respect/NN and/CC ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/VBN ,/, to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN democratic/JJ control/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN for/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, not/RB against/IN them/PRP ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB just/RB like/VB to/TO draw/VB Mr/NNP Dell/NNP '/POS Alba/NNP '/POS s/JJ attention/NN to/TO what/WP the/DT founding/VBG fathers/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP dreamed/VBN of/IN ./.

Take/VB a/DT look/NN at/IN Jean/NNP Monet/NNP '/POS s/JJ memoirs/NNS ./.

What/WP he/PRP envisaged/VBD was/VBD what/WP he/PRP called/VBD a/DT small/JJ ,/, practical/JJ secretariat/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB what/WP Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP is/VBZ President/NNP of/IN today/NN ./.

We/PRP accept/VBP that/IN Europeans/NNPS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT younger/JJR generation/NN ,/, need/VBP to/TO be/VB given/VBN a/DT broad/JJ perspective/NN of/IN where/WRB Europe/NNP will/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT years/NNS ahead/RB ./.

But/CC how/WRB are/VBP we/PRP to/TO succeed/VB when/WRB the/DT resources/NNS available/JJ are/VBP limited/JJ and/CC the/DT credibility/NN of/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS is/VBZ not/RB very/RB high/JJ ?/.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO match/VB this/DT vision/NN with/IN reality/NN ./.

Here/RB there/EX are/VBP three/CD elements/NNS I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO contribute/VB ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP a/DT successful/JJ European/JJ economy/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN unemployment/NN rates/NNS continue/VBP to/TO go/VB down/RP across/IN Europe/NNP ,/, confirm/VB the/DT trend/NN in/IN privatisation/NN and/CC deregulation/NN ,/, encourage/VB the/DT insertion/NN of/IN information/NN technology/NN and/CC knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT Internet/NN ,/, show/VB that/IN e-Europe/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ initiative/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP must/MD avoid/VB lurching/VBG back/RB into/IN the/DT old-style/JJ regulation/NN ,/, stifling/VBG individual/JJ initiative/NN and/CC enterprise/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB fear/VB globalisation/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD also/RB make/VB sure/JJ that/IN we/PRP understand/VBP its/PRP$ political/JJ impact/NN in/IN the/DT network/NN society/NN ./.

Without/IN a/DT successful/JJ European/JJ economy/NN we/PRP can/MD not/RB meet/VB the/DT challenges/NNS ahead/RB ,/, particularly/RB of/IN enlargement/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP legislate/VB only/RB when/WRB necessary/JJ -/: subsidiarity/RB ./.

Doing/NNP less/JJR but/CC better/JJR -/: a/DT central/JJ plank/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ Commission/NNP -/: needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT Commission/NNP too/RB ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB looking/VBG at/IN this/DT closely/RB when/WRB we/PRP come/VBP to/TO the/DT annual/JJ programmes/NNS of/IN proposed/VBN legislation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Bonde/NNP was/VBD right/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ this/DT image/NN of/IN doing/VBG less/RBR better/RB and/CC then/RB suddenly/RB we/PRP see/VBP an/DT annual/JJ programme/NN for/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD of/IN 500/CD proposals/NNS and/CC recommendations/NNS ,/, which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO go/VB in/IN a/DT different/JJ direction/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD establish/VB priorities/NNS and/CC make/VB sure/JJ there/EX is/VBZ value/NN for/IN money/NN in/IN each/DT of/IN these/DT programmes/NNS ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ proper/JJ ,/, genuine/JJ reform/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

Yes/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP -/: guardian/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS -/: is/VBZ meant/VBN to/TO be/VB an/DT independent/JJ body/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP also/RB has/VBZ to/TO be/VB accountable/JJ to/TO European/JJ citizens/NNS through/IN our/PRP$ Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT information/NN problem/NN ,/, which/WDT Mr/NNP Bonde/NNP just/RB referred/VBD to/TO ,/, is/VBZ treated/VBN like/IN a/DT straw/NN in/IN the/DT wind/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP seeming/NN to/TO restrict/VB information/NN to/TO us/PRP ,/, as/IN citizens/NNS and/CC as/IN parliamentarians/NNS ,/, although/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO it/PRP under/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN fact/NN today/NN a/DT European/JJ government/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB reflect/VB the/DT majority/NN in/IN this/DT particular/JJ Parliament/NNP ./.

We/PRP in/IN Parliament/NNP have/VBP a/DT major/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN the/DT shaping/NN of/IN governance/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT governance/NN therefore/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT sensitive/JJ governance/NN so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD actually/RB work/VB together/RB and/CC understand/VB that/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, has/VBZ its/PRP$ relevant/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB ./.

Therefore/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB credibility/NN ,/, coherence/NN and/CC confidence/NN that/IN in/IN working/VBG together/RB we/PRP can/MD restore/VB the/DT image/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, numerous/JJ steps/NNS have/VBP been/VBN taken/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, from/IN the/DT euro/NN to/TO resolutions/NNS on/IN a/DT common/JJ security/NN policy/NN ;/: even/RB to/TO the/DT response/NN by/IN the/DT 14/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP to/TO the/DT new/JJ coalition/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

I/PRP fully/RB endorse/VBP the/DT philosophy/NN and/CC the/DT principles/NNS behind/IN these/DT decisions/NNS ./.

That/DT does/VBZ not/RB apply/VB to/TO Austria/NNP alone/RB ./.

The/DT Union/NNP professes/VBZ its/PRP$ faith/NN in/IN its/PRP$ fundamental/JJ values/NNS in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP and/CC the/DT institutions/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP confirmed/VBD this/DT faith/NN once/RB again/RB when/WRB the/DT new/JJ coalition/NN was/VBD formed/VBN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT full/JJ potential/NN of/IN these/DT values/NNS will/MD only/RB be/VB realised/VBN if/IN they/PRP are/VBP set/VBN out/RP in/IN comprehensive/JJ detail/NN in/IN and/CC form/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP and/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, represent/VB legal/JJ claims/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN individual/JJ citizens/NNS ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ down/RP to/TO it/PRP ,/, Articles/NNP 6/CD and/CC 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD insist/VB ,/, and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO endorse/VB and/CC confirm/VB this/DT here/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT new/JJ Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS become/VBP part/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP and/CC create/VB binding/JJ ,/, enforceable/JJ rights/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD insist/VB on/IN building/VBG up/RP the/DT common/JJ area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN and/CC in/IN this/DT sense/NN I/PRP disagree/VBP with/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD speakers/NNS ./.

Only/JJ reasonable/JJ ,/, feasible/JJ and/CC humane/JJ principles/NNS of/IN immigration/NN and/CC asylum/NN law/NN can/MD counter/VB the/DT irrational/JJ ,/, misleading/JJ and/CC demagogic/JJ allegations/NNS of/IN the/DT extreme/JJ right/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB this/DT ,/, this/DT policy/NN must/MD also/RB be/VB accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT coherent/JJ and/CC convincing/JJ policy/NN to/TO promote/VB employment/NN and/CC prevent/VB social/JJ exclusion/NN because/IN unemployment/NN ,/, marginalisation/NN and/CC growing/NN inequality/NN are/VBP the/DT best/JJS breeding/VBG grounds/NNS for/IN anti-European/JJ ,/, nationalistic/JJ actions/NNS and/CC reactions/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB should/MD like/VB to/TO address/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN globalisation/NN which/WDT you/PRP speculated/VBD on/RP and/CC how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ perceived/VBN by/IN large/JJ segments/NNS of/IN the/DT population/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP ,/, like/IN everyone/NN else/RB ,/, has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB understood/VBN how/WRB to/TO present/VB the/DT EU/NN to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP as/IN a/DT means/NN of/IN protection/NN against/IN the/DT negative/JJ effects/NNS of/IN globalisation/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN building/VBG a/DT house/NN but/CC too/RB few/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS really/RB feel/VBP at/IN home/NN in/IN our/PRP$ house/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP says/VBZ about/IN boosting/VBG Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ voice/NN is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, the/DT USA/NNP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB our/PRP$ partner/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB our/PRP$ competitor/NN ;/: not/RB our/PRP$ opponent/NN ,/, our/PRP$ competitor/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD fight/VB to/TO see/VB which/WDT of/IN us/PRP offers/VBZ our/PRP$ citizens/NNS the/DT best/JJS model/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN what/WP we/PRP have/VBP said/VBN so/RB clearly/RB and/CC vehemently/RB here/RB today/NN will/MD also/RB be/VB reinforced/VBN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP documents/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, the/DT greatest/JJS legacy/NN which/WDT your/PRP$ Commission/NN could/MD pass/VB on/RP to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP would/MD be/VB to/TO help/VB resettle/NN and/CC redistribute/VB the/DT increasingly/RB jumbled/JJ and/CC confused/JJ powers/NNS and/CC competences/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB of/IN the/DT Union/NNP itself/PRP ./.

You/PRP have/VBP made/VBN a/DT bold/JJ start/NN by/IN rightly/RB emphasising/VBG the/DT need/NN to/TO focus/VB on/IN so-called/JJ ``/`` core/JJ tasks/NNS ''/'' ./.

That/DT ,/, as/IN you/PRP have/VBP said/VBD yourself/PRP today/NN ,/, means/VBZ that/IN you/PRP must/MD also/RB identify/VB tasks/NNS ,/, policies/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS which/WDT are/VBP peripheral/JJ or/CC irrelevant/JJ to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS main/JJ vocation/NN ./.

Many/JJ existing/JJ European/JJ Union/NNP policies/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS may/MD simply/RB have/VB passed/VBN their/PRP$ sell-by/JJ date/NN ,/, or/CC have/VB been/VBN proved/VBN unwieldy/JJ or/CC ineffective/JJ when/WRB administered/VBN at/IN European/JJ level/NN ./.

The/DT challenge/NN now/RB is/VBZ to/TO have/VB the/DT courage/NN to/TO devolve/VB as/RB many/JJ non-core/JJ tasks/NNS as/RB possible/JJ back/RP to/TO lower/JJR levels/NNS of/IN national/JJ ,/, regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ government/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO succeed/VB in/IN persuading/VBG a/DT sceptical/JJ European/JJ public/NN of/IN the/DT merits/NNS of/IN further/JJ European/JJ integration/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP as/RB active/JJ in/IN the/DT devolution/NN of/IN unwarranted/JJ EU/NNP powers/NNS as/IN we/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT evolution/NN of/IN new/JJ EU/NNP powers/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB allow/VB the/DT critics/NNS of/IN European/JJ integration/NN to/TO claim/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP presently/RB do/VBP with/IN some/DT justification/NN as/IN we/PRP have/VBP just/RB heard/VBN from/IN Mr/NNP Bonde/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT increase/NN in/IN EU/NNP responsibilities/NNS is/VBZ a/DT one-way/JJ street/NN only/RB ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB shown/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT two-way/JJ process/NN in/IN which/WDT existing/JJ EU/NN policies/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP not/RB clearly/RB justified/VBN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN subsidiarity/NN and/CC proportionality/NN ,/, are/VBP devolved/VBN and/CC repealed/VBN ./.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO match/VB these/DT aspirations/NNS with/IN actions/NNS in/IN the/DT years/NNS ahead/RB ,/, you/PRP will/MD be/VB making/VBG an/DT unprecedented/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN and/CC ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN today/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD enjoy/VB widespread/JJ support/NN in/IN this/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, you/PRP spoke/VBD about/IN fundamental/JJ political/JJ values/NNS ,/, and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ political/JJ values/NNS ,/, even/RB more/RBR important/JJ than/IN democracy/NN ,/, is/VBZ respect/NN for/IN others/NNS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB feel/VBP that/IN you/PRP acted/VBD correctly/RB in/IN sending/VBG a/DT message/NN and/CC that/IN perhaps/RB those/DT who/WP protested/VBD about/IN it/PRP are/VBP still/RB feeling/VBG the/DT effects/NNS of/IN Bolshevism/NNP or/CC Nazism/NNP ./.

Democracy/NNP means/VBZ dialogue/NN with/IN others/NNS and/CC making/NN others/NNS realise/VBP when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP wrong/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB listening/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ explanations/NNS ./.

Enlargement/NNP -/: and/CC Alleanza/NNP Nazionale/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN repeating/VBG this/DT for/IN ten/CD years/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP -/: must/MD not/RB mean/VB dilution/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP must/MD not/RB entail/VB more/JJR risks/NNS ./.

The/DT applicant/NN countries/NNS '/POS hopes/NNS are/VBP at/IN least/JJS as/RB important/JJ as/IN the/DT hopes/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ current/JJ fellow/JJ citizens/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP beginning/VBG to/TO feel/VB bitterly/RB disappointed/VBN by/IN the/DT way/NN Europe/NNP works/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB resolving/VBG the/DT most/RBS serious/JJ problems/NNS ./.

Even/RB today/NN ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB definite/JJ answers/NNS regarding/VBG the/DT monitoring/NN of/IN the/DT nuclear/JJ power/NN stations/NNS in/IN the/DT eastern/JJ republics/NNS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB need/VBP resources/NNS available/JJ to/TO spend/VB before/IN proceeding/VBG to/TO enlargement/VB ,/, so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD at/IN last/RB establish/VB a/DT European/JJ monitoring/NN body/NN responsible/JJ for/IN monitoring/VBG quality/NN of/IN life/NN and/CC living/NN conditions/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN creating/VBG a/DT new/JJ world/NN where/WRB such/JJ tragedies/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB occur/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS on/IN Africa/NNP ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ./.

The/DT third/JJ and/CC fourth/JJ worlds/NNS have/VBP been/VBN abandoned/VBN :/: just/RB one/CD dollar/NN ,/, one/CD and/CC a/DT half/JJ euro/NN would/MD be/VB enough/JJ to/TO save/VB a/DT great/JJ many/JJ children/NNS ./.

Europe/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ so/RB democratic/JJ ,/, so/RB progressive/JJ ,/, does/VBZ not/RB speak/VB out/RP or/CC take/VB these/DT tragic/JJ problems/NNS on/IN board/NN ,/, while/IN half/NN of/IN Africa/NNP is/VBZ dying/VBG of/IN Aids/NNP and/CC other/JJ diseases/NNS ./.

One/CD final/JJ remark/NN regarding/VBG the/DT Internet/NN and/CC globalisation/NN ./.

Globalisation/NNP of/IN the/DT economy/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB reduced/VBN to/TO product/NN and/CC quality/NN certification/NN ,/, just/RB as/IN the/DT globalisation/NN of/IN politics/NNS must/MD not/RB come/VB to/TO mean/VB levelling/VBG of/IN values/NNS or/CC dampening/VBG of/IN hopes/NNS and/CC enthusiasm/NN ./.

The/DT peoples/NNS which/WDT do/VBP not/RB participate/VB and/CC gradually/RB grow/VB more/JJR distant/NNS will/MD leave/VB the/DT way/NN open/JJ for/IN an/DT oligarchy/NN that/WDT will/MD take/VB power/NN and/CC leave/VB control/NN in/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN a/DT few/JJ ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT Internet/NN ,/, Europe/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB found/VBN the/DT courage/NN to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP need/VBP rules/NNS ./.

On/IN a/DT personal/JJ note/NN ,/, please/VB allow/VB me/PRP at/IN this/DT time/NN to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT pirates/NNS who/WP ,/, by/IN acting/VBG the/DT way/NN they/PRP are/VBP ,/, are/VBP forcing/VBG the/DT world/NN to/TO reflect/VB on/IN the/DT only/JJ system/NN which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB unregulated/JJ ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Members/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, five/CD months/NNS after/IN its/PRP$ coming/JJ into/IN office/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP committed/VBD to/TO paper/NN the/DT direction/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP aims/VBZ to/TO steer/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT ensuing/VBG document/NN is/VBZ both/DT ambitious/JJ and/CC bombastic/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, its/PRP$ President/NN perhaps/RB ,/, the/DT Council/NNP ?/.

You/PRP stated/VBD that/IN the/DT new/JJ European/JJ government/NN requires/VBZ strong/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT Commission/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO focus/VB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN on/IN its/PRP$ core/NN tasks/NNS ./.

We/PRP could/MD not/RB agree/VB more/JJR with/IN the/DT latter/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ high/JJ time/NN that/IN institutions/NNS restricted/VBN their/PRP$ scope/NN to/TO actual/JJ cross-border/JJ issues/NNS and/CC stopped/VBN decking/VBG out/RP the/DT European/JJ cart/NN with/IN powers/NNS which/WDT they/PRP are/VBP taking/VBG away/RP from/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

The/DT document/NN mentions/VBZ common/JJ values/NNS on/IN different/JJ occasions/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP find/VBP the/DT reference/NN to/TO the/DT relevant/JJ standards/NNS to/TO be/VB lacking/VBG ./.

This/DT raises/VBZ the/DT question/NN as/IN to/TO what/WP these/DT standards/NNS and/CC values/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/RP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN the/DT Bible/NNP ,/, God/NNP '/POS s/JJ word/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT only/RB pure/JJ source/NN of/IN proper/JJ standards/NNS and/CC real/JJ values/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT tradition/NN of/IN our/PRP$ continent/NN ,/, this/DT realisation/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ one/NN which/WDT merits/VBZ recognition/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ which/WDT to/TO go/VB by/IN :/: the/DT strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN 2000/CD to/TO 2005/CD or/CC your/PRP$ speech/NN for/IN 2000/CD to/TO 2010/CD ?/.

Have/VBP you/PRP already/RB included/VBN your/PRP$ second/JJ term/NN of/IN office/NN ?/.

But/CC seriously/RB ./.

As/IN it/PRP enlarges/VBZ ,/, the/DT Union/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB strengthened/VBN through/IN streamlining/NN and/CC demarcation/NN ./.

First/NNP ,/, streamlining/NN ./.

What/WP you/PRP say/VBP in/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN about/IN concentrating/VBG on/IN the/DT core/JJ functions/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ only/RB the/DT beginning/NN ./.

The/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT entire/JJ Union/NNP must/MD be/VB reduced/VBN to/TO core/JJ areas/NNS of/IN policy/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, a/DT social/JJ ,/, ecologically-orientated/JJ market/NN ,/, a/DT secure/JJ currency/NN ,/, guaranteed/VBD civil/JJ rights/NNS internally/RB and/CC representation/NN of/IN common/JJ interests/NNS externally/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO speak/VB out/RP in/IN the/DT world/NN with/IN one/CD voice/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB with/IN this/DT voice/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

Secondly/NNP ,/, the/DT new/JJ ``/`` in/IN ''/'' word/NN is/VBZ flexibility/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, increasing/VBG flexibility/NN can/MD or/CC quickly/RB threatens/VBZ to/TO turn/VB into/IN intergovernmentalisation/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD hold/VB fast/RB to/TO joint/JJ decision-making/JJ institutions/NNS which/WDT embrace/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

That/DT also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN the/DT civil/JJ society/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT welcome/JJ step/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ citizens/NNS do/VBP not/RB need/VB any/DT new/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC certainly/RB no/DT new/JJ mixing/NN of/IN powers/NNS ./.

Transparency/NNP does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB more/JJR access/NN to/TO more/JJR paper/NN ;/: to/TO our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ,/, transparency/RB means/VBZ greater/JJR clarity/NN at/IN long/RB last/JJ as/IN to/TO who/WP takes/VBZ decisions/NNS in/IN Brussels/NNP and/CC Strasbourg/NNP ,/, when/WRB and/CC with/IN what/WP right/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ transparency/JJ ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP can/MD not/RB and/CC should/MD not/RB enlarge/VB endlessly/RB ./.

Its/PRP$ borders/NNS are/VBP set/VBN not/RB by/IN how/WRB may/MD countries/NNS want/VBP to/TO join/VB ,/, but/CC by/IN how/WRB many/JJ countries/NNS it/PRP can/MD accommodate/VB ./.

If/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN enlargement/NN is/VBZ the/DT watering-down/NN or/CC even/RB the/DT break-up/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ Union/NNP ,/, then/RB it/PRP must/MD not/RB be/VB paid/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ too/RB high/JJ a/DT price/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ for/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS already/RB in/IN the/DT Union/NNP but/CC also/RB for/IN the/DT states/NNS which/WDT want/VBP to/TO join/VB the/DT Union/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT future/NN for/IN a/DT Union/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ merely/RB a/DT geo-strategic/JJ concept/NN or/CC for/IN a/DT Union/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ merely/RB a/DT free/JJ trade/NN zone/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT Union/NNP will/MD only/RB continue/VB to/TO be/VB more/JJR than/IN a/DT market/NN and/CC to/TO be/VB accredited/VBN by/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP if/IN it/PRP sees/VBZ itself/PRP as/IN a/DT community/NN of/IN destinies/NNS ./.

That/DT goes/VBZ far/RB beyond/IN your/PRP$ new/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ agenda/NN or/CC a/DT new/JJ ,/, better/JJR quality/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

Not/RB only/RB the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, not/RB only/JJ the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP but/CC also/RB the/DT people/NNS and/CC the/DT states/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ European/JJ Union/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO find/VB new/JJ answers/NNS to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB and/CC why/WRB we/PRP want/VBP to/TO live/VB and/CC work/VB together/RB ./.

In/IN doing/VBG so/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP ,/, no/DT less/RBR ,/, to/TO reinvent/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, but/CC without/IN destroying/VBG the/DT present/JJ Union/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP ,/, the/DT most/RBS important/JJ task/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT whole/JJ Union/NNP in/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS is/VBZ the/DT successful/JJ realisation/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD carry/VB on/IN negotiations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP a/DT decisive/JJ attempt/NN to/TO have/VB each/DT applicant/NN country/NN join/VB the/DT Union/NNP as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO see/VB to/TO it/PRP that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT achievements/NNS or/CC aims/NNS of/IN integration/NN that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN stated/VBN thus/RB far/RB are/VBP watered/VBG down/RP ./.

To/TO avoid/VB this/DT the/DT European/NNP Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS have/VBP expressed/VBN the/DT hope/NN that/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP will/MD consider/VB the/DT various/JJ models/NNS of/IN differentiated/JJ integration/NN and/CC create/VB a/DT concentric/JJ Union/NNP ,/, in/IN which/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT federal/JJ core/NN and/CC a/DT less/JJR integrated/VBN outer/JJ ring/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ differentiation/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP will/MD be/VB raised/VBN at/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

The/DT subject/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB discussed/VBN without/IN prejudice/NN ./.

A/DT technical/JJ improvement/NN in/IN the/DT flexibility/NN system/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB enough/JJ :/: we/PRP also/RB have/VBP to/TO raise/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN developing/VBG our/PRP$ institutions/NNS for/IN the/DT countries/NNS in/IN the/DT vanguard/NN as/IN proposed/VBD by/IN Jacques/NNP Delors/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, a/DT decision-making/JJ system/NN can/MD be/VB created/VBN that/IN is/VBZ more/RBR effective/JJ ,/, clearer/JJR ,/, more/RBR open/JJ and/CC more/RBR democratic/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD make/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ proposal/NN concerning/VBG how/WRB the/DT expanding/NNP Union/NNP might/MD implement/VB its/PRP$ institutional/JJ and/CC other/JJ differentiation/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNP ,/, your/PRP$ inspiring/JJ speech/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, has/VBZ quite/RB won/VBN me/PRP over/RP ./.

It/PRP raises/VBZ expectations/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP can/MD also/RB lead/VB to/TO disappointment/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ connected/VBN to/TO what/WP Mr/NNP Van/NNP Velzen/NNP was/VBD just/RB saying/VBG ,/, about/IN the/DT difference/NN between/IN words/NNS and/CC deeds/NNS ./.

The/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ wish/NN for/IN peace/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC stability/NN ./.

You/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG to/TO reassure/VB the/DT acceding/JJ countries/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN European/JJ opinion/NN ./.

But/CC these/DT days/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG the/DT exact/JJ reverse/NN before/IN our/PRP$ very/JJ eyes/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP noted/VBN increasing/VBG levels/NNS of/IN apprehension/NN and/CC disquiet/NN ,/, even/RB within/IN regions/NNS where/WRB unemployment/NN is/VBZ quite/RB low/JJ and/CC prosperity/RB very/RB high/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB our/PRP$ citizens/NNS feel/VB at/IN home/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP agree/VBP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT place/NN where/WRB we/PRP share/VBP the/DT same/JJ values/NNS and/CC where/WRB each/DT and/CC one/CD of/IN us/PRP also/RB have/VBP our/PRP$ own/JJ task/NN and/CC responsibility/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB linked/VBN to/TO the/DT standards/NNS mentioned/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Van/NNP Dam/NNP ,/, namely/RB subsidiarity/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT clear/JJ division/NN of/IN responsibility/NN among/IN all/DT levels/NNS of/IN authority/NN and/CC to/TO be/VB partners/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN competitors/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB necessary/JJ to/TO exercise/VB authority/NN as/IN closely/RB as/RB possible/JJ to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, where/WRB it/PRP can/MD be/VB exercised/VBN with/IN due/JJ transparency/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB monitored/VBN by/IN the/DT citizens/NNS themselves/PRP ./.

That/DT will/MD require/VB a/DT new/JJ political/JJ culture/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN words/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN practice/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD take/VB into/IN consideration/NN the/DT reality/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC regions/NNS ./.

Regions/NNS which/WDT ,/, culturally/JJ and/CC economically/RB ,/, sometimes/RB match/VBP the/DT interest/NN of/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT new/JJ Europe/NNP should/MD not/RB only/RB expand/VB horizontally/RB ,/, but/CC also/RB vertically/RB ,/, by/IN living/VBG by/IN our/PRP$ values/NNS in/IN practice/NN and/CC by/IN developing/VBG a/DT democratic/JJ structure/NN of/IN a/DT real/JJ community/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB judged/VBN on/RP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ today/NN presenting/VBG its/PRP$ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN 2000-2005/CD ./.

These/DT are/VBP contained/VBN in/IN an/DT extremely/RB general/JJ document/NN in/IN which/WDT all/PDT the/DT problems/NNS have/VBP been/VBN glossed/VBN over/RP to/TO prevent/VB any/DT conflict/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN on/IN the/DT new/JJ forms/NNS of/IN European/JJ governance/NN ,/, the/DT words/NNS `/`` federalism/JJ '/'' and/CC `/`` superstate/JJ '/'' are/VBP not/RB mentioned/VBN at/IN all/DT ./.

These/DT ambiguities/NNS mask/VBZ many/JJ misunderstandings/NNS ,/, primarily/RB about/IN our/PRP$ values/NNS ./.

The/DT inconsistency/NN is/VBZ astonishing/JJ ./.

Here/RB too/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP mentioned/VBD another/DT good/JJ example/NN regarding/VBG the/DT new/JJ Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ./.

If/IN the/DT new/JJ Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP is/VBZ simply/RB put/VBN into/IN operation/NN ,/, without/IN eradicating/VBG all/PDT these/DT inconsistencies/NNS from/IN the/DT policy/NN ,/, the/DT policy/NN will/MD then/RB be/VB built/VBN on/IN shifting/VBG sands/NNS -/: to/TO use/VB a/DT biblical/JJ expression/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ quoted/VBN examples/NNS of/IN inconsistency/JJ time/NN after/IN time/NN :/: in/IN agriculture/NN ,/, commerce/NN ,/, in/IN conflict/NN prevention/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT peace/NN operations/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT fisheries/VBN sector/NN ,/, migration/NN and/CC environment/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP ,/, what/WP we/PRP are/VBP waiting/VBG for/IN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ report/NN on/IN these/DT inconsistencies/NNS and/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN specific/JJ proposals/NNS to/TO eliminate/VB these/DT from/IN the/DT policy/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, all/DT your/PRP$ fine/NN examples/NNS ,/, your/PRP$ marvellous/JJ policy/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP include/VBP the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP in/IN this/DT -/: will/MD otherwise/RB be/VB built/VBN on/IN shifting/VBG sands/NNS and/CC will/MD not/RB really/RB come/VB off/RP the/DT ground/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB at/IN the/DT request/NN of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN saying/VBG this/DT ourselves/NN since/IN back/RB in/IN 1992/CD :/: this/DT is/VBZ the/DT topic/NN of/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT message/NN strikes/NNS home/NN and/CC I/PRP really/RB hope/VBP that/IN you/PRP will/MD soon/RB produce/VB a/DT report/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ measures/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, following/VBG the/DT same/JJ line/NN as/IN Mrs/NNP Maij-Weggen/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN representatives/NNS here/RB who/WP all/DT feel/VBP passionate/JJ about/IN contributing/VBG to/TO this/DT debate/NN ./.

The/DT topic/NN touches/VBZ the/DT very/JJ core/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT objectives/NNS which/WDT each/DT EU/NNP policy/NN needs/VBZ to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN ?/.

Article/NNP 177/NNP specifies/VBZ these/DT objectives/NNS as/IN ``/`` sustainable/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, and/CC more/RBR particularly/RB the/DT most/RBS disadvantaged/JJ among/IN them/PRP ''/'' ,/, the/DT ``/`` smooth/JJ and/CC gradual/JJ integration/NN of/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS into/IN the/DT world/NN economy/NN and/CC the/DT campaign/NN against/IN poverty/NN in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ''/'' ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, these/DT are/VBP no/RB arbitrary/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP articles/NNS ,/, statutory/JJ articles/NNS ,/, which/WDT form/VBP part/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ acquis/NNS established/VBN by/IN law/NN with/IN which/WDT the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD comply/VB ./.

Every/DT statutory/JJ article/NN should/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB be/VB judged/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ regularity/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN its/PRP$ contents/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN -/: and/CC luckily/RB I/PRP am/VBP not/RB alone/RB in/IN this/DT -/: that/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN policy/NN coherence/NN is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO every/DT government/NN which/WDT aims/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT credible/JJ servant/NN of/IN its/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

The/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS are/VBP only/RB served/VBN by/IN a/DT credible/JJ and/CC reliable/JJ government/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ if/IN the/DT government/NN wants/VBZ to/TO gain/VB the/DT trust/NN of/IN society/NN ,/, and/CC also/RB important/JJ from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN effectiveness/NN ,/, for/IN coherence/NN is/VBZ required/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO use/VB the/DT restricted/JJ means/NNS efficiently/RB ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB make/VB reality/NN out/RP to/TO be/VB more/RBR rose-tinted/JJ than/IN it/PRP really/RB is/VBZ ./.

Reality/NN is/VBZ obstinate/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ up/RB to/TO the/DT government/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN this/DT fact/NN in/IN a/DT transparent/JJ and/CC open/JJ manner/NN ,/, without/IN any/DT backhandedness/NNS ./.

The/DT government/NN is/VBZ obliged/JJ to/TO show/VB up/RP any/DT of/IN its/PRP$ dilemmas/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO show/VB where/WRB ,/, when/WRB and/CC why/WRB ,/, problems/NNS occur/VBP with/IN coherence/NN of/IN policy/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN sweeping/VBG it/PRP all/DT under/IN the/DT carpet/NN ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN here/RB today/NN is/VBZ not/RB an/DT issue/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB toyed/VBN with/IN at/IN leisure/NN ./.

Poverty/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ world/NN is/VBZ a/DT harrowing/JJ problem/NN that/WDT demands/VBZ urgent/JJ attention/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB natural/JJ that/IN we/PRP in/IN Parliament/NNP guard/VBP the/DT interests/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB in/IN the/DT interest/NN of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS to/TO live/VB in/IN a/DT stable/JJ ,/, international/JJ environment/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT goal/NN of/IN human/JJ safety/NN is/VBZ pursued/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT moral/JJ interest/NN ,/, a/DT safety/NN interest/NN and/CC is/VBZ ,/, ultimately/RB ,/, even/RB in/IN the/DT interest/NN of/IN our/PRP$ economy/NN ./.

In/IN whose/WP$ interest/NN is/VBZ it/PRP really/RB if/IN European/JJ taxpayers/NNS '/POS money/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO support/VB economic/JJ development/NN in/IN Namibia/NNP ,/, and/CC if/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT economic/JJ activity/NN of/IN poor/JJ cattle/NNS farmers/NNS in/IN the/DT same/JJ country/NN is/VBZ drastically/RB undercut/JJ by/IN rigorous/JJ export/NN subsidies/NNS ,/, financed/VBN by/IN the/DT same/JJ tax/NN payers/NNS ?/.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB acting/VBG as/RB if/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB really/RB happening/VBG ,/, but/CC we/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB our/PRP$ task/NN as/IN MEPs/NNP to/TO adopt/VB an/DT ostrich/JJ policy/NN and/CC bury/VB our/PRP$ heads/NNS in/IN the/DT sand/NN ./.

The/DT general/JJ interest/NN of/IN policy/NN coherence/NN is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, a/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, and/CC of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

This/DT responsibility/NN can/MD not/RB only/RB be/VB borne/VBN by/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN Development/NNP and/CC Humanitarian/NNP Aid/NNP ,/, however/RB much/RB we/PRP like/VBP to/TO see/VB him/PRP or/CC hear/VB him/PRP talk/VB ,/, or/CC by/IN the/DT Development/NNP Council/NNP or/CC the/DT parliamentary/JJ Committee/NN on/IN Development/NNP and/CC Cooperation/NNP ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP here/RB is/VBZ an/DT integral/JJ approach/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP urge/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN this/DT sharp/JJ and/CC clear/JJ resolution/NN ,/, to/TO develop/VB specific/JJ instruments/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO pinpoint/VB ,/, and/CC draw/VB up/RP an/DT inventory/NN of/IN ,/, the/DT problem/NN areas/NNS for/IN coherence/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP evident/JJ which/WDT problems/NNS we/PRP are/VBP solving/VBG and/CC which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB solved/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP advocate/VBP a/DT monitoring/VBG centre/NN for/IN coherence/NN which/WDT makes/VBZ this/DT apparent/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO set/VB up/RP inter-service/JJ task/NN groups/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC in/IN Parliament/NNP which/WDT can/MD police/VB the/DT attainment/NN of/IN coherence/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, if/IN our/PRP$ neighbour/NN '/POS s/JJ roof/NN is/VBZ leaking/VBG ,/, we/PRP can/MD lend/VB him/PRP pots/NNS and/CC pans/NNS to/TO collect/VB the/DT water/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, more/RBR effective/JJ to/TO help/VB him/PRP plug/VB the/DT leak/NN in/IN the/DT roof/NN ./.

The/DT crisis/NN in/IN last/JJ year/NN '/POS s/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN solved/VBN today/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD now/RB produce/VB a/DT policy/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP get/VBP full/JJ support/NN for/IN a/DT coherent/JJ approach/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, no/DT doubt/NN ,/, the/DT entire/JJ Parliament/NNP will/MD soon/RB demand/VB in/IN the/DT resolution/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD wish/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP all/PDT the/DT best/JJS in/IN his/PRP$ battle/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC wish/VBP Mr/NNP Amado/NNP the/DT same/JJ within/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VB us/PRP be/VB clear/JJ from/IN the/DT outset/NN :/: when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO cooperation/NN ,/, coherence/NN is/VBZ far/RB from/IN being/VBG the/DT watchword/NN ./.

The/DT Treaties/NNPS provide/VBP for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO help/VB developing/VBG countries/NNS to/TO develop/VB but/CC ,/, as/IN the/DT previous/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP explained/VBN so/RB well/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP various/JJ distortions/NNS to/TO these/DT declarations/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ area/NN of/IN incoherence/NN is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN consultation/NN between/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS on/IN individual/JJ cooperation/NN policies/NNS ./.

This/DT gives/VBZ rise/NN to/TO serious/JJ malfunctions/NNS ,/, because/IN some/DT Community/NNP programmes/NNS duplicate/VB national/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, whereas/IN they/PRP might/MD have/VB helped/VBN other/JJ projects/NNS about/IN which/WDT nothing/NN is/VBZ done/VBN ./.

The/DT second/JJ area/NN of/IN incoherence/NN is/VBZ aid/NN to/TO authoritarian/JJ regimes/NNS ./.

We/PRP state/VBP that/IN good/JJ governance/NN and/CC an/DT end/NN to/TO corruption/NN are/VBP mandatory/JJ but/CC we/PRP continue/VBP to/TO pour/VB hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN euros/NNS into/IN Swiss/JJ bank/NN accounts/NNS via/IN the/DT portfolios/NNS of/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN Heads/NNP of/IN State/NNP ./.

The/DT third/JJ area/NN of/IN incoherence/NN is/VBZ human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP say/VBP that/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO protect/VB human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP encourage/VBP developing/VBG countries/NNS to/TO respect/VB human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP even/RB adopt/VBP numerous/JJ resolutions/NNS condemning/VBG every/DT violation/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP ally/VBD ourselves/PRP with/IN demonstrations/NNS and/CC international/JJ campaigns/NNS ./.

And/CC yet/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP allow/VBP the/DT arms/NNS trade/NN to/TO proliferate/NNP and/CC do/VBP not/RB even/RB attempt/VB to/TO limit/VB the/DT trade/NN in/IN the/DT most/RBS atrocious/JJ forms/NNS of/IN arms/NNS such/JJ as/IN anti-personnel/JJ mines/NNS ./.

Nor/CC do/VBP we/PRP do/VB much/JJ to/TO really/RB prevent/VB human/JJ rights/NNS violations/NNS ./.

The/DT fourth/JJ area/NN of/IN incoherence/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ cooperation/NN policy/NN is/VBZ this/DT :/: how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP expect/VB to/TO help/VB development/NN by/IN pillaging/VBG the/DT natural/JJ resources/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS you/PRP are/VBP helping/VBG ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD leave/VB fish/NN for/IN local/JJ fishermen/NNS to/TO feed/VB local/JJ populations/NNS instead/RB of/IN systematically/RB destroying/VBG maritime/JJ resources/NNS through/IN intensive/JJ fisheries/NNS ./.

These/DT agreements/NNS risk/VBP being/VBG extended/VBN to/TO living/VBG organisms/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD mean/VB the/DT death/NN of/IN biodiversity/NN and/CC the/DT return/NN of/IN de/FW facto/FW slavery/NN for/IN small-scale/JJ farmers/NNS in/IN the/DT south/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN the/DT multinationals/NNS ./.

The/DT eighth/JJ area/NN of/IN incoherence/NN is/VBZ of/IN a/DT political/JJ and/CC practical/JJ nature/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP always/RB saying/VBG think/VB globally/RB ,/, act/VB locally/RB ./.

And/CC yet/RB we/PRP disregard/VBZ local/JJ development/NN agencies/NNS and/CC prefer/VBP to/TO negotiate/VB with/IN national/JJ governments/NNS and/CC subsidise/VB northern/JJ NGOs/NNS at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN local/JJ programmes/NNS and/CC southern/JJ NGOs/NNS ./.

Still/RB more/JJR problems/NNS ,/, still/RB more/JJR areas/NNS of/IN incoherence/NN which/WDT I/PRP might/MD have/VB highlighted/VBN ,/, not/RB to/TO mention/VB research/NN ,/, emigration/NN or/CC health/NN ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, we/PRP claim/VBP that/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO help/VB developing/VBG countries/NNS and/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP encourage/VBP the/DT liberalisation/NN of/IN trade/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP acknowledge/VBP runs/NNS counter/RB to/TO that/DT very/JJ objective/NN ./.

I/PRP say/VBP it/PRP again/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/NN cooperation/NN and/CC development/NN policy/NN is/VBZ not/RB coherent/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB timely/JJ and/CC appropriate/JJ ,/, not/RB just/RB because/IN development/NN is/VBZ in/IN general/JJ an/DT important/JJ issue/NN ,/, but/CC because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT topical/JJ one/NN ./.

Seattle/NNP was/VBD a/DT failure/NN ,/, and/CC north-south/JJ relations/NNS were/VBD in/IN the/DT spotlight/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT wrong/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

The/DT meeting/NN held/VBN in/IN that/DT North/NNP American/NNP city/NN demonstrated/VBD that/IN globalisation/NN is/VBZ having/VBG seriously/RB unbalanced/VBN and/CC negative/JJ effects/NNS on/IN poorer/JJR countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Tenth/NNP United/NNP Nations/NNPS Conference/NNP on/IN Trade/NNP and/CC Development/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN right/RB now/RB in/IN Bangkok/NNP ,/, and/CC is/VBZ suffering/VBG the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN that/DT failure/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, as/IN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN ,/, the/DT negotiations/NNS on/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP have/VBP been/VBN concluded/VBN ./.

This/DT goes/VBZ to/TO show/VB just/RB how/WRB topical/JJ this/DT subject/NN is/VBZ ./.

We/PRP could/MD also/RB add/VB to/TO the/DT list/NN the/DT next/JJ EU-OAU/JJ summit/NN which/WDT it/PRP has/VBZ finally/RB been/VBN agreed/VBN to/TO hold/VB in/IN Cairo/NNP in/IN April/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO add/VB that/IN any/DT analysis/NN ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB superficial/JJ ,/, inevitably/RB leads/VBZ us/PRP to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN something/NN -/: or/CC even/RB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN -/: is/VBZ amiss/JJ with/IN north-south/JJ relations/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT less/RBR developed/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT recent/JJ Community/NNP budget/NN cuts/VBZ in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT present/JJ financial/JJ year/NN ,/, are/VBP part/NN of/IN this/DT trend/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN sending/VBG an/DT undesirable/JJ and/CC misguided/JJ political/JJ message/NN ./.

It/PRP may/MD seem/VB ironic/JJ that/IN this/DT statement/NN should/MD come/VB from/IN someone/NN in/IN his/PRP$ position/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP did/VBD indeed/RB say/VB this/DT ,/, and/CC I/PRP heard/VBD it/PRP with/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ ears/NNS ./.

This/DT comment/NN certainly/RB seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO reflect/VB the/DT current/JJ situation/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP accordingly/RB wish/VBP to/TO stress/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO rethink/VB north-south/JJ relations/NNS and/CC break/VB the/DT mould/NN ./.

A/DT new/JJ agreement/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reached/VBN with/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ development/NN in/IN itself/PRP ,/, especially/RB given/VBN the/DT pressures/NNS to/TO terminate/VB it/PRP and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN various/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS did/VBD not/RB wish/VB it/PRP to/TO continue/VB ./.

Certain/JJ politically/RB important/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ partnership/NN agreement/NN will/MD have/VB contributed/VBN to/TO these/DT ./.

This/DT was/VBD without/IN a/DT doubt/NN the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT complex/JJ negotiating/NN process/NN in/IN which/WDT both/DT parties/NNS made/VBD major/JJ concessions/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB true/JJ of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN good/JJ governance/NN and/CC trade/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP was/VBD above/IN all/DT the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT stronger/JJR ACP/NNP group/NN ,/, which/WDT obviously/RB found/VBD new/JJ courage/NN following/VBG the/DT events/NNS in/IN Seattle/NNP ./.

I/PRP particularly/RB wish/VBP to/TO stress/VB that/IN a/DT new/JJ way/NN of/IN looking/VBG at/IN these/DT issues/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB emerging/VBG ,/, especially/RB as/IN regards/JJ trade/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB necessary/JJ to/TO tackle/VB this/DT area/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO go/VB further/RBR in/IN our/PRP$ development/NN aid/NN policies/NNS towards/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB simply/RB forge/VB ahead/RB with/IN something/NN that/WDT in/IN the/DT past/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN itself/PRP to/TO be/VB inappropriate/JJ and/CC wrong-headed/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, having/VBG listened/VBD to/TO the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP today/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO look/VB at/IN my/PRP$ agenda/NN ./.

Yes/UH ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ say/VB :/: `/`` Coherence/NNP of/IN different/JJ Union/NNP policies/NNS with/IN development/NN policy/NN '/'' ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP not/RB heard/VBN a/DT single/JJ word/NN on/IN this/DT subject/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP find/VBP that/DT deeply/RB embarrassing/VBG ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT report/NN on/IN coherence/NN for/IN years/NNS ./.

It/PRP ought/MD to/TO have/VB been/VBN here/RB in/IN writing/VBG today/NN and/CC ,/, after/IN having/VBG heard/VBN Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP '/POS s/JJ speech/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD well/RB imagine/VB that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ up/RB against/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN powerful/JJ opposition/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP himself/PRP has/VBZ some/DT strong/JJ and/CC extremely/RB reasonable/JJ opinions/NNS on/IN coherence/NN ,/, and/CC these/DT are/VBP what/WP I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO have/VB heard/VBN expressed/VBD here/RB today/NN ./.

Because/IN the/DT joint/JJ motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT range/NN of/IN effective/JJ mechanisms/NNS for/IN ensuring/VBG coherence/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD use/VB the/DT very/RB short/JJ time/NN allotted/JJ to/TO me/PRP here/RB just/RB to/TO mention/VB one/CD more/JJR such/JJ mechanism/NN ,/, namely/RB obliging/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO carry/VB out/RP an/DT evaluation/NN of/IN new/JJ ,/, relevant/JJ legislation/NN from/IN this/DT aspect/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT catastrophic/JJ effect/NN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ agricultural/JJ policy/NN has/VBZ had/VBN on/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS :/: dumping/VBG of/IN beef/NN in/IN Sahel/NNP and/CC South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, tomato/NNP pur脙/NNP 漏/NNP e/SYM in/IN West/NNP Africa/NNP and/CC milk/VB powder/NN in/IN Jamaica/NNP ./.

The/DT examples/NNS are/VBP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, all/DT well/RB known/VBN ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP known/VBN all/DT too/RB well/RB to/TO the/DT producers/NNS in/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS who/WP are/VBP affected/VBN by/IN these/DT measures/NNS and/CC who/WP have/VBP to/TO destroy/VB their/PRP$ products/NNS because/IN they/PRP can/MD not/RB compete/VB with/IN EU-subsidised/JJ products/NNS ./.

European/JJ taxpayers/NNS contribute/VBP EUR/$ 40/CD billion/CD per/IN year/NN in/IN support/NN of/IN agriculture/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ money/NN which/WDT is/VBZ helping/VBG to/TO impede/VB the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, which/WDT accounts/VBZ for/IN 69/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ work/NN force/NN there/RB compared/VBN with/IN 1.7/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

Add/VB to/TO this/DT the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN accounts/VBZ for/IN 34/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT developing/JJ countries/NNS '/POS gross/JJ national/JJ product/NN ,/, compared/VBN with/IN 5.3/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ neither/CC coherence/JJ nor/CC human/JJ decency/NN here/RB ./.

Why/WRB will/MD neither/DT the/DT Council/NNP nor/CC the/DT Commission/NNP admit/VB the/DT fact/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, how/WRB policy/NN decisions/NNS are/VBP arrived/VBN at/IN is/VBZ surely/RB fundamental/JJ ./.

The/DT Prime/NNP Minister/NNP of/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ Foreign/NNP Secretary/NNP yesterday/NN made/VBD statements/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ policy/NN in/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT voting/VBG system/NN within/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

They/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP that/IN the/DT UK/NNP ,/, France/NNP and/CC Germany/NNP far/RB exceed/VBP the/DT other/JJ countries/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP at/IN present/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN population/NN ./.

They/PRP then/RB drew/VBD the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN population/NN size/NN should/MD be/VB reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT voting/VBG system/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP would/MD not/RB surrender/VB its/PRP$ veto/NN ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP discussing/VBG this/DT issue/NN ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP prepared/VBN to/TO maintain/VB a/DT democratic/JJ veto/NN based/VBN on/IN population/NN strengths/NNS or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP still/RB moving/VBG towards/IN a/DT simple/JJ majority/NN vote/NN of/IN Council/NNP members/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN a/DT vote/NN reflecting/VBG the/DT population/NN in/IN Europe/NNP which/WDT they/PRP democratically/RB represent/VBP ?/.

As/IN this/DT voting/NN matter/NN is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO the/DT democratic/JJ future/NN of/IN this/DT Union/NNP ,/, surely/RB it/PRP should/MD receive/VB priority/NN consideration/NN ./.

How/WRB decisions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN is/VBZ all-important/JJ ./.

co-president/NN of/IN the/DT ACP-EU/NNP Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ statements/NNS this/DT morning/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP will/MD concentrate/VB on/IN coherence/NN policy/NN because/IN that/DT is/VBZ what/WP the/DT agenda/NN says/VBZ we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

Much/RB as/IN I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT requirement/NN to/TO hold/VB a/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT coherence/NN of/IN different/JJ Union/NNP policies/NNS and/CC development/NN policy/NN ,/, I/PRP question/VBP whether/IN today/NN is/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO be/VB holding/VBG it/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Council/NNP statement/NN gave/VBD me/PRP hope/VBP for/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB obvious/JJ to/TO me/PRP ,/, as/IN someone/NN who/WP specialises/VBZ in/IN development/NN policy/NN ,/, that/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ areas/NNS where/WRB lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN is/VBZ dramatically/RB affecting/VBG developing/VBG nations/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB some/DT examples/NNS shortly/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP remind/VB this/DT House/NNP that/IN ,/, back/RB in/IN June/NNP 1997/CD ,/, a/DT Council/NNP resolution/NN acknowledged/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT serious/JJ lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN in/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT EU/JJ policies/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO its/PRP$ development/NN cooperation/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD followed/VBN by/IN a/DT request/NN from/IN the/DT Council/NNP to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO provide/VB an/DT annual/JJ report/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ of/IN which/WDT was/VBD to/TO be/VB discussed/VBN in/IN 1998/CD ./.

We/PRP still/RB await/VBP the/DT first/JJ report/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT debate/NN was/VBD premature/JJ ,/, as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP had/VBD little/RB to/TO say/VB on/IN coherence/NN this/DT morning/NN ./.

The/DT areas/NNS identified/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP are/VBP specific/JJ areas/NNS where/WRB policy/NN coherence/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ ,/, such/JJ as/IN peace-building/NN ,/, conflict/NN prevention/NN and/CC resolution/NN ,/, food/NN security/NN ,/, fisheries/NNS and/CC immigration/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN these/DT issues/NNS have/VBP been/VBN discussed/VBN in/IN depth/NN ./.

I/PRP personally/RB feel/VBP that/IN issues/NNS such/JJ as/IN peace-building/NN and/CC conflict/NN prevention/NN and/CC resolution/NN are/VBP very/RB much/RB the/DT domain/NN of/IN African/NNP Heads/NNP of/IN State/NNP ,/, with/IN capacity/NN support/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT OAU/NNP acting/VBG as/IN arbiter/NN ./.

The/DT issues/NNS that/WDT are/VBP really/RB affected/VBN by/IN lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN are/VBP in/IN areas/NNS such/JJ agriculture/NN ,/, trade/NN ,/, environment/NN and/CC biodiversity/NN ,/, but/CC herein/NN lies/VBZ the/DT real/JJ problem/NN :/: these/DT are/VBP the/DT highly/RB sensitive/JJ areas/NNS of/IN policy/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN and/CC in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP in/IN particular/JJ ./.

Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP will/MD have/VB differing/VBG views/NNS ,/, even/RB within/IN the/DT same/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/RP -LRB-/-LRB- a/SYM -RRB-/-RRB- which/WDT country/NN they/PRP come/VBP from/IN or/CC -LRB-/-LRB- b/VB -RRB-/-RRB- which/WDT committee/NN they/PRP sit/VBP on/RP ./.

There/EX are/VBP areas/NNS of/IN coherence/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB as/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Development/NNP that/WDT would/MD probably/RB horrify/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT members/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP or/CC Committee/NNP on/IN Fisheries/NNPS ./.

As/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN ,/, one/PRP can/MD cite/VB as/IN Mrs/NNP Sandb脙艩k/NNP did/VBD ,/, the/DT exporting/VBG of/IN milk/NN products/NNS to/TO Jamaica/NNP at/IN prices/NNS far/RB below/IN production/NN costs/NNS there/RB which/WDT has/VBZ almost/RB ruined/VBN the/DT Jamaican/JJ dairy/NN industry/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP beef/NN exported/VBN to/TO southern/JJ Africa/NNP ,/, to/TO Namibia/NNP and/CC South/NNP Africa/NNP ,/, which/WDT then/RB sell/VBP their/PRP$ indigenous/NNS beef/NN to/TO Swaziland/NNP ,/, so/RB that/IN Swaziland/NNP can/MD fill/VB its/PRP$ export/NN quota/NN back/RP to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Remember/VB too/RB ,/, some/DT countries/NNS blocked/VBD an/DT agreement/NN with/IN South/NNP African/JJ trade/NN for/IN four/CD years/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP simply/RB import/VBP raw/JJ materials/NNS from/IN these/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN allowing/VBG them/PRP the/DT add-on/JJ value/NN of/IN producing/VBG their/PRP$ finished/JJ articles/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, we/PRP deny/VBP them/PRP the/DT very/JJ poverty-eradication/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP set/VBN as/IN our/PRP$ top/JJ principle/NN in/IN helping/VBG developing/VBG nations/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB surprised/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ having/VBG trouble/NN producing/VBG a/DT basic/JJ document/NN for/IN discussion/NN on/IN sustainable/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT morning/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB thank/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP for/IN having/VBG made/VBN a/DT statement/NN on/IN the/DT coherence/NN of/IN Community/NNP policies/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO development/NN ,/, because/IN this/DT demonstrates/VBZ a/DT will/NN to/TO make/VB policy/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

As/IN with/IN the/DT systems/NNS of/IN forces/NNS which/WDT are/VBP studied/VBN in/IN basic/JJ physics/NNS ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ no/DT sense/NN to/TO implement/VB policies/NNS which/WDT will/MD cancel/VB each/DT other/JJ out/RP ./.

For/IN these/DT reasons/NNS the/DT CSU/NNP European/NNP delegates/NNS are/VBP against/IN this/DT resolution/NN ./.

That/IN because/IN racial/JJ hatred/NN ,/, xenophobic/JJ violence/NN ,/, fear/NN and/CC rejection/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ different/JJ ,/, have/VBP deep/JJ roots/NNS in/IN all/DT that/WDT is/VBZ basest/JJ in/IN humanity/NN ,/, they/PRP may/MD re-emerge/VB at/IN any/DT moment/NN and/CC take/VB over/RP any/DT group/NN of/IN human/JJ beings/NNS ./.

For/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN the/DT Second/NNP World/NNP War/NNP ,/, a/DT party/NN which/WDT is/VBZ openly/RB pro-Nazi/JJ ,/, racist/JJ and/CC xenophobic/JJ has/VBZ gained/VBN access/NN to/TO power/NN in/IN a/DT European/JJ country/NN ./.

This/DT human/JJ diversity/NN is/VBZ our/PRP$ main/JJ sources/NNS of/IN wealth/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ duty/NN to/TO track/VB down/RP and/CC to/TO condemn/VB anything/NN which/WDT may/MD be/VB harmful/JJ to/TO it/PRP ,/, wherever/WRB it/PRP may/MD exist/VB ./.

The/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Freedom/NNP Party/NNP owes/VBZ as/RB much/RB to/TO the/DT endorsement/NN of/IN respectability/NN provided/VBN by/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ right/NN wing/NN and/CC social/JJ democrats/NNS as/IN to/TO the/DT policy/NN of/IN the/DT latter/NN ,/, whose/WP$ social/JJ disasters/NNS paved/VBD the/DT way/NN for/IN extreme/JJ right-wing/JJ populism/NN ./.

It/PRP can/MD be/VB explained/VBN by/IN the/DT feeling/NN of/IN helplessness/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS who/WP are/VBP the/DT victims/NNS of/IN the/DT ideology/NN of/IN mighty/JJ Mammon/NNP and/CC by/IN the/DT choice/NN of/IN the/DT ruling/NN classes/NNS to/TO promote/VB strong/JJ government/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO take/VB their/PRP$ policies/NNS of/IN austerity/NN and/CC deregulation/NN ever/RB further/RBR ./.

We/PRP German/JJ Christian/JJ Democrats/NNS used/VBD another/DT strategy/NN in/IN the/DT battle/NN against/IN extremists/NNS and/CC clearly/RB disassociated/VBD ourselves/PRP from/IN them/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB not/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO merely/RB reproduce/VB the/DT legislation/NN in/IN force/NN in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD and/CC must/MD improve/VB the/DT existing/VBG legislation/NN in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

Any/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN which/WDT truly/RB takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN all/PDT the/DT harm/NN occasioned/VBD to/TO persons/NNS and/CC the/DT environment/NN by/IN these/DT accidents/NNS ,/, is/VBZ bound/VBN to/TO support/VB this/DT approach/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN first/RB we/PRP should/MD all/RB congratulate/VB ourselves/PRP on/IN the/DT procedure/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN adopted/VBN and/CC which/WDT will/MD lead/VB us/PRP ,/, after/IN each/DT of/IN our/PRP$ respective/JJ political/JJ groups/NNS has/VBZ rallied/VBN together/RB and/CC expressed/VBN its/PRP$ feelings/NNS ,/, finally/RB to/TO produce/VB a/DT joint/JJ resolution/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN given/VBN the/DT dramatic/JJ circumstances/NNS ,/, and/CC as/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN principle/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB ill-advised/JJ and/CC inappropriate/JJ to/TO hold/VB several/JJ votes/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB obvious/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ conclusion/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB drawn/VBN from/IN the/DT Erika/NNP disaster/NN ,/, that/IN public/JJ opinion/NN would/MD find/VB it/PRP hard/JJ to/TO understand/VB that/IN we/PRP regulate/VB chocolate/NN but/CC do/VBP not/RB regulate/VB maritime/JJ transport/NN ./.

The/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ suggested/VBN three/CD main/JJ chapters/NNS which/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB drafted/VBN and/CC brought/VBN into/IN line/NN with/IN our/PRP$ legislation/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD set/VB standards/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP also/RB noted/VBN ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ great/JJ satisfaction/NN ,/, that/IN even/RB the/DT groups/NNS advocating/VBG greater/JJR national/JJ sovereignty/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT eurosceptic/JJ groups/NNS are/VBP calling/VBG for/IN Europe/NNP to/TO regulate/VB ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN the/DT right/JJ level/NN to/TO take/VB action/NN ./.

We/PRP sometimes/RB regulate/VB things/NNS which/WDT could/MD ,/, by/IN and/NNP large/JJ ,/, remain/VB subsidiary/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT area/NN we/PRP must/MD respond/VB to/TO public/JJ opinion/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ and/CC everyone/NN should/MD feel/VB concerned/VBN because/IN we/PRP are/VBP ,/, when/WRB all/DT is/VBZ said/VBN and/CC done/VBN ,/, on/IN the/DT global/JJ scale/NN merely/RB a/DT peninsula/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, once/IN our/PRP$ legislation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN brought/VBN into/IN line/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD follow/VB this/DT up/RP immediately/RB with/IN appropriate/JJ law/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB put/VB in/IN place/NN systematic/JJ controls/NNS and/CC finally/RB apply/VB the/DT `/`` polluter/NN pays/NN '/'' principle/NN of/IN responsibility/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT deterrent/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP almost/RB finished/VBN and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP personally/RB requested/VBN a/DT public/JJ hearing/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Transport/NNP ,/, which/WDT would/MD enable/VB us/PRP to/TO provide/VB an/DT immediate/JJ follow-up/NN to/TO the/DT Erika/NNP case/NN and/CC to/TO suggest/VB possible/JJ future/JJ considerations/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ currently/RB little/JJ financial/JJ incentive/NN for/IN this/DT when/WRB the/DT insurance/NN market/NN picks/VBZ up/RP the/DT tab/NN ./.

Ultimately/RB ,/, the/DT polluter/NN must/MD pay/VB ./.

In/IN addition/NN we/PRP must/MD build/VB on/IN the/DT Council/NNP directive/NN dealing/VBG with/IN enforcement/NN of/IN international/JJ standards/NNS for/IN ship/NN safety/NN and/CC pollution/NN prevention/NN by/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT inspection/NN goal/NN of/IN 25/CD %/NN of/IN ships/NNS calling/VBG at/IN EU/NNP ports/NNS is/VBZ met/VBN and/CC that/IN a/DT high/JJ standard/NN of/IN inspection/NN is/VBZ delivered/VBN ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, although/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB opposed/VBN to/TO shipowners/NNS registering/VBG their/PRP$ vessels/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ country/NN of/IN choice/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN stricter/JJR application/NN of/IN international/JJ regulations/NNS ./.

Rather/RB than/IN banning/VBG flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD violate/VB the/DT right/NN of/IN every/DT sovereign/JJ state/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT merchant/NN fleet/NN ,/, under/IN the/DT 1995/CD EU/NNP directive/NN on/IN port/JJ state/NN control/NN ,/, national/JJ maritime/NN authorities/NNS must/MD impose/VB more/RBR effective/JJ sanctions/NNS on/IN flag/NN states/NNS which/WDT fail/VBP to/TO carry/VB out/RP their/PRP$ international/JJ treaty/NN obligations/NNS ./.

I/PRP sincerely/RB hope/VBP that/IN ,/, particularly/RB during/IN the/DT French/JJ presidency/NN later/RBR this/DT year/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP will/MD look/VB carefully/RB at/IN all/PDT these/DT options/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP heartily/RB commend/VB this/DT resolution/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT victims/NNS are/VBP waiting/VBG outside/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP particularly/RB in/IN the/DT debt/NN of/IN those/DT who/WP undertook/VBD the/DT difficult/JJ deployment/NN of/IN all/PDT their/PRP$ crew/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB right/JJ to/TO demand/VB improved/JJ controls/NNS ,/, sanctions/NNS and/CC preventive/NN measures/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN fighting/VBG for/IN a/DT European/JJ environmental/JJ coastguard/JJ service/NN for/IN almost/RB ten/CD years/NNS ,/, here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

Before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN March/NNP ,/, I/PRP propose/VBP to/TO present/VB a/DT communication/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP will/MD possibly/RB present/VB legislative/JJ texts/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, amendments/NNS of/IN specific/JJ directives/NNS so/RB that/IN discussions/NNS may/MD begin/VB in/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/IN ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB an/DT environmental/JJ problem/NN -/: it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ environmental/JJ problem/NN -/: but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT very/RB important/JJ social/JJ problem/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP men/NNS and/CC women/NNS who/WP depend/VBP on/IN fishing/NN ,/, gathering/NN shellfish/NN and/CC the/DT service/NN or/CC tourist/NN industries/NNS in/IN these/DT coastal/JJ areas/NNS ./.

And/CC therefore/RB we/PRP must/MD take/VB the/DT utmost/JJ care/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT recurrence/NN of/IN a/DT similar/JJ situation/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP said/VBD that/IN nothing/NN had/VBD ever/RB been/VBN done/VBN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN things/NNS have/VBP been/VBN done/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ still/RB more/JJR to/TO do/VB ./.

This/DT was/VBD demonstrated/VBN by/IN the/DT Americans/NNPS who/WP ,/, after/IN the/DT Exxon/NNP Valdez/NNP disaster/NN ,/, within/IN one/CD year/NN ,/, adopted/VBD enormously/NN rigorous/JJ and/CC tough/JJ legislation/NN ,/, which/WDT threatens/VBZ ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/VBD earlier/RBR ,/, to/TO divert/VB ships/NNS unacceptable/JJ to/TO American/JJ ports/NNS towards/IN Europe/NNP ./.

In/IN Europe/NNP ,/, after/IN the/DT Amoco/NNP Cadiz/NNP ,/, or/CC the/DT Urquiola/NNP on/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ coast/NN ,/, in/IN 1976/CD ,/, or/CC the/DT Torrey/NNP Canyon/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT same/JJ year/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT many/JJ other/JJ cases/NNS there/EX have/VBP been/VBN ,/, we/PRP really/RB began/VBD to/TO legislate/VB after/IN 1994/CD and/CC 1995/CD ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.

During/IN these/DT years/NNS ,/, the/DT emphasis/NN has/VBZ mainly/RB been/VBN on/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN passenger/NN transport/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT reality/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PRP now/RB have/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT significant/JJ and/CC urgent/JJ effort/NN to/TO confront/VB new/JJ problems/NNS ,/, also/RB deriving/VBG from/IN American/JJ legislation/NN ,/, which/WDT emphasise/VBP the/DT safety/NN of/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS in/IN the/DT maritime/JJ sector/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP referred/VBN to/TO a/DT series/NN of/IN issues/NNS which/WDT I/PRP will/MD lay/VB out/RP in/IN more/JJR detail/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP ,/, in/IN an/DT appearance/NN before/IN a/DT special/JJ committee/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ,/, or/CC when/WRB I/PRP present/VBP the/DT actual/JJ initiatives/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/VBG months/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ intention/NN is/VBZ -/: and/CC I/PRP insist/VBP -/: for/IN us/PRP to/TO begin/VB discussions/NNS after/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN March/NNP ,/, also/RB coinciding/VBG with/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ,/, and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT six-month/JJ period/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, for/IN us/PRP to/TO have/VB texts/NNS to/TO discuss/VB ./.

Flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN are/VBP one/CD problem/NN ,/, but/CC are/VBP not/RB the/DT only/JJ one/NN ./.

The/DT Romanian/NNP flag/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT flag/NN of/IN convenience/NN but/CC ,/, nevertheless/RB ,/, that/DT country/NN has/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB high/JJ number/NN of/IN incidences/NNS at/IN inspections/NNS ;/: more/JJR than/IN the/DT countries/NNS with/IN flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ./.

Malta/NNP and/CC Cyprus/NNP have/VBP asked/VBN to/TO join/VB the/DT Community/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB demanding/VBG on/IN this/DT issue/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP negotiating/VBG to/TO this/DT end/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD oblige/VB us/PRP to/TO reconsider/VB the/DT registers/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT notorious/JJ problem/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD no/DT doubt/NN arise/VB again/RB ,/, of/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN a/DT Community/NNP register/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB difficult/JJ but/CC ,/, in/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD carry/VB out/RP a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT registers/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP countries/NNS ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT inspections/NNS ,/, very/RB much/RB a/DT key/JJ question/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ thing/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO consider/VB is/VBZ how/WRB the/DT current/JJ legislation/NN has/VBZ worked/VBN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Hatzidakis/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN ./.

We/PRP already/RB have/VBP legislation/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT information/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP services/NNS have/VBP given/VBN me/PRP ,/, this/DT legislation/NN is/VBZ not/RB adequately/RB applied/VBN in/IN many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS due/JJ to/TO a/DT lack/NN of/IN personnel/NNS ,/, means/NNS and/CC inspectors/NNS ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN only/RB 25/CD %/NN are/VBP inspected/VBN ,/, but/CC rather/RB how/WRB we/PRP select/VBP ,/, how/WRB we/PRP find/VBP ,/, the/DT ships/NNS which/WDT constitute/VBP the/DT highest/JJS risk/NN ,/, through/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN the/DT ships/NNS and/CC the/DT risk/NN history/NN of/IN the/DT flags/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT 25/CD %/NN often/RB consists/VBZ of/IN flags/NNS which/WDT are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO fulfil/VB the/DT requirements/NNS :/: in/IN this/DT way/NN inspections/NNS are/VBP quicker/JJR and/CC the/DT work/NN is/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP more/RBR easily/RB ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, more/RBR than/IN making/VBG amendments/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO implement/VB measures/NNS to/TO control/VB what/WP is/VBZ already/RB being/VBG done/VBN ,/, apart/RB from/IN some/DT supplementary/JJ requirements/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO reviews/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT age/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ vessels/NNS ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN Union/NNP inspectors/NNS ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN justifies/VBZ the/DT idea/NN that/IN these/DT inspections/NNS be/VB carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT States/NNPS carry/VBP out/IN their/PRP$ duty/NN adequately/RB ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN liability/NN ./.

Not/RB only/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN maximum/JJ sums/NNS insured/VBN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP believe/VBP should/MD be/VB similar/JJ to/TO those/DT in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP set/VBN a/DT figure/NN of/IN USD/NNP 180/CD million/CD ;/: in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS they/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN USD/NNP 1/CD billion/CD as/IN a/DT maximum/JJ ceiling/NN for/IN covering/VBG claims/NNS payments/NNS ./.

Unless/IN we/PRP require/VBP that/IN the/DT owners/NNS of/IN the/DT cargo/NN be/VB held/VBN liable/JJ ,/, we/PRP will/MD never/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, resolve/VB these/DT problems/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD end/VB now/RB ./.

I/PRP will/MD not/RB expand/VB further/RBR ./.

We/PRP will/MD have/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB on/IN other/JJ occasions/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, obviously/RB ,/, as/IN some/DT speakers/NNS have/VBP said/VBD -/: and/CC I/PRP thank/VBP all/DT of/IN you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ totally/RB positive/JJ and/CC relevant/JJ interventions/NNS -/: we/PRP can/MD not/RB allow/VB a/DT situation/NN where/WRB ,/, within/IN one/CD ,/, two/CD or/CC three/CD years/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB once/RB again/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB done/VBN what/WP we/PRP should/MD have/VB done/VBN ./.

As/IN for/IN me/PRP ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB ,/, after/IN having/VBG debated/VBN it/PRP in/IN the/DT College/NNP of/IN Commissioners/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO present/VB the/DT necessary/JJ legislative/JJ measures/NNS ,/, amendments/NNS and/CC directives/NNS to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO equip/VB ourselves/PRP with/IN the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ level/NN of/IN safety/NN ./.

The/DT political/JJ will/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ required/VBN -/: and/CC I/PRP can/MD see/VB that/IN I/PRP can/MD count/VB on/IN this/DT -/: as/RB well/RB as/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN good/JJ note/NN of/IN your/PRP$ intentions/NNS ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP at/IN 12.00/CD p.m./RB Storms/NNP in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN on/IN the/DT storms/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP has/VBZ the/DT floor/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP for/IN the/DT ideas/NNS you/PRP have/VBP put/VBN forward/RB ,/, particularly/RB on/IN the/DT very/RB specific/JJ proposals/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT people/NNS affected/VBN and/CC who/WP are/VBP expecting/VBG a/DT lot/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT help/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD offer/VB them/PRP ./.

In/IN the/DT days/NNS immediately/RB following/VBG this/DT terrible/JJ storm/NN I/PRP wrote/VBD to/TO you/PRP myself/PRP with/IN a/DT request/NN for/IN you/PRP to/TO ask/VB the/DT French/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO redraw/VB the/DT boundaries/NNS of/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD so/RB that/IN all/DT areas/NNS devastated/VBD by/IN the/DT storms/NNS in/IN France/NNP and/CC elsewhere/RB could/MD benefit/VB from/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN you/PRP must/MD have/VB done/VBN so/RB ,/, because/IN you/PRP have/VBP not/RB mentioned/VBN it/PRP ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, we/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN anyone/NN who/WP does/VBZ not/RB live/VB within/IN the/DT perimeter/NN of/IN an/DT Objective/NNP 2/CD region/NN will/MD find/VB it/PRP all/DT but/CC impossible/JJ to/TO obtain/VB aid/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD therefore/RB put/VB this/DT situation/NN right/RB immediately/RB ./.

You/PRP also/RB know/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD not/RB only/RB be/VB a/DT short-term/JJ problem/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB a/DT medium/NN and/CC long-term/JJ one/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP explain/VB ./.

I/PRP was/VBD in/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN Lorraine/NNP at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN this/DT terrible/JJ storm/NN which/WDT destroyed/VBN around/IN 20/CD %/NN of/IN deciduous/JJ forest/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, for/IN some/DT `/`` forestry/NN '/'' districts/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP lost/VBN 20/CD %/NN of/IN their/PRP$ trees/NNS ,/, this/DT represents/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ loss/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ between/IN 150/CD and/CC 200/CD years/NNS for/IN a/DT tree/NN to/TO reach/VB maturity/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT loss/NN these/DT towns/NNS will/MD suffer/VB will/MD not/RB be/VB spread/VBN over/IN one/CD ,/, two/CD or/CC five/CD years/NNS ,/, but/CC over/RB many/RB more/JJR ./.

The/DT towns/NNS concerned/VBN estimate/VBP that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB spread/VBN over/IN 40/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN consequently/RB it/PRP will/MD be/VB extremely/RB difficult/JJ indeed/RB to/TO compensate/VB these/DT rural/JJ towns/NNS through/IN subsidies/NNS for/IN losses/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ financial/JJ revenues/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT we/PRP should/MD continually/RB bear/VB in/IN mind/NN so/RB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB lose/VB sight/NN of/IN it/PRP in/IN our/PRP$ various/JJ policies/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT forestry/NN sector/NN is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB complex/JJ one/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, you/PRP spoke/VBD of/IN releasing/VBG funds/NNS for/IN timber/NN storage/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN its/PRP$ price/NN must/MD not/RB depreciate/VB ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, districts/NNS which/WDT have/VBP not/RB been/VBN affected/VBN by/IN the/DT storms/NNS will/MD also/RB suffer/VB ,/, as/IN the/DT National/NNP Forestry/NNP Office/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN to/TO freeze/VB cuts/NNS in/IN forestation/NN for/IN four/CD years/NNS ./.

Those/DT districts/NNS which/WDT have/VBP not/RB suffered/VBN losses/NNS will/MD therefore/RB see/VB their/PRP$ incomes/NNS decrease/NN in/IN any/DT case/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP telling/VBG you/PRP all/DT of/IN this/DT to/TO illustrate/VB how/WRB complex/JJ the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ ,/, and/CC I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP once/RB again/RB for/IN extending/VBG their/PRP$ analysis/NN of/IN this/DT situation/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN it/PRP could/MD ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, although/IN there/EX has/VBZ indeed/RB been/VBN an/DT economic/JJ disaster/NN ,/, the/DT real/JJ ecological/JJ catastrophes/NNS are/VBP still/RB to/TO come/VB ./.

As/IN you/PRP yourself/PRP said/VBD ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, these/DT disasters/NNS or/CC storms/NNS do/VBP not/RB always/RB have/VB natural/JJ causes/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP think/VBP that/IN these/DT are/VBP the/DT first/JJ signs/NNS of/IN climate/NN change/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP and/CC wish/VBP ,/, and/CC am/VBP indeed/RB certain/JJ ,/, that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, with/IN maturity/NN and/CC with/IN the/DT measures/NNS it/PRP has/VBZ begun/VBN to/TO adopt/VB ,/, will/MD little/RB by/IN little/RB construct/VB ,/, in/IN the/DT wider/JJR area/NN ,/, the/DT necessary/JJ environment/NN which/WDT it/PRP needs/VBZ itself/PRP ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB deceive/VB ourselves/PRP :/: a/DT Europe/NNP ,/, one/CD part/NN of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN back/RP because/RB of/IN frictions/NNS ,/, misinterpretations/NNS and/CC conflicts/NNS ,/, and/CC because/RB of/IN nationalistic/JJ clashes/NNS ,/, will/MD never/RB be/VB a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT has/VBZ brought/VBN its/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN to/TO the/DT level/NN it/PRP wants/VBZ ./.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, speaking/VBG now/RB as/IN a/DT Greek/JJ ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO tell/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT speakers/NNS I/PRP listened/VBD to/TO earlier/JJR that/IN much/RB of/IN what/WP was/VBD said/VBN is/VBZ fixated/VBN on/IN other/JJ times/NNS and/CC places/NNS ./.

They/PRP have/VBP quite/RB failed/VBN to/TO grasp/VB the/DT new/JJ conditions/NNS created/VBN in/IN the/DT area/NN ;/: the/DT new/JJ and/CC positive/JJ conditions/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN created/VBN ,/, in/IN very/RB many/JJ cases/NNS on/IN Greece/NNP '/POS s/JJ initiative/NN ./.

You/PRP should/MD know/VB that/IN the/DT country/NN which/WDT cooperates/VBZ most/JJS with/IN FYROM/NNP and/CC has/VBZ the/DT best/JJS relations/NNS with/IN it/PRP ,/, in/IN the/DT entire/JJ area/NN ,/, is/VBZ Greece/NNP ,/, and/CC this/DT has/VBZ contributed/VBN greatly/RB to/TO the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT area/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD none/NN the/DT worse/JJR for/IN that/DT ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB I/PRP will/MD be/VB forgiven/VBN for/IN concentrating/VBG very/RB largely/RB on/IN the/DT report/NN because/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT extremely/RB important/JJ issues/NNS that/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO touch/VB on/RP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO set/VB out/RP the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS position/NN on/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB helpful/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ contribution/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP very/RB grateful/JJ for/IN his/PRP$ leadership/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN and/CC for/IN that/DT of/IN some/DT of/IN his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN whom/WP are/VBP in/IN the/DT House/NNP this/DT evening/NN -/: Mrs/NNP Pack/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Lagendijk/NNP and/CC others/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ that/WDT at/IN our/PRP$ overall/JJ relations/NNS with/IN FYROM/NNP are/VBP in/IN such/PDT a/DT good/JJ state/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB Mr/NNP Dupuis/NNP will/MD forgive/VB me/PRP for/IN using/VBG that/DT expression/NN -/: both/CC he/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ interpreter/NN -/: in/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN entente/JJ cordiale/NN ./.

That/DT has/VBZ been/VBN helped/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ excellent/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP representative/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT great/JJ friend/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC a/DT great/JJ servant/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT imminent/JJ commencement/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS on/IN a/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS powerful/JJ example/NN of/IN our/PRP$ good/JJ relations/NNS ./.

So/IN to/TO is/VBZ the/DT cooperation/NN of/IN FYROM/NNP in/IN the/DT rebuilding/NN of/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP grateful/JJ to/TO the/DT authorities/NNS in/IN Macedonia/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ assistance/NN in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS in/IN helping/VBG to/TO cope/VB with/IN the/DT considerable/JJ difficulties/NNS with/IN the/DT power/NN supply/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

Like/IN honourable/JJ Members/NNS I/PRP recognise/VBP the/DT stabilising/VBG role/NN that/IN this/DT country/NN has/VBZ played/VBN during/IN the/DT Balkan/NNP tragedy/NN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO integrating/VBG the/DT Albanian/NNP minority/NN into/IN the/DT political/JJ and/CC social/JJ life/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN ./.

I/PRP saw/VBD the/DT newly-elected/JJ President/NNP Georgievski/NNP a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/RB and/CC I/PRP was/VBD extremely/RB impressed/JJ ,/, as/IN others/NNS have/VBP been/VBN ,/, by/IN his/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO multi-ethnicity/NN and/CC pluralism/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP set/VB out/RP where/WRB matters/NNS now/RB stand/VBP on/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS to/TO which/WDT -/: as/IN Mr/NNP Lagendijk/NNP said/VBD -/: other/JJ countries/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN are/VBP looking/VBG with/IN very/RB considerable/JJ interest/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP adopted/VBD on/IN 24/NNP January/NNP this/DT year/NN its/PRP$ negotiating/VBG directives/NNS for/IN a/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT former/JJ Yugoslav/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Macedonia/NNP ./.

This/DT represents/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ step/NN forward/RB in/IN the/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN process/NN of/IN the/DT western/JJ Balkans/NNP region/NN initiated/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN May/NNP 1999/CD ./.

Let/VB me/PRP make/VB clear/JJ the/DT main/JJ elements/NNS of/IN those/DT draft/NN directives/NNS ./.

They/PRP cover/VBP the/DT inclusion/NN in/IN the/DT agreement/NN of/IN arrangements/NNS establishing/VBG a/DT political/JJ dialogue/NN with/IN FYROM/NNP ./.

They/PRP cover/VBP provisions/NNS for/IN enhanced/VBN regional/JJ cooperation/NN including/VBG the/DT prospect/NN of/IN establishing/VBG free/JJ trade/NN areas/NNS between/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, though/IN I/PRP must/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN any/DT attempt/NN to/TO recreate/VB the/DT state/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

They/PRP cover/VBP the/DT prospect/NN of/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT free/JJ trade/NN area/NN between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC them/PRP within/IN ten/CD years/NNS of/IN the/DT entry/NN into/IN force/NN of/IN the/DT agreement/NN ./.

They/PRP cover/VBP provisions/NNS on/IN the/DT movement/NN of/IN workers/NNS ,/, freedom/NN of/IN establishment/NN ,/, supply/NN of/IN services/NNS ,/, current/JJ payments/NNS and/CC movement/NN of/IN capital/NN ./.

They/PRP cover/VBP a/DT commitment/NN by/IN FYROM/NNP to/TO approximate/VB its/PRP$ legislation/NN to/TO that/DT of/IN the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP ,/, notably/RB in/IN key/JJ areas/NNS of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ;/: and/CC they/PRP cover/VBP provisions/NNS on/IN cooperation/NN with/IN FYROM/NNP in/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN fields/NNS ,/, including/VBG justice/NN and/CC home/NN affairs/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB making/VBG in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP the/DT necessary/JJ preparations/NNS so/RB that/IN negotiations/NNS can/MD start/VB in/IN March/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP due/JJ to/TO visit/VB FYROM/NNP in/IN the/DT second/JJ week/NN in/IN March/NNP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO set/VB the/DT process/NN in/IN motion/NN then/RB ,/, although/IN the/DT formal/JJ negotiations/NNS will/MD start/VB very/RB shortly/RB thereafter/RB ./.

At/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN that/DT visit/NN I/PRP will/MD also/RB ,/, as/IN recommended/JJ by/IN honourable/JJ Members/NNS and/CC others/NNS ,/, be/VB upgrading/VBG our/PRP$ representation/NN in/IN FYROM/NNP ./.

The/DT target/NN date/NN for/IN concluding/VBG the/DT negotiations/NNS is/VBZ December/NNP this/DT year/NN but/CC this/DT will/MD depend/VB to/TO a/DT very/RB large/JJ extent/NN on/IN the/DT goodwill/NN and/CC determination/NN of/IN the/DT negotiators/NNS ./.

The/DT agreement/NN could/MD enter/VB into/IN force/NN in/IN three/CD to/TO four/CD years/NNS from/IN now/RB ,/, given/VBN the/DT time/NN needed/VBN for/IN ratification/NN in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS parliaments/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO comment/VB very/RB briefly/NN on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ points/NNS in/IN the/DT draft/NN resolution/NN ./.

We/PRP accept/VBP that/IN the/DT agreement/NN should/MD to/TO a/DT certain/JJ extent/NN serve/VB as/IN an/DT example/NN for/IN other/JJ such/JJ agreements/NNS ,/, although/IN obviously/RB we/PRP will/MD also/RB want/VB to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN different/JJ countries/NNS ,/, each/DT of/IN which/WDT has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ identity/NN and/CC its/PRP$ own/JJ concerns/NNS ./.

I/PRP share/VBP the/DT wide-spread/JJ concern/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD treat/VB each/DT country/NN on/IN its/PRP$ merits/NNS and/CC not/RB shackle/VB everyone/NN to/TO the/DT pace/NN of/IN the/DT slowest/JJS in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN relations/NNS with/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

That/DT has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN the/DT intention/NN ./.

The/DT very/JJ fact/NN that/IN negotiations/NNS are/VBP beginning/VBG first/RB with/IN FYROM/NNP ,/, before/IN all/PDT the/DT others/NNS ,/, is/VBZ evidence/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD and/CC do/VBP differentiate/VB ./.

On/IN the/DT provision/NN of/IN regional/JJ aid/NN referred/VBN to/TO in/IN the/DT report/NN we/PRP agree/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ technical/JJ and/CC financial/JJ assistance/NN should/MD go/VB in/IN part/NN to/TO projects/NNS having/VBG a/DT cross-border/JJ or/CC regional/JJ dimension/NN ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP that/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB an/DT evolutionary/JJ clause/NN on/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN EU/JJ membership/NN contained/VBN in/IN the/DT stabilisation/NN and/CC association/NN agreement/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD reflect/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP 's/POS position/NN on/IN its/PRP$ relations/NNS with/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT western/JJ Balkans/NNS as/IN set/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT Cologne/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP conclusions/NNP ./.

We/PRP strongly/RB agree/VBP on/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO decentralise/VB our/PRP$ assistance/NN programmes/NNS to/TO the/DT maximum/JJ possible/JJ extent/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT arrangements/NNS covering/VBG European/JJ Union/NNP assistance/NN to/TO the/DT western/JJ Balkans/NNS ,/, Members/NNS will/MD be/VB aware/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP drawing/VBG up/RP a/DT new/JJ regulation/NN to/TO simplify/VB and/CC streamline/VB their/PRP$ management/NN and/CC to/TO put/VB everything/NN under/IN one/CD regulation/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP aware/JJ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ concern/NN in/IN FYROM/NNP and/CC elsewhere/RB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT PHARE/JJ programme/NN in/IN these/DT countries/NNS and/CC ,/, especially/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT loss/NN of/IN association/NN with/IN the/DT PHARE/NNP name/NN ./.

I/PRP note/VBP with/IN considerable/JJ concern/NN what/WP Members/NNS say/VBP on/IN this/DT score/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD take/VB another/DT look/NN at/IN the/DT issue/NN ,/, although/IN I/PRP should/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN having/VBG two/CD PHARE/NNP programmes/NNS up/RP and/CC running/VBG risks/VBZ real/JJ confusion/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO stress/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN whatever/WDT the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ called/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO the/DT integration/NN of/IN FYROM/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ neighbours/NNS into/IN the/DT European/JJ family/NN is/VBZ stronger/JJR than/IN ever/RB ./.

In/IN general/NN I/PRP trust/VBP that/IN Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP will/MD share/VB my/PRP$ pleasure/NN that/IN Macedonia/NNP has/VBZ reached/VBN this/DT stage/NN relatively/RB rapidly/RB ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT other/JJ countries/NNS of/IN the/DT region/NN will/MD redouble/VB their/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO make/VB similar/JJ progress/NN ./.

I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO many/JJ similar/JJ debates/NNS to/TO this/DT over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ years/NNS marking/VBG ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, the/DT success/NN of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO do/VB in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS which/WDT ,/, for/IN me/PRP ,/, remains/VBZ the/DT single/JJ most/RBS important/JJ litmus-test/NN of/IN what/WP Europe/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO do/VB on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ doorstep/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12.00/CD p.m./RB Agreement/NNP on/IN comitology/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0021/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, on/IN the/DT agreement/NN between/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ Council/NNP decision/NN of/IN 28/CD June/NNP 1999/CD on/IN comitology/NN -LRB-/-LRB- 1999/468/EC/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Until/IN 1993/CD ,/, the/DT way/NN the/DT Commission/NNP exercised/VBD its/PRP$ executive/JJ powers/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ the/DT mysterious/NN and/CC even/RB suspect/JJ committee/NN arrangements/NNS ,/, was/VBD creating/VBG conflict/NN and/CC mistrust/NN between/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ,/, and/CC threatening/VBG to/TO have/VB serious/JJ consequences/NNS on/IN the/DT legislative/JJ procedure/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Declaration/NNP No/NNP 31/CD ,/, annexed/VBN to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, the/DT Union/NNP institutions/NNS have/VBP undertaken/VBN a/DT complex/JJ task/NN of/IN negotiation/NN and/CC consultation/NN ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN the/DT new/JJ Council/NNP decision/NN ,/, which/WDT revises/VBZ the/DT old/JJ system/NN quite/RB substantially/RB ,/, although/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB entirely/RB satisfied/VBN with/IN it/PRP ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT decision/NN outlines/VBZ a/DT form/NN of/IN parliamentary/JJ control/NN whereby/WRB Parliament/NNP can/MD sound/VB the/DT alarm/NN if/IN an/DT implementing/JJ measure/NN ,/, deriving/VBG from/IN an/DT act/NN adopted/VBN under/IN the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN ,/, oversteps/VBZ the/DT implementing/JJ powers/NNS delegated/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

During/IN the/DT trialogue/NN held/VBN on/IN 6/CD October/NNP 1999/CD in/IN Strasbourg/NNP ,/, the/DT Presidents/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP approved/VBD the/DT idea/NN of/IN concluding/VBG this/DT agreement/NN soon/RB ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP have/VBP respected/VBN that/DT commitment/NN ,/, and/CC indeed/RB this/DT was/VBD made/VBN relatively/RB easy/JJ by/IN the/DT climate/NN of/IN trust/NN and/CC mutual/JJ respect/NN evident/JJ throughout/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Essentially/RB ,/, the/DT agreement/NN deals/VBZ with/IN two/CD points/NNS :/: one/PRP is/VBZ the/DT right/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP to/TO be/VB informed/VBN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT sine/JJ qua/NN non/NN for/IN the/DT genuine/JJ exercise/NN of/IN its/PRP$ right/NN to/TO intervene/VB pursuant/JJ to/TO Article/NNP 8/CD of/IN the/DT decision/NN ./.

Hitherto/RB ,/, such/JJ information/NN had/VBD been/VBN supplied/VBN on/IN paper/NN and/CC unsystematically/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD of/IN no/DT use/NN to/TO our/PRP$ services/NNS ;/: and/CC indeed/RB this/DT was/VBD often/RB the/DT fault/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP itself/PRP ./.

From/IN now/RB on/RB ,/, the/DT information/NN will/MD be/VB provided/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN an/DT electronic/JJ system/NN called/VBN CIRCA/NNP ,/, to/TO which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD have/VB access/NN ./.

This/DT represents/VBZ a/DT real/JJ innovation/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ for/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC also/RB -/: I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ -/: for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT other/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN Article/NNP 8/CD of/IN the/DT Council/NNP decision/NN does/VBZ not/RB specify/VB either/RB the/DT method/NN by/IN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ to/TO sound/VB the/DT alarm/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT time/NN limit/NN within/IN which/WDT it/PRP must/MD exercise/VB its/PRP$ restricted/JJ power/NN of/IN control/NN ./.

Paragraphs/NNS 6/CD and/CC 7/CD of/IN the/DT agreement/NN confirm/VBP that/IN ,/, as/IN a/DT general/JJ rule/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD adopt/VB its/PRP$ resolution/NN ,/, stating/VBG its/PRP$ reasons/NNS ,/, at/IN a/DT plenary/NN sitting/VBG and/CC has/VBZ one/CD month/NN to/TO exercise/VB its/PRP$ right/NN of/IN intervention/NN before/IN the/DT Commission/NNP adopts/VBZ the/DT draft/NN implementing/VBG measure/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP all/DT realise/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB always/RB possible/JJ to/TO wait/VB a/DT month/NN before/IN implementing/VBG a/DT measure/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT agreement/NN contains/VBZ explicit/JJ provisions/NNS on/IN urgent/JJ procedure/NN ,/, including/VBG possible/JJ action/NN by/IN the/DT committee/NN responsible/JJ ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO end/VB by/IN stressing/VBG that/IN we/PRP can/MD not/RB assess/VB whether/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ agreement/NN or/CC not/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD wait/VB and/CC see/VB how/WRB it/PRP works/VBZ in/IN practice/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO acquire/VB the/DT resources/NNS ,/, which/WDT it/PRP currently/RB lacks/VBZ ,/, to/TO ensure/VB efficient/JJ monitoring/NN of/IN implementing/VBG measures/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD accept/VB that/IN some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ practices/NNS need/VBP reorganising/VBG to/TO provide/VB proper/JJ information/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC ensure/VB that/IN control/NN can/MD be/VB effective/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, comitology/RB is/VBZ a/DT concept/NN most/JJS people/NNS do/VBP not/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO handle/VB and/CC hardly/RB anyone/NN knows/VBZ what/WP it/PRP means/VBZ ./.

It/PRP makes/VBZ them/PRP think/VBP of/IN secret/JJ societies/NNS and/CC conspiracies/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN things/NNS used/VBN to/TO be/VB ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP implies/VBZ nothing/NN other/JJ than/IN fixing/VBG the/DT procedures/NNS for/IN the/DT exercise/NN of/IN the/DT implementing/JJ powers/NNS conferred/VBD on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT procedures/NNS for/IN exercising/VBG these/DT implementing/JJ powers/NNS take/VBP the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT limited/JJ number/NN of/IN committee/NN procedures/NNS ./.

Up/IN until/IN the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, there/EX were/VBD about/RB 20/CD variations/NNS of/IN these/DT committee/NN procedures/NNS ,/, which/WDT created/VBD neither/RB clarity/JJ in/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN legislation/NN nor/CC transparency/RB for/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN even/RB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP was/VBD not/RB informed/VBN ./.

For/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT first/JJ step/NN in/IN the/DT struggle/NN for/IN more/JJR transparency/NN in/IN this/DT jungle/NN of/IN committees/NNS was/VBD to/TO be/VB informed/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, of/IN all/DT that/WDT the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP intended/VBD to/TO regulate/VB in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN these/DT various/JJ committees/NNS ./.

Agreement/NNP was/VBD reached/VBN in/IN 1988/CD in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN an/DT exchange/NN of/IN letters/NNS between/IN Lord/NNP Plumb/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Delors/NNP ./.

A/DT further/JJ step/NN towards/IN transparency/NN and/CC the/DT involvement/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP came/VBD with/IN what/WP is/VBZ known/VBN as/IN the/DT modus/JJ vivendi/NN of/IN 20/CD September/NNP 1994/CD ,/, which/WDT granted/VBD Parliament/NNP the/DT right/NN not/RB only/JJ to/TO be/VB informed/VBN but/CC also/RB to/TO intervene/VB in/IN certain/JJ cases/NNS ./.

It/PRP also/RB gave/VBD it/PRP the/DT possibility/NN of/IN scrutiny/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, the/DT situation/NN improved/VBD decidedly/RB when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN committee/NN procedures/NNS was/VBD drastically/RB reduced/JJ -/: as/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP had/VBD long/RB wanted/VBN -/: to/TO three/CD procedures/NNS ,/, the/DT administrative/JJ procedure/NN ,/, the/DT regulatory/JJ procedure/NN and/CC the/DT advisory/JJ procedure/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, following/VBG the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, the/DT rights/NNS of/IN information/NN and/CC control/NN granted/VBD to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN the/DT past/JJ need/NN to/TO be/VB enshrined/VBN anew/RB in/IN an/DT interinstitutional/JJ agreement/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ,/, has/VBZ done/VBN very/RB careful/JJ work/NN and/CC identified/VBN the/DT questions/NNS that/WDT have/VBP to/TO be/VB clarified/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN that/DT interinstitutional/JJ agreement/NN and/CC the/DT administrative/JJ procedures/NNS that/WDT may/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB changed/VBN within/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

A/DT key/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ the/DT time/NN factor/NN ./.

When/WRB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ informed/VBN ,/, it/PRP generally/RB has/VBZ to/TO adopt/VB a/DT position/NN within/IN the/DT very/RB short/JJ timeframe/NN of/IN four/CD weeks/NNS ,/, should/MD it/PRP so/RB wish/VBP ./.

In/IN matters/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT health/NN and/CC safety/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS and/CC the/DT only/JJ institution/NN with/IN the/DT right/NN of/IN initiative/NN ,/, must/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO react/VB very/RB rapidly/RB ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ within/IN a/DT few/JJ hours/NNS or/CC days/NNS ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP must/MD retain/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO be/VB informed/VBN and/CC where/WRB appropriate/JJ also/RB to/TO react/VB ./.

Our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN identifies/VBZ very/RB useful/JJ solutions/NNS to/TO these/DT difficulties/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ group/NN can/MD only/RB support/VB in/IN full/JJ ./.

I/PRP just/RB have/VBP one/CD more/JJR request/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT German/JJ version/NN ,/, paragraph/NN 2/CD of/IN the/DT resolution/NN has/VBZ been/VBN translated/VBN rather/RB misleadingly/JJ and/CC I/PRP urgently/RB ask/VBP for/IN clarification/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO see/VB in/IN the/DT printed/VBN version/NN later/RB ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN ``/`` weitergef脙艗hrt/JJ werden/NN m脙艗ssen/NN ''/'' the/DT wording/NN should/MD be/VB ``/`` erhalten/JJ bleiben/JJ m脙艗ssen/NN ''/'' ./.

The/DT German/JJ version/NN is/VBZ not/RB very/RB clear/JJ here/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB for/IN that/WDT to/TO be/VB checked/VBN again/RB ./.

For/IN the/DT rest/NN ,/, I/PRP warmly/RB thank/VBP our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT difficult/JJ subject/JJ and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP we/PRP have/VBP managed/VBN to/TO make/VB it/PRP somewhat/RB easier/JJR to/TO deal/VB with/IN now/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN her/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP must/MD add/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT welcome/JJ change/NN to/TO see/VB Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP in/IN such/PDT a/DT conciliatory/JJ mood/NN and/CC willing/JJ to/TO reach/VB compromises/NNS with/IN the/DT other/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, she/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN what/WP the/DT French/NNP call/VBP ``/`` les/CD pures/NNS et/JJ dures/NNS ''/'' :/: no/DT compromise/NN ,/, no/DT deals/NNS with/IN the/DT other/JJ institutions/NNS ;/: we/PRP would/MD rather/RB see/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN blocked/VBN than/IN compromise/VB our/PRP$ positions/NNS ./.

Yet/CC here/RB she/PRP is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO accept/VB the/DT steps/NNS forward/RB that/IN have/VBP been/VBN achieved/VBN ,/, which/WDT are/VBP far/RB from/IN matching/VBG Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ original/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN comitology/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP remember/VB what/WP is/VBZ at/IN stake/NN here/RB ./.

Parliament/NNP had/VBD four/CD main/JJ criticisms/NNS of/IN the/DT comitology/JJ system/NN as/IN it/PRP existed/VBD prior/RB to/TO the/DT new/JJ Council/NNP decision/NN supplemented/VBN by/IN this/DT interinstitutional/JJ agreement/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT whole/JJ system/NN is/VBZ obscure/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB transparent/JJ with/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN committees/NNS meeting/VBG with/IN secret/JJ agendas/NNS and/CC nobody/NN knowing/VBG who/WP is/VBZ on/IN the/DT committees/NNS ./.

Here/RB is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ step/NN forward/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT new/JJ system/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN agreed/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP to/TO know/VB who/WP is/VBZ on/IN each/DT committee/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP to/TO know/VB when/WRB they/PRP meet/VBP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP to/TO get/VB the/DT agendas/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP to/TO get/VB the/DT documents/NNS that/WDT are/VBP sent/VBN to/TO them/PRP ./.

The/DT whole/JJ system/NN will/MD be/VB more/RBR open/JJ and/CC transparent/JJ -/: if/IN still/RB rather/RB complex/JJ ./.

So/IN that/DT is/VBZ at/IN least/JJS a/DT step/NN forward/RB ./.

Our/PRP$ second/JJ criticism/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT system/NN was/VBD very/RB restrictive/JJ of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

We/PRP adopt/VBP legislation/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP expect/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO implement/VB it/PRP ./.

Here/RB too/RB there/EX is/VBZ at/IN least/JJS some/DT progress/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO block/VB implementing/VBG measures/NNS indefinitely/RB beyond/IN the/DT three-month/JJ period/NN unless/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN to/TO block/VB it/PRP ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, unless/IN there/EX is/VBZ substantial/JJ opposition/NN among/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS represented/VBN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT more/RBR reasonable/JJ system/NN ./.

That/DT ,/, too/RB ,/, is/VBZ a/DT step/NN forward/RB ./.

But/CC on/IN our/PRP$ other/JJ two/CD criticisms/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP less/RBR satisfied/VBN ./.

The/DT first/JJ criticism/NN is/VBZ of/IN the/DT system/NN whereby/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ monitored/VBN ,/, scrutinised/VBN ,/, controlled/VBN if/IN you/PRP like/VBP ,/, only/RB by/IN a/DT committee/NN appointed/VBN by/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS or/CC the/DT Council/NN not/RB by/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT legislative/JJ authority/NN ,/, Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP ,/, should/MD be/VB equal/JJ ./.

We/PRP confer/VBP implementing/VBG powers/NNS on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB a/DT Council/NNP or/CC Member/NNP State/NNP appointed/VBN body/NN that/WDT can/MD blow/VB the/DT whistle/NN and/CC say/VB no/RB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC stop/VB the/DT implementing/JJ measure/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ no/DT equivalent/NN power/NN ./.

True/UH ,/, we/PRP are/VBP now/RB given/VBN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT power/NN in/IN this/DT new/JJ system/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP to/TO receive/VB all/PDT the/DT draft/NN implementing/VBG measures/NNS forwarded/VBN to/TO a/DT committee/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ sent/VBN to/TO the/DT committee/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD have/VB the/DT chance/NN to/TO scrutinise/VB ,/, to/TO debate/NN ,/, to/TO question/VB ./.

But/CC we/PRP will/MD only/RB have/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO formally/RB challenge/VB the/DT Commission/NNP if/IN we/PRP think/VBP it/PRP has/VBZ gone/VBN beyond/IN the/DT delegation/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP given/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN the/DT legislation/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD challenge/VB the/DT measure/NN for/IN being/VBG ultra-vires/JJ but/CC not/RB on/IN its/PRP$ content/NN ./.

And/CC in/IN a/DT democracy/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO challenge/VB the/DT content/NN ./.

Not/RB that/DT we/PRP do/VBP so/RB every/DT week/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB seeking/VBG to/TO immerse/VB ourselves/PRP in/IN implementing/VBG decisions/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT democratic/JJ safeguard/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO do/VB so/RB on/IN those/DT few/JJ occasions/NNS when/WRB it/PRP really/RB would/MD be/VB necessary/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ lacking/VBG in/IN this/DT new/JJ system/NN ,/, or/CC at/IN least/JJS is/VBZ only/RB there/RB in/IN embryonic/JJ form/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, our/PRP$ fourth/JJ criticism/NN is/VBZ that/IN if/IN an/DT implementing/JJ measure/NN is/VBZ blocked/VBN through/IN the/DT comitology/JJ system/NN it/PRP is/VBZ referred/VBN back/RB ,/, not/RB to/TO both/DT branches/NNS of/IN the/DT legislative/JJ authority/NN ,/, but/CC to/TO the/DT Council/NNP alone/RB ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ the/DT right/NN possibly/RB to/TO take/VB an/DT alternative/JJ measure/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB correct/JJ ./.

Both/DT branches/NNS adopt/VBP the/DT legislation/NN -/: Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP -/: that/WDT confers/VBZ implementing/VBG powers/NNS on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

If/IN such/JJ implementing/NN measures/NNS are/VBP referred/VBN back/RB ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB to/TO both/DT branches/NNS ,/, not/RB to/TO one/CD branch/NN alone/RB ./.

Overall/RB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT system/NN which/WDT has/VBZ made/VBN some/DT progress/NN ./.

The/DT supplementary/JJ aspects/NNS that/WDT arise/VBP from/IN the/DT interinstitutional/JJ agreement/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP are/VBP welcome/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT could/MD not/RB change/VB the/DT basic/JJ decision/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Even/RB here/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP renounced/VBN voluntarily/RB -/: because/IN this/DT did/VBD not/RB happen/VB automatically/RB -/: the/DT Plumb-Delors/NNP agreement/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT overall/JJ compromise/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN willing/JJ to/TO relinquish/VB the/DT provisions/NNS in/IN that/DT ./.

We/PRP shall/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB vigilant/JJ on/IN what/WP used/VBD to/TO be/VB covered/VBN by/IN that/DT agreement/NN and/CC is/VBZ not/RB fully/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT new/JJ decision/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB very/RB vigilant/JJ ./.

So/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT step/NN forward/RB ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN reluctantly/RB accepts/VBZ it/PRP as/IN a/DT step/NN forward/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB as/RB enthusiastic/JJ about/IN compromising/VBG as/IN Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ./.

It/PRP must/MD clearly/RB be/VB accepted/VBN that/IN the/DT people/NNS should/MD be/VB free/JJ to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ decisions/NNS at/IN the/DT level/NN which/WDT best/RB combines/VBZ the/DT objective/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN an/DT immediate/JJ ,/, fair/JJ and/CC transparent/JJ democratic/JJ debate/NN ,/, namely/RB at/IN national/JJ level/NN in/IN the/DT main/JJ ./.

This/DT Charter/NNP is/VBZ really/RB misnamed/JJ because/IN it/PRP will/MD actually/RB reduce/VB these/DT rights/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT Union/NNP for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Nations/NNP Group/NNP our/PRP$ principles/NNS are/VBP rather/RB different/JJ ./.

Clearly/RB we/PRP want/VBP to/TO defend/VB the/DT countries/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP but/CC we/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO respect/VB the/DT autonomy/NN of/IN nations/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB impossible/JJ ./.

We/PRP must/MD move/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT outmoded/JJ federalist/NN schemes/NNS promoted/VBN by/IN those/DT whose/WP$ every/DT idea/NN on/IN European/JJ matters/NNS comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT Memoires/NNPS of/IN Jean/NNP Monnet/NNP ./.

Instead/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD open/VB the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS to/TO the/DT modern/JJ world/NN by/IN creating/VBG a/DT flexible/JJ dynamic/NN which/WDT respects/VBZ nations/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT keynote/JJ idea/NN on/IN the/DT new/JJ governance/NN which/WDT we/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN to/TO have/VB seen/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ communication/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, but/CC which/WDT is/VBZ unfortunately/RB not/RB there/RB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, you/PRP claim/VBP to/TO be/VB shaping/VBG a/DT new/JJ Europe/NNP yet/RB you/PRP are/VBP lacking/VBG one/CD basic/JJ element/NN :/: confidence/NN ./.

The/DT confidence/NN of/IN millions/NNS of/IN Europeans/NNPS can/MD not/RB be/VB won/VBN without/IN being/VBG worthy/JJ of/IN this/DT ./.

And/CC how/WRB could/MD you/PRP be/VB worthy/JJ of/IN this/DT after/IN the/DT mad/JJ cow/NN scandal/NN and/CC the/DT resignation/NN of/IN the/DT Santer/NNP Commission/NNP for/IN corruption/NN ?/.

You/PRP are/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN millions/NNS of/IN unemployed/JJ and/CC for/IN millions/NNS living/VBG in/IN poverty/NN ,/, insecurity/RB and/CC increasing/VBG misery/RB because/RB of/IN your/PRP$ ultra-trade-oriented/NN and/CC ultra-liberal/NN policies/NNS and/CC because/RB of/IN the/DT forced/VBN march/NN towards/IN the/DT single/JJ currency/NN ./.

You/PRP wanted/VBD and/CC have/VBP obtained/VBN the/DT abolition/NN of/IN internal/JJ borders/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, you/PRP have/VBP opened/VBN Europe/NNP up/RP to/TO an/DT explosion/NN in/IN crime/NN and/CC insecurity/NN and/CC to/TO a/DT flood/NN of/IN uncontrolled/JJ immigration/NN ./.

You/PRP are/VBP now/RB proposing/VBG to/TO give/VB all/DT decision-making/JJ power/NN to/TO a/DT handful/NN of/IN officials/NNS ./.

The/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC NGOs/NNP will/MD simply/RB become/VB enforcers/NNS of/IN decisions/NNS handed/VBN down/RP from/IN above/JJ ,/, all/DT on/IN an/DT equal/JJ footing/NN in/IN their/PRP$ submission/NN to/TO Brussels/NNP ./.

Not/RB once/RB does/VBZ your/PRP$ twelve-page/JJ document/NN mention/VB the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS even/RB though/IN they/PRP comprise/VBP the/DT elected/VBN representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.

Clearly/RB ,/, they/PRP have/VBP no/DT role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN your/PRP$ strategy/NN ./.

You/PRP dare/MD not/RB even/RB call/VB a/DT spade/NN a/DT spade/NN ,/, but/CC instead/RB hide/VB behind/IN pseudo-trendy/JJ language/NN by/IN using/VBG the/DT term/NN `/`` governance/NN '/'' for/IN what/WP is/VBZ nothing/NN more/JJR than/IN federal/JJ ,/, autocratic/JJ ,/, centralised/JJ government/NN ./.

Having/VBG tried/VBN for/IN many/JJ years/NNS to/TO persuade/VB us/PRP by/IN talking/VBG of/IN shared/VBN sovereignty/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP now/RB revealing/VBG your/PRP$ ultimate/JJ goal/NN ./.

You/PRP intend/VBP to/TO trade/VB in/IN all/DT European/JJ sovereignty/NN ,/, whether/IN national/JJ or/CC collective/JJ ,/, for/IN a/DT world/NN government/NN in/IN which/WDT you/PRP do/VBP not/RB even/RB expect/VB to/TO obtain/VB a/DT dominant/JJ position/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, you/PRP are/VBP daring/JJ to/TO condemn/VB and/CC penalise/VB the/DT free/JJ and/CC democratic/JJ vote/NN of/IN millions/NNS of/IN Austrians/NNP ,/, or/CC are/VBP allowing/VBG this/DT to/TO happen/VB ,/, just/RB because/IN the/DT result/NN does/VBZ not/RB suit/VB you/PRP ./.

Yet/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN you/PRP are/VBP supporting/VBG Communist/NNP China/NNP and/CC trading/VBG with/IN countries/NNS which/WDT have/VBP openly/RB violated/VBN human/JJ rights/NNS for/IN decades/NNS ./.

Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP are/VBP today/NN speaking/VBG out/RP against/IN a/DT telegram/NN from/IN Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP to/TO Chancellor/NNP Sch脙艗ssel/NNP which/WDT ,/, quite/RB obviously/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB a/DT demonstration/NN of/IN sympathy/NN but/CC rather/RB a/DT political/JJ manoeuvre/NN ./.

Your/PRP$ sabre-rattling/JJ fools/NNS no/RB one/CD because/IN ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP perfectly/RB well/RB ,/, whether/IN you/PRP like/VB it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, you/PRP need/VBP Austria/NNP in/IN order/NN to/TO reform/VB the/DT Treaties/NNP and/CC harmonise/JJ savings/NNS tax/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD cynically/RB and/CC hypocritically/RB use/VB Austria/NNP as/IN a/DT convenient/JJ threat/NN to/TO further/RBR strip/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN any/DT real/JJ powers/NNS in/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Your/PRP$ Commissioners/NNS are/VBP clearly/RB not/RB solely/RB responsible/JJ for/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT governments/NNS which/WDT ,/, through/IN spinelessness/NNS or/CC ideology/NN ,/, support/VBP you/PRP are/VBP also/RB responsible/JJ ./.

Brussels/NNP is/VBZ not/RB all/DT of/IN us/PRP ,/, as/IN you/PRP claim/VBP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ all/DT of/IN you/PRP ./.

Tell/VB the/DT truth/NN for/IN once/RB ./.

You/PRP could/MD not/RB care/VB less/RBR what/WP the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP want/VBP ./.

They/PRP are/VBP free/JJ to/TO choose/VB only/RB between/IN your/PRP$ brave/JJ new/JJ world/NN and/CC denouncement/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ over/IN ten/CD years/NNS since/IN the/DT collapse/NN of/IN the/DT Soviet/NNP Union/NNP and/CC yet/RB your/PRP$ projects/NNS contain/VBP a/DT strong/JJ hint/NN of/IN the/DT gulags/NNS and/CC mollifying/NN moralism/NN ./.

We/PRP were/VBD among/IN the/DT small/JJ number/NN who/WP denounced/VBD the/DT communist/JJ dictatorship/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP and/CC will/MD remain/VB among/IN those/DT fighting/NN against/IN Europeanist/NNP dictatorship/NN ./.

We/PRP call/VBP on/IN all/PDT the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP to/TO resist/VB your/PRP$ monstrous/JJ projects/NNS ./.

The/DT salvation/NN of/IN European/JJ democracies/NNS is/VBZ with/IN nation/NN states/NNS ./.

Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ salvation/NN lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT cooperation/NN of/IN the/DT nations/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Limited/JJ applause/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

President/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, today/NN you/PRP have/VBP presented/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ five-year/JJ programme/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ many/JJ objectives/NNS that/IN we/PRP endorse/VBP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT programme/NN based/VBN on/IN real-life/JJ situations/NNS and/CC issues/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB right/JJ to/TO put/VB concrete/JJ measures/NNS aside/RB for/IN the/DT moment/NN and/CC focus/VB on/IN the/DT major/JJ issues/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, judging/VBG from/IN the/DT text/NN and/CC the/DT document/NN that/IN you/PRP had/VBD sent/VBN to/TO us/PRP ,/, one/CD subject/NN that/WDT is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ to/TO both/DT of/IN us/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN given/VBN secondary/JJ importance/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ solidarity/NN ,/, not/RB so/RB much/JJ at/IN international/JJ level/NN as/IN at/IN internal/JJ level/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ of/IN the/DT utmost/JJ importance/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN those/DT who/WP can/MD not/RB keep/VB up/RP ,/, one/CD which/WDT reminds/VBZ us/PRP of/IN how/WRB difficult/JJ and/CC complicated/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO establish/VB progress/NN indicators/NNS and/CC how/WRB inadequate/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO use/VB the/DT parameter/NN of/IN per/IN capita/NN income/NN alone/RB ./.

The/DT fundamental/JJ element/NN for/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN each/DT person/NN -/: his/PRP$ freedom/NN ,/, which/WDT comes/VBZ before/IN economic/JJ gain/NN -/: is/VBZ thus/RB enhanced/VBN ./.

This/DT social/JJ freedom/NN ,/, which/WDT becomes/VBZ manifest/JJ in/IN initiatives/NNS favouring/VBG the/DT poor/JJ ,/, gives/VBZ excellent/JJ results/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ justice/NN and/CC stability/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, public/JJ institutions/NNS must/MD not/RB accept/VB only/RB the/DT economic/JJ criterion/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ heritage/NN has/VBZ taught/VBN us/PRP that/IN politics/NNS must/MD have/VB a/DT heart/NN ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP and/CC the/DT actions/NNS of/IN you/PRP and/CC your/PRP$ Commission/NN will/MD put/VB this/DT into/IN practice/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, `/`` Shaping/NNP the/DT new/JJ Europe/NNP '/'' is/VBZ an/DT ambitious/JJ objective/NN both/DT for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC for/IN us/PRP all/DT ./.

Our/PRP$ ambitions/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ work/NN will/MD be/VB followed/VBN not/RB only/JJ by/IN people/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ countries/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB by/IN many/JJ people/NNS outside/IN Europe/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

What/WDT sort/NN of/IN impression/NN will/MD an/DT interested/JJ public/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, have/VB of/IN this/DT five-year/JJ programme/NN ?/.

My/PRP$ reply/NN would/MD be/VB :/: a/DT new/JJ start/NN ,/, a/DT clear/JJ agenda/NN for/IN reform/NN which/WDT confirms/VBZ that/IN the/DT Union/NNP in/IN the/DT 2000s/NNS will/MD not/RB stop/VB at/IN being/VBG an/DT economic/JJ community/NN but/CC will/MD become/VB a/DT community/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB trusted/VBN and/CC that/IN we/PRP take/VBP seriously/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ correct/JJ in/IN stating/VBG that/IN the/DT Union/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO develop/VB and/CC safeguard/VB the/DT welfare/NN state/NN in/IN an/DT age/NN of/IN globalisation/NN ./.

It/PRP foresees/VBZ a/DT just/RB and/CC more/RBR effective/JJ Europe/NNP that/IN also/RB recognises/VBZ its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS beyond/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ borders/NNS out/RB of/IN solidarity/JJ and/CC enlightened/VBN self-interest/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP see/VBP poverty/NN and/CC exclusion/NN as/IN the/DT greatest/JJS enemies/NNS of/IN peace/NN and/CC freedom/NN ./.

I/PRP concur/VBP with/IN what/WP other/JJ members/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ political/JJ group/NN have/VBP said/VBD and/CC I/PRP commend/VB the/DT tone/NN of/IN your/PRP$ document/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP two/CD omissions/NNS which/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ future/JJ work/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ concerns/NNS women/NNS ,/, gender/NN and/CC women/NNS 's/VBZ rights/NNS ./.

You/PRP talked/VBD about/IN how/WRB women/NNS can/MD help/VB in/IN increasing/VBG production/NN and/CC growth/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, but/CC equality/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB necessary/JJ for/IN productivity/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO make/VB our/PRP$ societies/NNS more/RBR democratic/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB noticeable/JJ that/DT `/`` equality/NN '/'' ,/, `/`` gender/UH '/'' and/CC `/`` women/UH '/'' are/VBP barely/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN `/`` Shaping/NNP the/NNP New/NNP Europe/NNP '/'' ./.

You/PRP mentioned/VBD `/`` women/NNS '/'' in/IN your/PRP$ speech/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP not/RB referred/VBN to/TO in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT strategic/JJ goals/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ that/DT because/RB mainstreaming/NN is/VBZ already/RB so/RB widespread/JJ in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN to/TO mention/VB women/NNS ?/.

What/WDT other/JJ explanation/NN could/MD there/EX be/VB for/IN omitting/VBG women/NNS ?/.

The/DT EU/NNP must/MD not/RB take/VB on/IN a/DT masculine/JJ persona/NN ./.

My/PRP$ other/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ Africa/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ continent/NN not/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN `/`` Shaping/VBG the/DT New/NNP Europe/NNP '/'' ./.

Africa/NNP has/VBZ the/DT largest/JJS number/NN of/IN refugees/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS overall/JJ poverty/NN and/CC a/DT debilitating/JJ AIDS/NNP epidemic/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN Commissioner/NNP Nielson/NNP and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ Commissioners/NNS are/VBP doing/VBG a/DT fine/JJ job/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP also/RB needs/VBZ to/TO focus/VB more/JJR clearly/RB on/IN that/WDT continent/NN ,/, partly/RB by/IN including/VBG it/PRP among/IN its/PRP$ strategic/JJ goals/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS statement/NN and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT says/VBZ for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ prepared/VBN unilaterally/RB to/TO introduce/VB measures/NNS to/TO make/VB it/PRP easier/JJR for/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS to/TO gain/VB access/NN to/TO our/PRP$ markets/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD merely/RB ask/VB when/WRB this/DT is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO take/VB effect/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT vital/JJ document/NN for/IN the/DT future/NN and/CC fate/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, out/RB of/IN all/PDT the/DT points/NNS ,/, two/CD specifically/RB require/VBP our/PRP$ attention/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP closely/RB linked/VBN :/: peace/NN and/CC stability/NN within/IN Europe/NNP and/CC outside/IN Europe/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT question/NN of/IN objectives/NNS that/WDT must/MD be/VB pursued/VBN as/IN a/DT priority/NN ./.

For/IN some/DT time/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP all/RB agreed/VBN on/IN this/DT notion/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD also/RB clearly/RB affirm/VB that/IN these/DT objectives/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB achieved/VBN without/IN enlargement/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN this/DT comes/VBZ at/IN a/DT price/NN ./.

Today/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN called/VBN on/RP to/TO choose/VB ,/, for/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ decades/NNS ,/, between/IN a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT might/MD be/VB less/RBR prosperous/JJ but/CC a/DT beacon/NN of/IN peace/NN and/CC civilisation/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ planet/NN and/CC a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT might/MD be/VB more/RBR wealthy/JJ ,/, but/CC where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ uncertainty/NN over/IN what/WP the/DT future/NN might/MD bring/VB ./.

The/DT first/JJ supporter/NN of/IN this/DT reform/NN should/MD be/VB Parliament/VBN itself/PRP ,/, if/IN it/PRP really/RB wants/VBZ to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ role/NN of/IN interpreting/VBG the/DT will/NN of/IN the/DT Europeans/NNPS and/CC acquire/VB the/DT centrality/NN which/WDT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN a/DT genuinely/RB democratic/JJ and/CC firmly/RB integrated/VBN Union/NNP ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, it/PRP will/MD only/RB be/VB possible/JJ to/TO give/VB the/DT Commission/NNP responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT tasks/NNS it/PRP takes/VBZ on/RP according/VBG to/TO the/DT actual/JJ powers/NNS it/PRP will/MD be/VB accorded/VBN ./.

Without/IN these/DT prospects/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP outlined/VBN ,/, Europe/NNP would/MD ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, have/VB no/DT future/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP pleased/VBN about/IN the/DT overall/JJ intention/NN of/IN the/DT objectives/NNS announced/VBD which/WDT are/VBP in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT challenges/NNS which/WDT Europe/NNP must/MD overcome/VB ./.

I/PRP note/VBP that/IN you/PRP consider/VBP the/DT fall/NN of/IN the/DT Berlin/NNP wall/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT crucial/JJ factor/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT century/NN ./.

This/DT event/NN must/MD underpin/VB enlargement/NN ./.

Rather/RB than/IN using/VBG the/DT word/NN `/`` enlargement/JJ '/'' ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO talk/VB of/IN reunification/NN which/WDT has/VBZ much/RB greater/JJR political/JJ significance/NN ./.

Your/PRP$ idea/NN is/VBZ to/TO concentrate/VB your/PRP$ activities/NNS on/IN the/DT core/JJ tasks/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT goals/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ reform/NN ./.

In/IN essence/NN this/DT means/VBZ applying/VBG the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

Precise/JJ application/NN of/IN this/DT principle/NN can/MD only/RB reinforce/VB the/DT actions/NNS taken/VBN and/CC give/VB our/PRP$ citizens/NNS a/DT clear/JJ view/NN of/IN each/DT level/NN of/IN competence/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, saying/VBG is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN and/CC doing/VBG is/VBZ another/DT !/NN ./.

You/PRP must/MD therefore/RB fight/VB against/IN the/DT tendency/NN of/IN all/DT institutions/NNS to/TO try/VB and/CC increase/VB their/PRP$ powers/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD therefore/RB judge/VB you/PRP on/IN your/PRP$ deeds/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, I/PRP approve/VBP and/CC encourage/VBP this/DT clearly/RB expressed/VBN desire/NN in/IN your/PRP$ communication/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD make/VB two/CD essential/JJ points/NNS ./.

These/DT concern/NN the/DT simplification/NN and/CC application/NN of/IN Community/NNP law/NN ./.

In/IN 1998/CD ,/, 123/CD referrals/NNS were/VBD made/VBN to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP for/IN non-application/NN or/CC non-transposition/NN and/CC 25/CD %/NN of/IN environmental/JJ directives/NNS were/VBD not/RB applied/VBN or/CC transposed/VBN ./.

Recent/JJ events/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN us/PRP that/IN these/DT regulations/NNS are/VBP essential/JJ ./.

Community/NNP law/NN must/MD not/RB go/VB unapplied/JJ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB complex/JJ or/CC too/RB pedantic/JJ ./.

The/DT Union/NNP must/MD not/RB make/VB this/DT mistake/NN and/CC I/PRP therefore/RB regret/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN your/PRP$ communication/NN does/VBZ not/RB go/VB into/IN more/JJR detail/NN on/IN this/DT ./.

You/PRP are/VBP being/VBG realistic/JJ when/WRB you/PRP say/VBP that/IN the/DT welfare/NN state/NN can/MD no/RB longer/RB provide/VB adequate/JJ responses/NNS to/TO the/DT problems/NNS facing/VBG us/PRP ,/, including/VBG unemployment/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP regret/VBP that/IN a/DT clear/JJ alternative/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN proposed/VBN ./.

The/DT emphasis/NN should/MD have/VB been/VBN placed/VBN on/IN the/DT rejection/NN of/IN any/DT policy/NN of/IN handouts/NNS and/CC instead/RB on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN initiative/NN and/CC responsibility/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP not/RB highlighted/VBN the/DT ageing/NN of/IN our/PRP$ population/NN which/WDT will/MD fundamentally/RB alter/VB the/DT structure/NN of/IN our/PRP$ society/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB economically/RB but/CC also/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN public/JJ health/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT silent/JJ revolution/NN and/CC in/IN this/DT respect/NN I/PRP expected/VBD more/JJR from/IN your/PRP$ communication/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, you/PRP do/VBP highlight/VB European/JJ research/NN as/IN being/VBG at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN our/PRP$ future/NN ./.

Yet/CC you/PRP do/VBP not/RB indicate/VB the/DT resources/NNS you/PRP intend/VBP to/TO implement/VB to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ./.

Also/RB ,/, ethical/JJ principles/NNS are/VBP at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN this/DT research/NN but/CC your/PRP$ communication/NN says/VBZ nothing/NN about/IN these/DT ./.

If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO better/RBR inform/VB the/DT people/NNS ,/, you/PRP should/MD start/VB by/IN strengthening/VBG liaison/NN with/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, as/IN we/PRP are/VBP the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP can/MD only/RB endorse/VB the/DT general/JJ guidelines/NNS of/IN the/DT five-year/JJ programme/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT programme/NN for/IN 2000/CD ,/, set/VBD out/RP with/IN so/RB much/JJ enthusiasm/NN by/IN President/NNP Prodi/NNP this/DT morning/NN ./.

Firstly/NNP ,/, the/DT promotion/NN of/IN and/CC participation/NN in/IN the/DT drafting/NN of/IN joint/JJ plans/NNS for/IN the/DT creation/NN of/IN an/DT integrated/VBN services/NNS network/NN in/IN the/DT transport/NN and/CC energy/NN sectors/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT backing/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Investment/NNP Bank/NNP ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT approval/NN of/IN investments/NNS -/: where/WRB the/DT parameters/NNS are/VBP binding/JJ when/WRB drawing/VBG up/RP action/NN programmes/NNS on/IN employment/NN -/: to/TO be/VB made/VBN in/IN individual/JJ countries/NNS via/IN Community/NNP projects/VBZ in/IN the/DT priority/NN sectors/NNS of/IN research/NN ,/, innovation/NN and/CC training/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, you/PRP have/VBP come/VBN here/RB today/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT very/RB reformist/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ mood/NN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP you/PRP and/CC your/PRP$ ambition/NN ./.

Ambition/NNP will/MD be/VB needed/VBN ,/, given/VBN the/DT mammoth/JJ task/NN which/WDT awaits/VBZ us/PRP ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB these/DT reforms/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB progress/NN with/IN the/DT 2001/CD legislative/JJ programme/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB very/RB sure/JJ ,/, not/RB only/JJ of/IN the/DT strengths/NNS of/IN the/DT reformer/NN himself/PRP ,/, but/CC also/RB of/IN the/DT opinions/NNS of/IN others/NNS ./.

You/PRP say/VBP that/IN you/PRP will/MD not/RB hesitate/VB to/TO come/VB to/TO this/DT House/NNP to/TO request/VB more/JJR resources/NNS for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD be/VB aware/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP walking/VBG on/IN thin/JJ financial/JJ ice/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP 1.27/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/NNP GDP/NNP ./.

Not/RB a/DT euro/NN more/RBR or/CC a/DT euro/NN less/JJR ./.

It/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB us/PRP who/WP refuse/VBP these/DT new/JJ resources/NNS ./.

You/PRP should/MD ask/VB the/DT Council/NN ./.

These/DT financial/JJ perspectives/NNS are/VBP adjusted/VBN to/TO within/IN a/DT millimetre/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO finance/VB the/DT stability/NN plan/NN for/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO negotiate/VB a/DT significant/JJ revision/NN of/IN Category/NNP 4/CD ,/, and/CC you/PRP must/MD remember/VB the/DT enormous/JJ difficulties/NNS we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN in/IN approving/VBG the/DT 2000/CD budget/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD remind/VB you/PRP that/IN this/DT Group/NNP ,/, the/DT PPE-DE/NN ,/, does/VBZ not/RB like/VB to/TO finance/VB new/JJ political/JJ initiatives/NNS at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN existing/VBG ones/NNS ./.

The/DT political/JJ priorities/NNS must/MD be/VB set/VBN by/IN this/DT House/NNP and/CC the/DT MEPs/NNPS ./.

Do/VB not/RB believe/VB for/IN one/CD moment/NN that/IN your/PRP$ proposed/VBN reform/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN will/MD disguise/VB the/DT limitations/NNS of/IN the/DT Community/NNP financial/JJ system/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB wonder/VBP whether/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ the/DT political/JJ will/NN to/TO resolve/VB them/PRP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP communication/NN is/VBZ well/RB written/JJ but/CC sufficiently/RB vague/JJ to/TO allow/VB any/DT interpretation/NN whatsoever/RB ./.

On/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP the/DT words/NNS and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, their/PRP$ real/JJ political/JJ meaning/NN ./.

We/PRP Socialists/NNPS applaud/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN wanting/VBG to/TO fight/VB against/IN social/JJ exclusion/NN and/CC poverty/NN ./.

Yet/RB how/WRB can/MD the/DT gulf/NN between/IN political/JJ rhetoric/NN and/CC reality/NN be/VB filled/VBN ?/.

What/WP is/VBZ meant/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/PRP declared/VBD objective/NN of/IN `/`` economic/JJ reform/NN '/'' in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ?/.

Does/NNP this/DT mean/VB more/JJR flexibility/NN ,/, insecurity/NN and/CC fixed-term/JJ contracts/NNS ?/.

Everyone/NN knows/VBZ that/IN quality/NN of/IN life/NN and/CC full/JJ and/CC better/JJR employment/NN depend/VBP on/IN sustainable/JJ economic/JJ growth/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB restricted/VBN to/TO a/DT policy/NN of/IN stability/NN which/WDT is/VBZ certainly/RB necessary/JJ but/CC insufficient/JJ ./.

We/PRP Socialists/NNPS desperately/RB want/VBP a/DT European/JJ pact/NN for/IN growth/NN and/CC employment/NN ./.

The/DT ingredients/NNS of/IN this/DT policy/NN are/VBP well/RB known/VBN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP the/DT stimulation/NN of/IN public/JJ and/CC private/JJ investment/NN ,/, increased/JJ investment/NN in/IN research/NN ,/, education/NN and/CC training/NN and/CC the/DT promotion/NN of/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN enterprise/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT e-Europe/JJ initiative/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

In/IN the/DT world/NN of/IN new/JJ technologies/NNS ,/, the/DT main/JJ danger/NN remains/VBZ that/IN access/NN to/TO information/NN will/MD be/VB easier/JJR the/DT richer/JJR you/PRP are/VBP ./.

The/DT gulfs/NNS which/WDT are/VBP opening/VBG up/RP everywhere/RB are/VBP the/DT main/JJ problem/NN for/IN our/PRP$ era/NN ./.

On/IN one/CD hand/NN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT exuberance/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS and/CC the/DT explosion/NN of/IN wealth/NN and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, more/RBR widespread/JJ exclusion/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP asking/VBG workers/NNS to/TO be/VB flexible/JJ ,/, innovative/JJ and/CC ever/RB more/RBR productive/JJ ,/, yet/CC the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN this/DT productivity/NN increasingly/RB benefit/VBP the/DT shareholders/NNS alone/RB ./.

The/DT European/NNP Central/NNP Bank/NNP is/VBZ keeping/VBG very/RB quiet/JJ about/IN the/DT staggering/JJ rates/NNS of/IN return/NN on/IN financial/JJ assets/NNS ,/, yet/CC it/PRP never/RB misses/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO remind/VB us/PRP that/IN any/DT wage/NN increase/NN should/MD remain/VB below/IN the/DT rate/NN of/IN increase/NN in/IN productivity/NN ./.

How/WRB do/VBP we/PRP explain/VB to/TO workers/NNS who/WP fall/VBP victim/NN to/TO the/DT rationalisations/NNS of/IN the/DT worldwide/JJ Monopoly/NNP game/NN that/IN they/PRP must/MD be/VB prepared/JJ to/TO change/VB career/NN several/JJ times/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ working/VBG lives/NNS when/WRB the/DT captains/NNS of/IN industry/NN ,/, having/VBG lost/VBN the/DT gamble/NN of/IN a/DT take-over/NN ,/, leave/VBP with/IN compensation/NN of/IN EUR/$ 30/CD million/CD ?/.

For/IN years/NNS we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN told/VBN over/RP and/CC over/RP that/IN the/DT economy/NN must/MD be/VB liberalised/VBN ./.

The/DT sectors/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN liberalised/VBN are/VBP experiencing/VBG an/DT avalanche/NN of/IN mergers/NNS and/CC acquisitions/NNS ,/, leading/VBG inevitably/RB to/TO monopoly/NN situations/NNS ./.

All/PDT these/DT stock/NN market/NN battles/NNS are/VBP based/VBN solely/RB on/IN forecast/NN increases/NNS in/IN profit/NN of/IN 15/CD %/NN ,/, 20/CD %/NN or/CC 25/CD %/NN which/WDT are/VBP unrealistic/JJ in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ./.

The/DT unfettered/JJ rise/NN in/IN prices/NNS of/IN financial/JJ assets/NNS and/CC property/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT risks/NNS are/VBP on/IN the/DT increase/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ danger/NN awaiting/VBG us/PRP in/IN the/DT medium/NN term/NN is/VBZ not/RB inflation/NN but/CC deflation/NN caused/VBN by/IN the/DT collapse/NN of/IN the/DT speculative/JJ bubbles/NNS on/IN the/DT international/JJ financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

To/TO conclude/VB ,/, the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS will/MD be/VB crucial/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP new/JJ rules/NNS to/TO regulate/VB globalisation/NN and/CC we/PRP need/VBP investment/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ economy/NN and/CC in/IN people/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO ensure/VB the/DT social/JJ dimension/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN economy/NN in/IN a/DT visible/JJ manner/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNPS ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, this/DT strategy/NN paper/NN has/VBZ two/CD clear/JJ weaknesses/NNS ./.

I/PRP was/VBD also/RB encouraged/VBN by/IN Commissioner/NNP Patten/NNP '/POS s/JJ comments/NNS this/DT morning/NN about/IN a/DT rapid/JJ reaction/NN fund/NN for/IN security/NN crises/NNS ./.

Perhaps/RB that/DT will/MD end/VB scandals/NNS like/IN the/DT failure/NN of/IN states/NNS to/TO deploy/VB in/IN Kosovo/NNP the/DT police/NN they/PRP promised/VBD ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO highlight/VB three/CD areas/NNS among/IN many/JJ where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP quick/JJ progress/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ asylum/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO establish/VB a/DT single/JJ European/JJ system/NN ,/, but/CC one/PRP based/VBN on/IN fairness/NN ,/, full/JJ respect/NN for/IN the/DT Geneva/NNP Convention/NNP and/CC decent/JJ reception/NN conditions/NNS ,/, including/VBG an/DT end/NN to/TO routine/JJ detention/NN ./.

Decisions/NNS on/IN asylum/NN should/MD take/VB months/NNS -/: not/RB years/NNS ./.

The/DT second/JJ area/NN is/VBZ that/DT of/IN freedom/NN :/: freedom/NN to/TO move/VB and/CC reside/VB wherever/WRB one/PRP wishes/VBZ in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ;/: freedom/NN of/IN information/NN ;/: freedom/NN to/TO vote/VB for/IN all/DT who/WP have/VBP European/JJ citizenship/NN -/: and/CC that/DT includes/VBZ not/RB just/RB Member/VB State/NNP citizens/NNS but/CC third/JJ country/NN nationals/NNS ./.

Let/VB our/PRP$ citizens/NNS know/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ common/JJ policies/NNS in/IN justice/NN and/CC home/NN affairs/NNS are/VBP about/IN freedom/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB about/IN repression/NN ./.

The/DT last/JJ area/NN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO mention/VB is/VBZ convergence/NN of/IN civil/JJ and/CC criminal/JJ justice/NN systems/NNS ./.

Arrested/VBN and/CC released/VBN in/IN Madrid/NNP ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ now/RB being/VBG extradited/VBN after/IN arrest/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP ./.

Whatever/WDT the/DT Eurosceptics/NNPS say/VBP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN all/PDT our/PRP$ interests/NNS to/TO get/VB cooperation/NN in/IN such/JJ matters/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, as/IN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN said/VBN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT IGC/NNP will/MD cover/VB this/DT ,/, to/TO move/VB to/TO codecision/VB with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN these/DT areas/NNS ,/, with/IN democratic/JJ and/CC judicial/JJ scrutiny/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, all/RB I/PRP can/MD say/VB about/IN 1999/CD is/VBZ this/DT :/: how/WRB wonderful/JJ to/TO feel/VB the/DT Portuguese/NNP summer/NN after/IN the/DT Finnish/JJ winter/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN it/PRP works/VBZ out/RP ./.

The/DT Tampere/NNP Summit/NNP was/VBD certainly/RB an/DT important/JJ milestone/NN in/IN 1999/CD for/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN in/IN particular/NN ./.

Numerous/JJ questions/NNS are/VBP still/RB outstanding/JJ ./.

Answers/NNS are/VBP still/RB awaited/JJ ./.

Since/IN Tampere/NNP ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT imbalance/NN between/IN positive/JJ action/NN and/CC mere/JJ declarations/NNS of/IN intent/NN ./.

Regulations/NNPS on/IN nationality/NN and/CC the/DT integration/NN of/IN people/NNS from/IN third/JJ countries/NNS are/VBP still/RB outstanding/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, quite/RB specific/JJ action/NN has/VBZ been/VBN called/VBN for/IN on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN safety/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

The/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS will/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT important/JJ projects/NNS in/IN the/DT immediate/JJ future/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO predict/VB what/WP the/DT content/NN of/IN this/DT charter/NN will/MD be/VB and/CC how/WRB it/PRP will/MD be/VB implemented/VBN legally/RB when/WRB you/PRP think/VBP of/IN the/DT people/NNS who/WP are/VBP not/RB currently/RB citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT Europol/NNP agreement/NN has/VBZ now/RB officially/RB entered/VBN into/IN force/NN ./.

In/IN Tampere/NNP ,/, the/DT question/NN of/IN granting/VBG operational/JJ powers/NNS was/VBD discussed/VBN ./.

We/PRP continue/VBP to/TO demand/VB a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT agreement/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO incorporate/VB better/JJR parliamentary/JJ and/CC judicial/JJ control/NN ./.

The/DT agreement/NN also/RB attracts/VBZ criticism/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO EURODAC/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ amended/VBD the/DT contractual/JJ text/NN ./.

Care/NNP must/MD be/VB taken/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT Council/NNP complies/VBZ with/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ modus/NNS operandi/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, no/DT initiatives/NNS have/VBP yet/RB materialised/VBN regarding/VBG other/JJ matters/NNS and/CC we/PRP still/RB await/VBP them/PRP ./.

Europe/NNP as/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN has/VBZ so/RB far/RB been/VBN an/DT area/NN with/IN no/DT clear/JJ regulation/NN in/IN important/JJ sectors/NNS ./.

And/CC yet/RB we/PRP owe/VBP this/DT to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Having/VBG listened/VBD to/TO the/DT justice/NN and/CC home/NN affairs/NNS ministers/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP optimistic/JJ and/CC I/PRP am/VBP assuming/VBG that/IN we/PRP will/MD succeed/VB in/IN the/DT next/JJ six/CD months/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT oral/JJ question/NN tabled/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Terr脙/NNP 鲁/NNP n/NNP i/FW Cus脙/NN shows/VBZ that/IN this/DT House/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG a/DT firm/NN stance/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, six/CD months/NNS after/IN the/DT election/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ Parliament/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD now/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO send/VB a/DT firm/JJ political/JJ message/NN to/TO the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP can/MD contribute/VB positively/RB to/TO this/DT ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/DT aware/JJ of/IN the/DT enormous/JJ expectations/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ people/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ,/, particularly/RB social/JJ justice/NN ./.

Yet/CC their/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN interest/NN and/CC involvement/NN and/CC sometimes/RB even/RB their/PRP$ distaste/NN for/IN all/DT things/NNS political/JJ requires/VBZ us/PRP to/TO take/VB specific/JJ action/NN to/TO tackle/VB their/PRP$ problems/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT sine/JJ qua/NN non/NN condition/NN for/IN reconciling/VBG the/DT popular/JJ and/CC political/JJ spheres/NNS ./.

For/IN Europe/NNP to/TO become/VB the/DT symbol/NN of/IN peace/NN and/CC fraternity/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP a/DT bold/JJ and/CC generous/JJ policy/NN to/TO come/VB to/TO the/DT aid/NN of/IN the/DT most/JJS disadvantaged/NN ./.

A/DT proper/JJ plan/NN for/IN fighting/VBG unemployment/NN must/MD be/VB established/VBN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT scourge/NN which/WDT is/VBZ allowing/VBG the/DT rise/NN of/IN racism/NN ,/, xenophobia/NN ,/, nationalism/NN and/CC extreme-right/JJ racist/NN movements/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD remember/VB that/IN the/DT most/RBS disadvantaged/JJ include/VBP immigrants/NNS and/CC refugees/NNS ./.

The/DT virtually/RB systematic/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN detention/NN and/CC the/DT criminalisation/NN of/IN asylum-seekers/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR acceptable/JJ ./.

All/DT asylum-seekers/NNS must/MD be/VB entitled/VBN to/TO a/DT fair/JJ hearing/NN and/CC an/DT appeal/NN with/IN suspensory/JJ effect/NN ./.

Last/JJ week/NN ,/, and/CC somewhat/RB by/IN chance/NN ,/, I/PRP witnessed/VBZ ,/, at/IN Roissy/NNP airport/NN ,/, a/DT scene/NN of/IN rare/JJ violence/NN in/IN which/WDT two/CD young/JJ women/NNS ,/, admittedly/RB illegal/JJ immigrants/NNS ,/, were/VBD being/VBG returned/VBN to/TO Conakry/NNP ./.

They/PRP were/VBD treated/VBN like/IN the/DT worst/JJS criminals/NNS ./.

The/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP must/MD put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO this/DT type/NN of/IN barbaric/JJ behaviour/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ role/NN should/MD be/VB to/TO accompany/VB ,/, reassure/VB and/CC assist/VB those/DT who/WP are/VBP fleeing/VBG dictatorships/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN creating/VBG a/DT European/JJ fund/NN for/IN refugees/NNS to/TO which/WDT Parliament/NNP was/VBD favourably/RB disposed/JJ ./.

Instead/RB of/IN all/PDT this/DT waffling/NN about/IN the/DT budget/NN granted/VBN to/TO this/DT fund/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD take/VB the/DT decision/NN to/TO set/VB this/DT up/RP ./.

The/DT Presidency/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP can/MD realise/VB what/WP was/VBD incomprehensibly/RB rejected/VBN in/IN Tampere/NNP ,/, even/RB though/IN this/DT summit/NN provided/VBD an/DT important/JJ basis/NN ./.

Likewise/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB simply/RB record/VB the/DT rise/NN in/IN xenophobic/JJ feelings/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC the/DT increasingly/RB common/JJ discrimination/NN without/IN taking/VBG wide-ranging/JJ action/NN ./.

The/DT laws/NNS against/IN racism/NN must/MD be/VB harmonised/VBN ./.

What/WDT direction/NN do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO give/VB to/TO Article/NNP 13/CD of/IN the/DT EC/NNP Treaty/NNP ?/.

What/WP do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO do/VB to/TO promote/VB equal/JJ treatment/NN in/IN wages/NNS for/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ?/.

How/WRB do/VBP you/PRP aim/VB to/TO eradicate/VB homophobia/NN ,/, racism/NN and/CC sexism/NN ?/.

We/PRP must/MD take/VB the/DT best/JJS from/IN each/DT of/IN our/PRP$ countries/NNS ./.

When/WRB six/CD European/JJ countries/NNS have/VBP granted/VBN the/DT right/NN to/TO vote/VB ,/, the/DT President/NNP of/IN this/DT House/NNP can/MD venture/VB to/TO extend/VB this/DT right/NN to/TO vote/VB ,/, and/CC eligibility/NN to/TO participate/VB in/IN the/DT municipal/NN and/CC European/JJ elections/NNS ,/, to/TO all/DT people/NNS from/IN outside/IN the/DT Community/NNP who/WP have/VBP lived/VBN in/IN Europe/NNP for/IN more/JJR than/IN five/CD years/NNS ./.

The/DT regularisation/NN of/IN illegal/JJ immigrants/NNS in/IN certain/JJ countries/NNS ,/, including/VBG your/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, must/MD act/VB as/IN an/DT example/NN to/TO others/NNS ./.

These/DT illegal/JJ immigrants/NNS nowadays/RB constitute/VBP a/DT plethora/NN of/IN vulnerable/JJ people/NNS at/IN the/DT mercy/NN of/IN slum/NN landlords/NNS ,/, an/DT oppressed/JJ workforce/NN subject/NN to/TO economic/JJ exploitation/NN ,/, rendering/VBG them/PRP modern-day/JJ slaves/NNS ./.

In/IN more/JJR general/JJ terms/NNS ,/, this/DT Presidency/NNP must/MD start/VB to/TO change/VB the/DT behaviour/NN and/CC interaction/NN of/IN our/PRP$ people/NNS with/IN minority/NN groups/NNS and/CC immigrants/NNS ./.

Immigration/NNP is/VBZ too/RB often/RB a/DT synonym/NN for/IN insecurity/NN and/CC violence/NN and/CC purely/RB repressive/JJ responses/NNS ./.

How/WRB do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO make/VB our/PRP$ people/NNS understand/VB that/IN ,/, today/NN like/IN always/RB ,/, immigration/NN is/VBZ a/DT source/NN of/IN social/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ wealth/NN with/IN a/DT role/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, and/CC will/MD remain/VB ,/, essential/JJ in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN population/NN ?/.

What/WDT action/NN do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO take/VB to/TO enhance/VB the/DT place/NN of/IN immigrants/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ society/NN and/CC to/TO guarantee/VB proper/JJ protection/NN for/IN asylum-seekers/NNS ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ lack/NN of/IN transparency/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN security/NN ,/, freedom/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ an/DT economic/JJ powerhouse/NN but/CC we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO pontificate/VB when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO our/PRP$ treatment/NN of/IN refugees/NNS ./.

The/DT level/NN of/IN racism/NN in/IN our/PRP$ society/NN is/VBZ terrifying/JJ ./.

Ireland/NNP ,/, for/IN generations/NNS ,/, sent/VBD her/PRP$ sons/NNS and/CC daughters/NNS to/TO places/NNS of/IN safety/NN throughout/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, but/CC now/RB when/WRB the/DT Celtic/NNP tiger/NN is/VBZ providing/VBG wealth/NN and/CC prosperity/NN beyond/IN our/PRP$ expectations/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP showing/VBG a/DT very/RB ugly/JJ side/NN to/TO our/PRP$ character/NN ./.

Racism/NNP in/IN Ireland/NNP is/VBZ endemic/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT relative/JJ shock/NN to/TO our/PRP$ political/JJ leaders/NNS to/TO find/VB we/PRP must/MD now/RB take/VB a/DT share/NN of/IN the/DT refugees/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN coming/VBG into/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP coming/VBG from/IN behind/RB in/IN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT issue/NN and/CC the/DT government/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG its/PRP$ utmost/NN to/TO catch/VB up/RP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT willingness/NN but/CC fear/NN pervades/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO assuage/VB this/DT fear/NN we/PRP must/MD find/VB political/JJ and/CC religious/JJ leadership/NN not/RB only/JJ in/IN Ireland/NNP but/CC throughout/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP take/VBP note/VBP that/IN the/DT excuse-making/NN ,/, reticent/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, which/WDT ,/, in/IN recent/JJ months/NNS ,/, has/VBZ prevented/VBN us/PRP from/IN holding/VBG a/DT debate/NN such/JJ as/IN the/DT one/NN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO hold/VB today/NN ,/, has/VBZ come/VBN to/TO an/DT end/NN ./.

I/PRP totally/RB agree/VBP with/IN Mr/NNP von/NNP Boetticher/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Schulz/NNP '/POS s/JJ remarks/NNS ,/, and/CC truly/RB believe/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP need/VBP to/TO be/VB more/RBR involved/JJ in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ,/, without/IN having/VBG to/TO derogate/VB from/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ powers/NNS ./.

The/DT two/CD identical-sounding/JJ questions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP under/IN discussion/NN are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, underpinned/VBN by/IN a/DT mantra/NN of/IN the/DT kind/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, has/VBZ increasingly/RB transformed/VBN politics/NNS into/IN a/DT type/NN of/IN ideology/NN -/: fine-sounding/NN ,/, but/CC pernicious/VBZ ./.

And/CC our/PRP$ current/JJ EU/NNP mantra/NN is/VBZ AFSJ/NNP :/: Area/NNP for/IN Freedom/NNP ,/, Security/NNP and/CC Justice/NNP ./.

Behind/IN this/DT lies/VBZ another/DT ambition/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC of/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC of/IN the/DT overwhelming/JJ majority/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, namely/RB to/TO introduce/VB such/PDT an/DT area/NN ./.

And/CC who/WP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN security/NN ,/, freedom/NN and/CC justice/NN ?/.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ just/RB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB something/NN the/DT EU/NNP can/MD introduce/VB by/IN means/NNS of/IN legislative/JJ decrees/NNS and/CC other/JJ supranational/JJ resolutions/NNS ./.

Freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN are/VBP the/DT root/NN system/NN of/IN any/DT society/NN ,/, reflecting/VBG its/PRP$ history/NN ,/, corporate/JJ experience/NN and/CC political/JJ development/NN ./.

A/DT system/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN is/VBZ not/RB something/NN the/DT EU/NNP can/MD introduce/VB without/IN society/NN '/'' s/VBZ sustaining/VBG damage/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB here/RB that/IN we/PRP find/VBP the/DT real/JJ rationale/NN behind/IN the/DT mantra/NN concerning/VBG security/NN ,/, freedom/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

The/DT agenda/NN is/VBZ not/RB designed/VBN to/TO secure/VB justice/NN for/IN the/DT citizen/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ already/RB secured/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT various/JJ national/JJ legal/JJ systems/NNS ./.

The/DT agenda/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO transfer/VB vital/JJ parts/NNS of/IN society/NN '/POS s/JJ criminal/JJ law/NN ,/, policy/NN on/IN crime/NN and/CC administration/NN of/IN justice/NN to/TO the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ control/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN increased/VBN integration/NN which/WDT ,/, as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT duplicitous/JJ package/NN ,/, involves/VBZ increased/JJ repression/NN and/CC control/NN ./.

You/PRP just/RB have/VBP to/TO think/VB of/IN all/PDT the/DT resolutions/NNS concerning/VBG Fort/NNP Europa/NNP ,/, Schengen/NNP ,/, Eurodac/NNP etc./NNP ./.

Any/DT democrat/NN can/MD spot/VB two/CD key/JJ problems/NNS ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT initiatives/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN planned/VBN are/VBP completely/RB unrealistic/JJ ./.

How/WRB is/VBZ it/PRP envisaged/VBN that/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP already/RB stretched/VBN well/RB beyond/IN their/PRP$ capacity/NN ,/, can/MD bring/VB the/DT ambitious/JJ projects/NNS concerned/VBN to/TO fruition/NN ?/.

Think/VB of/IN last/JJ year/NN '/POS s/JJ deadly/JJ criticism/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ lack/NN of/IN propriety/NN ,/, ethics/NNS and/CC accountability/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, finds/VBZ indirect/JJ expression/NN in/IN the/DT question/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, secondly/RB ,/, the/DT projects/NNS will/MD put/VB a/DT strain/NN on/IN ,/, indeed/NNP will/MD be/VB injurious/JJ to/TO ,/, the/DT national/JJ democracies/NNS ./.

As/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT EU/NNP revolved/VBD around/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, only/RB the/DT body/NN was/VBD being/VBG attacked/VBN ./.

Now/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT soul/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, today/NN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP see/VBP a/DT strange/JJ irony/NN ./.

The/DT IRA/NNP terrorists/NNS have/VBP not/RB given/VBN up/RP any/DT of/IN their/PRP$ weapons/NNS ,/, nor/CC have/VBP the/DT loyalist/JJ terrorists/NNS ,/, yet/CC the/DT police/NN are/VBP being/VBG forced/VBN into/IN a/DT position/NN where/WRB they/PRP will/MD not/RB have/VB the/DT power/NN to/TO resist/VB the/DT terrorist/JJ community/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP just/RB look/VB at/IN the/DT figures/NNS from/IN the/DT day/NN that/IN the/DT agreement/NN was/VBD signed/VBN ./.

In/IN 1998/CD ,/, we/PRP had/VBD 55/CD murders/NNS ./.

In/IN 1999/CD ,/, we/PRP had/VBD 7/CD murders/NNS and/CC that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB include/VB the/DT Omagh/NNP bomb/NN where/WRB 29/CD were/VBD killed/VBN and/CC 300/CD injured/VBN ./.

Between/IN 1998/CD and/CC 1999/CD ,/, loyalists/NNS assaulted/VBD and/CC shot/VBD 123/CD people/NNS ,/, while/IN republicans/NNS assaulted/VBD and/CC shot/VBD 93/CD people/NNS ./.

Charges/NNS brought/VBD against/IN loyalists/NNS in/IN 1999/CD totalled/JJ 193/NNS ,/, while/IN those/DT against/IN republicans/NNS totalled/VBD 97/CD ./.

Since/IN January/NNP 2000/CD ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN six/CD shootings/NNS by/IN loyalists/NNS and/CC two/CD by/IN republicans/NNS ,/, loyalists/NNS have/VBP been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN six/CD serious/JJ assaults/NNS ,/, one/CD leading/VBG to/TO another/DT murder/NN ,/, while/IN republicans/NNS have/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN five/CD serious/JJ assaults/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, that/DT situation/NN can/MD not/RB continue/VB and/CC needs/VBZ remedying/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP has/VBZ set/VBN an/DT important/JJ objective/NN for/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT task/NN which/WDT all/DT MEPs/NNPS ,/, the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD take/VB on/RP during/IN this/DT legislature/NN :/: the/DT creation/NN ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN already/RB ,/, of/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

The/DT Tampere/NNP Council/NNP ,/, the/DT motor/NN and/CC architect/NN of/IN this/DT objective/NN ,/, has/VBZ proposed/VBN certain/JJ goals/NNS ,/, but/CC five/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT time/NN scale/NN laid/VBN down/RP for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN Chapter/NNP IV/NNP of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, is/VBZ too/RB long/JJ to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT urgent/JJ solution/NN which/WDT some/DT problems/NNS require/VBP ./.

My/PRP$ first/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN Parliament/NNP must/MD not/RB be/VB excluded/VBN from/IN the/DT important/JJ decisions/NNS to/TO be/VB taken/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN and/CC that/IN its/PRP$ participation/NN in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN must/MD be/VB guaranteed/VBN ,/, especially/RB with/IN regard/VB to/TO this/DT project/NN which/WDT affects/VBZ the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ explained/VBN very/RB well/RB ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD make/VB rapid/JJ progress/NN in/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN a/DT common/JJ asylum/NN system/NN ,/, adopting/VBG common/JJ procedural/JJ rules/NNS and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, putting/VBG an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT current/JJ confusion/NN between/IN migration/NN for/IN political/JJ reasons/NNS and/CC migration/VBN for/IN economic/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

The/DT recent/JJ laws/NNS on/IN aliens/NNS adopted/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN ,/, Spain/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, are/VBP a/DT reminder/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ an/DT urgent/JJ need/NN for/IN the/DT communitisation/NN of/IN immigration/NN policy/NN ./.

My/PRP$ third/JJ and/CC final/JJ point/NN relates/VBZ to/TO the/DT external/JJ activities/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN immigration/NN and/CC asylum/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB and/CC can/MD not/RB give/VB the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT Union/NNP exclusively/RB wishes/VBZ to/TO defend/VB itself/PRP from/IN an/DT avalanche/NN of/IN refugees/NNS and/CC economic/JJ migrants/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ,/, the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP need/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT vision/NN of/IN citizenship/NN ./.

The/DT Euro/NNP ,/, employment/NN ,/, even/RB security/NN ,/, are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ ./.

They/PRP need/VBP a/DT `/`` European/JJ soul/NN '/'' ,/, as/IN a/DT distinguished/VBN Spanish/JJ professor/NN once/RB said/VBD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, unlike/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT previous/JJ speakers/NNS ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RP to/TO the/DT words/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ Portuguese/JJ ministers/NNS and/CC Mr/NNP Vitorino/NNP ./.

This/DT trio/NN 's/POS words/NNS were/VBD like/IN music/NN to/TO our/PRP$ ears/NNS as/IN Mr/NNP Ceyhun/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN ./.

As/IN with/IN all/DT music/NN it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT fine/JJ tune/NN and/CC properly/RB orchestrated/VBD ./.

Many/JJ of/IN us/PRP of/IN here/RB are/VBP very/RB optimistic/JJ about/IN the/DT next/JJ six/CD months/NNS ./.

The/DT tune/NN that/WDT will/MD be/VB played/VBN will/MD be/VB one/CD that/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP will/MD be/VB listening/VBG to/TO and/CC they/PRP will/MD want/VB to/TO hear/VB the/DT right/JJ sort/NN of/IN tune/NN ./.

As/IN described/VBD this/DT afternoon/NN it/PRP will/MD go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN towards/IN drowning/VBG out/RP some/DT of/IN the/DT unpleasant/JJ tunes/NNS we/PRP heard/VBD during/IN the/DT European/JJ election/NN and/CC over/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ./.

The/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP and/CC the/DT Tampere/NNP Council/NNP built/VBD on/IN this/DT project/NN for/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

One/CD area/NN though/RB is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT House/NNP must/MD be/VB involved/VBN in/IN it/PRP :/: namely/RB scrutiny/NN ./.

And/CC we/PRP must/MD make/VB certain/JJ that/IN the/DT details/NNS are/VBP applicable/JJ ,/, appropriate/JJ and/CC relevant/JJ to/TO the/DT different/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB attention/NN to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT resolutions/NNS before/IN us/PRP this/DT afternoon/NN ,/, one/CD or/CC two/CD of/IN which/WDT were/VBD referred/VBN to/TO earlier/RBR on/IN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT movement/NN towards/IN the/DT recognition/NN of/IN judicial/JJ systems/NNS in/IN the/DT various/JJ countries/NNS and/CC the/DT cooperation/NN on/IN crime/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ an/DT area/NN that/IN European/JJ citizens/NNS will/MD respond/VB to/TO and/CC will/MD be/VB happy/JJ about/IN ./.

But/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Council/NNP must/MD know/VB that/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ people/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP who/WP have/VBP reservations/NNS about/IN the/DT Eurodac/JJ system/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

We/PRP accept/VBP the/DT predominant/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP in/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP reservations/NNS and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT Council/NNP will/MD listen/VB to/TO the/DT words/NNS coming/VBG from/IN the/DT elected/VBN parliamentarians/NNS here/RB when/WRB they/PRP go/VBP through/IN it/PRP in/IN more/JJR detail/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Schulz/NNP said/VBD earlier/RBR on/IN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD not/RB certain/JJ about/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN `/`` scoreboard/JJ '/'' ./.

Anyone/NN who/WP is/VBZ English/JJ or/CC British/JJ or/CC follows/VBZ cricket/NN knows/VBZ what/WP a/DT scoreboard/NN is/VBZ ./.

A/DT scoreboard/NN tells/VBZ people/NNS the/DT score/NN ;/: it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB up-to-date/JJ and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB clear/JJ and/CC visible/JJ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN Commissioner/NNP Vitorino/NNP will/MD make/VB certain/JJ that/WDT is/VBZ so/RB ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN six/CD months/NNS I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT music/NN is/VBZ still/RB playing/VBG and/CC that/IN the/DT European/JJ people/NNS are/VBP still/RB listening/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB the/DT President-in-Office/NN and/CC his/PRP$ colleague/NN from/IN the/DT Justice/NNP Ministry/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Costa/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO thank/VB them/PRP for/IN the/DT welcome/JJ they/PRP gave/VBD my/PRP$ committee/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP last/JJ week/NN and/CC the/DT constructive/JJ meetings/NNS we/PRP enjoyed/VBD ./.

Amsterdam/NNP and/CC Tampere/NNP have/VBP given/VBN us/PRP much/JJ work/NN to/TO do/VB together/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT excellent/JJ draft/NN resolution/NN by/IN Mrs/NNP Terr脙/NNP 鲁/NNP n/NN today/NN shows/VBZ ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB three/CD brief/JJ points/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT mature/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ barely/RB six/CD months/NNS since/IN Amsterdam/NNP imposed/VBD a/DT duty/NN on/IN our/PRP$ two/CD organisations/NNS to/TO work/VB together/RB ;/: we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN sizing/VBG each/DT other/JJ up/RP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT few/JJ minor/JJ spats/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO work/VB effectively/RB together/RB ./.

Let/VB us/PRP stop/VB the/DT shadow-boxing/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP drop/VB the/DT elaborate/JJ charades/NNS and/CC let/VB us/PRP respect/VB the/DT duties/NNS that/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS impose/VB on/IN us/PRP and/CC the/DT timescales/NNS allowed/VBN for/IN full/JJ democratic/JJ debate/NN ./.

Involve/RB us/PRP please/VBP in/IN your/PRP$ discussions/NNS on/IN both/DT policy/NN and/CC process/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB pretend/VB that/IN national/JJ parliaments/NNS are/VBP able/JJ to/TO exercise/VB effective/JJ democratic/JJ control/NN of/IN government/NN activities/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT properly/RB resourced/JJ Commission/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP established/VBN a/DT new/JJ Directorate-General/NN ,/, yet/CC it/PRP has/VBZ only/RB 70/CD people/NNS all/RB told/VBN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ an/DT agreement/NN to/TO double/VB this/DT number/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN ,/, so/RB far/RB ,/, not/RB a/DT single/JJ new/JJ person/NN has/VBZ arrived/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP setting/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT massive/JJ task/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS in/IN the/DT drawing/VBG up/RP of/IN the/DT scoreboard/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP must/MD work/VB together/RP to/TO provide/VB the/DT resources/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP needs/VBZ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT content/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT presidency/NN has/VBZ put/VBN the/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN its/PRP$ agenda/NN ./.

All/DT good/JJ things/NNS come/VBD in/IN threes/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN our/PRP$ policy/NN area/NN ./.

Two/CD hundred/CD years/NNS ago/RB it/PRP was/VBD liberty/NN ,/, equality/NN and/CC fraternity/NN ,/, and/CC things/NNS went/VBD along/RP very/RB well/RB until/IN the/DT governments/NNS of/IN the/DT left/NN raised/VBD equality/NN above/IN the/DT others/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN forming/VBG governments/NNS in/IN German/JJ federal/JJ states/NNS ./.

I/PRP fully/RB support/VBP the/DT statements/NNS made/VBD by/IN Commissioner/NNP Prodi/NNP in/IN today/NN 's/POS session/NN ./.

He/PRP spoke/VBD of/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN not/RB isolating/VBG Member/NNP States/NNPS but/CC of/IN doing/VBG everything/NN to/TO unite/VB them/PRP in/IN common/JJ European/JJ values/NNS ./.

-/: -LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- I/PRP voted/VBD against/IN the/DT joint/JJ resolution/NN on/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

Austria/NNP is/VBZ a/DT free/JJ ,/, independent/JJ and/CC sovereign/JJ country/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, neither/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP nor/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ the/DT right/NN to/TO interfere/VB in/IN the/DT internal/JJ administration/NN of/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

The/DT Austrian/JJ elections/NNS were/VBD held/VBN in/IN a/DT free/JJ ,/, proper/JJ and/CC democratic/JJ manner/NN ./.

Any/DT interference/NN by/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS in/IN this/DT country/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB unacceptable/JJ ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN violation/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Treaty/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- Article/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, these/DT same/JJ institutions/NNS showed/VBD no/DT reluctance/NN to/TO accept/VB Turkey/NNP as/IN a/DT candidate/NN for/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, despite/IN its/PRP$ well-known/JJ human/NN rights/NNS violations/NNS ./.

Nothing/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN has/VBZ yet/RB occurred/VBN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

This/DT precedent/NN ,/, created/VBN on/IN the/DT initiative/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT worrying/JJ one/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

In/IN such/JJ circumstances/NNS will/NN it/PRP even/RB be/VB worth/JJ having/VBG elections/NNS ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT way/NN to/TO create/VB the/DT conditions/NNS for/IN the/DT nations/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP to/TO live/VB together/RB in/IN harmony/NN and/CC to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO cooperate/VB to/TO achieve/VB a/DT shared/VBN future/NN ./.

-/: -LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- The/DT vote/NN which/WDT has/VBZ just/RB taken/VBN place/NN in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP is/VBZ a/DT historic/JJ one/NN for/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN we/PRP have/VBP ever/RB debated/VBN the/DT internal/JJ political/JJ situation/NN of/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ Member/JJ States/NNPS with/IN such/JJ anxiety/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP there/EX are/VBP circumstances/NNS when/WRB the/DT question/NN of/IN principles/NNS and/CC institutional/JJ regulations/NNS is/VBZ obliterated/VBN ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP Presidency/NNP to/TO continue/VB to/TO protect/VB the/DT fundamental/JJ values/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB less/RBR cautious/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT resolution/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP is/VBZ assuming/VBG its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/IN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT resolution/NN adopted/VBN today/NN is/VBZ the/DT absolute/JJ minimum/NN ,/, the/DT very/RB least/JJS we/PRP could/MD do/VB ./.

Personally/RB I/PRP argued/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT rather/RB harder/JJR line/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP supported/VBD Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 1/CD ,/, 4/CD ,/, 6/CD ,/, 7/CD and/CC 8/CD ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT oral/JJ amendment/NN tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP ./.

In/IN fact/NN I/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP essential/JJ for/IN the/DT Council/NNP to/TO accept/VB only/RB purely/RB technical/JJ relations/NNS with/IN the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN an/DT Austrian/JJ Government/NN which/WDT includes/VBZ members/NNS of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Freedom/NNP Party/NNP ./.

Including/VBG J脙/NNP 露/NNP rg/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ party/NN in/IN a/DT coalition/NN government/NN makes/VBZ the/DT presence/NN of/IN the/DT extreme/JJ right/NN an/DT everyday/JJ fact/NN of/IN life/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC sets/NNS an/DT extremely/RB dangerous/JJ precedent/NN which/WDT may/MD generate/VB a/DT serious/JJ aftermath/NN in/IN other/JJ Union/NNP Member/NNP States/NNP or/CC in/IN candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Austrian/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP must/MD accept/VB some/DT historical/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN this/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ fundamental/JJ values/NNS which/WDT are/VBP at/IN stake/NN here/RB ./.

As/IN the/DT democratically/RB elected/VBN representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ people/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP no/DT choice/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD reject/VB what/WP is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ constituents/NNS demand/VBP ./.

Because/IN ,/, when/WRB the/DT spectre/NN of/IN barbarism/NN resurfaces/VBZ ,/, failure/NN to/TO oppose/VB is/VBZ tantamount/JJ to/TO capitulation/VB ./.

I/PRP abstained/VBD in/IN the/DT vote/NN on/IN adopting/VBG the/DT resolution/NN ./.

I/PRP condemn/VB J脙/NNP 露/NNP rg/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/NN racist/JJ and/CC xenophobic/JJ policy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB that/IN an/DT EU/NNP body/NN should/MD intervene/VB politically/RB in/IN the/DT internal/JJ policy/NN of/IN one/NN Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB therefore/RB accept/VB paragraph/NN 4/CD in/IN the/DT joint/JJ resolution/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP can/MD not/RB vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT resolution/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT vote/NN against/IN the/DT extreme/JJ right/NN ./.

-/VBG -LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Obviously/RB ,/, the/DT political/JJ leaders/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP have/VBP a/DT right/NN and/CC a/DT duty/NN to/TO react/VB against/IN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ party/NN ./.

The/DT political/JJ leaders/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP entitled/VBN to/TO express/VB their/PRP$ view/NN of/IN political/JJ developments/NNS in/IN another/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, just/RB as/IN a/DT prime/JJ minister/NN can/MD express/VB his/PRP$ opinion/NN about/IN racist/JJ politicians/NNS in/IN a/DT local/JJ authority/NN ./.

Finland/NNP '/POS s/JJ experience/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN integration/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN isolation/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT better/JJR way/NN of/IN combating/VBG antidemocratic/JJ forces/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB voted/VBD against/IN paragraph/NN 2/CD of/IN the/DT resolution/NN ,/, which/WDT presupposes/VBZ that/IN all/DT parties/NNS have/VBP respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

The/DT EU/NNP Presidency/NNP '/POS s/JJ ``/`` common/JJ reaction/NN ''/'' against/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN in/IN Austria/NNP is/VBZ legally/RB unjustified/JJ ./.

The/DT treaties/NNS do/VBP not/RB authorise/VB this/DT reaction/NN by/IN the/DT 14/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Nor/CC should/MD we/PRP isolate/VB the/DT forces/NNS in/IN Austria/NNP which/WDT wish/VBP to/TO work/VB for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

That/DT concludes/VBZ the/DT vote/NN ./.

Adjournment/NN of/IN the/DT session/NN ./.

I/PRP declare/VBP the/DT session/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP adjourned/NNP ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT sitting/NN was/VBD closed/VBN at/IN 12.25/CD p.m./RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

I/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN your/PRP$ reaction/NN that/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP have/VBP not/RB received/VBN the/DT Minutes/NNPS and/CC clearly/RB you/PRP can/MD not/RB approve/VB Minutes/NNPS which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP not/RB seen/VBN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ remarkable/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB adopted/VBN a/DT position/NN on/IN the/DT possible/JJ release/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Pinochet/NNP ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN international/JJ arrest/NN warrants/NNS have/VBP already/RB been/VBN issued/VBN ./.

Since/IN the/DT Belgian/JJ Government/NN '/POS s/JJ appeal/NN to/TO a/DT higher/JJR court/NN was/VBD declared/VBN admissible/JJ last/JJ week/NN and/CC since/IN the/DT decision/NN has/VBZ essentially/RB not/RB yet/RB been/VBN taken/VBN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO at/IN last/RB give/VB out/RP a/DT strong/JJ message/NN ,/, a/DT message/NN which/WDT should/MD signify/VB that/DT nobody/NN can/MD escape/VB a/DT just/JJ trial/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ inconceivable/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT quite/RB rightly/RB pays/VBZ so/RB much/JJ attention/NN to/TO respecting/VB human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, should/MD fail/VB to/TO adopt/VB a/DT clear/JJ stance/NN on/IN this/DT ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT matter/NN is/VBZ far/RB too/RB serious/JJ to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN by/IN means/NNS of/IN an/DT urgent/JJ procedure/NN at/IN this/DT time/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ already/RB expressed/VBN its/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN General/NNP Pinochet/NNP ,/, but/CC ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP certain/JJ questions/NNS to/TO be/VB borne/VBN in/IN mind/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN this/DT matter/NN is/VBZ sub/NN judice/NN in/IN several/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB Members/NNS that/IN there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT European/JJ judicial/JJ area/NN nor/CC a/DT European/JJ legal/JJ system/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT International/NNP Criminal/NNP Court/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB yet/RB exist/VB ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT serious/JJ issue/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP obliged/JJ to/TO follow/VB up/RP ,/, but/CC it/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN by/IN means/NNS of/IN urgent/JJ procedure/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN justice/NN should/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT most/RBS appropriate/JJ procedure/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Parliament/NNP rejected/VBD the/DT proposal/NN -RRB-/-RRB- President/NN ./.

We/PRP now/RB come/VBP to/TO the/DT third/JJ proposal/NN which/WDT is/VBZ for/IN `/`` Environmental/JJ disasters/NNS in/IN the/DT waters/NNS of/IN the/DT Danube/NNP '/'' ,/, a/DT proposal/NN tabled/VBD by/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/European/NNP Free/NNP Alliance/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, what/WP has/VBZ occurred/VBN in/IN a/DT tributary/NN of/IN the/DT Danube/NNP is/VBZ considered/VBN by/IN many/JJ experts/NNS to/TO be/VB an/DT accident/NN on/IN an/DT environmental/JJ scale/NN as/RB serious/JJ as/IN the/DT scale/NN of/IN the/DT Chernobyl/NNP disaster/NN ./.

It/PRP affects/VBZ not/RB only/RB Romania/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB Yugoslavia/NNP and/CC ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT entire/JJ Danube/NNP basin/NN ./.

We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT matter/NN to/TO be/VB important/JJ enough/RB for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO react/VB swiftly/RB to/TO this/DT situation/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP must/MD make/VB its/PRP$ position/NN clear/JJ and/CC vote/VB on/IN a/DT resolution/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Parliament/NNP gave/VBD its/PRP$ assent/NN -RRB-/-RRB- President/NN ./.

Still/RB relating/VBG to/TO Thursday/NNP '/POS s/VBZ sitting/VBG ,/, the/DT PPE/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ requested/VBN that/IN Mrs/NNP Cederschi脙/NNP 露/NNP ld/NN '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN increasing/VBG protection/NN by/IN penal/JJ sanctions/NNS against/IN counterfeiting/VBG in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN should/MD be/VB brought/VBN forward/RP to/TO Wednesday/NNP as/IN the/DT last/JJ item/NN on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT agenda/NN has/VBZ been/VBN rearranged/VBN so/RB many/JJ times/NNS that/IN I/PRP would/MD simply/RB ask/VB the/DT Chamber/NNP to/TO support/VB the/DT present/JJ proposal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT very/RB time-consuming/JJ matter/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ that/IN it/PRP should/MD get/VB through/IN Parliament/NNP now/RB and/CC that/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT delays/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN about/IN protecting/VBG the/DT euro/NN against/IN counterfeiting/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB urgent/JJ matter/NN ./.

Relating/NN to/TO Friday/NNP :/: President/NNP ./.

Is/VBZ there/EX a/DT Member/NNP who/WP wishes/VBZ to/TO speak/VB on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT PSE/NNP Group/NNP in/IN favour/NN of/IN this/DT proposal/NN ?/.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, with/IN apologies/NNS to/TO my/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, Enrique/NNP Bar脙/NNP 鲁/NNP n/NNP Crespo/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO speak/VB against/IN this/DT proposal/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP surprised/VBN it/PRP has/VBZ even/RB been/VBN made/VBN ,/, because/IN we/PRP came/VBD to/TO an/DT agreement/NN following/VBG an/DT exchange/NN in/IN the/DT Conference/NN of/IN Presidents/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN your/PRP$ proposal/NN ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO keep/VB the/DT debate/NN and/CC the/DT vote/NN separate/JJ ,/, with/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN Friday/NNP and/CC the/DT vote/NN at/IN a/DT later/JJ date/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ one/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN is/VBZ as/IN follows/VBZ :/: this/DT issue/NN concerns/VBZ no/DT less/JJR than/IN 1/CD 800/CD 000/CD employees/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP already/RB have/VBP a/DT directive/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, everyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ travelled/VBN here/RB by/IN car/NN ,/, train/NN or/CC aeroplane/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN able/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT extent/NN of/IN the/DT damage/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN France/NNP ,/, caused/VBN by/IN hurricanes/NNS of/IN a/DT completely/RB unprecedented/JJ violence/NN which/WDT struck/VBD Europe/NNP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ month/NN ./.

What/WP can/MD the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP do/VB when/WRB faced/VBN with/IN such/PDT a/DT widespread/JJ disaster/NN ?/.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO pay/VB tribute/NN to/TO the/DT mayors/NNS and/CC local/JJ representatives/NNS who/WP ,/, on/IN a/DT daily/JJ basis/NN ,/, have/VBP had/VBN to/TO reassure/VB their/PRP$ constituents/NNS ,/, organise/VB volunteers/NNS and/CC cooperate/VB with/IN the/DT public/JJ services/NNS ./.

They/PRP have/VBP earned/VBN the/DT confidence/NN of/IN their/PRP$ fellow-citizens/NNS ./.

Next/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT emergency/NN services/NNS and/CC the/DT armed/JJ forces/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS who/WP ,/, in/IN a/DT fine/JJ example/NN of/IN intergovernmental/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, came/VBD to/TO support/VB the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ French/JJ colleagues/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO consider/VB the/DT paradoxical/JJ situation/NN we/PRP have/VBP with/IN regard/NN to/TO emergency/NN aid/NN ./.

If/IN this/DT disaster/NN had/VBD taken/VBN place/NN in/IN Guatemala/NNP or/CC Turkey/NNP ,/, we/PRP could/MD have/VB immediately/RB used/VBN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN to/TO help/VB the/DT victims/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ countries/NNS nothing/NN of/IN the/DT kind/NN is/VBZ possible/JJ because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT suitable/JJ budget/NN line/NN with/IN which/WDT to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP not/RB to/TO prevent/VB local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC individual/JJ States/NNPS from/IN coming/VBG to/TO the/DT assistance/NN of/IN businesses/NNS affected/VBN by/IN the/DT disaster/NN by/IN applying/VBG Community/NNP competition/NN rules/NNS too/RB strictly/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG in/IN particular/JJ here/RB of/IN fish/NN and/CC shellfish/NN companies/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN particularly/RB badly/RB hit/VBN ./.

As/IN you/PRP said/VBD ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ compensation/NN for/IN the/DT forced/VBN cessation/NN in/IN activity/NN and/CC that/IN appeals/NNS can/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO FIFG/NNP for/IN investments/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN totally/RB wiped/VBN out/RP ./.

Beyond/IN this/DT ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN implementing/NNP MAGPs/NNP in/IN a/DT mechanical/JJ way/NN will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB appropriate/JJ in/IN the/DT coastal/JJ regions/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN affected/VBN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB ask/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO stop/VB doing/VBG so/RB and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, to/TO help/VB those/DT who/WP make/VBP their/PRP$ living/NN from/IN the/DT sea/NN to/TO proceed/VB to/TO new/JJ investments/NNS ,/, which/WDT they/PRP urgently/RB need/VBP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT storms/NNS which/WDT devastated/VBD France/NNP during/IN the/DT night/NN between/IN 26/CD and/CC 27/CD December/NNP have/VBP caused/VBN ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN ,/, 90/CD deaths/NNS and/CC damage/NN to/TO a/DT value/NN of/IN FF/NNP 75/CD billion/CD ,/, i.e./VBD EUR/$ 11/CD billion/CD ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ quite/RB natural/JJ that/IN given/VBN such/PDT a/DT disaster/NN ,/, national/JJ and/CC European/JJ solidarity/NNS should/MD go/VB to/TO the/DT help/NN of/IN the/DT devastated/JJ regions/NNS and/CC those/DT people/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN worst/JJS affected/VBN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP full/JJ well/RB that/IN what/WP you/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ ,/, limiting/VBG yourself/PRP to/TO giving/VBG us/PRP the/DT hypothetical/JJ and/CC remote/JJ possibility/NN of/IN benefiting/VBG from/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ Objective/NNP 2/CD or/CC from/IN the/DT provisional/JJ Objectives/NNS 2/CD or/CC 5b/CD ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT written/VBN answer/NN you/PRP gave/VBD Mr/NNP Martinez/NNP on/IN 11/CD January/NNP 2000/CD ./.

I/PRP can/MD show/VB you/PRP a/DT copy/NN if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP ./.

We/PRP would/MD understand/VB completely/RB if/IN you/PRP were/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO say/VB anything/NN else/RB given/VBN the/DT irresponsible/JJ attitude/NN not/RB only/JJ of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, and/CC if/IN you/PRP can/MD not/RB do/VB anything/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT legal/JJ or/CC financial/JJ framework/NN for/IN doing/VBG so/RB ./.

But/CC for/IN pity/NNP '/POS s/VBZ sake/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB saying/VBG this/DT to/TO you/PRP in/IN an/DT aggressive/JJ way/NN ,/, please/NNP do/VBP not/RB present/VB appropriations/NNS which/WDT have/VBP previously/RB been/VBN earmarked/VBN under/IN an/DT unrelated/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN as/IN aid/NN for/IN victims/NNS of/IN the/DT storms/NNS ./.

As/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD restore/VB ,/, within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN a/DT supplementary/JJ budget/NN ,/, the/DT budget/NN line/NN which/WDT was/VBD allocated/VBN to/TO us/PRP for/IN natural/JJ disasters/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD use/VB the/DT Berlin/NNP Summit/NNP aid/NN appropriations/NNS and/CC we/PRP must/MD change/VB the/DT forestry/NN policy/NN implemented/VBN in/IN most/JJS countries/NNS in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

That/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ another/DT problem/NN altogether/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Europe/NNP has/VBZ undergone/VBN a/DT tough/JJ ordeal/NN at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN this/DT millennium/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD first/RB like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ heartfelt/JJ condolences/NNS to/TO the/DT families/NNS in/IN mourning/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT appalling/JJ weather/NN conditions/NNS that/WDT devastated/VBD Europe/NNP in/IN December/NNP ./.

These/DT storms/NNS were/VBD an/DT unprecedented/JJ ecological/JJ disaster/NN for/IN our/PRP$ forests/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP you/PRP do/VBP not/RB mind/VB if/IN I/PRP make/VBP particular/JJ mention/NN of/IN the/DT forests/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ region/NN ,/, Lorraine/NNP ,/, which/WDT have/VBP suffered/VBN enormous/JJ destruction/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT regional/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, the/DT volunteers/NNS and/CC the/DT public/JJ services/NNS on/IN the/DT fantastic/JJ way/NN in/IN which/WDT they/PRP rallied/VBD round/RB but/RB ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, their/PRP$ troubles/NNS are/VBP not/RB yet/RB over/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ Europe/NNP 's/POS duty/NN to/TO support/VB them/PRP and/CC thereby/RB complement/VB the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN the/DT governments/NNS of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS affected/VBN by/IN the/DT disaster/NN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP '/POS s/JJ statement/NN and/CC I/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP the/DT measures/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ announced/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP certainly/RB not/RB forgetting/VBG the/DT economic/JJ dimension/NN of/IN this/DT matter/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT timber/NN industry/NN has/VBZ been/VBN devastated/VBN and/CC a/DT whole/JJ population/NN is/VBZ suffering/VBG the/DT tragic/JJ effects/NNS of/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT Community/NNP action/NN programme/NN for/IN civil/JJ protection/NN ,/, established/VBN by/IN a/DT Council/NNP decision/NN on/IN 9/CD December/NNP ,/, was/VBD launched/VBN on/IN 1/CD January/NNP 2000/CD ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO grasp/VB this/DT opportunity/NN ./.

This/DT programme/NN must/MD work/VB at/IN full/JJ capacity/NN ./.

Although/IN it/PRP may/MD have/VB been/VBN effective/JJ in/IN certain/JJ areas/NNS -/: and/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB doubt/VB the/DT sincerity/NN of/IN Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP '/POS s/JJ words/NNS -/: unfortunately/RB it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB in/IN its/PRP$ infancy/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO forestry/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ priority/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP wait/VBP for/IN Community-level/JJ funds/NNS to/TO be/VB freed/VBN up/RP ,/, is/VBZ for/IN material/NN aid/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN partnership/NN exchanges/NNS between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN to/TO improve/VB forest/NN roads/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO repair/VB them/PRP as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Lending/VBG forestry/NN equipment/NN and/CC making/VBG personnel/NNS qualified/VBN in/IN forestry/NN management/NN available/JJ are/VBP also/RB covered/VBN by/IN this/DT measure/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ next/JJ challenge/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO prevent/VB the/DT occurrence/NN of/IN phytosanitary/JJ problems/NNS which/WDT could/MD result/VB from/IN having/VBG to/TO abandon/VB large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN wood/NN in/IN the/DT forest/NN ,/, and/CC from/IN the/DT pollution/NN of/IN ground/NN water/NN through/IN having/VBG to/TO store/VB such/JJ large/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN wood/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN we/PRP slow/VB down/RP the/DT logging/VBG of/IN standing/NN wood/NN ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB priority/NN to/TO the/DT purchase/NN of/IN windfalls/NNS ./.

These/DT timber/NN sales/NNS should/MD be/VB supported/VBN by/IN strong/JJ media/NNS coverage/NN in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT aid/NN for/IN gathering/NN timber/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, only/RB the/DT first/JJ stage/NN of/IN an/DT aid/NN package/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD take/VB the/DT form/NN of/IN aid/NN for/IN reforestation/NN and/CC aid/NN for/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO incorporate/VB this/DT into/IN a/DT study/NN of/IN how/WRB the/DT situation/NN should/MD be/VB managed/VBN now/RB that/IN the/DT emergency/NN is/VBZ over/RP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB sad/JJ opportunity/NN for/IN Europe/NNP to/TO renew/VB its/PRP$ forestry/NN heritage/NN in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT role/NN that/IN this/DT plays/VBZ in/IN wildlife/NN and/CC nature/NN conservation/NN and/CC in/IN our/PRP$ economies/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB a/DT time/NN for/IN solidarity/NN and/CC cooperation/NN between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN an/DT ecological/JJ and/CC economic/JJ calamity/NN ./.

If/IN this/DT solidarity/NN is/VBZ to/TO have/VB been/VBN worthwhile/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ up/RB to/TO Europe/NNP to/TO propose/VB priority/NN actions/NNS for/IN safeguarding/VBG the/DT timber/NN industry/NN ./.

Current/JJ programmes/NNS must/MD be/VB accelerated/VBN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP stand/VBP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ programmes/NNS will/MD preclude/VB us/PRP from/IN meeting/VBG our/PRP$ obligations/NNS under/IN Kyoto/NNP ./.

The/DT trade/NN in/IN emissions/NNS rights/NNS is/VBZ immoral/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC rather/RB than/IN solving/VBG the/DT problem/NN ,/, it/PRP shelves/VBZ it/PRP ./.

We/PRP must/MD work/VB more/RBR rapidly/RB towards/IN achieving/VBG the/DT targets/NNS stipulated/VBD in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP for/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS ,/, as/IN this/DT would/MD bring/VB about/IN a/DT massive/JJ reduction/NN in/IN greenhouse/NN gases/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ not/RB put/VBN forward/RB nearly/RB enough/RB on/IN this/DT subject/NN ,/, and/CC what/WP it/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RB is/VBZ woefully/NN inadequate/JJ !/. ./.

We/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN that/IN in/IN a/DT short/JJ space/NN of/IN time/NN the/DT storm/NN left/VBD us/PRP with/IN approximately/RB 120/CD million/CD cubic/JJ metres/NNS of/IN solid/JJ timber/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ only/RB an/DT estimate/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP listened/VBD to/TO you/PRP very/RB attentively/RB Commissioner/JJ ,/, and/CC welcome/JJ with/IN open/JJ arms/NNS the/DT fact/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP intending/VBG to/TO go/VB and/CC see/VB for/IN yourself/PRP the/DT effects/NNS the/DT catastrophe/NN has/VBZ had/VBN in/IN France/NNP and/CC in/IN Germany/NNP ./.

If/IN Mrs/NNP Schreyer/NNP is/VBZ to/TO visit/VB the/DT Black/NNP Forest/NNP sometime/RB in/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ days/NNS ,/, then/RB any/DT one/CD farmer/NN might/MD ask/VB her/PRP how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Europe/NNP would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO help/VB him/PRP as/IN an/DT individual/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN 1999/CD ,/, NATO/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT participation/NN of/IN most/RBS Member/JJ States/NNPS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, flattened/VBD Kosovo/NNP with/IN bombs/NNS in/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN freedom/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB endeavouring/VBG ,/, at/IN huge/JJ cost/NN ,/, to/TO get/VB the/DT country/NN back/RB on/IN its/PRP$ feet/NNS again/RB and/CC help/VB its/PRP$ people/NNS ,/, and/CC rightly/RB so/RB ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 1999/CD unbelievable/JJ storms/NNS raged/VBD bringing/VBG death/NN and/CC destruction/NN to/TO vast/JJ tracts/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP in/IN Brussels/NNP responded/VBD to/TO the/DT victims/NNS '/POS cries/NN for/IN help/NN with/IN a/DT shrugging/NN of/IN shoulders/NNS ./.

``/`` We/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB the/DT wherewithal/NN for/IN that/DT ,/, ''/'' they/PRP said/VBD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ wrong/JJ !/. ./.

And/CC no/DT one/NN can/MD comprehend/VB this/DT attitude/NN ./.

Certainly/RB those/DT who/WP fear/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ livelihood/NN are/VBP at/IN a/DT complete/JJ loss/NN ./.

The/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP expect/VBP solidarity/NN ,/, also/RB from/IN within/IN this/DT Community/NNP ./.

I/PRP say/VBP they/PRP have/VBP a/DT right/NN to/TO solidarity/NN ./.

Indeed/RB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP must/MD make/VB it/PRP its/PRP$ business/NN to/TO uphold/VB this/DT right/NN in/IN hours/NNS of/IN need/NN ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP not/RB to/TO keep/VB having/VBG to/TO be/VB asked/VBN and/CC to/TO provide/VB assistance/NN for/IN the/DT victims/NNS of/IN the/DT storms/NNS ./.

It/PRP knows/VBZ the/DT ins/NN and/CC outs/NNS of/IN aid/NN provision/NN better/RBR than/IN any/DT local/JJ organisation/NN or/CC authority/NN ./.

I/PRP call/VBP upon/IN you/PRP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, to/TO support/VB me/PRP in/IN bringing/VBG home/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP the/DT fact/NN that/IN what/WP most/JJS Brussels/NNP offices/NNS are/VBP lacking/VBG is/VBZ not/RB so/RB much/RB the/DT wherewithal/NN for/IN providing/VBG aid/NN as/IN the/DT good/JJ will/NN ./.

Permit/VB me/PRP one/CD further/JJ comment/NN ./.

Although/IN it/PRP was/VBD less/RBR evident/JJ in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT storm/NN ,/, the/DT tanker/NN disaster/NN off/IN the/DT French/JJ coast/NN has/VBZ made/VBN it/PRP very/RB clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO give/VB the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT helping/VBG hand/NN on/IN another/DT matter/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP needs/VBZ rules/NNS governing/VBG environmental/JJ liability/NN as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD no/RB longer/RB tolerate/VB a/DT situation/NN where/WRB the/DT general/JJ public/NN has/VBZ to/TO foot/VB the/DT bill/NN for/IN damage/NN that/WDT has/VBZ often/RB been/VBN caused/VBN by/IN individuals/NNS involved/VBN in/IN criminal/JJ machinations/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD make/VB the/DT perpetrators/NNS liable/JJ for/IN all/DT manner/NN of/IN damage/NN done/VBN to/TO our/PRP$ environment/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, people/NNS will/MD think/VB twice/RB before/IN transporting/VBG oil/NN in/IN a/DT tanker/NN that/WDT is/VBZ about/IN to/TO fall/VB apart/RB ./.

When/WRB ,/, in/IN 1994/CD ,/, over/IN five/CD years/NNS ago/RB that/DT is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP joined/VBD the/DT Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS Committee/NNP in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP became/VBD rapporteur/NN for/IN the/DT environmental/JJ liability/NN dossier/NN ./.

To/TO this/DT day/NN I/PRP am/VBP still/RB awaiting/VBG an/DT initiative/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD actually/RB enable/VB me/PRP to/TO start/VB work/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT scandalous/JJ state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS that/WDT must/MD be/VB ended/VBN with/IN all/DT haste/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN February/NNP does/VBZ not/RB see/VB this/DT dossier/NN being/VBG postponed/VBN yet/RB again/RB !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT storms/NNS that/WDT took/VBD place/NN at/IN the/DT turn/NN of/IN the/DT millennium/NNP should/MD galvanise/VB us/PRP into/IN thinking/VBG about/IN certain/JJ problems/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN clear/JJ that/IN mankind/NN continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB unable/JJ to/TO avoid/VB natural/JJ disasters/NNS ./.

There/EX have/VBP always/RB been/VBN natural/JJ disasters/NNS and/CC there/EX always/RB will/MD be/VB ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN solidarity/NN here/RB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ certainly/RB a/DT need/NN for/IN European/JJ civil/JJ protection/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT EU/NNP budget/NN must/MD also/RB provide/VB for/IN a/DT budget/NN line/NN covering/VBG natural/JJ disasters/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, most/RBS importantly/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB ever/RB man/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT mistakes/NNS as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT nature-mankind/JJ relationship/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ -/: despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT same/JJ mistakes/NNS have/VBP often/RB been/VBN made/VBN down/RP through/IN the/DT centuries/NNS -/: and/CC never/RB nature/NN ,/, for/IN nature/NN can/MD not/RB make/VB mistakes/NNS ./.

The/DT extent/NN of/IN the/DT damage/NN caused/VBN on/IN this/DT occasion/NN was/VBD determined/VBN by/IN the/DT population/NN density/NN ,/, the/DT type/NN of/IN infrastructure/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT many/JJ monocultures/NNS ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG forests/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN providing/VBG assistance/NN where/WRB we/PRP can/MD ./.

But/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO aid/VB ,/, we/PRP ought/MD to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN perhaps/RB in/IN future/NN ,/, more/JJR emphasis/NN should/MD be/VB placed/VBN on/IN laying/VBG electricity/NN and/CC telephone/NN cabling/VBG underground/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD take/VB account/NN of/IN smaller/JJR cycles/NNS and/CC plant/NN stable/JJ mixed/JJ woodland/VBN when/WRB undertaking/VBG reforestation/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN monocultures/NNS ./.

The/DT most/RBS important/JJ subject/NN for/IN discussion/NN in/IN this/DT context/NN is/VBZ the/DT climate/NN ./.

To/TO this/DT day/NN ,/, we/PRP in/IN Europe/NNP remain/VBP in/IN the/DT privileged/JJ position/NN of/IN having/VBG the/DT Gulf/NNP Stream/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Gulf/NNP Stream/NNP still/RB does/VBZ its/PRP$ stuff/NN ./.

America/NNP and/CC south-east/JJ Asia/NNP are/VBP having/VBG a/DT much/RB worse/JJR time/NN of/IN it/PRP as/RB far/RB as/IN climate/NN and/CC storms/NNS go/VBP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP fortunate/JJ in/IN having/VBG the/DT Gulf/NNP Stream/NNP ./.

But/CC in/IN common/JJ with/IN others/NNS ,/, we/PRP too/RB are/VBP having/VBG to/TO endure/VB the/DT greenhouse/NN effect/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ partly/RB the/DT work/NN of/IN human/JJ hand/NN ,/, as/RB difficult/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO demonstrate/VB climate/NN change/NN using/VBG calculations/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD take/VB more/JJR account/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS produced/VBN at/IN the/DT Kyoto/NNP environmental/JJ conference/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD reduce/VB CO2/CD emissions/NNS ,/, employ/VB renewable/JJ energies/NNS ,/, and/CC generally/RB make/VB enquiries/NNS ,/, in/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, as/RB to/TO how/WRB the/DT forests/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP faring/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP should/MD firstly/RB express/VB our/PRP$ sorrow/NN for/IN the/DT victims/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT irreparable/JJ loss/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT solidarity/NN between/IN the/DT French/JJ departments/NNS and/CC citizens/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT solidarity/NN of/IN other/JJ countries/NNS with/IN France/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT country/NN worst/JJS affected/VBN ./.

As/IN I/PRP have/VBP little/JJ time/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO touch/VB upon/IN two/CD elements/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ resolution/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT first/JJ one/NN was/VBD implicitly/RB recognised/VBN by/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP in/IN his/PRP$ speech/NN when/WRB he/PRP wondered/VBD whether/IN these/DT catastrophes/NNS are/VBP natural/JJ or/CC not/RB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB that/IN experts/NNS are/VBP ever/RB more/RBR convinced/JJ that/IN climate/NN change/NN and/CC human/JJ activities/NNS ,/, in/IN general/JJ terms/NNS ,/, are/VBP linked/VBN to/TO the/DT increase/NN seen/VBN in/IN natural/JJ disasters/NNS in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, over/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN ,/, the/DT temperature/NN has/VBZ risen/VBN more/RBR than/IN in/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT century/NN ./.

Therefore/RB Europe/NNP must/MD be/VB clearly/RB committed/VBN to/TO the/DT Kyoto/NNP Protocol/NNP and/CC make/VB specific/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD rapporteur/NN for/IN civil/JJ protection/NN in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC I/PRP completely/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT European/JJ civil/JJ protection/NN body/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD utilise/VB an/DT extraordinary/JJ budget/NN line/NN ,/, since/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT extraordinarily/RB catastrophic/JJ situation/NN ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB sympathy/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT families/NNS and/CC communities/NNS that/WDT lost/VBD members/NNS in/IN this/DT terrible/JJ tragedy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB the/DT loss/NN of/IN life/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ this/DT particular/JJ disaster/NN an/DT extraordinary/JJ one/NN by/IN European/JJ standards/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ regrettable/JJ that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB any/DT instrument/NN with/IN which/WDT to/TO give/VB assistance/NN in/IN situations/NNS like/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ comprehensive/JJ statement/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN and/CC his/PRP$ suggestion/NN that/IN we/PRP might/MD indeed/RB organise/VB ourselves/PRP at/IN European/JJ level/NN to/TO give/VB assistance/NN to/TO Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC regions/NNS that/WDT have/VBP tragedies/VBN like/IN this/DT ./.

That/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

The/DT other/JJ thing/NN we/PRP should/MD remember/VB is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP did/VBD have/VB a/DT budget/NN line/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD very/RB small/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO do/VB very/RB much/JJ but/CC it/PRP was/VBD repeatedly/RB abused/JJ by/IN Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP proposing/NNP action/NN when/WRB the/DT disasters/NNS were/VBD not/RB even/RB major/JJ ./.

Officials/NNS and/CC ministers/NNS from/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS were/VBD coming/VBG to/TO Brussels/NNP ,/, whispering/VBG with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC getting/VBG a/DT few/JJ euros/NNS and/CC making/VBG a/DT political/JJ point/NN by/IN bringing/VBG aid/NN back/RP to/TO their/PRP$ constituencies/NNS ./.

So/IN there/EX was/VBD not/RB much/RB sympathy/JJ for/IN this/DT budget/NN line/NN when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD abolished/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP should/MD reinstate/VB this/DT budget/NN line/NN ./.

When/WRB we/PRP had/VBD the/DT earthquake/NN in/IN Greece/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT big/JJ disaster/NN ,/, the/DT Community/NNP had/VBD no/DT instrument/NN with/IN which/WDT to/TO offer/VB its/PRP$ sympathy/NN or/CC solidarity/NN to/TO the/DT Greeks/NNPS ./.

The/DT same/JJ when/WRB the/DT floods/NNS came/VBD in/IN France/NNP and/CC the/DT same/JJ again/RB now/RB ./.

These/DT are/VBP major/JJ disasters/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD have/VB an/DT instrument/NN ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB it/PRP ./.

We/PRP should/MD reinstate/VB that/DT instrument/NN and/CC we/PRP should/MD make/VB the/DT rules/NNS tight/RB so/RB that/IN only/RB in/IN situations/NNS where/WRB grave/JJ disasters/NNS occur/VBP will/MD we/PRP call/VB up/RP this/DT particular/JJ instrument/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD save/VB it/PRP from/IN year/NN to/TO year/NN and/CC ensure/VB that/IN when/WRB something/NN major/JJ happens/VBZ we/PRP have/VBP an/DT instrument/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB it/PRP so/RB bad/JJ in/IN Ireland/NNP this/DT time/NN although/IN we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN many/JJ serious/JJ wind/NN storms/NNS on/IN the/DT Atlantic/NNP ./.

We/PRP had/VBD floods/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP also/RB and/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ sympathy/NN with/IN the/DT people/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP who/WP suffered/VBN from/IN these/DT ./.

Ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, none/NN of/IN us/PRP must/MD forget/VB what/WP has/VBZ taken/VBN place/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT joint/JJ decision/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP seeking/VBG to/TO discontinue/VB emergency/NN lines/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nevertheless/RB the/DT case/NN that/IN not/RB a/DT penny/NN more/RBR than/IN what/WP was/VBD allocated/VBN before/IN the/DT storm/NN will/MD now/RB be/VB freed/VBN up/RP to/TO demonstrate/VB practical/JJ ,/, active/JJ solidarity/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN more/JJR than/IN the/DT States/NNPS playing/VBG at/IN taking/VBG from/IN Peter/NNP in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB to/TO Paul/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ inadequate/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP personally/RB delighted/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP has/VBZ stated/VBN an/DT idea/NN close/RB to/TO my/PRP$ heart/NN and/CC which/WDT ,/, moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP expressed/VBD when/WRB I/PRP told/VBD the/DT press/NN in/IN Bordeaux/NNP what/WP I/PRP am/VBP hoping/VBG for/IN ,/, and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT reinforced/JJ policy/NN of/IN European/JJ civil/JJ security/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, when/WRB we/PRP compare/VBP the/DT frequency/NN with/IN which/WDT storms/NNS occur/VBP in/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN with/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ situation/NN ,/, we/PRP see/VBP that/IN Europe/NNP gets/VBZ off/RB relatively/RB lightly/RB ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT storms/NNS that/WDT took/VBD place/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ week/NN of/IN December/NNP showed/VBD us/PRP what/WP the/DT consequences/NNS can/MD be/VB and/CC that/IN there/EX are/VBP major/JJ problems/NNS in/IN store/NN for/IN us/PRP ./.

Anyone/NN travelling/VBG to/TO Strasbourg/NNP by/IN car/NN or/CC by/IN rail/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO see/VB for/IN themselves/PRP that/IN storms/NNS raged/VBD in/IN Alsace/NNP as/RB well/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO extend/VB my/PRP$ sympathy/NN to/TO all/PDT those/DT citizens/NNS in/IN the/DT regions/NNS where/WRB the/DT storms/NNS raged/VBD so/RB furiously/RB ,/, and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, from/IN my/PRP$ position/NN here/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP ,/, point/NN to/TO how/WRB important/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO support/VB these/DT regions/NNS and/CC people/NNS ./.

Each/DT and/CC every/DT one/NN of/IN us/PRP knows/VBZ that/IN any/DT other/JJ region/NN of/IN Europe/NNP could/MD meet/VB with/IN just/RB such/PDT a/DT fate/NN tomorrow/NN ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB now/RB is/VBZ to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT fallen/VBN timber/NN as/IN swiftly/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

For/IN it/PRP is/VBZ common/JJ knowledge/NN that/IN we/PRP could/MD have/VB an/DT even/RB greater/JJR disaster/NN on/IN our/PRP$ hands/NNS if/IN the/DT fallen/JJ timber/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB left/VBN in/IN the/DT forests/NNS too/RB long/JJ ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB pointed/VBN out/RP that/IN fallen/JJ timber/NN provides/VBZ the/DT best/JJS breeding/NN ground/NN for/IN the/DT bark/NN beetle/NN '/POS s/JJ larvae/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP not/RB yet/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO assess/VB the/DT repercussions/NNS this/DT will/MD have/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB essential/JJ to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT fallen/JJ timber/NN before/IN the/DT warmer/JJR weather/NN arrives/VBZ ./.

I/PRP propose/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP should/MD keep/VB the/DT arrangements/NNS as/RB per/IN the/DT agenda/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN Friday/NNP and/CC the/DT vote/NN at/IN a/DT later/JJ date/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP clearly/RB owe/VBP Mr/NNP Wurtz/NNP an/DT explanation/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG give/VB this/DT explanation/NN before/IN the/DT whole/JJ House/NN ./.

We/PRP had/VBD reached/VBN this/DT agreement/NN on/IN principle/NN in/IN the/DT Conference/NN of/IN Presidents/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB know/VB that/IN Commissioner/NNP Bolkestein/NNP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO appear/VB next/JJ week/NN before/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP to/TO discuss/VB this/DT matter/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD simply/RB like/VB to/TO ask/VB Mr/NNP Wurtz/NNP to/TO take/VB a/DT second/JJ look/NN at/IN what/WP this/DT is/VBZ about/IN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN any/DT disputes/NNS on/IN the/DT substance/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB about/IN the/DT following/JJ question/NN :/: when/WRB will/MD the/DT Commission/NNP -/VB having/VBG already/RB had/VBN a/DT year/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT -/: finally/RB be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO table/VB the/DT directive/NN ?/.

Our/PRP$ sole/JJ intention/NN in/IN tabling/VBG the/DT motion/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT deadlines/NNS which/WDT were/VBD promised/VBN are/VBP now/RB finally/RB adhered/VBN to/TO ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ that/IN we/PRP act/VBP as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO support/VB the/DT Social/NNP Democrats/NNPS '/POS request/NN to/TO hold/VB the/DT vote/NN on/IN Friday/NNP ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Parliament/NNP gave/VBD its/PRP$ assent/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

That/DT ought/MD to/TO mean/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP more/JJR time/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP ./.

In/IN general/NN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT sittings/NNS have/VBP been/VBN managed/VBN in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO have/VB been/VBN very/RB chaotic/JJ ./.

Last/JJ Thursday/NNP speaking/VBG times/NNS were/VBD extremely/RB tight/JJ and/CC then/RB suddenly/RB we/PRP had/VBD between/IN one/CD and/CC one-and-a-half/JJ hours/NNS when/WRB there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN on/IN the/DT agenda/NN and/CC we/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT vote/NN ./.

On/IN Friday/NNP of/IN this/DT week/NN we/PRP have/VBP one/CD single/JJ item/NN on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ absolutely/RB absurd/JJ ./.

I/PRP really/RB should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB that/IN a/DT review/NN be/VB carried/VBN out/RP of/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT sittings/NNS are/VBP managed/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ all/DT I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN here/RB ,/, just/RB that/DT ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, Commissioners/VBZ and/CC members/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD given/VBN the/DT task/NN of/IN drawing/VBG up/RP the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT Community/NNP Initiative/NNP Programme/NNP INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ./.

Upon/IN referral/NN to/TO committee/NN ,/, we/PRP examined/VBD over/IN a/DT hundred/CD amendments/NNS and/CC ,/, so/RB far/RB ,/, 17/CD amendments/NNS ,/, some/DT of/IN which/WDT have/VBP already/RB been/VBN presented/VBN in/IN committee/NN ,/, have/VBP once/RB again/RB been/VBN tabled/VBN ./.

Before/IN discussing/VBG the/DT content/NN of/IN the/DT resolution/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO inform/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT elements/NNS which/WDT I/PRP took/VBD account/NN of/IN and/CC which/WDT guided/VBN my/PRP$ work/NN as/IN rapporteur/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT function/NN of/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP Community/NNP initiative/NN ,/, founded/VBD on/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN transnationality/NN and/CC innovation/NN ./.

This/DT programme/NN constitutes/VBZ a/DT driving/VBG force/NN for/IN development/NN on/IN the/DT European/JJ scale/NN ./.

INTERREG/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT four/CD Community/NNP initiatives/NNS scheduled/VBN for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2006/CD ,/, and/CC is/VBZ the/DT one/NN with/IN the/DT largest/JJS budget/NN for/IN implementation/NN ,/, i.e./VBG EUR/$ 4.875/CD billion/CD as/RB opposed/JJ to/TO EUR/$ 3.604/CD billion/CD at/IN the/DT present/JJ time/NN ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN ,/, created/VBN in/IN 1990/CD ,/, is/VBZ built/VBN upon/IN the/DT wish/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ready/JJ for/IN a/DT `/`` Europe/NNP without/IN frontiers/NNS '/'' in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN establishing/VBG the/DT great/JJ single/JJ market/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS in/IN 1994/CD and/CC 1996/CD ,/, the/DT INTERREG/NNP CIP/NNP has/VBZ incorporated/VBN new/JJ strands/NNS contributing/VBG to/TO the/DT development/NN of/IN trans-European/JJ transport/NN and/CC energy/NN distribution/NN networks/NNS ./.

These/DT programmes/NNS promoted/VBD cross-border/JJ ,/, transnational/JJ and/CC interregional/JJ cooperation/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP by/IN encouraging/VBG balanced/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP area/NN ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP III/NNP programme/NN ,/, for/IN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP before/IN us/PRP today/NN the/DT guidelines/NNS issued/VBD by/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, pursuant/JJ to/TO the/DT terms/NNS of/IN European/JJ Community/NNP Regulation/NNP No/NNP 1260/CD de/IN 1999/CD laying/NNS down/RB general/JJ provisions/NNS on/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, continues/VBZ these/DT measures/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ INTERREG/NNP programme/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP received/VBN it/PRP ,/, takes/VBZ into/IN consideration/NN the/DT needs/NNS engendered/VBD by/IN enlargement/NN to/TO the/DT countries/NNS of/IN Eastern/NNP and/CC Central/NNP Europe/NNP and/CC to/TO island/NN regions/NNS and/CC most/RBS remote/JJ regions/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP proposes/VBZ redistributing/VBG the/DT INTERREG/NNP funding/NN as/IN follows/VBZ :/: between/IN 50/CD and/CC 80/CD %/NN for/IN strand/JJ A/NN ,/, 6/CD %/NN for/IN strand/JJ C/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT remainder/NN for/IN strand/JJ B/NNP ,/, i.e./VBG from/IN 14/CD up/RB to/TO a/DT maximum/NN of/IN 44/CD %/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP draws/VBZ up/RP the/DT list/NN of/IN eligible/JJ regions/NNS for/IN strand/JJ A/NN and/CC strand/VBD B/NNP ./.

It/PRP bases/VBZ its/PRP$ assessment/NN principally/RB on/IN the/DT map/NN of/IN regions/NNS eligible/JJ during/IN the/DT previous/JJ programming/NN period/NN ./.

The/DT adoption/NN procedure/NN for/IN the/DT programmes/NNS is/VBZ established/VBN by/IN the/DT general/JJ regulations/NNS on/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

Proposals/NNS are/VBP drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC are/VBP submitted/VBN for/IN approval/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, which/WDT checks/VBZ their/PRP$ conformity/NN with/IN the/DT general/JJ guidelines/NNS ,/, adopted/VBN ./.

These/DT proposals/NNS must/MD include/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN elements/NNS ,/, an/DT overview/NN of/IN the/DT cross-border/JJ or/CC transnational/JJ priorities/NNS and/CC strategies/NNS ,/, a/DT description/NN of/IN the/DT measures/NNS necessary/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ implementation/NN and/CC an/DT indicative/JJ financial/JJ plan/NN ./.

In/IN promoting/VBG cross-border/JJ ,/, transnational/JJ and/CC interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, this/DT cross-disciplinary/JJ instrument/NN is/VBZ the/DT very/JJ incarnation/NN of/IN a/DT regional/JJ policy/NN on/IN the/DT European/JJ scale/NN intended/VBN to/TO encourage/VB harmonious/JJ and/CC balanced/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP territory/NN ./.

An/DT integrated/VBN development/NN policy/NN for/IN all/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ therefore/RB needed/VBN ,/, consisting/VBG of/IN the/DT following/VBG elements/NNS :/: an/DT integrated/VBN ,/, multi-sectoral/JJ approach/NN ,/, simplification/NN of/IN administrative/JJ procedures/NNS ,/, improvement/NN of/IN the/DT partnership/NN between/IN European/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC national/JJ and/CC local/JJ actors/NNS and/CC protection/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ 1998/CD policy/NN paper/NN ,/, Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP set/VBD out/RP two/CD key/JJ principles/NNS on/IN which/WDT rural/JJ development/NN policy/NN should/MD be/VB based/VBN :/: the/DT recognition/NN of/IN the/DT multifunctionality/NN of/IN agriculture/NN and/CC the/DT need/NN for/IN an/DT integrated/VBN strategy/NN for/IN developing/VBG rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ principle/NN means/VBZ creating/VBG a/DT new/JJ `/`` pact/NN '/'' between/IN farmers/NNS and/CC society/NN ,/, making/VBG the/DT farmer/NN `/`` steward/JJ of/IN the/DT countryside/NN '/'' and/CC ensuring/VBG that/IN society/NN is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT environmental/JJ services/NNS needed/VBN to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT countryside/NN '/POS s/JJ recreation/NN value/NN ./.

The/DT LEADER/NNP Community/NNP initiative/NN was/VBD launched/VBN in/IN 1991/CD to/TO promote/VB a/DT new/JJ bottom-up/JJ approach/NN to/TO rural/JJ development/NN and/CC to/TO diversify/VB measures/NNS by/IN adapting/VBG them/PRP to/TO local/JJ needs/NNS ./.

The/DT following/JJ objectives/NNS were/VBD set/NN :/: improving/VBG the/DT development/NN potential/NN of/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS by/IN calling/VBG upon/IN local/JJ initiative/NN ;/: promoting/VBG the/DT acquisition/NN of/IN knowledge/NN in/IN the/DT rural/JJ development/NN sector/NN ;/: disseminating/VBG this/DT knowledge/NN to/TO other/JJ rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

LEADER/NNP I/NNP applied/VBD to/TO the/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS covered/VBN by/IN Structural/NNP Fund/NNP Objectives/NNP 1/CD and/CC 5b/NNS ,/, and/CC 217/CD local/JJ action/NN groups/NNS participated/VBD in/IN it/PRP ,/, with/IN financing/NN of/IN EUR/$ 1/CD 155/CD million/CD ./.

LEADER/NNP II/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 1994-1999/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, for/IN which/WDT a/DT total/JJ evaluation/NN has/VBZ ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, not/RB yet/RB been/VBN completed/VBN ,/, had/VBD a/DT wider/JJR scope/NN than/IN LEADER/NNP I/NNP :/: there/EX were/VBD probably/RB over/IN 800/CD beneficiaries/NNS and/CC the/DT sums/NNS allocated/VBD ,/, after/IN reallocation/NN of/IN resources/NNS ,/, probably/RB amounted/VBD to/TO over/IN EUR/$ 4/CD 000/CD million/CD ./.

In/IN October/NNP 1999/CD ,/, following/VBG the/DT success/NN of/IN LEADER/NNP I/NNP and/CC LEADER/NNP II/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP decided/VBD to/TO extend/VB the/DT initiative/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT 2000-2006/CD period/NN provision/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, only/RB for/IN a/DT total/JJ contribution/NN of/IN EUR/$ 2/CD 020/CD million/CD ,/, and/CC an/DT indicative/JJ allocation/NN for/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN ./.

LEADER/NNP +/NNP differs/VBZ from/IN the/DT previous/JJ stages/NNS in/IN that/WDT all/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS will/MD be/VB eligible/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB more/RBR ambitious/JJ ,/, and/CC better/RBR geared/VBN to/TO the/DT challenges/NNS which/WDT rural/JJ areas/NNS will/MD have/VB to/TO meet/VB ./.

I/PRP share/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ preference/NN for/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN global/JJ grants/NNS while/IN urging/VBG ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT accounting/NN requirements/NNS of/IN national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS should/MD be/VB precisely/RB and/CC painstakingly/RB defined/VBN ./.

I/PRP regret/VBP the/DT delay/NN with/IN which/WDT LEADER/NNP ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT other/JJ three/CD initiatives/NNS ,/, was/VBD presented/VBN to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC for/IN the/DT knock-on/JJ delay/NN this/DT entailed/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ procedure/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP concerned/VBN by/IN the/DT paucity/NN of/IN the/DT amount/NN allocated/VBN ,/, if/IN you/PRP consider/VBP ,/, in/IN addition/NN ,/, that/IN this/DT time/NN the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ available/JJ to/TO all/PDT the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC will/MD be/VB implemented/VBN for/IN a/DT year/NN longer/RBR than/IN the/DT previous/JJ LEADER/NNP II/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Commission/NNP services/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ helpfulness/NNS and/CC cooperation/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP for/IN the/DT contribution/NN they/PRP have/VBP made/VBN through/IN their/PRP$ amendments/NNS ./.

This/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN succeeds/VBZ the/DT two/CD forerunner/NN programmes/NNS ADAPT/VBP and/CC EMPLOYMENT/VBP and/CC has/VBZ a/DT much/RB smaller/JJR budget/NN of/IN around/RB EUR/$ 2.8/CD billion/CD ./.

The/DT initiative/NN adopts/VBZ a/DT completely/RB new/JJ approach/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ to/TO develop/VB innovative/JJ employment/NN models/NNS within/IN transnational/JJ geographical/JJ or/CC sectoral/JJ development/NN partnerships/NNS ./.

The/DT intention/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ :/: targeted/JJ projects/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB developed/VBN at/IN transnational/JJ level/NN ,/, projects/NNS which/WDT are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT employment/NN policy/NN guidelines/NNS of/IN employability/JJ ,/, entrepreneurship/JJ ,/, adaptability/JJ and/CC equal/JJ opportunities/NNS ./.

This/DT objective/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN and/CC also/RB meets/VBZ with/IN a/DT broad/JJ consensus/NN in/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, EQUAL/NNP should/MD feed/VB into/IN the/DT National/NNP Action/NNP Plans/NNPS for/IN employment/NN and/CC its/PRP$ implementation/NN should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO be/VB monitored/VBN through/IN these/DT Action/NNP Plans/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ Community/NNP initiative/NN which/WDT ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT three/CD other/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, URBAN/NNP ,/, LEADER/NNP and/CC INTERREG/NNP ,/, is/VBZ financed/VBN out/RP of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ report/NN I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN to/TO reduce/VB excessive/JJ administrative/JJ expenditure/NN and/CC to/TO build/VB greater/JJR openness/NN and/CC flexibility/NN into/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN development/NN partnerships/NNS ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP technical/JJ support/NN to/TO be/VB necessary/JJ but/CC ,/, given/VBN the/DT problems/NNS with/IN the/DT former/JJ TAOs/NNS ,/, no/DT new/JJ TAOs/NNS should/MD be/VB set/VBN up/RP without/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ approval/NN so/RB as/RB to/TO prevent/VB political/JJ responsibility/NN from/IN being/VBG passed/VBN down/RP to/TO the/DT technical/JJ assistance/NN level/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, technical/JJ assistance/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ ./.

Particular/JJ attention/NN is/VBZ also/RB paid/VBN to/TO the/DT dissemination/NN of/IN results/NNS and/CC learning/VBG from/IN each/DT other/JJ by/IN identifying/VBG best/RBS practice/NN ,/, with/IN special/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN mainstreaming/VBG ./.

I/PRP have/VBP endeavoured/VBN to/TO secure/VB the/DT widest/JJS possible/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ meant/VBN a/DT reduction/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS -/: from/IN over/IN 100/CD in/IN committee/NN to/TO 22/CD for/IN the/DT plenary/NN -/: which/WDT has/VBZ also/RB created/VBN numerous/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN compromises/NNS ./.

A/DT compromise/NN has/VBZ now/RB also/RB been/VBN reached/VBN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN asylum/NN seekers/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO allow/VB us/PRP to/TO work/VB out/RP the/DT details/NNS ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO request/VB that/IN the/DT vote/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP report/NN be/VB held/VBN not/RB tomorrow/NN but/CC on/IN Wednesday/NNP ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ also/RB justified/JJ in/IN insisting/VBG that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO amend/VB the/DT thematic/JJ priorities/NNS only/RB after/IN a/DT further/JJ hearing/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

EQUAL/NNP should/MD live/VB up/RP to/TO its/PRP$ name/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ firm/NN intention/NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD provide/VB equal/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN all/PDT those/DT at/IN a/DT disadvantage/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP should/MD prevent/VB society/NN from/IN splintering/VBG ./.

It/PRP should/MD prevent/VB exclusion/NN from/IN being/VBG part/NN of/IN everyday/JJ life/NN ./.

Everyone/NN should/MD be/VB given/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO benefit/VB here/RB from/IN a/DT common/JJ initiative/NN regardless/RB of/IN their/PRP$ age/NN ,/, gender/NN or/CC origin/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ intention/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT House/NNP to/TO give/VB this/DT report/NN overwhelming/JJ support/NN !/. ./.

Madam/VB President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN itself/PRP an/DT achievement/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP having/VBG this/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT new/JJ URBAN/NNP Community/NNP initiative/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT achievement/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP here/RB tonight/NN because/IN Air/NNP France/NNP cancelled/VBD my/PRP$ flight/NN at/IN 2.10/CD p.m./RB but/CC I/PRP am/VBP here/RB !/. ./.

Just/RB a/DT year/NN ago/RB when/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP produced/VBD its/PRP$ proposals/NNS around/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD it/PRP axed/VBD the/DT URBAN/NNP initiative/NN ./.

Yet/CC we/PRP as/IN politicians/NNS knew/VBD that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT groundswell/NN of/IN support/NN for/IN continuing/VBG this/DT initiative/NN into/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ./.

Parliament/NNP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, can/MD take/VB credit/NN for/IN a/DT successful/JJ lobbying/NN campaign/NN to/TO put/VB URBAN/NNP back/RP on/IN the/DT agenda/NN and/CC get/VB the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Council/NNP to/TO make/VB a/DT U-turn/NN ./.

Urban/NNP policy/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN at/IN the/DT forefront/NN of/IN EU/NNP policy/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ Member/NNP State/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP developing/VBG a/DT strategic/JJ approach/NN in/IN a/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP and/CC an/DT urban/JJ government/NN taskforce/NN is/VBZ looking/VBG at/IN the/DT problems/NNS of/IN urban/JJ communities/NNS ./.

With/IN eight/CD out/RB of/IN ten/CD people/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP living/VBG in/IN urban/JJ areas/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ that/IN we/PRP help/VBP our/PRP$ most/RBS deprived/JJ communities/NNS to/TO tackle/VB the/DT all/RB too/RB familiar/JJ problems/NNS of/IN deprivation/NN ,/, social/JJ exclusion/NN ,/, joblessness/NN ,/, crime/NN ,/, drug/NN dependency/NNS and/CC all/PDT the/DT problems/NNS that/WDT are/VBP associated/VBN with/IN that/DT ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ region/NN ,/, in/IN Manchester/NNP ,/, the/DT URBAN/NNP Community/NNP initiative/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT tremendous/JJ success/NN ./.

URBAN/NNP funds/NNS have/VBP been/VBN invested/VBN in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS deprived/VBN neighbourhoods/NNS in/IN the/DT UK/NNP ,/, in/IN Moss/NNP Side/NNP ./.

The/DT Millennium/NNP Youth/NNP Park/NNP project/NN is/VBZ helping/VBG to/TO get/VB young/JJ people/NNS re-engaged/VBN in/IN regenerating/VBG their/PRP$ own/JJ community/NN and/CC in/IN addition/NN to/TO support/VB for/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS and/CC social/JJ policy/NN we/PRP are/VBP beginning/VBG to/TO see/VB a/DT turnaround/NN of/IN a/DT very/RB deprived/JJ urban/JJ community/NN ./.

The/DT work/NN of/IN this/DT URBAN/NNP agenda/NN was/VBD then/RB taken/VBN out/RP to/TO the/DT wider/JJR community/NN with/IN an/DT active/JJ communication/NN and/CC publicity/NN campaign/NN in/IN local/JJ supermarkets/NNS and/CC famous/JJ British/JJ pubs/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN good/JJ practice/NN we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB extended/VBN across/IN the/DT EU/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN communication/NN and/CC publicity/NN ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT specific/JJ guidelines/NNS governing/VBG the/DT initiative/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP broadly/RB defined/VBN to/TO give/VB scope/NN for/IN local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ diversity/NN ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP that/IN they/PRP ought/MD to/TO be/VB indicative/JJ in/IN nature/NN ,/, allowing/VBG the/DT maximum/JJ flexibility/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP target/VBP specific/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

In/IN committee/NN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN reducing/VBG the/DT number/NN to/TO 50/CD ./.

We/PRP are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN reduction/NN overall/RB but/CC we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT arbitrary/JJ number/NN of/IN 50/CD is/VBZ not/RB the/DT key/JJ factor/NN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD go/VB for/IN good-quality/JJ projects/NNS that/WDT can/MD act/VB as/IN a/DT catalyst/NN to/TO effect/NN change/NN and/CC renewal/NN ,/, to/TO attract/VB inward/JJ investment/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN loans/NNS and/CC venture/NN capital/NN and/CC to/TO achieve/VB a/DT multiplier/NN effect/NN ./.

The/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS should/MD therefore/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO propose/VB a/DT reasonable/JJ number/NN of/IN areas/NNS within/IN the/DT financial/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN their/PRP$ allocations/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT designation/NN of/IN local/JJ URBAN/NN programmes/NNS we/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB good/JJ use/NN of/IN local/JJ indicators/NNS and/CC statistics/NNS on/IN deprivation/NN and/CC health/NN to/TO enable/VB us/PRP to/TO more/RBR effectively/RB target/VB the/DT most/RBS affected/JJ areas/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT UK/NNP the/DT local/JJ index/NN of/IN deprivation/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ example/NN of/IN a/DT widely/RB used/VBN standard/NN and/CC statistic/NN to/TO help/VB determine/VB not/RB only/JJ EU/NNP but/CC national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ assistance/NN programmes/NNS ./.

This/DT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB acknowledged/VBN as/IN a/DT tool/NN and/CC resource/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT EU/NNP criteria/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO take/VB on/IN board/NN local/JJ indicators/NNS to/TO help/VB us/PRP do/VB that/DT ./.

Our/PRP$ most/RBS deprived/VBN urban/JJ neighbourhoods/NNS face/VBP a/DT plethora/NN of/IN problems/NNS :/: high/JJ unemployment/NN and/CC often/RB very/RB low-paid/JJ precarious/JJ employment/NN ,/, poverty/NN and/CC social/JJ exclusion/NN ./.

Often/RB these/DT problems/NNS are/VBP compounded/VBN by/IN poor/JJ health/NN and/CC housing/NN stock/NN and/CC a/DT culture/NN of/IN drug/NN dependency/NNS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB have/VBP unstable/JJ communities/NNS which/WDT are/VBP infiltrated/VBN with/IN crime/NN ,/, drug-dealing/NN and/CC gangs/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ all/RB too/RB familiar/JJ in/IN many/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ urban/JJ areas/NNS ./.

All/PDT these/DT complex/JJ problems/NNS undermine/VBP the/DT quality/NN of/IN life/NN for/IN our/PRP$ urban/JJ residents/NNS ,/, yet/CC we/PRP have/VBP the/DT potential/NN in/IN these/DT areas/NNS to/TO create/VB growth/NN and/CC prosperity/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB again/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ report/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN that/IN action/NN under/IN the/DT URBAN/NNP Programme/NNP should/MD not/RB merely/RB provide/VB a/DT single/JJ solution/NN to/TO a/DT single/JJ problem/NN :/: these/DT areas/NNS do/VBP not/RB have/VB single/JJ ,/, ``/`` mono/JJ ''/'' problems/NNS ./.

Instead/RB ,/, communities/NNS in/IN urban/JJ areas/NNS should/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN to/TO present/VB integrated/JJ action/NN plans/NNS to/TO tackle/VB their/PRP$ specific/JJ urban/JJ problems/NNS ,/, using/VBG EU/JJ resources/NNS as/IN a/DT value/NN added/VBD to/TO local/JJ actions/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB those/DT actions/NNS extended/VBN to/TO cover/VB health/NN and/CC anti-discrimination/NN ,/, as/IN provided/VBN for/IN in/IN the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ./.

The/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN means/VBZ community/NN involvement/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS active/JJ and/CC committed/JJ proponents/NNS and/CC agents/NNS of/IN change/NN in/IN our/PRP$ urban/JJ areas/NNS are/VBP local/JJ residents/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO encourage/VB them/PRP to/TO participate/VB in/IN designing/VBG and/CC delivering/VBG projects/NNS for/IN these/DT programmes/NNS ./.

The/DT time-scale/NN therefore/RB proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ very/RB ambitious/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ better/JJR to/TO have/VB quality/NN projects/NNS with/IN the/DT active/JJ participation/NN of/IN community/NN groups/NNS than/IN to/TO have/VB projects/NNS delivered/VBN on/IN time/NN but/CC without/IN local/JJ participation/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD of/IN course/NN provide/VB full/JJ disclosure/NN and/CC transparency/NN concerning/VBG the/DT selection/NN criteria/NNS used/VBN for/IN the/DT new/JJ urban/JJ initiatives/NNS but/CC it/PRP must/MD also/RB disclose/VB the/DT consultancy/JJ networks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP being/VBG used/VBN to/TO deliver/VB the/DT exchange/NN of/IN good/JJ practice/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN transparency/NN and/CC the/DT overall/JJ effectiveness/NN of/IN networks/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN in/IN order/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT problems/NNS facing/VBG the/DT post-industrial/JJ city/NN we/PRP require/VBP local/JJ participation/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO deploy/VB the/DT energies/NNS of/IN the/DT unemployed/JJ ,/, the/DT underused/JJ skills/NNS of/IN youth/NN and/CC the/DT experience/NN of/IN age/NN to/TO tackle/VB these/DT problems/NNS ./.

We/PRP shall/MD thereby/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO replace/VB poverty/NN ,/, dependency/NN and/CC alienation/NN with/IN equity/NN ,/, initiative/NN and/CC participation/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD help/VB us/PRP to/TO restore/VB the/DT credibility/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC the/DT confidence/NN of/IN citizens/NNS that/IN Europe/NNP can/MD deliver/VB local/JJ action/NN to/TO solve/VB local/JJ problems/NNS ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- IT/PRP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP McCarthy/NNP ,/, has/VBZ already/RB pointed/VBN out/RP ,/, we/PRP can/MD certainly/RB consider/VB URBAN/VB a/DT success/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN held/VBN last/JJ year/NN on/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT regulations/NNS ./.

As/IN we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN ,/, the/DT objective/NN of/IN URBAN/NNP is/VBZ the/DT promotion/NN of/IN innovative/JJ strategies/NNS to/TO promote/VB economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ regeneration/NN in/IN urban/JJ areas/NNS ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN 80/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN of/IN Europe/NNP lives/VBZ in/IN cities/NNS ./.

The/DT Communication/NNP from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP takes/VBZ account/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO adopt/VB approaches/NNS combining/VBG a/DT range/NN of/IN economic/JJ ,/, social/JJ ,/, and/CC infrastructural/JJ measures/NNS ./.

As/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS stressed/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD therefore/RB recognise/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO exploit/VB synergies/NNS in/IN this/DT context/NN while/IN avoiding/VBG duplication/NN of/IN multiple/JJ funding/NN ./.

While/IN ,/, on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN steering/NN committees/NNS should/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT various/JJ projects/NNS are/VBP coherent/JJ and/CC complementary/JJ ,/, we/PRP would/MD on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN urge/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO reinforce/VB exchanges/NNS of/IN information/NN and/CC coordination/NN between/IN the/DT departments/NNS involved/VBN ./.

Not/RB only/RB is/VBZ this/DT coordination/NN essential/JJ but/CC ,/, as/IN we/PRP stated/VBD in/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, exchanges/NNS and/CC the/DT dissemination/NN of/IN expertise/NN and/CC good/JJ practice/NN must/MD also/RB be/VB essential/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN this/DT initiative/NN is/VBZ increasing/VBG constantly/RB as/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ problems/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ cities/NNS intensify/VB and/CC the/DT public/NN feels/VBZ more/JJR and/CC more/JJR out/RB of/IN touch/NN with/IN the/DT administration/NN of/IN its/PRP$ city/NN or/CC neighbourhood/NN ./.

That/DT situation/NN will/MD be/VB compounded/VBN by/IN social/JJ reclassifications/NNS resulting/VBG from/IN European/JJ Union/NNP enlargement/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP must/MD therefore/RB make/VB provision/NN for/IN the/DT economic/JJ regeneration/NN and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN of/IN our/PRP$ cities/NNS ./.

Addressing/VBG those/DT problems/NNS is/VBZ all/PDT the/DT more/RBR urgent/JJ in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT marked/JJ spread/NN of/IN cities/NNS into/IN the/DT surrounding/VBG areas/NNS and/CC in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT cities/NNS '/POS historical/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ role/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN for/IN such/PDT an/DT effort/NN to/TO succeed/VB it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO secure/VB the/DT commitment/NN and/CC participation/NN of/IN the/DT public/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN and/CC to/TO enlist/VB the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT less/RBR active/JJ social/JJ groups/NNS and/CC the/DT groups/NNS particularly/RB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ crisis/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP want/VBP a/DT Union/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ democratic/JJ and/CC transparent/JJ to/TO the/DT fullest/JJS degree/NN we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO revisit/VB this/DT subject/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/RB I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ,/, for/IN her/PRP$ work/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ never/RB easy/JJ working/VBG on/IN comitology/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Schleicher/NNP referred/VBD to/TO a/DT kind/NN of/IN committee/NN magic/NN ,/, something/NN we/PRP have/VBP long/RB talked/VBN about/IN ./.

Certainly/RB the/DT process/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN very/RB complex/JJ ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN historical/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, and/CC these/DT must/MD eventually/RB be/VB rationalised/VBN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT agreement/NN reached/VBN between/IN Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ rationalisation/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN ./.

From/IN our/PRP$ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, it/PRP satisfies/VBZ the/DT fundamental/JJ interests/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP set/VBD out/RP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ concerns/NNS ./.

He/PRP says/VBZ some/DT of/IN them/PRP have/VBP been/VBN satisfied/JJ and/CC others/NNS have/VBP not/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD say/VB the/DT ones/NNS the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO satisfy/VB have/VB been/VBN satisfied/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP is/VBZ raising/VBG issues/NNS the/DT Council/NNP decision/NN does/VBZ not/RB cover/VB ,/, and/CC unfortunately/RB we/PRP can/MD go/VB no/DT further/RBR on/IN those/DT ./.

So/RB how/WRB far/RB have/VBP we/PRP come/VBN ?/.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN a/DT fundamental/JJ point/NN ,/, highlighted/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ,/, given/VBN that/IN we/PRP now/RB have/VBP an/DT automatic/JJ information/NN system/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD facilitate/VB two/CD activities/NNS Parliament/NNP is/VBZ especially/RB interested/VBN in/RP ./.

One/PRP is/VBZ knowing/VBG how/WRB the/DT committees/NNS operate/VBP ,/, about/IN their/PRP$ composition/NN ,/, agendas/NNS ,/, descriptions/FW ,/, and/CC so/RB on/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ the/DT right/NN of/IN scrutiny/NN over/IN actual/JJ decisions/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ agreement/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ agreement/NN which/WDT undoubtedly/RB improves/VBZ the/DT transparency/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN ./.

From/IN here/RB on/RB things/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB easier/JJR ./.

But/CC the/DT agreement/NN we/PRP are/VBP reaching/VBG today/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB regarded/VBN as/IN a/DT backward/JJ step/NN compared/VBN with/IN the/DT Plumb/Delors/NNP Agreement/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP referred/VBD to/TO that/DT ,/, but/CC the/DT new/JJ model/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB much/RB more/RBR complex/JJ ,/, different/JJ because/IN the/DT situation/NN is/VBZ now/RB different/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, much/RB more/RBR coherent/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP made/VBN a/DT start/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP hope/VBP the/DT work/NN will/MD produce/VB some/DT excellent/JJ results/NNS ./.

We/PRP think/VBP there/EX are/VBP other/JJ positive/JJ advances/NNS too/RB ./.

To/TO a/DT certain/JJ extent/NN we/PRP have/VBP gone/VBN beyond/IN agreements/NNS which/WDT are/VBP already/RB dated/VBN and/CC ,/, by/IN realigning/VBG old/JJ procedures/NNS with/IN the/DT new/JJ situation/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP to/TO clear/VB up/RP everything/NN still/RB outstanding/JJ from/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, our/PRP$ conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ agreement/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB the/DT Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP who/WP worked/VBD on/IN it/PRP -/: especially/RB Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT new/JJ climate/NN means/VBZ we/PRP have/VBP achieved/VBN the/DT result/NN we/PRP were/VBD seeking/VBG ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ greater/JJR transparency/NN and/CC better/JJR information/NN about/IN the/DT decisions/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP as/IN an/DT executive/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP Solbes/NNPS Mira/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12.00/CD p.m./RB Protocol/NNP on/IN the/DT excessive/JJ deficit/NN procedure/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP also/RB pleased/JJ to/TO welcome/VB the/DT Spanish/NNP Commissioner/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Solbes/NNPS Mira/NNP ,/, whom/WP I/PRP have/VBP congratulated/VBN more/RBR than/IN once/RB ,/, inside/RB and/CC outside/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT excellent/JJ work/NN he/PRP did/VBD in/IN Spain/NNP on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN European/JJ convergence/NN ./.

To/TO date/NN ,/, the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP calculated/VBN this/DT GDP/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT criteria/NNS laid/VBN down/RP in/IN ESA/NNP 79/CD ./.

The/DT most/RBS recent/JJ estimate/NN of/IN the/DT deficit/NN was/VBD submitted/VBN in/IN September/NNP 1999/CD and/CC it/PRP relates/VBZ to/TO the/DT 1998/CD financial/JJ year/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT regulation/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN ,/, the/DT estimate/NN which/WDT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO appear/VB in/IN March/NNP 2000/CD ,/, the/DT first/JJ estimate/NN of/IN the/DT deficit/NN for/IN the/DT 1999/CD accounting/NN year/NN ,/, will/MD be/VB made/VBN using/VBG the/DT new/JJ system/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP done/VBN their/PRP$ duty/NN -/: if/IN I/PRP can/MD use/VB that/DT expression/NN -/: doing/VBG their/PRP$ calculations/NNS and/CC preparing/VBG their/PRP$ national/JJ accounts/NNS in/IN line/NN with/IN ESA/NNP 95/CD ,/, and/CC they/PRP have/VBP already/RB published/VBN their/PRP$ corresponding/JJ estimates/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO incorporating/VBG a/DT new/JJ methodology/NN ,/, this/DT has/VBZ meant/VBN making/VBG slight/JJ changes/NNS to/TO most/JJS accounting/NN aggregates/NNS and/CC operations/NNS ,/, on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT aforesaid/JJ methodological/JJ changes/NNS ,/, and/CC also/RB the/DT improved/JJ statistical/JJ information/NN included/VBD in/IN the/DT estimates/NNS ./.

These/DT changes/NNS may/MD of/IN course/NN alter/VB the/DT government/NN deficits/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS national/JJ accounting/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD now/RB describe/VB ,/, very/RB briefly/NN ,/, the/DT five/CD areas/NNS where/WRB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ changes/NNS may/MD occur/VB ./.

First/RB ,/, the/DT adjustments/NNS to/TO the/DT scope/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ meant/VBN by/IN `/`` government/NN institutional/JJ sector/NN '/'' under/IN ESA/NNP 95/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, since/IN government/NN deficit/NN means/VBZ the/DT deficit/NN accumulated/VBN by/IN all/DT forms/NNS of/IN government/NN ./.

The/DT non-availability/NN of/IN precise/JJ criteria/NNS for/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN government/NN deficit/NN would/MD produce/VB distortions/NNS in/IN the/DT estimates/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS government/NN deficits/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT deficit/NN -/: or/CC ,/, if/IN applicable/JJ ,/, the/DT surplus/NN -/: means/VBZ the/DT ESA/NNP 95/CD government/NN sector/NN '/'' s/VBZ net/JJ borrowing/NN requirement/NN or/CC lending/NN ability/NN respectively/RB ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, government/NN investment/NN means/VBZ the/DT gross/JJ fixed/JJ capital/NN formation/NN of/IN the/DT general/JJ government/NN sector/NN ,/, as/IN defined/VBN in/IN ESA/NNP 95/CD ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, government/NN debt/NN is/VBZ defined/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN ESA/NNP 95/CD ,/, as/IN are/VBP the/DT flows/NNS or/CC interest/NN stemming/VBG from/IN assets/liabilities/NNS ./.

Fifthly/RB and/CC finally/RB ,/, the/DT aggregate/NN to/TO which/WDT government/NN debt/NN will/MD relate/VB will/MD be/VB gross/JJ domestic/JJ product/NN at/IN current/JJ market/NN prices/NNS ,/, estimated/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT 1995/CD European/NNP System/NNP of/IN Accounts/NNPS '/POS definitions/NNS ./.

To/TO summarise/VB ,/, I/PRP consider/VBP that/IN this/DT proposal/NN constitutes/VBZ a/DT satisfactory/JJ adaptation/NN of/IN the/DT criteria/NNS laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT 1995/CD European/NNP System/NNP of/IN Accounts/NNPS ,/, and/CC I/PRP therefore/RB approve/VB it/PRP in/IN full/JJ ,/, as/IN did/VBD the/DT committee/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, let/VBD me/PRP say/VBP at/IN the/DT outset/NN that/IN my/PRP$ group/NN welcomes/VBZ this/DT proposal/NN because/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ the/DT basic/JJ statistical/JJ data/NNS for/IN an/DT economic/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ union/NN directed/VBN at/IN stability/NN and/CC real/JJ growth/NN more/RBR harmonised/JJ ,/, directly/RB comparable/JJ and/CC more/RBR accurate/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP already/RB heard/VBN about/IN the/DT various/JJ aspects/NNS involved/VBN ./.

What/WP I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ crucial/JJ is/VBZ that/IN henceforth/VBP the/DT statistical/JJ data/NNS will/MD be/VB more/RBR reliable/JJ and/CC comparable/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP that/IN because/IN the/DT various/JJ European/JJ Union/NNP bodies/NNS and/CC all/PDT the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS within/IN monetary/JJ union/NN have/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO depend/VB on/IN one/CD another/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO adjust/VB the/DT procedure/NN for/IN two/CD reasons/NNS ./.

Firstly/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ most/RBS important/JJ quite/RB generally/RB in/IN a/DT single/JJ market/NN to/TO have/VB reliable/JJ and/CC directly/RB comparable/JJ data/NNS and/CC statistics/NNS so/RB as/RB to/TO give/VB an/DT accurate/JJ picture/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN and/CC development/NN trends/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, for/IN economic/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ union/NN ./.

The/DT regulation/NN dating/VBG from/IN 1993/CD on/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT Protocol/NNP must/MD be/VB brought/VBN into/IN harmony/NN with/IN the/DT methodology/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ system/NN of/IN accounts/NNS at/IN national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ level/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ vitally/RB important/JJ to/TO the/DT accurate/JJ and/CC reliable/JJ calculation/NN of/IN deficits/NNS ./.

This/DT adjustment/NN will/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO estimate/VB the/DT deficits/NNS and/CC debts/NNS in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS more/RBR precisely/RB ./.

These/DT technical/JJ changes/NNS will/MD have/VB a/DT very/RB real/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT actual/JJ position/NN of/IN the/DT countries/NNS ,/, since/IN the/DT data/NNS will/MD automatically/RB be/VB amended/VBN in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT public/JJ deficit/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB welcome/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT estimates/NNS of/IN the/DT deficits/NNS for/IN the/DT 1999/CD financial/JJ year/NN that/WDT are/VBP due/JJ to/TO be/VB published/VBN in/IN March/NNP 2000/CD are/VBP already/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT new/JJ ESA/NN ,/, i.e./JJ the/DT analysis/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN consolidated/JJ aggregates/NNS that/WDT are/VBP economically/RB relevant/JJ ./.

Let/VB me/PRP also/RB briefly/RB use/VBP this/DT debate/NN as/IN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO urge/VB all/PDT the/DT governments/NNS and/CC political/JJ parties/NNS to/TO do/VB their/PRP$ utmost/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN this/DT procedure/NN never/RB has/VBZ to/TO be/VB initiated/VBN for/IN an/DT excessive/JJ deficit/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN the/DT procedure/NN exists/VBZ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP it/PRP because/IN it/PRP lends/VBZ our/PRP$ criteria/NNS the/DT necessary/JJ seriousness/NN and/CC credibility/NN ./.

The/DT citizens/NNS ask/VBP what/WP happens/VBZ if/IN the/DT criteria/NNS are/VBP not/RB met/VBN ./.

Thanks/NNS to/TO these/DT procedures/NNS and/CC other/JJ measures/NNS we/PRP can/MD prove/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP taking/VBG the/DT criteria/NNS and/CC ourselves/PRP seriously/RB ./.

Another/DT important/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD do/VB all/DT we/PRP can/MD ,/, not/RB just/RB to/TO prevent/VB excessive/JJ deficits/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO further/RBR reduce/VB public/JJ deficits/NNS ./.

I/PRP know/VBP what/WP I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN and/CC I/PRP will/MD conclude/VB by/IN telling/VBG you/PRP why/WRB I/PRP am/VBP so/RB glad/JJ we/PRP are/VBP holding/VBG this/DT debate/NN !/. ./.

We/PRP are/VBP currently/RB holding/VBG a/DT debate/NN in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN on/IN whether/IN the/DT former/JJ minister/NN for/IN finance/NN actually/RB gave/VBD us/PRP accurate/JJ information/NN on/IN the/DT deficit/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ country/NN ,/, Austria/NNP ,/, new/JJ elections/NNS had/VBD to/TO be/VB held/VBN in/IN 1995/CD in/IN order/NN to/TO meet/VB the/DT Maastricht/NNP criteria/NNS and/CC persuade/VB our/PRP$ political/JJ partner/NN to/TO rethink/VB his/PRP$ approach/NN ./.

I/PRP must/MD also/RB tell/VB you/PRP that/IN in/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ,/, when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ so/RB much/RB talk/NN about/RP us/PRP ,/, the/DT coalition/NN talks/NNS with/IN the/DT SP脙/NNP --/: failed/VBD -/: and/CC unfortunately/RB so/RB -/: because/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Party/NNP brought/VBD down/RP the/DT negotiated/VBN austerity/NN and/CC consolidation/NN programme/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT beauty/NN of/IN statistical/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB reliable/JJ but/CC also/RB comparable/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ of/IN great/JJ importance/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN European/JJ unification/NN and/CC the/DT completion/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB this/DT report/NN is/VBZ also/RB so/RB politically/RB charged/VBN :/: a/DT report/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, on/IN which/WDT we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN warmly/RB ./.

It/PRP also/RB inspires/VBZ a/DT few/JJ political/JJ comments/NNS ./.

The/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP is/VBZ a/SYM given/VBN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

All/DT countries/NNS participating/VBG in/IN the/DT euro/NN have/VBP committed/VBN themselves/PRP ,/, in/IN the/DT medium/NN term/NN ,/, to/TO striving/VBG towards/IN a/DT budget/NN which/WDT is/VBZ either/RB balanced/VBN or/CC shows/VBZ up/RP a/DT slight/JJ surplus/NN ./.

This/DT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN ,/, if/IN the/DT economic/JJ climate/NN is/VBZ less/RBR than/IN favourable/JJ ,/, the/DT budget/NN could/MD not/RB fluctuate/VB up/RB or/CC down/RB slightly/RB ./.

It/PRP means/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT long/JJ and/CC medium/NN term/NN ,/, there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT balance/NN or/CC surplus/NN ./.

The/DT stronger/JJR the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT participating/JJ countries/NNS ,/, the/DT stronger/JJR the/DT euro/NN will/MD be/VB ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT three/CD percent/NN standard/NN will/MD rarely/RB be/VB exceeded/VBN ,/, not/RB even/RB in/IN a/DT bad/JJ economic/JJ climate/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT theory/NN behind/IN it/PRP ,/, anyway/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN these/DT criteria/NNS should/MD be/VB stringently/RB met/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ of/IN great/JJ importance/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO turn/VB the/DT EMU/NNP into/IN a/DT success/NN ,/, now/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Strict/JJ compliance/NN with/IN the/DT Stability/NNP Pact/NNP can/MD thus/RB contribute/VB to/TO a/DT culture/NN of/IN stability/NN within/IN all/DT EMU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Various/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP taken/VBN one-off/JJ measures/NNS to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO meet/VB the/DT criteria/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS budget/NN policy/NN should/MD be/VB strictly/RB supervised/VBN ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT measures/NNS continue/VBP to/TO be/VB taken/VBN in/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN the/DT prescribed/JJ criteria/NNS at/IN all/DT times/NNS ./.

A/DT drop/NN in/IN standards/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB allowed/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN a/DT further/JJ reduction/NN in/IN the/DT burden/NN and/CC reducing/VBG the/DT national/JJ debt/NN should/MD be/VB prioritised/VBN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, we/PRP still/RB have/VBP not/RB managed/VBN to/TO stop/VB passing/VBG on/IN the/DT burden/NN to/TO future/JJ generations/NNS ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- ES/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, many/JJ thanks/NNS ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN his/PRP$ splendid/JJ work/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT subject/NN which/WDT called/VBN for/IN a/DT large/JJ dose/NN of/IN technical/JJ skill/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP Mr/NNP Kn脙/NNP 露/NNP rr/NNP has/VBZ handled/VBN it/PRP with/IN great/JJ precision/NN and/CC professionalism/NN ./.

I/PRP just/RB mention/VBP that/IN to/TO complete/VB the/DT view/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Kn脙/NNP 露/NNP rr/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ speediness/NNS ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN really/RB good/JJ work/NN in/IN a/DT very/RB short/JJ time/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ subject/NN for/IN certain/JJ references/NNS which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN subsequently/RB ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP seeking/VBG with/IN this/DT legislation/NN is/VBZ not/RB to/TO make/VB the/DT statistics/NNS reliable/JJ and/CC comparable/JJ -/: they/PRP already/RB are/VBP -/: but/CC to/TO make/VB them/PRP more/RBR reliable/JJ and/CC more/RBR comparable/JJ ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ taken/VBN its/PRP$ decision/NN so/RB quickly/RB will/MD mean/VB that/IN the/DT March/NNP figures/NNS can/MD already/RB be/VB calculated/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN these/DT new/JJ criteria/NNS ./.

That/DT being/VBG so/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT final/JJ result/NN will/MD be/VB better/JJR ./.

The/DT figures/NNS will/MD be/VB more/RBR reliable/JJ and/CC more/RBR comparable/JJ and/CC I/PRP think/VBP the/DT concerns/NNS some/DT Members/NNS have/VBP raised/VBN about/IN compliance/NN with/IN the/DT stability/NN pact/NN can/MD be/VB better/RBR addressed/VBN ./.

This/DT regulation/NN is/VBZ purely/RB instrumental/JJ ./.

It/PRP does/VBZ deal/NN with/IN the/DT substance/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN some/DT of/IN you/PRP have/VBP raised/VBN ./.

But/CC we/PRP do/VBP need/VBP to/TO think/VB about/IN how/WRB we/PRP deal/VBP with/IN the/DT substance/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.

The/DT stability/NN pact/NN is/VBZ in/IN place/NN and/CC we/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO press/VB ahead/RB with/IN monitoring/VBG compliance/NN by/IN the/DT various/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT results/NNS are/VBP clearly/RB positive/JJ in/IN all/PDT the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS where/WRB we/PRP have/VBP analysed/VBN the/DT position/NN as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN deficit/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP see/VBP no/DT reason/NN to/TO lower/VB our/PRP$ guard/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD press/VB on/RP in/IN that/DT direction/NN because/IN we/PRP know/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ ./.

So/RB ,/, once/RB again/RB -/: and/CC finally/RB -/: I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ help/NN in/IN allowing/VBG us/PRP to/TO measure/VB stability/NN with/IN greater/JJR technical/JJ certainty/NN and/CC better/JJR comparability/NN ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12.00/CD p.m./NN Increasing/VBG penal/JJ sanctions/NNS against/IN counterfeiting/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- all/PDT the/DT more/JJR welcome/JJ for/IN being/VBG so/RB few/JJ in/IN number/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, one/PRP might/MD have/VB thought/VBN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD an/DT unimportant/JJ subject/NN which/WDT was/VBD to/TO be/VB discussed/VBN at/IN this/DT hour/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT definite/JJ and/CC concrete/JJ issue/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN our/PRP$ common/JJ currency/NN ./.

How/WRB many/JJ people/NNS here/RB know/VBP that/IN this/DT currency/NN is/VBZ being/VBG counterfeited/VBN and/CC that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT quite/RB unacceptable/JJ state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ?/.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB permit/VB our/PRP$ common/JJ currency/NN to/TO become/VB weaker/JJR through/IN its/PRP$ being/JJ counterfeited/NN ./.

The/DT ECB/NNP ,/, ECOFIN/NNP ,/, Europol/NNP ,/, OLAF/NNP and/CC the/NNP Commissioner/NNP responsible/JJ for/IN legal/JJ questions/NNS have/VBP therefore/RB realised/VBN that/IN common/JJ countermeasures/NNS must/MD be/VB taken/VBN quickly/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO close/VB the/DT loopholes/NNS left/VBN by/IN the/DT legislation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO forget/VB that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO exchange/VB the/DT old/JJ currencies/NNS for/IN twenty/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT new/JJ currency/NN has/VBZ been/VBN introduced/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ to/TO include/VB these/DT currencies/NNS too/RB in/IN the/DT section/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ programme/NN of/IN measures/NNS which/WDT deals/VBZ with/IN penal/JJ sanctions/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD it/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO see/VB added/VBN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP ought/MD to/TO have/VB given/VBN Parliament/NNP the/DT stipulated/JJ three-month/JJ period/NN within/IN which/WDT to/TO consider/VB ,/, too/RB ,/, the/DT last/JJ document/NN produced/VBD on/IN this/DT matter/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ of/IN how/WRB urgent/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO have/VB these/DT measures/NNS put/VB safely/RB in/IN place/NN ./.

Any/DT country/NN which/WDT began/VBD to/TO make/VB difficulties/NNS would/MD incur/VB a/DT responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT currency/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT country/NN would/MD be/VB accountable/JJ ,/, both/DT morally/RB and/CC economically/RB ,/, if/IN its/PRP$ actions/NNS were/VBD to/TO contribute/VB to/TO a/DT delay/NN ./.

A/DT country/NN which/WDT acted/VBD in/IN that/DT way/NN would/MD bring/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN ill/JJ will/NN upon/IN itself/PRP ./.

On/IN 1/CD January/NNP 2002/CD the/DT euro/NN will/MD be/VB in/IN circulation/NN ./.

The/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP must/MD have/VB the/DT same/JJ protection/NN ,/, a/DT type/NN of/IN protection/NN which/WDT prohibits/VBZ counterfeiting/VBG ,/, not/RB only/RB of/IN currencies/NNS in/IN circulation/NN but/CC also/RB of/IN currencies/NNS which/WDT will/MD be/VB in/IN circulation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN ,/, in/IN time/NN ,/, there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT more/JJR or/CC less/JJR similar-looking/JJ form/NN of/IN protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN in/IN all/DT countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN measures/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN providing/VBG information/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN penal/JJ sanctions/NNS ,/, preventive/JJ measures/NNS and/CC the/DT pooling/NN of/IN experience/NN ./.

These/DT measures/NNS do/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, entail/VB a/DT certain/JJ necessary/JJ harmonisation/NN in/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN the/DT lowest/JJS acceptable/JJ maximum/JJ penalty/NN for/IN currency/NN counterfeiting/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB eight/CD years/NNS '/POS imprisonment/NN ./.

Trading/NN with/IN counterfeit/JJ currencies/NNS and/CC the/DT possession/NN of/IN counterfeiting/JJ equipment/NN will/MD also/RB become/VB criminal/JJ offences/NNS ./.

Quite/VBG simply/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT minimum/JJ level/NN for/IN the/DT maximum/JJ penalty/NN ./.

The/DT denominations/NNS of/IN the/DT euro/NN are/VBP well/RB known/VBN ./.

Modern/NNP computer/NN equipment/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO cause/VB a/DT very/RB great/JJ deal/NN of/IN damage/NN if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB protect/VB ourselves/PRP ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ tabled/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT present/JJ proposal/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN in/IN regard/NN to/TO jurisdiction/NN ,/, the/DT idea/NN being/VBG that/IN a/DT person/NN may/MD only/RB be/VB prosecuted/VBN and/CC sentenced/VBN in/IN the/DT one/CD country/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ crime/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB proposed/VBN sanctions/NNS against/IN companies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN counterfeiting/NN ,/, this/DT being/VBG a/DT measure/NN which/WDT we/PRP would/MD encourage/VB ./.

The/DT new/JJ applicant/NN States/NNS are/VBP also/RB encouraged/VBN to/TO adapt/VB to/TO these/DT regulations/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN two/CD years/NNS for/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO produce/VB this/DT proposal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN the/DT decision/NN should/MD now/RB be/VB taken/VBN in/IN March/NNP ./.

To/TO delay/VB ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB even/RB risk/VB damage/NN to/TO the/DT euro/NN ,/, would/MD be/VB indefensible/JJ ./.

It/PRP would/MD also/RB be/VB a/DT betrayal/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS who/WP will/MD be/VB handling/VBG the/DT new/JJ ,/, unfamiliar/JJ notes/NNS ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ believed/VBN that/IN counterfeiters/NNS will/MD turn/VB their/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO countries/NNS outside/IN the/DT euro/NN zone/NN ,/, where/WRB people/NNS are/VBP less/RBR familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT new/JJ currency/NN ./.

The/DT protective/JJ measures/NNS cover/VBP these/DT countries/NNS too/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT views/NNS expressed/VBN by/IN these/DT countries/NNS have/VBP carried/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN weight/NN ./.

The/DT present/JJ proposal/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB staunchly/RB inclusive/JJ and/CC reciprocal/JJ in/IN character/NN ,/, accepting/VBG responsibility/NN for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN interests/NNS in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT imposes/VBZ obligations/NNS upon/IN others/NNS ./.

The/DT Council/NNP must/MD now/RB convene/VB in/IN March/NNP and/CC make/VB the/DT relevant/JJ decision/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN listening/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, too/RB ,/, those/DT who/WP contributed/VBD to/TO this/DT matter/NN '/POS s/VBZ being/VBG dealt/VBN with/IN swiftly/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG in/IN particular/JJ of/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Party/NNP of/IN European/JJ Socialists/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/RB I/PRP want/VBP to/TO compliment/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Charlotte/NNP Cederschi脙/NNP 露/NNP ld/NNP ,/, on/IN drawing/VBG up/RP this/DT report/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ point/NN of/IN departure/NN for/IN increasing/VBG protection/NN by/IN penal/JJ sanctions/NNS against/IN counterfeiting/VBG in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN ./.

The/DT euro/NN will/MD enter/VB into/IN circulation/NN on/IN 1/CD January/NNP 2002/CD and/CC will/MD become/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ most/RBS important/JJ reserve/NN currencies/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN transport/NN policy/NN and/CC regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP excellent/JJ Commissioners/NNS for/IN both/DT issues/NNS in/IN Mrs/NNP Palacio/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP ,/, yet/CC still/RB you/PRP attach/VBP too/RB little/JJ importance/NN to/TO these/DT areas/NNS ./.

And/CC do/VBP you/PRP know/VB why/WRB ?/.

Just/RB look/VB at/IN transport/NN policy/NN ;/: clearly/RB it/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ for/IN this/DT policy/NN to/TO be/VB drawn/VBN up/RP as/IN a/DT economically/RB and/CC ecologically/RB sensible/JJ policy/NN before/IN the/DT accession/NN of/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ if/IN the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP would/MD listen/VB to/TO what/WP I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, although/IN of/IN course/NN he/PRP has/VBZ no/DT obligation/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

Let/VB me/PRP give/VB you/PRP three/CD examples/NNS ./.

First/JJ :/: we/PRP need/VBP reasonable/JJ deregulation/NN of/IN the/DT railway/NN sector/NN because/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO shift/VB freight/NN from/IN the/DT roads/NNS to/TO the/DT railways/NNS ./.

That/DT makes/VBZ sense/NN from/IN an/DT economic/JJ and/CC an/DT ecological/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

Without/IN deregulation/NN we/PRP will/MD not/RB make/VB any/DT headway/NN with/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ transport/NN policy/NN ./.

The/DT same/JJ applies/VBZ to/TO European/JJ air/NN traffic/NN control/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ citizens/NNS can/MD not/RB understand/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP deregulating/VBG air/NN traffic/NN ,/, but/CC leaving/VBG 15/CD different/JJ sectors/NNS in/IN the/DT skies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP under/IN national/JJ control/NN ,/, which/WDT have/VBP an/DT adverse/JJ economic/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT airlines/NNS and/CC which/WDT pollute/VB the/DT environment/NN ./.

You/PRP still/RB have/VBP not/RB finished/VBN that/DT agenda/NN ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, far/RB too/RB little/JJ is/VBZ said/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ paper/NN about/IN regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

Economic/NNP and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ task/NN of/IN this/DT Community/NNP ./.

If/IN we/PRP fail/VBP to/TO complete/VB it/PRP ,/, citizens/NNS in/IN less/RBR favoured/JJ regions/NNS will/MD dread/VB enlargement/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD show/VB them/PRP that/IN we/PRP intend/VBP to/TO use/VB the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS to/TO help/VB them/PRP join/VB the/DT rich/JJ regions/NNS by/IN promoting/VBG the/DT less/RBR favoured/JJ regions/NNS using/VBG reasonable/JJ means/NNS ./.

Then/RB they/PRP too/RB will/MD be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO really/RB support/VB enlargement/NN and/CC help/VB to/TO achieve/VB it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB manage/VB to/TO create/VB true/JJ solidarity/NN between/IN the/DT rich/JJ and/CC the/DT poor/JJ regions/NNS ,/, then/RB this/DT Union/NNP will/MD be/VB all/PDT the/DT poorer/JJR and/CC it/PRP will/MD not/RB meet/VB with/IN the/DT approval/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNP ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP formulating/VBG new/JJ programmes/NNS does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD neglect/VB those/DT older/JJR programmes/NNS which/WDT are/VBP at/IN implementation/NN stage/NN ./.

From/IN that/DT standpoint/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ useful/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN programme/NN comes/VBZ back/RP to/TO the/DT issues/NNS of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ,/, the/DT common/JJ agricultural/JJ policy/NN ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ fishing/NN ,/, and/CC secondly/NN ,/, the/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP this/DT reference/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT reorganisation/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP currently/RB in/IN progress/NN will/MD not/RB damage/VB the/DT mechanism/NN for/IN monitoring/VBG and/CC implementing/VBG Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ./.

The/DT Agenda/JJ 2000/CD issues/NNS are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, ones/NNS that/WDT relate/VBP to/TO your/PRP$ third/JJ and/CC fourth/JJ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS ,/, the/DT economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ Agenda/NN and/CC a/DT better/JJR quality/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

What/WP your/PRP$ texts/NNS do/VBP not/RB make/VB apparent/JJ is/VBZ the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT these/DT major/JJ ,/, high-minded/JJ objectives/NNS are/VBP compatible/JJ with/IN the/DT resources/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO deploy/VB ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB necessarily/RB mean/VB financial/JJ resources/NNS ./.

The/DT implementation/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD in/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN does/VBZ not/RB ultimately/RB require/VB more/JJR money/NN ./.

There/EX must/MD also/RB be/VB savings/NNS ./.

But/CC what/WP we/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ the/DT analytical/JJ resources/NNS :/: these/DT issues/NNS require/VB the/DT investment/NN of/IN more/JJR intellectual/JJ capital/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO achieve/VB two/CD things/NNS :/: the/DT European/JJ model/NN of/IN multifunctionality/NN in/IN agriculture/NN must/MD be/VB secured/VBN ,/, and/CC this/DT must/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT facilitates/VBZ the/DT liberalisation/NN of/IN world/NN trade/NN in/IN agricultural/JJ products/NNS ,/, mainly/RB to/TO the/DT benefit/NN of/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO combine/VB those/DT aims/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT obvious/JJ way/NN ./.

There/EX may/MD well/RB be/VB contradictions/NNS between/IN the/DT two/CD objectives/NNS and/CC there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO show/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ pointed/VBN out/IN those/DT contradictions/NNS and/CC how/WRB it/PRP proposes/VBZ to/TO deal/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT other/JJ aspect/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP ,/, the/DT aspect/NN of/IN cohesion/NN and/CC regional/JJ development/NN ,/, there/RB we/PRP do/VBP indeed/RB have/VB great/JJ achievements/NNS to/TO point/VB to/TO ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP still/RB less/RBR developed/JJ regions/NNS ,/, particularly/RB island/NN regions/NNS ,/, to/TO which/WDT more/JJR attention/NN should/MD be/VB paid/VBN ./.

As/IN for/IN fishing/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN in/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN to/TO tell/VB us/PRP that/IN the/DT predatory/JJ exploitation/NN of/IN fishing/NN grounds/NNS ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ gone/VBN as/RB far/RB as/RB to/TO wipe/VB out/RP entire/JJ species/NNS of/IN fish/NN ,/, will/MD certainly/RB prove/VB fruitful/JJ in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB these/DT issues/NNS should/MD be/VB approached/VBN with/IN greater/JJR attention/NN and/CC a/DT greater/JJR esprit/FW de/FW finesse/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO start/VB by/IN reinforcing/VBG the/DT caution/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN expressed/VBN by/IN many/JJ colleagues/NNS here/RB in/IN addressing/VBG this/DT five-year/JJ plan/NN ./.

In/IN setting/VBG very/RB ambitious/JJ long-term/JJ goals/NNS we/PRP must/MD not/RB take/VB our/PRP$ eyes/NNS away/RP from/IN the/DT present/NN ./.

That/DT was/VBD a/DT point/NN made/VBN very/RB forcibly/JJ by/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Poettering/NNP ,/, in/IN his/PRP$ opening/NN address/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP must/MD not/RB take/VB on/IN a/DT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN new/JJ tasks/NNS without/IN the/DT basic/JJ foundation/NN for/IN a/DT successful/JJ European/JJ economy/NN being/VBG in/IN place/NN ./.

That/DT foundation/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB the/DT single/JJ market/NN ./.

How/WRB strongly/JJ is/VBZ the/DT single/JJ market/NN established/VBN at/IN the/DT moment/NN ?/.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO remind/VB Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS who/WP are/VBP still/RB here/RB ,/, of/IN the/DT findings/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ own/JJ survey/NN among/IN 3000/CD European/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

Nearly/RB 40/CD %/NN of/IN businesses/NNS in/IN this/DT survey/NN are/VBP still/RB reporting/VBG additional/JJ costs/NNS to/TO render/VB products/NNS or/CC services/NNS compatible/JJ with/IN national/JJ specifications/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ survey/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT classic/JJ symptoms/NNS of/IN continued/VBN obstruction/NN by/IN national/JJ governments/NNS -/: bureaucratic/JJ red-tape/NN blocking/VBG market/NN entry/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ programme/NN shows/VBZ a/DT disturbing/JJ complacency/NN about/IN the/DT completion/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO keep/VB the/DT pressure/NN up/RP in/IN all/DT areas/NNS by/IN removing/VBG further/JJ barriers/NNS ,/, intensifying/VBG pressure/NN on/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS who/WP fail/VBP to/TO implement/VB single/JJ market/NN measures/NNS and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, extending/VBG into/IN crucial/JJ new/JJ areas/NNS like/IN financial/JJ services/NNS ./.

Only/JJ on/IN the/DT strong/JJ foundation/NN of/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN will/MD the/DT agenda/NN of/IN enlargement/VB be/VB successfully/RB achieved/VBN ./.

An/DT enlarged/JJ Europe/NNP must/MD build/VB on/IN the/DT existing/VBG strengths/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT single/JJ market/NN extending/VBG across/IN that/DT enlarged/JJ Union/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT colossal/JJ achievement/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD add/VB to/TO these/DT the/DT future/NN of/IN our/PRP$ social/JJ model/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ group/NN are/VBP so/RB firmly/RB insisting/VBG on/IN the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ people/NNS expect/VBP more/JJR Europe/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB just/RB any/DT Europe/NNP ./.

They/PRP are/VBP expecting/VBG us/PRP not/RB to/TO fall/VB in/RP with/IN globalisation/NN but/CC rather/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN our/PRP$ social/JJ model/NN ,/, to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO organise/VB globalisation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO a/DT political/JJ union/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP favourable/JJ ,/, this/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB achieved/VBN unless/IN it/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN our/PRP$ social/JJ model/NN ,/, on/IN our/PRP$ originality/NN and/CC our/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO better/RBR regulate/VB the/DT business/NN of/IN this/DT world/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Commissioners/VBZ ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB with/IN a/DT quote/NN :/: ``/`` The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO work/VB towards/IN establishing/VBG a/DT European/NNP Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS and/CC draw/VB up/RP proposals/NNS to/TO bring/VB about/IN an/DT ambitious/JJ programme/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ planning/VBG in/IN particular/JJ to/TO develop/VB a/DT genuine/JJ European/JJ policy/NN on/IN asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN ./.

It/PRP wishes/VBZ to/TO boost/VB judicial/JJ assistance/NN and/CC cooperation/NN and/CC to/TO develop/VB an/DT effective/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT fight/NN against/IN all/DT forms/NNS of/IN crime/NN ''/'' ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT entire/JJ programme/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS on/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN internal/JJ security/NN ,/, freedom/NN ,/, citizens/NNS '/POS rights/NNS and/CC judicial/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

A/DT paper/NN this/DT short/JJ is/VBZ a/DT farce/NN ./.

A/DT farce/NN because/IN we/PRP know/VB and/CC appreciate/VB the/DT work/NN of/IN Commissioner/NNP Vitorino/NNP and/CC what/WP we/PRP have/VBP here/RB on/IN paper/NN is/VBZ a/DT blatant/JJ contradiction/NN to/TO how/WRB things/NNS actually/RB stand/VBP ./.

A/DT paper/NN such/JJ as/IN this/DT is/VBZ no/DT basis/NN for/IN a/DT scoreboard/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN extolled/VBN and/CC celebrated/VBN as/IN a/DT huge/JJ achievement/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP all/DT for/IN it/PRP ;/: we/PRP need/VBP a/DT basis/NN for/IN a/DT scoreboard/NN ./.

We/PRP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP want/VBP to/TO hold/VB a/DT serious/JJ discussion/NN about/IN the/DT future/JJ development/NN in/IN this/DT policy/NN area/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN a/DT programme/NN ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN are/VBP minimum/JJ standards/NNS in/IN asylum/NN procedures/NNS so/RB that/IN refugees/NNS can/MD be/VB given/VBN help/VB quickly/RB ,/, and/CC those/DT who/WP are/VBP not/RB fleeing/VBG know/VBP where/WRB they/PRP stand/VBP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP instruments/NNS to/TO prevent/VB abuse/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO develop/VB a/DT Community/NNP immigration/NN policy/NN which/WDT takes/VBZ account/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS capacity/NN to/TO absorb/VB immigrants/NNS and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO extend/VB the/DT operational/JJ powers/NNS of/IN EUROPOL/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN specific/JJ steps/NNS can/MD be/VB taken/VBN to/TO combat/VB organised/JJ crime/NN ./.

We/PRP debate/VB these/DT issues/NNS intensively/RB and/CC seriously/RB and/CC we/PRP should/MD be/VB entitled/VBN to/TO expect/VB likewise/RB from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, even/RB where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ merely/RB submitting/VBG a/DT paper/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, what/WP does/VBZ this/DT statement/NN tell/VB us/PRP about/IN principles/NNS ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB quite/RB legitimate/JJ and/CC even/RB imperative/JJ that/IN we/PRP ask/VBP ourselves/PRP ,/, what/WDT purpose/NN do/VBP the/DT current/JJ common/JJ standards/NNS and/CC rules/NNS serve/VB ?/.

What/WDT good/NN are/VBP the/DT current/JJ way/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP negotiate/VBP and/CC the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP works/VBZ ,/, if/IN they/PRP cause/VBP trade/VBP to/TO increase/VB on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, but/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, they/PRP create/VBP problems/NNS and/CC above/IN all/DT cause/VB this/DT gulf/NN between/IN rich/JJ and/CC poor/JJ countries/NNS to/TO grow/VB ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP said/VBD that/IN we/PRP were/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT strategy/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP outlined/VBD here/RB for/IN the/DT Seattle/NNP negotiations/NNS and/CC for/IN later/JJ ones/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN this/DT strategic/JJ vision/NN but/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB brave/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB demanding/VBG and/CC ensure/VB that/IN social/JJ rights/NNS ,/, environmental/JJ rights/NNS and/CC consumer/NN protection/NN are/VBP incorporated/VBN into/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ negotiations/NNS ./.

Most/RBS importantly/RB though/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD have/VB a/DT brave/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ long-term/JJ vision/NN for/IN reform/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB of/IN the/DT WTO/NNP but/CC also/RB of/IN the/DT ILO/NNP ,/, the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC above/IN all/DT ,/, of/IN the/DT financial/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, specifically/RB the/DT IMF/NNP and/CC the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP prepared/VBN ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB a/DT voice/NN crying/VBG in/IN the/DT wilderness/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN a/DT fishing/NN policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB surprising/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB treat/VB the/DT revision/NN of/IN one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ common/JJ policies/NNS as/IN a/DT strategic/JJ objective/NN for/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN which/WDT must/MD take/VB place/NN in/IN 2002/CD ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN whatsoever/RB that/IN this/DT revision/NN process/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ thing/NN to/TO affect/VB the/DT fishing/NN industry/NN for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT revision/NN process/NN has/VBZ already/RB begun/VBN for/IN many/JJ bodies/NNS and/CC institutions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT in/IN 1998/CD already/RB issued/VBD and/CC adopted/VBD a/DT report/NN pointing/VBG out/RP all/PDT the/DT current/JJ problems/NNS and/CC deficiencies/NNS of/IN the/DT common/JJ fisheries/NNS policy/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP often/RB asked/VBN for/IN a/DT basic/JJ timetable/NN for/IN this/DT revision/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP received/VBN no/DT reply/NN ./.

Less/NNP than/IN two/CD years/NNS is/VBZ not/RB much/JJ time/NN if/IN we/PRP bear/VBP in/IN mind/NN also/RB that/IN the/DT fishing/NN policy/NN is/VBZ anomalous/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT internal/JJ market/NN regulations/NNS and/CC that/IN such/JJ anomalies/NNS should/MD be/VB resolved/VBN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN this/DT reform/NN process/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB that/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ of/IN vital/JJ importance/NN to/TO a/DT very/RB significant/JJ industry/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN in/IN this/DT strategy/NN and/CC these/DT strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO add/VB my/PRP$ congratulations/NNS to/TO Commissioner/NNP Prodi/NNP 's/POS programme/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP one/CD observation/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT criticism/NN ,/, to/TO make/VB regarding/VBG Commissioner/NNP Prodi/NNP 's/POS statement/NN this/DT morning/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/RB weak/JJ on/IN the/DT actual/JJ content/NN of/IN economic/JJ policy/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB take/VB anything/NN for/IN granted/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN how/WRB we/PRP get/VBP the/DT European/JJ economy/NN restructured/VBN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, what/WP is/VBZ social/JJ justice/NN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ without/IN full/JJ employment/NN ?/.

Full/JJ employment/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO generate/VB social/JJ justice/NN for/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ priority/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO focus/VB on/RP ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB one/CD or/CC two/CD initiatives/NNS that/WDT have/VBP already/RB come/VBN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP which/WDT will/MD help/VB us/PRP :/: in/IN particular/JJ Commissioner/NNP Liikanen/NNP 's/POS commitment/NN to/TO having/VBG an/DT innovative/JJ knowledge-driven/JJ economy/NN ./.

Yes/UH ,/, e-Europe/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT future/NN for/IN us/PRP because/IN it/PRP will/MD help/VB us/PRP create/VB new/JJ prosperity/NN and/CC new/JJ jobs/NNS ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP initiatives/NNS now/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT past/NN to/TO support/VB our/PRP$ small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB our/PRP$ Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP for/IN its/PRP$ initiative/NN on/IN having/VBG a/DT charter/NN for/IN micro-businesses/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ important/JJ and/CC something/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB developed/VBN through/IN the/DT Lisbon/NNP Summit/NNP ./.

I/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP Commissioner/NNP Busquin/NNP 's/POS idea/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT common/JJ research/NN area/NN for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Again/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT way/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD help/VB create/VB better/JJR opportunities/NNS for/IN jobs/NNS and/CC for/IN prosperity/NN ./.

You/PRP said/VBD in/IN your/PRP$ summary/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, that/DT liberalisation/NN ,/, competitiveness/NN ,/, keeping/VBG inflation/NN low/JJ ,/, innovation/NN ,/, science/NN and/CC technology/NN are/VBP central/JJ for/IN the/DT future/JJ success/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ economy/NN and/CC creating/VBG jobs/NNS ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB agree/VBP with/IN you/PRP on/IN that/DT ,/, but/CC we/PRP can/MD take/VB nothing/NN for/IN granted/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ still/RB more/JJR we/PRP have/VBP to/TO do/VB ,/, and/CC the/DT Lisbon/NNP Summit/NNP will/MD become/VB part/NN of/IN that/DT ./.

So/RB with/IN those/DT remarks/NNS I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB you/PRP on/IN the/DT programme/NN and/CC wish/VB it/PRP every/DT success/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN two/CD points/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ programme/NN ./.

To/TO me/PRP ,/, this/DT Commission/NNP strategy/NN paper/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS reads/VBZ like/IN a/DT scientific/JJ paper/NN on/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP or/CC a/DT declaration/NN of/IN principle/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB give/VB the/DT impression/NN of/IN being/VBG a/DT real/JJ political/JJ strategy/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

As/IN the/DT spokesperson/NN for/IN cultural/JJ and/CC training/NN policy/NN for/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD have/VB expected/VBN more/RBR in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN agenda/NN from/IN an/DT Italian/JJ President/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP gives/VBZ no/DT soul/NN to/TO Europe/NNP ./.

Culture/NNP and/CC training/NN simply/RB do/VBP not/RB exist/VB in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO create/VB a/DT real/JJ area/NN of/IN training/NN and/CC culture/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Just/RB a/DT few/JJ main/NN points/VBZ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT integration/NN of/IN the/DT policies/NNS of/IN the/DT culture/NN industry/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN of/IN training/NN and/CC culture/NN ;/: they/PRP create/VBP jobs/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN cultural/JJ mainstreaming/NN in/IN all/DT policy/NN areas/NNS ,/, about/IN consolidating/VBG and/CC improving/VBG the/DT European/JJ dimension/NN of/IN training/NN and/CC education/NN syllabuses/NNS and/CC about/IN networking/VBG training/NN and/CC education/NN policies/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP especially/RB lifelong/JJ learning/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ millennium/NN and/CC you/PRP made/VBD no/DT mention/NN whatsoever/RB of/IN the/DT audio-visual/JJ area/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Nor/CC was/VBD any/DT mention/NN made/VBN of/IN information/NN policy/NN and/CC communications/NNS catering/VBG to/TO the/DT needs/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN something/NN is/VBZ missing/VBG from/IN this/DT programme/NN ./.

Truly/RB European/JJ citizenship/NN depends/VBZ on/IN our/PRP$ creating/VBG a/DT real/JJ ,/, visible/JJ area/NN of/IN training/NN and/CC culture/NN ./.

Declarations/NNS of/IN principle/NN are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP an/DT agenda/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB translated/VBN into/IN political/JJ action/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN an/DT ongoing/JJ basis/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP just/RB described/VBN ./.

Madam/VB President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, how/WRB would/MD you/PRP take/VB stock/NN of/IN your/PRP$ policy/NN and/CC work/NN programme/NN ,/, what/WP would/MD your/PRP$ benchmark/NN be/VB ,/, if/IN you/PRP had/VBD to/TO make/VB direct/JJ choices/NNS ?/.

You/PRP have/VBP the/DT fine/JJ ,/, charming/JJ idea/NN that/IN the/DT outcome/NN and/CC the/DT benchmark/NN for/IN your/PRP$ policy/NN and/CC for/IN your/PRP$ five-year/JJ programme/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT elections/NNS ,/, or/CC rather/RB the/DT turnout/NN at/IN the/DT next/JJ European/JJ elections/NNS ./.

When/WRB I/PRP think/VBP that/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO explain/VB your/PRP$ work/NN programme/NN week/NN in/IN ,/, week/NN out/IN to/TO my/PRP$ constituents/NNS ,/, not/RB in/IN the/DT rarefied/JJ atmosphere/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, but/CC on/IN the/DT street/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP ask/VBP myself/PRP ,/, what/WP can/MD I/PRP say/VB ?/.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, what/WP can/MD I/PRP say/VB ;/: what/WP is/VBZ there/RB that/WDT is/VBZ new/JJ ?/.

There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN new/JJ in/IN your/PRP$ work/NN programme/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN 12/CD pages/NNS for/IN five/CD years/NNS and/CC 18/CD pages/NNS for/IN one/CD year/NN '/POS s/JJ work/NN programme/NN ./.

Does/NNP that/DT give/VB me/PRP hope/NN for/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ?/.

No/UH ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB !/VB ./.

In/IN your/PRP$ work/NN programme/NN for/IN 2000/CD you/PRP state/VBP something/NN quite/RB clever/JJ ./.

You/PRP say/VBP that/IN environmental/JJ considerations/NNS must/MD be/VB integrated/VBN into/IN all/DT other/JJ policy/NN areas/NNS ./.

Have/VBP you/PRP done/VBN so/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ;/: have/VBP you/PRP even/RB read/VB your/PRP$ work/NN programme/NN for/IN the/DT year/NN ?/.

No/UH ,/, you/PRP have/VBP not/RB done/VBN so/RB ./.

You/PRP have/VBP not/RB integrated/VBN environmental/JJ policy/NN into/IN enlargement/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ problems/NNS of/IN enlargement/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP not/RB integrated/VBN it/PRP anywhere/RB ./.

You/PRP have/VBP tacked/VBD a/DT few/JJ components/NNS together/RB but/CC you/PRP have/VBP no/DT overall/JJ structure/NN ./.

You/PRP said/VBD earlier/RBR in/IN your/PRP$ speech/NN that/IN a/DT disaster/NN such/JJ as/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT Danube/NNP is/VBZ an/DT example/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN an/DT emergency/NN structure/NN ;/: no/UH ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, we/PRP need/VBP ,/, at/IN long/RB last/RB ,/, to/TO start/VB transposing/VBG legislation/NN and/CC ensuring/VBG that/DT legislation/NN is/VBZ monitored/VBN ./.

You/PRP say/VBP in/IN your/PRP$ five-year/JJ programme/NN that/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP rightly/RB expect/VBP food/NN standards/NNS to/TO be/VB higher/JJR and/CC better/JJR foodstuffs/JJ legislation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, you/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

The/DT foodstuffs/NNS legislation/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS ambitious/JJ in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

Where/WRB it/PRP falls/VBZ short/JJ ,/, what/WP is/VBZ missing/VBG ,/, is/VBZ transposition/VBN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC monitoring/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ time/NN you/PRP took/VBD your/PRP$ job/NN seriously/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN for/IN you/PRP ,/, as/IN President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, to/TO box/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS on/IN the/DT ears/NNS and/CC force/VB them/PRP to/TO do/VB their/PRP$ work/NN and/CC fulfil/VB their/PRP$ duties/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ no/DT good/JJ spending/NN time/NN on/IN hobbies/NNS when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT day/NN '/POS s/VBN work/NN to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

Although/IN the/DT main/JJ achievements/NNS in/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN should/MD be/VB mentioned/VBN ,/, we/PRP must/MD remember/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ still/RB room/NN for/IN progress/NN ./.

The/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP is/VBZ still/RB too/RB limited/JJ and/CC communitisation/NN is/VBZ incomplete/JJ ./.

The/DT unilateral/JJ decision/NN by/IN Belgium/NNP to/TO re-establish/VB border/NN controls/NNS is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ illustration/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT decision/NN to/TO establish/VB a/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS is/VBZ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO predict/VB whether/IN its/PRP$ content/JJ and/CC legal/JJ scope/NN will/MD be/VB restrictive/JJ or/CC symbolic/JJ ,/, including/VBG all/DT people/NNS ,/, whatever/WDT their/PRP$ nationality/NN ,/, or/CC excluding/VBG some/DT ./.

The/DT total/JJ lack/NN of/IN progress/NN in/IN European/JJ citizenship/NN and/CC the/DT political/JJ rights/NNS of/IN all/DT European/JJ residents/NNS is/VBZ to/TO be/VB regretted/VBN ./.

Although/IN action/NN plans/NNS established/VBD by/IN the/DT high-level/JJ working/JJ group/NN aim/NN to/TO limit/VB migratory/JJ flows/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, these/DT plans/NNS do/VBP nothing/NN to/TO improve/VB human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, civil/JJ liberties/NNS and/CC the/DT economic/JJ situation/NN in/IN the/DT countries/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN readmission/NN clauses/NNS are/VBP included/VBN in/IN the/DT cooperation/NN and/CC association/NN agreements/NNS ./.

Yet/CC these/DT represent/VBP a/DT serious/JJ threat/NN to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN `/`` non-refoulement/JJ '/'' -LSB-/NNS no/RB turning/VBG back/RP -RSB-/NNS ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN that/IN these/DT provisions/NNS were/VBD adopted/VBN within/IN the/DT Council/NNP by/IN a/DT procedure/NN without/IN debate/NN and/CC without/IN consulting/VBG Parliament/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT main/JJ concern/NN remains/VBZ .../: -LRB-/-LRB- The/DT President/NNP cut/VBD the/DT speaker/NN off/RP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, esteemed/JJ gentlemen/NNS from/IN Portugal/NNP ,/, especially/RB the/DT Council/NNP representatives/NNS ,/, you/PRP face/VBP great/JJ expectations/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ part/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO give/VB you/PRP an/DT example/NN of/IN one/CD way/NN in/IN which/WDT you/PRP can/MD meet/VB these/DT expectations/NNS relatively/RB quickly/RB in/IN at/IN least/JJS one/CD small/JJ segment/NN ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP to/TO Eurodac/NNP ./.

We/PRP voted/VBD clearly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN this/DT instrument/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN an/DT implementation/NN committee/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB attached/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN just/RB the/DT same/JJ way/NN that/IN a/DT corresponding/JJ database/NN would/MD be/VB ./.

We/PRP were/VBD of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN EURODAC/NNP was/VBD becoming/VBG a/DT reality/NN ./.

Even/RB in/IN Tampere/NNP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN Eurodac/NNP was/VBD becoming/VBG a/DT reality/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT perfect/JJ example/NN of/IN the/DT sort/NN of/IN work/NN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO see/VB ./.

My/PRP$ urgent/JJ request/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Group/NNP is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP do/VBP everything/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Eurodac/NNP is/VBZ implemented/VBN immediately/RB as/IN an/DT instrument/NN to/TO fight/VB asylum/NN abuse/NN and/CC illegality/NN and/CC as/IN an/DT instrument/NN to/TO speed/VB up/RP asylum/NN procedures/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP tell/VBP us/PRP today/NN how/WRB you/PRP wish/VBP to/TO proceed/VB ,/, you/PRP will/MD be/VB doing/VBG us/PRP a/DT great/JJ service/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Ministers/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT 1999/CD harvest/NN of/IN decisions/NNS was/VBD indeed/RB rich/JJ ,/, so/RB much/RB so/RB that/IN it/PRP became/VBD difficult/JJ to/TO gather/VB ,/, i.e./VBG to/TO put/VB those/DT decisions/NNS into/IN practice/NN ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP in/IN particular/JJ to/TO the/DT Council/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT inertia/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN implementing/VBG the/DT decisions/NNS they/PRP had/VBD jointly/RB made/VBN ./.

From/IN what/WP I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB obvious/JJ to/TO you/PRP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ not/RB prepared/JJ to/TO simply/RB play/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN observer/NN ./.

Neither/DT will/MD it/PRP stop/VBP raising/VBG vital/JJ issues/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, how/WRB much/JJ progress/NN are/VBP you/PRP willing/JJ to/TO make/VB and/CC what/WP measures/VBZ ,/, legislative/JJ or/CC otherwise/RB ,/, will/MD you/PRP be/VB taking/VBG to/TO combat/VB the/DT scourge/NN of/IN trafficking/NN in/IN human/JJ beings/NNS ,/, child/NN pornography/NN on/IN the/DT Internet/NN ,/, drugs/NNS ,/, and/CC organised/JJ crime/NN ?/.

Do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO press/VB for/IN a/DT common/JJ policy/NN for/IN asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN ?/.

How/WRB do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO go/VB about/IN integrating/VBG immigrants/NNS into/IN the/DT Community/NNP ,/, reuniting/VBG them/PRP with/IN their/PRP$ families/NNS and/CC recognising/VBG their/PRP$ rights/NNS and/CC duties/NNS on/IN an/DT equal/JJ footing/NN with/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ?/.

In/IN light/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ international/JJ demographic/JJ class/NN portrayed/NN by/IN experts/NNS at/IN the/DT UN/NNP ,/, is/VBZ it/PRP not/RB about/RB time/NN you/PRP abandoned/VBD your/PRP$ traditional/JJ ,/, conservative/JJ views/NNS on/IN refugees/NNS and/CC immigrants/NNS ?/.

I/PRP have/VBP great/JJ expectations/NNS for/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP much/RB ,/, indeed/RB most/JJS ,/, of/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB courts/NNS in/IN Karlsruhe/NNP ,/, London/NNP ,/, Lisbon/NNP ,/, Dublin/NNP and/CC Edinburgh/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD make/VB sure/JJ that/IN what/WP we/PRP do/VBP makes/VBZ clear/JJ sense/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB generate/VB a/DT confusion/NN and/CC conflict/NN of/IN jurisdictions/NNS about/IN rights/NNS ,/, for/IN that/WDT would/MD be/VB the/DT enemy/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, justice/NN and/CC security/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP ,/, in/IN short/JJ ,/, to/TO have/VB and/CC to/TO sustain/VB the/DT highest/RBS possible/JJ common/JJ standards/NNS and/CC to/TO find/VB ways/NNS of/IN securing/VBG these/DT ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO see/VB these/DT degenerate/NN into/IN over-centralisation/NN ,/, chaos/NN and/CC confusion/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD very/RB quickly/RB like/VB to/TO make/VB one/CD point/NN ./.

Various/JJ Members/NNS raised/VBD questions/NNS about/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

What/WDT steps/NNS will/MD the/DT Council/NNP take/VB to/TO prevent/VB nuclear/JJ accidents/NNS and/CC the/DT proliferation/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS in/IN a/DT country/NN that/WDT wishes/VBZ to/TO join/VB the/DT EU/NN but/CC spends/VBZ enormous/JJ amounts/NNS on/IN nuclear/JJ programmes/NNS while/IN receiving/VBG financial/JJ aid/NN from/IN the/DT EU/NNP budget/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP wishes/VBZ to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN Turkey/NNP is/VBZ a/DT signatory/NN to/TO the/DT Convention/NN on/IN Nuclear/NNP Safety/NNP ,/, the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN which/WDT should/MD allay/VB the/DT fears/NNS expressed/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Souladakis/NNPS ./.

The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT convention/NN ,/, which/WDT came/VBD into/IN force/NN on/IN 24/CD October/NNP 1996/CD ,/, is/VBZ precisely/RB to/TO achieve/VB and/CC maintain/VB a/DT high/JJ standard/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ safety/NN at/IN world/NN level/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN national/JJ measures/NNS and/CC through/IN international/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

It/PRP further/RB aims/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN nuclear/JJ installations/NNS are/VBP equipped/VBN with/IN continuing/VBG protection/NN against/IN potential/JJ radiological/JJ risks/NNS ,/, so/CC as/IN to/TO protect/VB individuals/NNS ,/, society/NN at/IN large/JJ and/CC the/DT environment/NN against/IN the/DT harmful/JJ effects/NNS of/IN the/DT ionising/VBG radiation/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB emitted/VBN by/IN such/JJ installations/NNS ./.

The/DT convention/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP will/MD be/VB aware/JJ ,/, also/RB covers/VBZ the/DT prevention/NN of/IN accidents/NNS which/WDT have/VBP radiological/JJ effects/NNS and/CC the/DT limitation/NN of/IN such/JJ effects/NNS when/WRB incidents/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN occur/VBP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ answer/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO add/VB the/DT following/NN ./.

Turkey/NNP is/VBZ only/RB looking/VBG to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ energy/NN potential/NN by/IN 2/CD %/NN with/IN this/DT unit/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, rumour/NN has/VBZ it/PRP that/IN it/PRP plans/VBZ to/TO buy/VB Candu/NNP reactors/NNS of/IN the/DT type/NN acquired/VBN by/IN Pakistan/NNP and/CC India/NNP which/WDT were/VBD used/VBN for/IN nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT issue/NN requires/VBZ closer/JJR examination/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT sensitive/JJ situation/NN in/IN the/DT Caucasus/NNP region/NN could/MD heighten/VB people/NNS '/POS s/JJ suspicions/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT safety/NN of/IN these/DT plants/NNS ./.

In/IN areas/NNS of/IN high/JJ seismic/JJ risk/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ just/RB to/TO have/VB secure/JJ ,/, earthquake-proof/JJ buildings/NNS ./.

Speaking/VBG as/IN an/DT engineer/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN we/PRP carry/VBP out/RP tests/NNS to/TO investigate/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN certain/JJ risk/NN factors/NNS in/IN extreme/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB carry/VB out/RP tests/NNS on/IN nuclear/JJ plants/NNS which/WDT are/VBP in/IN operation/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB not/RB possible/JJ ./.

With/IN this/DT in/IN mind/NN ,/, it/PRP goes/VBZ without/IN saying/VBG that/IN nuclear/JJ plants/NNS a/FW priori/FW should/MD not/RB be/VB built/VBN in/IN areas/NNS prone/JJ to/TO earthquakes/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, and/CC because/IN Turkey/NNP is/VBZ situated/VBN on/IN the/DT periphery/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB helping/VBG it/PRP to/TO become/VB a/DT more/RBR secure/JJ ,/, peaceful/JJ and/CC cooperative/JJ country/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ our/PRP$ role/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT point/NN of/IN my/PRP$ question/NN ./.

I/PRP recognise/VBP the/DT relevance/NN of/IN the/DT arguments/NNS that/IN Mr/NNP Souladakis/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT highly/RB sensitive/JJ issue/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB evident/JJ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB only/RB affect/VB Turkey/NNP ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN that/WDT country/NN '/POS s/VBZ proximity/JJ to/TO the/DT existing/VBG territory/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP also/RB affects/VBZ other/JJ states/NNS neighbouring/VBG the/DT EU/NNP with/IN which/WDT we/PRP maintain/VBP relations/NNS ./.

We/PRP understand/VBP your/PRP$ concerns/NNS and/CC will/MD certainly/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN them/PRP ,/, particularly/RB during/IN the/DT discussions/NNS that/IN we/PRP will/MD be/VB having/VBG with/IN Turkey/CD to/TO define/VB that/DT country/NN '/POS s/CD own/JJ pre-accession/JJ strategy/NN agenda/NN ./.

This/DT question/NN will/MD naturally/RB be/VB one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ key/JJ concerns/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP will/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO take/VB this/DT into/IN account/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP and/CC thank/VB you/PRP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ the/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB nice/JJ man/NN and/CC is/VBZ very/RB kind/JJ to/TO his/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC his/PRP$ children/NNS and/CC his/PRP$ dog/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, forgive/VB me/PRP if/IN I/PRP am/VBP a/DT little/JJ sceptical/NN of/IN the/DT reply/NN you/PRP have/VBP just/RB given/VBN me/PRP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN the/DT statements/NNS made/VBD within/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT votes/NNS are/VBP available/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN immediately/RB ./.

Will/NNP you/PRP please/VB therefore/RB undertake/VB ,/, before/IN the/DT next/JJ plenary/NN in/IN February/NNP ,/, to/TO write/VB and/CC tell/VB me/PRP where/WRB I/PRP can/MD find/VB this/DT information/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT public/NN ,/, immediately/RB the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ passed/VBN legislation/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN waiting/VBG for/IN it/PRP to/TO come/VB out/RP weeks/NNS later/RB on/IN a/DT press/NN release/NN list/NN ./.

Will/MD you/PRP write/VB to/TO me/PRP before/IN the/DT next/JJ plenary/NN with/IN that/DT information/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP Newton/NNP Dunn/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD first/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB appreciate/VB the/DT kind/NN of/IN personal/JJ comments/NNS with/IN which/WDT you/PRP started/VBD your/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ if/IN you/PRP could/MD refrain/VB from/IN making/VBG such/JJ comments/NNS in/IN future/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB ,/, Mr/NNP Newton/NNP Dunn/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN process/NN for/IN transparency/NN are/VBP quite/RB obvious/JJ to/TO us/PRP and/CC we/PRP consider/VBP them/PRP to/TO be/VB unquestionable/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP no/DT problem/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Newton/NNP Dunn/NNP ,/, in/IN repeating/VBG this/DT information/NN to/TO you/PRP in/IN writing/VBG ,/, but/CC we/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO go/VB any/DT further/RBR than/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN here/RB ,/, because/IN that/DT meets/VBZ the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP exactly/RB ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB consider/VBP that/IN the/DT General/NNP Secretariat/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ at/IN present/JJ making/VBG available/JJ to/TO the/DT public/JJ all/RB essential/JJ information/NN regarding/VBG the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ functions/NNS as/IN a/DT legislative/JJ body/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB that/IN the/DT Council/NNP tried/VBD to/TO answer/VB my/PRP$ question/NN ./.

I/PRP did/VBD not/RB ask/VB what/WP the/DT Council/NNP thought/VBD of/IN the/DT proposal/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ still/RB not/RB tabled/VBN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, my/PRP$ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT interpretation/NN in/IN principle/NN of/IN Article/NNP 255/NNP of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ./.

Does/NNP this/DT permit/VB legislation/NN also/RB to/TO be/VB passed/VBN concerning/VBG national/JJ laws/NNS on/IN transparency/NN and/CC not/RB only/RB in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT three/CD institutions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP referred/VBN to/TO there/RB ?/.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO have/VB an/DT answer/NN to/TO that/DT question/NN ./.

Does/NNP the/DT Council/NNP consider/VB that/IN ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN Article/NNP 255/NNP of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, national/JJ legislation/NN on/IN transparency/NN can/MD be/VB regulated/VBN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB legislation/NN not/RB relating/VBG to/TO the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS ?/.

Mr/NNP Sj脙/NNP 露/NNP stedt/NNP ,/, the/DT answer/NN that/IN I/PRP gave/VBD was/VBD the/DT only/JJ answer/NN possible/JJ ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN any/DT interpretation/NN of/IN Article/NNP 255/NNP of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP must/MD also/RB be/VB linked/VBN to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP no/DT concrete/JJ proposals/NNS which/WDT would/MD allow/VB us/PRP to/TO make/VB adjustments/NNS under/IN this/DT Article/NNP ,/, and/CC unless/IN there/EX is/VBZ such/PDT a/DT proposal/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB move/VB forward/RB on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, Article/NNP 255/NNP does/VBZ not/RB ,/, at/IN first/JJ sight/NN ,/, allow/VB work/NN to/TO be/VB done/VBN on/IN any/DT basis/NN that/WDT could/MD affect/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP ,/, up/RB to/TO a/DT point/NN ,/, concerned/JJ about/RB how/WRB the/DT Council/NNP will/MD fight/VB for/IN the/DT principles/NNS contained/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP and/CC whose/WP$ purpose/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN citizens/NNS have/VBP a/DT better/JJR opportunity/NN to/TO participate/VB in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN ./.

Does/VBZ not/RB the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ representative/NN think/VB that/IN this/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO participate/VB in/IN the/DT democratic/JJ decision-making/JJ process/NN ?/.

Mrs/NNP Frahm/NNP ,/, the/DT question/NN that/IN you/PRP raised/VBD is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ and/CC we/PRP discussed/VBD it/PRP at/IN great/JJ length/NN during/IN the/DT last/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN transparency/NN does/VBZ not/RB only/RB apply/VB from/IN the/DT Community/NNP institutions/NNS ``/`` outwards/NNS ''/'' ,/, it/PRP also/RB applies/VBZ between/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ./.

By/IN this/DT I/PRP mean/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT form/NN and/CC procedure/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP institutions/NNS '/POS workings/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB accessible/JJ to/TO the/DT other/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB only/RB as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ relationship/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ relationship/NN with/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Genuine/JJ transparency/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS '/POS workings/NNS and/CC the/DT way/NN they/PRP are/VBP presented/VBN throughout/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ issue/NN and/CC one/CD which/WDT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB studied/VBN again/RB ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP no/DT doubts/NNS about/IN this/DT and/CC we/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT Members/NNS taking/VBG part/NN in/IN this/DT preparatory/JJ group/NN will/MD have/VB an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO raise/VB this/DT issue/NN again/RB ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN should/MD make/VB provision/NN for/IN greater/JJR transparency/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT various/JJ institutions/NNS function/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ always/RB room/NN for/IN improvement/NN in/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

For/IN our/PRP$ part/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO study/VB any/DT proposals/NNS made/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ question/NN indeed/RB which/WDT Jonas/NNP Sj脙/NNP 露/NNP stedt/NN and/CC others/NNS have/VBP asked/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT principle/NN of/IN transparency/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP which/WDT strengthens/VBZ democracy/NN and/CC ensures/VBZ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT worthwhile/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN citizens/NNS ,/, decision/NN makers/NNS and/CC authorities/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP very/RB anxious/JJ indeed/RB that/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, too/RB ,/, should/MD move/VB in/IN this/DT direction/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ also/RB stated/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ./.

We/PRP can/MD now/RB see/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ perhaps/RB some/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT warning/NN from/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO ask/VB the/DT Council/NN if/IN it/PRP understands/VBZ this/DT warning/NN ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN what/WP we/PRP have/VBP now/RB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT working/VBG documents/NNS from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP listened/VBD very/RB carefully/RB to/TO what/WP Mr/NNP Seixas/NNP da/NNP Costa/NNP had/VBD to/TO say/VB on/IN transparency/NN and/CC the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ concern/NN is/VBZ ,/, if/IN I/PRP have/VBP understood/VBN Mr/NNP Seixas/NNP da/NNP Costa/NNP correctly/RB on/IN the/DT interesting/JJ points/NNS he/PRP made/VBD as/IN regards/VBZ transparency/NN and/CC the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, whether/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP will/MD take/VB on/IN the/DT commitment/NN to/TO tackle/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN widening/VBG the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, examining/VBG the/DT issue/NN of/IN transparency/NN in/IN the/DT ways/NNS the/DT institutions/NNS operate/VBP should/MD never/RB be/VB hidden/VBN away/RP under/IN any/DT old/JJ heading/NN or/CC confined/VBN to/TO some/DT lobby/NN or/CC other/JJ -/: though/IN I/PRP know/VBP full/JJ well/RB the/DT importance/NN of/IN these/DT lobbies/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD have/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ heading/NN in/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, which/WDT would/MD mean/VB widening/VBG the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Dimitrakopoulos/NNP ,/, transparency/RB is/VBZ naturally/RB an/DT issue/NN of/IN concern/NN to/TO the/DT institutions/NNS ./.

This/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP will/MD ,/, at/IN the/DT outset/NN ,/, concentrate/VB on/IN improving/VBG the/DT way/NN the/DT institutions/NNS operate/VBP ,/, particularly/RB taking/VBG account/NN of/IN the/DT desire/NN we/PRP all/DT share/NN for/IN them/PRP specifically/RB to/TO become/VB more/RBR democratic/JJ ,/, more/RBR transparent/JJ and/CC more/RBR efficient/JJ ./.

All/DT of/IN this/DT must/MD nevertheless/RB be/VB done/VBN whilst/IN respecting/VBG a/DT broad/JJ framework/NN -/: that/DT of/IN the/DT overall/JJ acceptability/NN of/IN any/DT solutions/NNS we/PRP may/MD devise/VB to/TO achieve/VB these/DT three/CD aims/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN transparency/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT permanent/JJ fixture/NN on/IN the/DT European/JJ agenda/NN and/CC it/PRP will/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, feature/VB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN this/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN which/WDT the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP will/MD keep/VB before/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT preparatory/JJ group/NN for/IN the/DT conference/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD therefore/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO count/VB on/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, who/WP will/MD surely/RB rally/VB behind/IN this/DT proposal/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD then/RB see/VB ,/, at/IN ministerial/JJ level/NN ,/, how/WRB we/PRP can/MD follow/VB this/DT up/RP ./.

It/PRP should/MD nevertheless/RB be/VB noted/VBN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP just/RB concluded/VBN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD approved/VBN last/JJ May/NNP ,/, and/CC that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT raft/NN of/IN implementing/VBG measures/NNS on/IN transparency/NN which/WDT are/VBP still/RB in/IN progress/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ whether/IN it/PRP is/VBZ premature/JJ or/CC not/RB to/TO start/VB a/DT new/JJ initiative/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN transparency/NN ./.

My/PRP$ feeling/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN everything/NN ,/, this/DT issue/NN will/MD always/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT public/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB concerned/VBN about/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ linked/VBN with/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS accountable/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, they/PRP will/MD be/VB ./.

We/PRP shall/MD try/VB to/TO achieve/VB a/DT consensus/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

For/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP how/WRB long/RB it/PRP takes/VBZ a/DT tree/NN to/TO grow/VB ./.

The/DT calculations/NNS are/VBP in/IN decades/NNS rather/RB than/IN years/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT forestry/NN industry/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB just/RB about/IN timber/NN production/NN ,/, for/IN barrier/NN woodland/VBN and/CC woodland/VBN that/IN acts/NNS as/IN a/DT shield/NN against/IN avalanches/NNS also/RB constitute/VBP an/DT important/JJ factor/NN in/IN certain/JJ regions/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB very/RB proud/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT skilled/JJ Austrian/JJ forestry/NN workers/NNS are/VBP also/RB prepared/JJ .../: -LRB-/-LRB- The/DT President/NNP cut/VBD the/DT speaker/NN off/RP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP extend/VBP our/PRP$ deepest/JJS sympathy/NN to/TO all/DT of/IN those/DT who/WP were/VBD affected/VBN by/IN the/DT storms/NNS ./.

Sometimes/RB within/IN the/DT Community/NNP we/PRP do/VBP not/RB actually/RB have/VB an/DT awareness/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ./.

We/PRP had/VBD very/RB little/JJ coverage/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP of/IN the/DT tanker/NN that/WDT sank/VBD ./.

I/PRP was/VBD asked/VBN to/TO highlight/VB the/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT storms/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP ./.

We/PRP had/VBD high/JJ winds/NNS and/CC unprecedented/JJ ,/, prolonged/JJ rainfall/NNS which/WDT ,/, adding/VBG to/TO existing/VBG difficulties/NNS ,/, resulted/VBD in/IN thousands/NNS of/IN acres/NNS being/VBG submerged/VBN ,/, sometimes/RB ,/, in/IN up/IN to/TO 15/CD feet/NNS of/IN water/NN ./.

We/PRP experienced/VBD the/DT human/JJ misery/NN of/IN flooded/JJ homes/NNS and/CC farms/NNS ,/, no/DT sanitation/NN ,/, no/DT drinking/NN water/NN and/CC the/DT environmental/JJ disasters/NNS of/IN E.coli-infected/JJ water/NN ./.

So/IN I/PRP ask/VBP that/IN Ireland/NNP be/VB remembered/VBN in/IN this/DT particular/JJ case/NN ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP and/CC support/VBP him/PRP very/RB much/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ European/JJ protection/NN force/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP second/RB all/PDT those/DT who/WP expressed/VBD their/PRP$ solidarity/NN with/IN the/DT storm/NN victims/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB again/RB to/TO the/DT impact/NN on/IN the/DT forestry/NN industry/NN throughout/IN Europe/NNP ./.

For/IN the/DT storms/NNS will/MD have/VB major/JJ implications/NNS for/IN the/DT forestry/NN industry/NN in/IN all/DT areas/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP need/VBP ,/, in/IN the/DT long-term/JJ ,/, to/TO give/VB thought/VBN to/TO how/WRB problems/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN future/NN ./.

We/PRP certainly/RB do/VBP not/RB want/VB market/NN organisation/NN for/IN forests/NNS ,/, but/CC maybe/RB we/PRP should/MD set/VB up/RP a/DT system/NN ,/, perhaps/RB in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT private/JJ insurance/NN sector/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO mitigate/VB the/DT implications/NNS for/IN the/DT victims/NNS in/IN some/DT way/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD expect/VB there/EX to/TO be/VB repeat/NN performances/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN major/JJ disaster/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

As/IN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN here/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP indications/NNS -/: no/DT proof/NN ,/, but/CC clear/JJ indications/NNS -/: that/IN the/DT increase/NN in/IN storms/NNS world-wide/RB has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT climate/NN catastrophe/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, an/DT exception/NN should/MD certainly/RB be/VB made/VBN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Shell/NNP and/CC BP/NNP ,/, for/IN they/PRP have/VBP changed/VBN policy/NN and/CC do/VBP not/RB just/RB base/VB their/PRP$ sales/NNS on/IN fossil/JJ fuels/NNS which/WDT are/VBP damaging/JJ to/TO the/DT climate/NN ,/, rather/RB they/PRP also/RB invest/VBP in/IN forms/NNS of/IN energy/NN that/WDT have/VBP future/JJ viability/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN seven/CD motions/NNS for/IN resolutions/NNS tabled/VBN pursuant/JJ to/TO Rule/NNP 37/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD be/VB taken/VBN at/IN noon/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP ./.

Food/NNP safety/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT communication/NN on/IN food/NN safety/NN and/CC a/DT statement/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ to/TO take/VB this/DT first/JJ available/JJ opportunity/NN of/IN outlining/VBG to/TO Parliament/NNP the/DT main/JJ lines/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN ,/, adopted/VBD on/IN Wednesday/NNP last/JJ ,/, 12/CD January/NNP ,/, in/IN association/NN with/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Liikanen/NNP ./.

At/IN my/PRP$ hearing/NN last/JJ September/NNP ,/, I/PRP promised/VBD speedy/JJ delivery/NN of/IN this/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO deliver/VB so/RB quickly/RB ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP represents/VBZ three/CD to/TO four/CD months/NNS of/IN intensive/JJ work/NN since/IN the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP was/VBD appointed/VBN last/JJ September/NNP ./.

It/PRP takes/VBZ on/IN board/NN the/DT extensive/JJ consultations/NNS of/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS since/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS Green/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN law/NN was/VBD published/VBN ./.

Equally/RB it/PRP reflects/VBZ our/PRP$ experiences/NNS of/IN recent/JJ food/NN alerts/NNS in/IN such/JJ areas/NNS as/IN dioxin/NN and/CC sludge/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT BSE/NNP crisis/NN ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP also/RB reflects/VBZ the/DT concerns/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP outlined/VBN to/TO both/DT President/NNP Prodi/NNP and/CC myself/PRP on/IN the/DT numerous/JJ occasions/NNS we/PRP have/VBP debated/VBN food/NN safety/NN in/IN this/DT House/NNP since/IN the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD appointed/VBN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB need/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN consumer/NN confidence/NN in/IN Europe/NNP 's/POS food/NN safety/NN regime/NN has/VBZ been/VBN badly/RB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT crises/NNS and/CC alerts/NNS of/IN recent/JJ years/NNS and/CC months/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ fully/RB committed/JJ to/TO restoring/VBG that/DT confidence/NN by/IN putting/VBG in/IN place/NN the/DT most/RBS up-to-date/JJ and/CC effective/JJ food/NN safety/NN regime/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

When/WRB I/PRP launched/VBD the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP last/JJ week/NN I/PRP said/VBD that/IN the/DT shopping/NN trolley/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS potent/JJ weapons/NNS on/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN the/DT earth/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS discerning/JJ decisions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN by/IN the/DT consumers/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

If/IN their/PRP$ confidence/NN is/VBZ damaged/VBN this/DT is/VBZ reflected/VBN in/IN shopping/NN decisions/NNS ./.

This/DT in/IN turn/NN has/VBZ a/DT dramatic/JJ effect/NN on/IN farmers/NNS ,/, producers/NNS and/CC industry/NN generally/RB ./.

In/IN an/DT industry/NN worth/JJ some/DT EUR/$ 600/CD billion/CD annually/RB ,/, even/RB a/DT slight/JJ dip/NN in/IN confidence/NN levels/NNS can/MD have/VB significant/JJ effects/NNS ./.

Between/IN the/DT agro-food/JJ sector/NN and/CC the/DT farming/NN sector/NN there/EX are/VBP over/IN 10/CD million/CD employees/NNS ./.

High/JJ levels/NNS of/IN confidence/NN are/VBP necessary/JJ to/TO boost/VB job/NN numbers/NNS and/CC competitiveness/NN ./.

This/DT crisis/NN of/IN confidence/NN has/VBZ also/RB had/VBN the/DT unfortunate/JJ but/CC inevitable/JJ effect/NN of/IN eroding/VBG the/DT trust/NN of/IN consumers/NNS in/IN the/DT systems/NNS and/CC institutions/NNS at/IN national/JJ and/CC European/JJ level/NN that/WDT should/MD monitor/VB and/CC assure/VB the/DT highest/JJS standards/NNS of/IN food/NN safety/NN ./.

In/IN saying/VBG all/DT of/IN this/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN Europe/NNP nevertheless/RB has/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS food/NN industries/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC also/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT safest/JJS food/NN control/NN systems/NNS ./.

The/DT challenge/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB the/DT system/NN the/DT very/RB best/RB ./.

The/DT overall/JJ objective/NN therefore/RB of/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN is/VBZ to/TO put/VB in/IN place/NN the/DT necessary/JJ legislation/NN and/CC structures/NNS that/WDT will/MD guarantee/VB the/DT highest/JJS possible/JJ level/NN of/IN health/NN protection/NN for/IN consumers/NNS arising/VBG from/IN the/DT consumption/NN of/IN food/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP setting/VBG out/RP a/DT challenging/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ agenda/NN for/IN change/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD need/VB the/DT full/JJ support/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO achieve/VB our/PRP$ ambitions/NNS on/IN schedule/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD also/RB need/VB the/DT fullest/JJS support/NN from/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC other/JJ key/NN stakeholders/NNS ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN outlines/VBZ a/DT comprehensive/JJ range/NN of/IN actions/NNS needed/VBN to/TO complement/VB and/CC modernise/VB existing/VBG EU/NN food/NN legislation/NN ./.

All/DT of/IN these/DT measures/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO make/VB it/PRP more/RBR coherent/JJ ,/, understandable/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO promote/VB better/JJR enforcement/NN of/IN that/DT legislation/NN and/CC to/TO provide/VB greater/JJR transparency/NN to/TO consumers/NNS ./.

The/DT detailed/JJ action/NN plan/NN on/IN food/NN safety/NN in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP sets/VBZ a/DT precise/JJ timetable/NN for/IN action/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD years/NNS ./.

Over/IN 80/CD measures/NNS are/VBP envisaged/JJ ./.

Our/PRP$ objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO put/VB in/IN place/NN a/DT coherent/JJ and/CC up-to-date/JJ body/NN of/IN food/NN law/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2002/CD ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB envisaging/VBG the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ food/NN authority/NN by/IN 2002/CD as/IN an/DT essential/JJ complement/NN to/TO the/DT new/JJ food/NN safety/NN regime/NN ./.

This/DT idea/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT focus/NN of/IN much/JJ scrutiny/NN and/CC debate/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ already/RB attracted/VBN much/JJ comment/NN ,/, including/VBG reactions/NNS from/IN Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT chapter/NN of/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP devoted/VBN to/TO the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ food/NN authority/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB designed/VBN to/TO elicit/VB views/NNS and/CC comments/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP seeking/VBG views/NNS by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN April/NNP on/IN what/WP we/PRP envisage/VBP ./.

I/PRP will/MD return/VB to/TO this/DT process/NN of/IN consultation/NN in/IN a/DT few/JJ moments/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN major/JJ structural/JJ change/NN is/VBZ required/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ system/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT twin/JJ objectives/NNS of/IN assuring/VBG the/DT highest/JJS standard/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN and/CC restoring/VBG consumer/NN confidence/NN ./.

Why/WRB should/MD a/DT European/JJ food/NN authority/NN be/VB an/DT essential/JJ part/NN of/IN that/DT structure/NN of/IN change/NN ?/.

The/DT first/JJ key/JJ concern/NN is/VBZ independence/NN ./.

Key/NN stakeholders/NNS ,/, including/VBG consumers/NNS ,/, are/VBP seeking/VBG a/DT system/NN that/WDT is/VBZ independent/JJ and/CC perceived/VBN to/TO be/VB independent/JJ of/IN all/DT vested/VBN interests/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB ensure/VB excellence/JJ and/CC transparency/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP made/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN progress/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS since/IN the/DT reformed/JJ system/NN of/IN scientific/JJ advice/NN was/VBD adopted/VBN as/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN the/DT BSE/NNP crisis/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD go/VB further/RBR ./.

We/PRP must/MD create/VB a/DT permanent/JJ and/CC truly/RB independent/JJ ,/, excellent/JJ and/CC transparent/JJ system/NN of/IN risk/NN assessment/NN ./.

The/DT key/JJ task/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN will/MD be/VB risk/NN assessment/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN ./.

We/PRP envisage/VBP that/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT existing/JJ five/CD Scientific/NNP Committees/NNS devoted/VBN to/TO food/NN safety/NN will/MD be/VB transferred/VBN to/TO the/DT authority/NN ./.

They/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB transferred/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ present/JJ form/NN or/CC structure/NN -/: this/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN on/IN which/WDT we/PRP will/MD elicit/VB views/NNS before/IN making/VBG our/PRP$ definitive/JJ proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT authority/NN 's/POS establishment/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, if/IN we/PRP were/VBD merely/RB to/TO propose/VB a/DT simple/JJ moving/NN of/IN deckchairs/NNS ,/, this/DT would/MD clearly/RB not/RB be/VB enough/JJ ./.

As/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP makes/VBZ clear/JJ ,/, the/DT new/JJ authority/NN must/MD be/VB a/DT value-added/JJ structure/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT view/NN that/IN the/DT existing/VBG system/NN of/IN scientific/JJ advice/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB strengthened/VBN ./.

Within/IN the/DT authority/NN I/PRP envisage/VBP much/RB stronger/JJR scientific/JJ and/CC other/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT independent/JJ scientists/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP also/RB envisaging/VBG that/IN the/DT authority/NN will/MD be/VB much/RB more/RBR proactive/JJ than/IN our/PRP$ current/JJ regime/NN -/: anticipate/VBP rather/RB than/IN react/VBP ,/, identify/VB issues/NNS before/IN they/PRP become/VBP crises/NNS ./.

This/DT proactive/JJ approach/NN should/MD become/VB the/DT hallmark/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

To/TO be/VB proactive/JJ the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP identifies/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN new/JJ areas/NNS that/WDT would/MD be/VB embraced/VBN by/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

These/DT include/VBP a/DT comprehensive/JJ information/NN gathering/NN and/CC surveillance/NN function/NN ,/, the/DT coordination/NN of/IN scientific/JJ information/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, and/CC building/VBG up/RP strong/JJ networks/NNS with/IN food/NN safety/NN agencies/NNS and/CC bodies/NNS in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

As/IN part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ remit/NN we/PRP also/RB envisage/VB the/DT authority/NN operating/VBG an/DT enhanced/JJ rapid/JJ alert/NN system/NN for/IN food/NN and/CC feed/NN concerns/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ neither/DT appropriate/JJ nor/CC feasible/JJ to/TO devolve/VB risk/NN management/NN power/NN to/TO the/DT authority/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN decisions/NNS in/IN the/DT risk/NN management/NN area/NN should/MD properly/RB remain/VB the/DT preserve/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Parliament/NNP and/CC Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP make/VBP no/DT apology/NN for/IN this/DT approach/NN ;/: I/PRP firmly/RB believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT correct/JJ one/NN ./.

Certainly/RB there/EX are/VBP those/DT who/WP would/MD argue/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD give/VB law-making/NNS powers/NNS to/TO such/PDT an/DT authority/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB accept/VB those/DT views/NNS and/CC reject/VB them/PRP with/IN some/DT degree/NN of/IN passion/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD only/RB last/JJ year/NN that/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP was/VBD amended/VBN to/TO give/VB Parliament/NNP a/DT much/RB greater/JJR role/NN in/IN the/DT legislative/JJ process/NN ./.

To/TO give/VB such/PDT a/DT role/NN to/TO an/DT authority/NN at/IN this/DT stage/NN would/MD be/VB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, a/DT retrograde/JJ step/NN and/CC represent/VB a/DT dilution/NN of/IN democratic/JJ accountability/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD be/VB very/RB interested/JJ to/TO hear/VB the/DT views/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP itself/PRP in/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT matter/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB those/DT who/WP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD effectively/RB ignore/VB the/DT advice/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ authority/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB reject/VBP this/DT line/NN of/IN argument/NN ./.

How/WRB could/MD a/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Protection/NNP reject/VB or/CC ignore/VB well-founded/JJ independent/JJ scientific/JJ advice/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO food/NN safety/NN ?/.

Would/MD this/DT be/VB in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP 's/POS citizens/NNS ?/.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, most/JJS definitely/RB not/RB unless/IN such/JJ rejection/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ arguments/NNS were/VBD soundly/RB based/VBN ,/, rationally/RB argued/VBD and/CC fully/RB justified/VBN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO envisage/VB such/PDT a/DT situation/NN evolving/VBG ./.

I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP here/RB today/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN exercising/VBG its/PRP$ risk/NN management/NN functions/NNS ,/, will/MD fully/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ advice/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/VBN that/IN the/DT authority/NN will/MD be/VB charged/VBN with/IN developing/VBG networks/NNS with/IN national/JJ food/NN safety/NN agencies/NNS and/CC bodies/NNS in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ task/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD develop/VB greater/JJR certainty/NN in/IN the/DT science/NN that/WDT underpins/VBZ food/NN safety/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT authority/NN must/MD become/VB the/DT authoritative/JJ source/NN of/IN scientific/JJ advice/NN and/CC information/NN on/IN food/NN safety/NN issues/NNS ./.

This/DT situation/NN will/MD not/RB come/VB about/IN by/IN the/DT very/JJ creation/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN but/CC will/MD evolve/VB over/IN time/NN as/IN confidence/NN is/VBZ gained/VBN in/IN the/DT authority/NN itself/PRP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB we/PRP can/MD be/VB prescriptive/VBN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN science/NN and/CC advice/NN based/VBN on/IN science/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT evolution/NN of/IN dynamic/JJ networks/NNS with/IN national/JJ scientific/JJ bodies/NNS and/CC agencies/NNS ,/, the/DT authority/NN will/MD become/VB pre-eminent/JJ on/IN the/DT European/JJ stage/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP also/RB anxious/JJ to/TO hear/VB the/DT views/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP also/RB contains/VBZ very/RB important/JJ proposals/NNS in/IN respect/NN of/IN controls/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT hugely/RB important/JJ component/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN checks/NNS and/CC balances/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC operators/NNS are/VBP complying/VBG with/IN Community/NNP legislation/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB a/DT genuine/JJ internal/JJ market/NN operating/NN in/IN the/DT control/NN arena/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN we/PRP are/VBP also/RB proposing/VBG to/TO strengthen/VB significantly/RB the/DT control/NN function/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC veterinary/JJ office/NN located/VBN in/IN Dublin/NNP ./.

This/DT revised/VBN Community/NNP framework/NN would/MD have/VB three/CD core/JJ elements/NNS :/: operational/JJ criteria/NNS set/VBN up/RP at/IN Community/NNP level/NN ,/, Community/NNP control/NN guidelines/NNS ,/, and/CC enhanced/VBN administrative/JJ cooperation/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN and/CC operation/NN of/IN control/NN ./.

As/IN part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposals/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN -/: which/WDT I/PRP expect/VBP to/TO bring/VB forward/RB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN -/: I/PRP will/MD be/VB examining/VBG whether/IN additional/JJ powers/NNS in/IN addition/NN to/TO infringement/NN procedures/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

These/DT could/MD include/VB withholding/VBG Community/NNP financial/JJ support/NN or/CC recouping/VBG funding/NN already/RB committed/VBN to/TO a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

These/DT proposals/NNS must/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ mission/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT highest/JJS food/NN safety/NN standards/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, boost/VB consumer/NN confidence/NN and/CC increase/VB markets/NNS for/IN farmers/NNS and/CC producers/NNS in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT proposals/NNS for/IN a/DT new/JJ European/JJ food/NN authority/NN and/CC an/DT enhanced/VBN control/NN system/NN at/IN Community-level/NNP ,/, the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP proposes/VBZ an/DT action/NN plan/NN with/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN measures/NNS to/TO improve/VB and/CC bring/VB coherence/NN to/TO the/DT Community/NNP 's/POS legislation/NN ,/, covering/VBG all/DT aspects/NNS of/IN food/NN products/NNS from/IN farm/NN to/TO table/NN ./.

It/PRP sets/VBZ out/RP over/IN 80/CD separate/JJ actions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP envisaged/JJ over/IN the/DT period/NN ahead/RB and/CC intends/VBZ to/TO close/RB identified/VBN loopholes/NNS in/IN current/JJ legislation/NN ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ,/, I/PRP might/MD add/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB finalising/VBG a/DT communication/NN which/WDT I/PRP expect/VBP to/TO be/VB adopted/VBN very/RB soon/RB ./.

I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO having/VBG a/DT useful/JJ exchange/NN of/IN views/NNS this/DT afternoon/NN with/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP who/WP would/MD clearly/RB have/VB preferred/VBN to/TO do/VB this/DT last/JJ week/NN if/IN there/EX had/VBD been/VBN an/DT appropriate/JJ parliamentary/JJ forum/NN available/JJ ./.

But/CC I/PRP know/VBP too/RB that/IN we/PRP will/MD have/VB many/JJ further/JJ opportunities/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/JJ months/NNS to/TO consider/VB the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP 's/POS proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ especially/RB active/JJ since/IN then/RB in/IN bringing/VBG citizens/NNS '/POS concerns/NNS about/IN food/NN safety/NN issues/NNS to/TO the/DT fore/NN ./.

I/PRP expect/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS contribution/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT authority/NN can/MD be/VB as/RB incisive/JJ and/CC constructive/JJ ./.

While/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN months/NNS to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN April/NNP to/TO debate/VB the/DT issue/NN and/CC garner/VB our/PRP$ views/NNS ,/, I/PRP recognise/VBP fully/RB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ also/RB a/DT very/RB tight/JJ timeframe/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB ask/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO make/VB appropriate/JJ arrangements/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN its/PRP$ views/NNS can/MD be/VB formulated/VBN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN we/PRP get/VBP the/DT mix/NN right/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ statement/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB the/DT division/NN of/IN labour/NN that/IN you/PRP have/VBP made/VBN and/CC that/IN food/NN management/NN will/MD remain/VB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ very/RB much/RB the/DT right/JJ approach/NN ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ one/CD word/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP not/RB heard/VBN you/PRP mention/VBP here/RB tonight/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD thrash/VB this/DT out/RP ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT body/NN of/IN food/NN law/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO agree/VB this/DT together/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ that/IN we/PRP include/VBP liability/NN in/IN that/DT process/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT one/CD word/NN I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

The/DT problem/NN so/RB far/RB is/VBZ that/IN taxpayers/NNS paid/VBD when/WRB something/NN went/VBD wrong/JJ ./.

When/WRB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT crisis/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO clearly/RB identify/VB in/IN advance/NN that/IN if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN ,/, those/DT responsible/JJ are/VBP liable/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB worthwhile/JJ White/NNP Paper/NN and/CC you/PRP will/MD not/RB hear/VB a/DT word/NN from/IN me/PRP on/IN the/DT food/NN safety/NN authority/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ addressing/VBG a/DT very/RB important/JJ area/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, commercial/JJ policy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT Parliament/NNP wishes/VBZ to/TO add/VB policies/NNS to/TO aid/NN development/NN ,/, agriculture/NN ,/, fisheries/JJ policy/NN ,/, immigration/NN ,/, our/PRP$ position/NN in/IN international/JJ financial/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, the/DT common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN and/CC aid/NN for/IN structural/JJ reform/NN ./.

Since/IN the/DT Development/NNP Council/NNP is/VBZ in/IN agreement/NN with/IN what/WP he/PRP says/VBZ -/: and/CC this/DT is/VBZ very/RB significant/JJ -/: there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ we/PRP can/MD say/VB ,/, as/IN some/DT previous/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP pointed/VBN out/RP ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT report/NN it/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO present/VB to/TO us/PRP on/IN global/JJ policy/NN ,/, will/MD also/RB address/VB the/DT question/NN of/IN coherence/NN as/IN an/DT integral/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT efficient/JJ use/NN of/IN Community/NNP resources/NNS and/CC the/DT specific/JJ management/NN of/IN public/JJ interests/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ reports/NNS and/CC ,/, in/IN common/JJ with/IN others/NNS ,/, express/VB my/PRP$ regret/NN at/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN coherence/NN policy/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN given/VBN more/JJR prominence/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP who/WP sit/VBP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP do/VBP not/RB doubt/VB for/IN a/DT second/NN what/WP the/DT reason/NN is/VBZ ./.

I/PRP should/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO discuss/VB something/NN more/RBR general/JJ and/CC begin/VB with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, useful/JJ figures/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT nineteenth/JJ century/NN ,/, real/JJ per/IN capita/NN income/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/CD richest/JJS countries/NNS was/VBD three/CD times/NNS higher/JJR than/IN in/IN the/DT poorest/JJS countries/NNS ./.

In/IN 1900/CD it/PRP was/VBD ten/CD times/NNS higher/JJR and/CC in/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD it/PRP is/VBZ 60/CD times/NNS higher/JJR ./.

And/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT sign/NN of/IN this/DT trend/NN '/'' s/VBZ being/VBG reversed/VBN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, it/PRP looks/VBZ as/RB if/IN we/PRP have/VBP entered/VBN an/DT exponential/JJ curve/NN which/WDT is/VBZ widening/VBG the/DT gap/NN still/RB further/RBR ./.

This/DT is/VBZ shown/VBN by/IN the/DT following/VBG figures/NNS :/: the/DT income/NN gap/NN between/IN the/DT richest/JJS and/CC poorest/JJS fifths/NNS was/VBD 30:1/CD in/IN 1960/CD ,/, 60:1/CD in/IN 1990/CD and/CC 74:1/CD in/IN 1997/CD ./.

These/DT figures/NNS are/VBP from/IN before/IN the/DT Internet/NN revolution/NN took/VBD off/RP ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, there/EX will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT quantum/NN leap/NN in/IN development/NN policy/NN if/IN the/DT rich/JJ countries/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT EU/NNP countries/NNS ,/, are/VBP not/RB to/TO surround/VB themselves/PRP with/IN barriers/NNS to/TO prevent/VB immigration/NN on/IN a/DT massive/JJ scale/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT global/JJ village/NN ,/, major/JJ discrepancies/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN will/MD not/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT longer/JJR term/NN ,/, be/VB tolerated/VBN by/IN the/DT poorest/JJS section/NN of/IN the/DT village/NN ./.

At/IN some/DT time/NN or/CC another/DT ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT revolt/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP will/MD be/VB fully/RB justified/JJ ./.

The/DT EU/NNP on/IN average/NN is/VBZ far/RB from/IN providing/VBG the/DT pledged/JJ 0.7/CD %/NN ./.

It/PRP may/MD well/RB be/VB that/IN others/NNS are/VBP worse/JJR ,/, but/CC that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB place/VB us/PRP in/IN any/DT better/JJR a/DT light/NN ./.

Above/IN all/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD give/VB the/DT countries/NNS concerned/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO trade/VB with/IN us/PRP ./.

As/IN far/RB as/RB I/PRP could/MD hear/VB -/: but/CC I/PRP may/MD have/VB missed/VBN something/NN -/: the/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP did/VBD not/RB mention/VB the/DT word/NN ``/`` trade/NN ''/'' at/IN all/DT ./.

I/PRP shall/MD conclude/VB with/IN a/DT few/JJ words/NNS about/IN the/DT Internet/NN revolution/NN ./.

As/IN Commissioner/NNP Liikanen/NNP keeps/VBZ saying/VBG on/IN his/PRP$ travels/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT head/NN start/VB here/RB in/IN Europe/NNP in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN mobile/JJ telecommunications/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP use/VB this/DT not/RB only/JJ for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ populations/NNS but/CC also/RB for/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

This/DT technology/NN can/MD facilitate/VB that/DT necessary/JJ quantum/NN leap/NN forward/RB in/IN development/NN policy/NN to/TO which/WDT I/PRP referred/VBD and/CC ,/, in/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, the/DT EU/NNP can/MD set/VB the/DT agenda/NN ,/, leave/VB its/PRP$ mark/NN on/IN development/NN and/CC honour/VB its/PRP$ global/JJ responsibilities/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ``/`` The/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/NN development/NN cooperation/NN leaves/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO be/VB desired/JJ ''/'' ./.

This/DT is/VBZ just/RB a/DT quote/NN from/IN a/DT newspaper/NN article/NN which/WDT appeared/VBD last/JJ week/NN ,/, commenting/VBG on/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB new/JJ ./.

Ever/RB since/IN we/PRP have/VBP attempted/VBN to/TO do/VB something/NN about/IN development/NN cooperation/NN ,/, its/PRP$ effectiveness/NN and/CC quality/NN have/VBP been/VBN called/VBN into/IN question/NN ./.

Hope/NNP of/IN improvement/NN threatens/VBZ to/TO be/VB nipped/VBN in/IN the/DT bud/NN if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP keeps/VBZ refusing/VBG to/TO look/VB into/IN the/DT mirror/NN ./.

Why/WRB was/VBD the/DT critical/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT coherence/NN of/IN development/NN policy/NN not/RB disseminated/VBN externally/RB ?/.

One/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ conclusions/NNS of/IN this/DT report/NN concerned/VBD the/DT European/JJ policy/NN '/'' s/VBZ internal/JJ conflict/NN ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN trade/NN and/CC agriculture/NN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT European/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ in/IN conflict/NN with/IN the/DT development/NN policy/NN ./.

We/PRP seem/VBP unable/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT serious/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT least/JJS developed/JJ countries/NNS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ everything/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT difference/NN of/IN opinion/NN which/WDT exists/VBZ among/IN various/JJ countries/NNS within/IN the/DT Union/NNP regarding/VBG development/NN cooperation/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD no/RB longer/RB view/VB development/NN cooperation/NN as/IN an/DT instrument/NN of/IN external/JJ and/CC foreign/JJ relations/NNS ,/, but/CC as/RB a/DT policy/NN in/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ right/NN ./.

I/PRP advocate/VBP transparent/NN ,/, joint/NN and/CC efficient/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

As/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT European/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT development/NN issue/NN creates/VBZ more/JJR inefficiency/NN and/CC wastes/VBZ more/JJR money/NN ,/, it/PRP remains/VBZ appropriate/JJ to/TO apportion/VB a/DT larger/JJR role/NN to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO send/VB the/DT document/NN I/PRP referred/VBD to/TO to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ,/, so/CC that/IN we/PRP can/MD help/VB think/VB of/IN possible/JJ solutions/NNS in/IN a/DT constructive/JJ way/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT appropriate/JJ initiative/NN and/CC that/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ very/RB good/JJ sense/NN ./.

As/IN various/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP already/RB commented/VBD ,/, we/PRP often/RB encounter/VB situations/NNS where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT enormous/JJ contradiction/NN between/IN our/PRP$ intentions/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN development/NN and/CC cooperation/NN policy/NN and/CC the/DT damage/NN we/PRP inflict/VB with/IN our/PRP$ other/JJ sectoral/JJ policies/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ objectives/NNS run/VBP counter/RB to/TO development/NN in/IN those/DT countries/NNS ./.

And/CC we/PRP are/VBP not/RB just/RB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT concrete/JJ impact/NN of/IN our/PRP$ common/JJ policies/NNS ,/, tourism/NN ,/, the/DT environment/NN ,/, agriculture/NN ,/, fisheries/NNS and/CC industry/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG in/IN general/JJ terms/NNS -/: and/CC this/DT is/VBZ more/RBR serious/JJ -/: about/RB contradictions/NNS between/IN our/PRP$ economic/JJ and/CC trade/NN policies/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ defence/NN policies/NNS ./.

So/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ raft/NN of/IN contradictions/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, these/DT contradictions/NNS are/VBP not/RB all/DT that/DT serious/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN Community/NNP policies/NNS ./.

They/PRP are/VBP ,/, if/IN anything/NN ,/, more/RBR serious/JJ as/IN regards/VBZ certain/JJ objectives/NNS and/CC industries/NNS in/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB aware/JJ of/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP often/RB adopt/VBP resolutions/NNS on/IN peace/NN processes/NNS in/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD recently/RB the/DT case/NN with/IN Indonesia/NNP ,/, when/WRB we/PRP protested/VBD at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN our/PRP$ voices/NNS only/RB to/TO discover/VB subsequently/RB that/IN some/DT European/JJ countries/NNS had/VBD been/VBN supplying/VBG them/PRP with/IN arms/NNS and/CC military/JJ equipment/NN ./.

For/IN me/PRP ,/, these/DT are/VBP the/DT most/RBS serious/JJ contradictions/NNS in/IN all/PDT this/DT ,/, more/RBR serious/JJ than/IN the/DT contradictions/NNS inherent/JJ in/IN any/DT incompatibility/NN between/IN sectoral/JJ policies/NNS ./.

We/PRP obviously/RB know/VBP that/IN ,/, even/RB within/IN any/DT one/CD country/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP always/RB contradictions/NNS between/IN various/JJ policies/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

And/CC we/PRP must/MD also/RB be/VB aware/JJ that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB contradictions/NNS between/IN the/DT various/JJ Community/NNP policies/NNS ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN development/NN policy/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB aware/JJ that/IN these/DT contradictions/NNS exist/VBP and/CC that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO minimise/VB them/PRP ./.

The/DT underlying/VBG reason/NN for/IN presenting/VBG this/DT resolution/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT objective/NN of/IN minimising/VBG these/DT contradictions/NNS is/VBZ a/DT fair/JJ and/CC wise/JJ one/NN ./.

This/DT monitoring/NN centre/NN should/MD draw/VB up/RP an/DT annual/JJ report/NN on/IN developments/NNS in/IN these/DT policies/NNS and/CC on/IN their/PRP$ impact/NN and/CC interaction/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP left/VBN to/TO the/DT end/NN a/DT question/NN that/IN I/PRP regard/VBP as/RB fundamental/JJ and/CC which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB noted/VBN and/CC approved/VBN by/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ objective/NN of/IN minimising/VBG contradictions/NNS between/IN development/NN and/CC cooperation/NN policy/NN and/CC other/JJ policies/NNS has/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT valid/JJ objective/NN ,/, not/RB merely/RB within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB at/IN world/NN level/NN ,/, given/VBN the/DT increasing/JJ globalisation/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN ./.

Action/NNP simply/RB has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN taken/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP want/VBP annual/JJ reports/NNS ,/, we/PRP want/VBP an/DT annual/JJ inter-service/JJ group/NN and/CC we/PRP want/VBP a/DT complaints/NNS procedure/NN ,/, to/TO make/VB sure/JJ action/NN is/VBZ actually/RB taken/VBN ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP ,/, in/IN his/PRP$ summing-up/NN ,/, to/TO directly/RB address/VB those/DT points/NNS in/IN the/DT resolution/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO restrict/VB my/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT link/NN between/IN development/NN cooperation/NN and/CC agriculture/NN ./.

Over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, a/DT considerable/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT funds/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN channelled/VBN towards/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN agriculture/NN and/CC cattle/NNS breeding/VBG in/IN the/DT developing/JJ countries/NNS and/CC ,/, more/RBR especially/RB ,/, the/DT Lom脙/JJ 漏/CD countries/NNS ./.

The/DT results/NNS are/VBP certainly/RB not/RB what/WP we/PRP expected/VBD ./.

What/WP could/MD be/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN this/DT ?/.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT cause/NN should/MD first/RB and/CC foremost/RB be/VB sought/VBN in/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN clear/JJ agricultural/JJ policy/NN in/IN the/DT various/JJ developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, barring/VBG a/DT few/JJ exceptions/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD do/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN there/RB to/TO help/VB this/DT develop/VB ./.

No/DT farmer/NN ,/, anywhere/RB in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, will/MD produce/VB something/NN if/IN prices/NNS are/VBP too/RB low/JJ ./.

The/DT governments/NNS in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS are/VBP always/RB faced/VBN with/IN a/DT difficult/JJ dilemma/NN :/: whom/WP should/MD they/PRP support/VB ,/, the/DT farmers/NNS or/CC the/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT large/JJ cities/NNS who/WP want/VBP cheap/JJ food/NN ?/.

This/DT fine/JJ balance/NN must/MD be/VB struck/VBN in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC not/RB by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

In/IN most/JJS countries/NNS where/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ active/JJ ,/, development/NN aid/NN is/VBZ also/RB granted/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS themselves/PRP ./.

It/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN that/IN the/DT policy/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS contravenes/VBZ that/DT of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ up/RB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ delegations/NNS in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS to/TO assume/VB a/DT leading/VBG role/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN this/DT political/JJ dialogue/NN and/CC to/TO ensure/VB that/IN all/DT countries/NNS follow/VBP this/DT line/NN of/IN approach/NN ./.

Special/JJ attention/NN is/VBZ also/RB required/VBN for/IN the/DT costs/NNS of/IN the/DT means/NN of/IN production/NN ./.

Far/RB too/RB often/RB ,/, artificial/JJ fertiliser/NN ,/, veterinary/JJ medication/NN and/CC a/DT host/NN of/IN other/JJ items/NNS are/VBP provided/VBN to/TO farmers/NNS free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ./.

Once/IN the/DT project/NN comes/VBZ to/TO an/DT end/NN after/IN five/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT policy/NN of/IN free/JJ gifts/NNS also/RB ends/VBZ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT cost/NN element/NN should/MD be/VB built/VBN in/IN right/NN from/IN the/DT outset/NN in/IN the/DT policy/NN of/IN all/DT projects/NNS ,/, and/CC as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP know/VBP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN by/IN any/DT stretch/NN of/IN the/DT imagination/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP wonder/VBP whether/IN the/DT funds/NNS could/MD not/RB be/VB put/VBN to/TO better/JJR use/NN ./.

Every/DT year/NN ,/, I/PRP notice/VBP in/IN the/DT budget/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT European/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, that/IN they/PRP are/VBP far/RB behind/RB in/IN spending/VBG the/DT funds/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/VBZ ,/, we/PRP are/VBP in/IN actual/JJ fact/NN holding/VBG a/DT debate/NN amongst/IN the/DT converted/JJ ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT pity/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB note/VBP that/IN ,/, as/IN before/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP still/RB various/JJ DGs/NN which/WDT stifle/VB this/DT policy/NN with/IN often/RB very/RB conflicting/JJ procedures/NNS and/CC arguments/NNS ./.

The/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP came/VBD up/RP with/IN a/DT good/JJ suggestion/NN ,/, namely/RB to/TO budget/NN the/DT European/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP would/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, welcome/VB this/DT with/IN open/JJ arms/NNS ./.

If/IN this/DT were/VBD possible/JJ ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ ,/, historic/JJ victory/NN ./.

Since/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, three/CD terms/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN centre/NN stage/NN :/: complementarity/NN ,/, coordination/NN and/CC cohesion/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN very/RB little/JJ has/VBZ been/VBN achieved/VBN in/IN these/DT three/CD fields/NNS ./.

If/IN a/DT request/NN is/VBZ made/VBN for/IN a/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT progress/NN made/VBN on/IN cohesion/NN ,/, if/IN a/DT request/NN is/VBZ made/VBN at/IN all/DT ,/, then/RB drafting/VBG such/PDT a/DT report/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB very/RB difficult/JJ ,/, unless/IN one/PRP simply/RB admits/VBZ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT cohesion/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB it/PRP if/IN a/DT report/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB written/VBN on/IN the/DT present/JJ lack/NN of/IN cohesion/NN ,/, and/CC if/IN a/DT systematic/JJ strategy/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB developed/VBN to/TO reach/VB a/DT certain/JJ level/NN of/IN cohesion/NN ,/, for/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT long/JJ way/NN off/RB yet/RB ./.

One/CD thing/NN shocked/VBD me/PRP in/IN the/DT speech/NN of/IN the/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

He/PRP stated/VBD :/: ``/`` Contradictions/NNP in/IN policy/NN can/MD lead/VB to/TO balance/VB ./. ''/'' ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ indeed/RB the/DT case/NN that/IN what/WP one/CD hand/NN gives/VBZ can/MD be/VB taken/VBN away/RB by/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, and/CC vice/RB versa/RB ./.

But/CC this/DT leads/VBZ to/TO status-quo/NN and/CC self-deceit/NN ,/, and/CC globalisation/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN has/VBZ so/RB far/RB only/RB led/VBN to/TO changes/NNS ,/, indeed/RB ,/, but/CC changes/NNS which/WDT have/VBP only/RB made/VBN poverty/NN worse/RBR ./.

This/DT is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB our/PRP$ priority/NN ,/, would/MD you/PRP believe/VBP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN we/PRP do/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN good/JJ ,/, but/CC let/VBD us/PRP start/VBP with/IN this/DT very/RB essential/JJ aspect/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP already/RB noted/VBN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT report/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP intend/VBP to/TO discuss/VB three/CD matters/NNS in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT objectives/NNS which/WDT the/DT Council/NNP presented/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ 1997/CD opinion/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN conflict/NN resolution/NN ./.

For/IN many/JJ years/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN ,/, through/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, to/TO find/VB out/RP why/WRB none/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS is/VBZ actively/RB participating/VBG in/RP ,/, and/CC working/VBG for/IN ,/, conflict/NN resolution/NN in/IN the/DT Western/NNP Sahara/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ occupied/VBN by/IN Morocco/NNP ./.

The/DT UN/NNP has/VBZ a/DT peace/NN plan/NN ./.

We/PRP ought/MD to/TO seize/VB this/DT opportunity/NN and/CC bring/VB the/DT last/JJ colonial/JJ episode/NN in/IN Africa/NNP to/TO an/DT end/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO take/VB up/RP the/DT subject/NN of/IN migration/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP anxious/JJ about/IN the/DT new/JJ stipulations/NNS in/IN the/DT partnership/NN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT ACP/NNP countries/NNS ,/, which/WDT might/MD make/VB it/PRP easier/RBR to/TO expel/VB immigrants/NNS ,/, asylum/NN seekers/NNS and/CC refugees/NNS on/IN flimsier/NN grounds/NNS ./.

I/PRP really/RB also/RB want/VBP to/TO see/VB the/DT EU/JJ pioneer/NN patents/NNS on/IN living/VBG organisms/NNS ./.

We/PRP now/RB know/VBP that/IN at/IN least/JJS one/CD person/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN dies/VBZ of/IN hunger/VBG every/DT four/CD seconds/NNS ./.

Three/CD quarters/NNS of/IN those/DT who/WP die/VBP are/VBP children/NNS under/IN five/CD years/NNS of/IN age/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB because/RB of/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN food/NN ,/, but/CC because/RB of/IN what/WP we/PRP have/VBP talked/VBN a/DT lot/NN about/IN today/NN ,/, namely/RB increasing/VBG poverty/NN ./.

Food/NN safety/NN and/CC the/DT guarantee/NN of/IN biological/JJ diversity/NN must/MD take/VB precedence/NN over/IN commercial/JJ interests/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN patents/NNS on/IN living/VBG organisms/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN only/RB to/TO control/VB the/DT global/JJ food/NN supply/NN ,/, specifically/RB for/IN commercial/JJ purposes/NNS and/CC for/IN no/DT other/JJ reason/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO see/VB something/NN about/IN women/NNS in/IN the/DT report/NN I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD produce/VB ./.

Women/NNP appear/VBP to/TO be/VB completely/RB absent/JJ from/IN all/DT areas/NNS ,/, especially/RB development/NN policy/NN when/WRB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN reality/NN absent/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT debate/NN we/PRP are/VBP holding/VBG today/NN strongly/RB underlines/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO discuss/VB development/NN policy/NN in/IN much/RB broader/JJR terms/NNS than/IN are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN simply/RB measuring/VBG the/DT flow/NN of/IN aid/NN ./.

The/DT level/NN of/IN aid/NN is/VBZ naturally/RB important/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT level/NN of/IN aid/NN contributed/VBD by/IN the/DT rich/JJ countries/NNS as/IN a/DT whole/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB increased/VBN ./.

This/DT ought/MD to/TO be/VB done/VBN with/IN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, a/DT view/NN to/TO combating/VBG poverty/NN and/CC through/IN investing/VBG in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN capacity/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT level/NN of/IN aid/NN is/VBZ only/RB one/CD of/IN many/JJ instruments/NNS which/WDT significantly/RB influence/VBP the/DT development/NN of/IN poor/JJ countries/NNS ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN colleagues/NNS have/VBP today/NN pointed/VBN to/TO areas/NNS in/IN addition/NN to/TO aid/VB which/WDT are/VBP important/JJ and/CC where/WRB contrasts/NNS and/CC conflicts/NNS between/IN different/JJ policy/NN areas/NNS are/VBP very/RB serious/JJ indeed/RB ./.

The/DT latter/NN include/VBP trade/NN ,/, agricultural/JJ and/CC fisheries/NNS policies/NNS ./.

Other/JJ important/JJ areas/NNS are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT flow/NN of/IN private/JJ investments/NNS ,/, cooperation/NN on/IN research/NN and/CC technology/NN and/CC the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT welfare/NN state/NN deals/VBZ with/IN ,/, and/CC finances/VBZ solutions/NNS to/TO ,/, a/DT variety/NN of/IN global/JJ problems/NNS which/WDT affect/VBP us/PRP all/DT ./.

These/DT problems/NNS include/VBP questions/NNS of/IN climate/NN ,/, health/NN issues/NNS ,/, biodiversity/JJ etc/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT problems/NNS are/VBP clearly/RB exacerbated/VBN by/IN globalisation/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB the/DT new/JJ economy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ developing/VBG ./.

In/IN this/DT economy/NN ,/, the/DT connection/NN between/IN different/JJ policy/NN areas/NNS is/VBZ that/DT much/RB more/RBR marked/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, what/WP we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG here/RB today/NN is/VBZ partly/RB the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN about/IN the/DT opportunities/NNS and/CC risks/NNS of/IN globalisation/NN and/CC about/RB the/DT rules/NNS there/RB must/MD be/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB poor/JJ countries/NNS a/DT decent/JJ chance/NN ./.

The/DT report/NN ,/, or/CC survey/NN ,/, which/WDT Mrs/NNP Maij-Weggen/NNP has/VBZ demanded/VBN ,/, showing/VBG how/WRB the/DT various/JJ policy/NN areas/NNS fit/VBP together/RB and/CC what/WP the/DT aforementioned/JJ conflicts/NNS appear/VBP to/TO be/VB ,/, is/VBZ naturally/RB quite/RB crucial/JJ ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB help/VB but/CC wonder/VBP why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ not/RB done/VBN more/RBR ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ new/JJ and/CC has/VBZ to/TO be/VB given/VBN time/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT absence/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT survey/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP powerful/JJ tensions/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB hope/VB that/IN Mr/NNP Nielsen/NNP will/MD be/VB successful/JJ in/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ discussions/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO a/DT report/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT more/RBR positive/JJ analysis/NN which/WDT could/MD be/VB ongoing/VBN in/IN character/NN ./.

An/DT analysis/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN should/MD look/VB not/RB only/RB at/IN the/DT flow/NN of/IN aid/NN but/CC also/RB give/VB comprehensive/JJ consideration/NN to/TO all/PDT the/DT different/JJ types/NNS of/IN aid/NN and/CC transfers/NNS of/IN resources/NNS which/WDT influence/VBP poor/JJ countries/NNS ./.

These/DT include/VBP technology/NN ,/, trade/NN ,/, cooperation/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN research/NN etc./NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD be/VB an/DT extremely/RB constructive/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN we/PRP are/VBP conducting/VBG ./.

Finally/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP recommends/VBZ ,/, in/IN paragraph/NN 6/CD of/IN the/DT draft/NN resolution/NN ,/, that/IN a/DT working/VBG party/NN should/MD be/VB established/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO bring/VB about/IN coherence/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB a/DT coincidence/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN the/DT Environment/NNP is/VBZ also/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, to/TO participate/VB in/IN this/DT group/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT debate/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP now/RB engaged/VBN will/MD prove/VB to/TO have/VB been/VBN a/DT watershed/NN ./.

Policy/NNP so/RB far/RB has/VBZ been/VBN characterised/VBN far/RB too/RB much/RB by/IN a/DT process/NN of/IN giving/VBG with/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN and/CC taking/VBG away/RP with/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP duty/NN bound/VBN to/TO publicly/RB denounce/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN fishing/NN is/VBZ absent/JJ from/IN the/DT programme/NN which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP presented/VBN to/TO us/PRP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB asking/VBG for/IN details/NNS or/CC specific/JJ points/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN a/DT mention/NN was/VBD required/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ all/PDT the/DT more/RBR serious/JJ ,/, if/IN that/DT is/VBZ possible/JJ -/: as/IN others/NNS have/VBP said/VBD -/: bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN your/PRP$ Commission/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, has/VBZ to/TO carry/VB out/RP nothing/NN less/CC than/IN a/DT revision/NN or/CC reform/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ common/JJ fisheries/NNS policy/NN ,/, which/WDT you/PRP are/VBP legally/RB required/VBN to/TO do/VB in/IN 2002/CD ./.

We/PRP wholeheartedly/RB support/VBP the/DT programme/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ now/RB laid/VBN down/RP in/IN a/DT consultative/JJ document/NN and/CC which/WDT is/VBZ also/RB included/VBN in/IN the/DT programme/NN of/IN Vice-President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

We/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB of/IN utmost/JJ importance/NN that/IN ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN financial/JJ control/NN ,/, personnel/JJ management/NN and/CC bureaucratic/JJ short-cuts/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD expect/VB swift/JJ lines/NNS of/IN policy/NN and/CC a/DT more/RBR effective/JJ bureaucracy/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN the/DT citizen/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT massive/JJ programme/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, during/IN the/DT overhaul/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO keep/VB the/DT actual/JJ results/NNS coming/VBG in/RP ,/, as/RB before/RB ./.

Much/RB like/IN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, where/WRB ,/, at/IN a/DT given/VBN point/NN ,/, women/NNS woke/VBD up/RP to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, by/IN referring/VBG to/TO European/JJ legislation/NN ,/, they/PRP could/MD improve/VB their/PRP$ status/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ security/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ now/RB also/RB the/DT case/NN for/IN scores/NNS of/IN other/JJ citizens/NNS ./.

They/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB results/NNS ./.

Democracy/NN ,/, transparency/NN and/CC clarity/NN always/RB lead/VBP to/TO results/NNS ,/, citizens/NNS value/NN results/NNS and/CC this/DT is/VBZ what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ judged/VBN on/RP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB the/DT point/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP and/CC also/RB other/JJ Members/NNS made/VBD :/: fear/NN of/IN modernisation/NN ,/, globalisation/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT individual/NN losing/VBG his/PRP$ own/JJ sense/NN of/IN safety/NN and/CC security/NN ./.

This/DT can/MD be/VB prevented/VBN if/IN a/DT European/JJ social/JJ model/NN is/VBZ drawn/VBN up/RP and/CC if/IN results/NNS are/VBP achieved/VBN in/IN all/PDT these/DT concrete/JJ areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB strongly/RB advocate/VB internal/JJ reform/NN which/WDT delivers/VBZ fast/JJ and/CC concrete/JJ results/NNS at/IN a/DT social/JJ level/NN ./.

This/DT gives/VBZ the/DT citizen/NN a/DT sense/NN of/IN recognition/NN ,/, here/RB in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC elsewhere/RB ./.

Because/IN this/DT citizen/NN -/: one/CD in/IN five/CD globally/NNS -/: still/RB has/VBZ no/DT access/NN to/TO elementary/JJ social/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN education/NN and/CC health/NN care/VBP ./.

These/DT are/VBP really/RB the/DT people/NNS who/WP deserve/VBP our/PRP$ solidarity/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP read/VBN and/CC re-read/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ document/NN setting/NN out/IN the/DT strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN its/PRP$ term/NN in/IN office/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ being/VBG discussed/VBN in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP also/RB note/VBP the/DT compromises/NNS and/CC the/DT omissions/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP makes/VBZ only/RB a/DT passing/NN reference/NN to/TO economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ,/, to/TO solidarity/NN between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

And/CC this/DT is/VBZ true/JJ even/RB when/WRB it/PRP addresses/VBZ the/DT issue/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ./.

Are/VBP reducing/VBG the/DT disparities/NNS between/IN levels/NNS of/IN development/NN and/CC the/DT consequent/JJ promotion/NN of/IN real/JJ convergence/NN objectives/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP already/RB achieved/VBN ?/.

Certainly/RB not/RB !/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD rightly/RB pointed/VBN out/RP that/IN Europe/NNP must/MD evaluate/VB its/PRP$ role/NN as/IN a/DT joint/JJ partner/NN with/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, and/CC strengthen/VB its/PRP$ activities/NNS designed/VBN for/IN fighting/VBG poverty/NN ./.

This/DT document/NN leaves/VBZ out/RP issues/NNS which/WDT clearly/RB should/MD have/VB been/VBN included/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB address/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN cohesion/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB serious/JJ ./.

It/PRP plays/VBZ down/RP one/CD of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS '/POS principles/NNS -/: that/DT of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN -/: which/WDT must/MD inform/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS '/POS policies/NNS and/CC measures/VBZ ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO ignore/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN various/JJ European/JJ regions/NNS are/VBP still/RB considerably/RB less/RBR advanced/JJ than/IN others/NNS ./.

It/PRP also/RB forgets/VBZ that/IN enlargement/NN means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD get/VB regional/JJ policy/NN right/NN ./.

Unless/IN we/PRP achieve/VB real/JJ convergence/NN ,/, the/DT cohesion/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP itself/PRP will/MD be/VB at/IN risk/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD take/VB into/IN consideration/NN the/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT situation/NN of/IN the/DT regions/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, for/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ responsible/JJ ./.

This/DT report/NN confirms/VBZ that/IN whereas/IN an/DT average/JJ level/NN of/IN development/NN is/VBZ given/VBN a/DT rating/NN of/IN 100/CD ,/, the/DT ten/CD so-called/JJ ``/`` strongest/NN ''/'' regions/NNS reached/VBD an/DT average/NN of/IN 158/CD ,/, and/CC the/DT ten/CD so-called/JJ ``/`` weakest/NN ''/'' regions/NNS reached/VBD a/DT figure/NN of/IN around/RB 50/CD ./.

You/PRP may/MD draw/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ conclusions/NNS ./.

50/CD is/VBZ exactly/RB the/DT level/NN of/IN development/NN of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ region/NN ,/, the/DT Azores/NNPS ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT regions/NNS defined/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS as/IN ultra-peripheral/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT ultra-peripheral/JJ regions/NNS ,/, which/WDT the/DT Council/NNP decided/VBD should/MD be/VB drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN December/NNP 1999/CD ./.

I/PRP shall/MD finish/VB by/IN restating/VBG my/PRP$ conviction/NN that/IN without/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB no/DT cohesion/NN at/IN all/DT ,/, only/RB disunity/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, Europe/NNP needs/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

This/DT House/NNP is/VBZ therefore/RB your/PRP$ ally/NN but/CC not/RB one/CD which/WDT is/VBZ too/RB accommodating/VBG ./.

You/PRP must/MD therefore/RB listen/VB to/TO our/PRP$ opinions/NNS ,/, one/CD or/CC two/CD of/IN which/WDT I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO express/VB in/IN my/PRP$ brief/JJ speech/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, although/IN your/PRP$ two/CD predecessors/NNS concentrated/VBD on/IN developing/VBG an/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC establishing/VBG the/DT single/JJ currency/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN left/VBN to/TO you/PRP to/TO develop/VB this/DT whole/JJ value/NN of/IN citizenship/NN which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN European/JJ construction/NN ./.

You/PRP must/MD not/RB allow/VB yourself/PRP to/TO be/VB distracted/VBN by/IN the/DT sole/JJ issue/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ,/, however/RB important/JJ this/DT may/MD be/VB ./.

You/PRP must/MD go/VB further/RBR ,/, towards/IN reconciling/VBG the/DT people/NNS with/IN Europe/NNP ,/, in/IN particular/JJ those/DT people/NNS who/WP are/VBP falling/VBG victim/NN to/TO economic/JJ ,/, social/JJ and/CC ,/, probably/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, technological/JJ divisions/NNS ./.

The/DT promotion/NN of/IN scientific/JJ development/NN and/CC new/JJ technologies/NNS and/CC access/NN for/IN all/DT to/TO these/DT technologies/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB provided/VBN by/IN the/DT market/NN or/CC competition/NN ./.

The/DT latter/NN will/MD also/RB not/RB ensure/VB the/DT social/JJ proximity/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ community/NN services/NNS of/IN health/NN ,/, education/NN ,/, transport/NN ,/, communications/NNS ,/, water/NN and/CC whatever/NN else/RB ./.

Your/PRP$ action/NN programme/NN and/CC your/PRP$ objectives/NNS are/VBP reserved/VBN ,/, even/RB silent/JJ ,/, specifically/RB on/IN the/DT stimulation/NN of/IN public/JJ investment/NN which/WDT is/VBZ needed/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT consolidation/NN and/CC financing/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ public/JJ and/CC general/JJ interest/NN services/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT absolute/JJ priority/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP to/TO reconcile/VB Europe/NNP with/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC ensure/VB that/IN the/DT people/NNS choose/VBP Europe/NNP rather/RB than/IN J脙/NNP 露/NNP rg/NNP Haider/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD correct/JJ to/TO make/VB food/NN safety/NN one/NN of/IN its/PRP$ top/JJ priorities/NNS ./.

The/DT recent/JJ dioxin/NN scare/NN in/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, prior/RB to/TO that/IN the/DT BSE/NNP crisis/NN in/IN Britain/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT continuing/VBG controversy/NN over/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN genetically-modified/JJ foods/NNS ,/, have/VBP all/RB contributed/VBN to/TO undermining/VBG consumer/NN confidence/NN in/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN they/PRP eat/VBP ./.

If/IN the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD indeed/RB restore/VB confidence/NN in/IN the/DT food/NN production/NN chain/NN it/PRP will/MD simultaneously/RB restore/VB confidence/NN in/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP institutions/NNS themselves/PRP and/CC demonstrate/VB their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO protect/VB the/DT rights/NNS of/IN EU/NNP citizens/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN ,/, public/JJ health/NN and/CC consumer/NN confidence/NN features/VBZ prominently/RB in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS work/NN programme/NN for/IN 2000/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN with/IN the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ food/NN authority/NN in/IN the/DT recent/JJ White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ present/JJ form/NN ,/, what/WP is/VBZ being/VBG proposed/VBN is/VBZ more/JJR like/IN an/DT advisory/JJ agency/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP rather/RB than/IN an/DT independent/JJ body/NN that/WDT would/MD have/VB decision/NN -/: and/CC law-making/NNS powers/NNS more/RBR similar/JJ to/TO those/DT of/IN the/DT US/NNP Food/NNP and/CC Drug/NNP Administration/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB established/VBN credibility/NN in/IN this/DT particular/JJ field/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, future/JJ legislation/NN must/MD address/VB the/DT modus/JJ operandi/NN of/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT European/JJ food/NN authority/NN and/CC the/DT authorities/NNS of/IN national/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, for/IN example/NN the/DT food/NN safety/NN authority/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP ./.

This/DT body/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, alongside/IN the/DT recently/RB established/VBN cross-border/JJ body/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP for/IN food/NN safety/NN ,/, is/VBZ already/RB doing/VBG good/JJ work/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT tragedy/NN if/IN their/PRP$ efforts/NNS were/VBD to/TO be/VB undermined/VBN by/IN deficiencies/NNS in/IN EU/NNP legislation/NN ./.

My/PRP$ fear/NN is/VBZ that/IN such/JJ deficiencies/NNS in/IN EU/NNP legislation/NN could/MD lead/VB to/TO turf/NN wars/NNS between/IN national/JJ and/CC EU/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, who/WP should/MD be/VB working/VBG together/RB rather/RB than/IN against/IN one/CD another/DT ./.

That/DT is/VBZ something/NN we/PRP must/MD guard/VB against/IN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT presentation/NN by/IN President/NNP Prodi/NNP today/NN has/VBZ necessarily/RB been/VBN a/DT fairly/RB broad/JJ brush/NN affair/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB looking/VBG for/IN the/DT detail/NN year/NN by/IN year/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN in/IN the/DT social/JJ action/NN programme/NN to/TO be/VB unveiled/VBN this/DT year/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB looking/VBG at/IN this/DT from/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN social/JJ and/CC employment/NN policy/NN ,/, and/CC will/MD be/VB applying/VBG a/DT number/NN of/IN tests/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB looking/VBG at/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT we/PRP can/MD create/VB an/DT equilateral/JJ policy/NN triangle/NN combining/VBG economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, employment/NN policy/NN and/CC social/JJ policy/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, social/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ trailing/VBG well/RB behind/IN economic/JJ and/CC employment/NN policy/NN ./.

Within/IN the/DT employment/NN strategy/NN we/PRP will/MD look/VB for/IN a/DT deepening/VBG and/CC broadening/VBG of/IN the/DT strategy/NN following/VBG the/DT review/NN under/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP presidency/NN and/CC within/IN the/DT framework/NN being/VBG proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

Within/IN the/DT social/JJ dimension/NN we/PRP will/MD be/VB looking/VBG for/IN a/DT deepening/VBG of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN with/IN a/DT social/JJ aspect/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP a/DT code/NN of/IN corporate/JJ conduct/NN to/TO make/VB sure/JJ that/IN companies/NNS in/IN fact/NN work/VBP in/IN partnership/NN with/IN their/PRP$ workers/NNS in/IN the/DT management/NN of/IN change/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT successful/JJ way/NN to/TO manage/VB change/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD act/VB to/TO make/VB sure/JJ that/IN is/VBZ put/VBN into/IN place/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT emergence/NN ,/, the/DT resurgence/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT xenophobic/NN Right/RB within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS together/RB will/MD do/VB their/PRP$ utmost/NN to/TO give/VB reality/NN to/TO Article/NNP 6/CD by/IN using/VBG Article/NNP 13/CD to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN ,/, and/CC Article/NNP 137/VBZ to/TO combat/VB exclusion/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO move/VB that/DT agenda/NN forward/RB with/IN great/JJ urgency/NN now/RB ./.

The/DT aspirations/NNS are/VBP fine/JJ ,/, President/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, we/PRP want/VBP those/DT aspirations/NNS to/TO be/VB matched/VBN by/IN action/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ omen/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP still/RB a/DT few/JJ i/FW 's/VBZ left/VBN for/IN me/PRP to/TO dot/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, you/PRP set/VBD great/JJ store/NN in/IN your/PRP$ reform/NN efforts/NNS on/IN introducing/VBG a/DT forward-looking/JJ employment/NN policy/NN throughout/IN Europe/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT economic/JJ sector/NN which/WDT I/PRP represent/VBP ,/, i.e./JJ fisheries/NNS ,/, this/DT means/VBZ change/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO break/VB away/RP from/IN planned/VBN economy/NN subsidies/NNS in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT liberal/JJ policy/NN which/WDT fosters/VBZ personal/JJ responsibility/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD reduce/VB protective/JJ tariffs/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO safeguard/VB effective/JJ capacity/NN utilisation/NN in/IN undertakings/NNS in/IN the/DT processing/NN industry/NN ./.

What/WP it/PRP comes/VBZ down/RP to/TO is/VBZ the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ economy/NN on/IN the/DT world/NN market/NN and/CC the/DT existence/NN of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN jobs/NNS in/IN the/DT processing/NN industry/NN and/CC offshore/JJ fishing/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB need/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN a/DT branch/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ both/PDT an/DT economic/JJ and/CC a/DT social/JJ factor/NN ,/, which/WDT affects/VBZ not/RB only/JJ Germany/NNP but/CC all/PDT the/DT coastal/JJ regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Plus/NNP ,/, this/DT branch/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ sectors/NNS in/IN which/WDT Europe/NNP has/VBZ fully/RB integrated/VBN powers/NNS to/TO decide/VB and/CC act/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP expect/VBP to/TO be/VB given/VBN a/DT right/NN of/IN codecision/NN here/RB too/RB ./.

This/DT has/VBZ since/IN been/VBN unanimously/RB approved/VBN ./.

The/DT fisheries/NNS policy/NN is/VBZ due/JJ for/IN review/NN in/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS '/POS time/NN ,/, i.e./VBN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ./.

So/IN it/PRP is/VBZ somewhat/RB upsetting/VBG that/IN there/EX is/VBZ not/RB so/RB much/JJ as/IN a/DT mention/NN of/IN this/DT branch/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ this/DT paper/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT misunderstanding/NN ./.

Please/UH ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, stand/VB by/IN your/PRP$ word/NN and/CC implement/VB your/PRP$ promises/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, many/JJ of/IN the/DT speakers/NNS from/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP have/VBP already/RB identified/VBN key/JJ areas/NNS where/WRB there/EX are/VBP gaps/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ statement/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP acknowledged/VBN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT innovative/JJ and/CC very/RB welcome/JJ initiative/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

One/CD area/NN that/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO focus/VB on/RP ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO those/DT already/RB identified/VBN ,/, is/VBZ that/DT of/IN cultural/JJ diversity/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT introduction/NN to/TO this/DT statement/NN acknowledges/VBZ under/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN life/NN section/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN in/IN the/DT statement/NN which/WDT indicates/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO take/VB any/DT steps/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN cultural/JJ diversity/NN ./.

Unless/IN we/PRP address/VB these/DT issues/NNS ,/, unless/IN we/PRP dismantle/NNP these/DT negative/JJ stereotypes/NNS ,/, unless/IN we/PRP take/VBP what/WP is/VBZ best/JJS from/IN our/PRP$ various/JJ cultures/NNS and/CC languages/NNS and/CC protect/VB and/CC expand/VB it/PRP and/CC ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP serious/JJ about/IN having/VBG a/DT diverse/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, we/PRP will/MD fail/VB ./.

Those/DT who/WP are/VBP currently/RB coming/VBG to/TO the/DT fore/NN in/IN Europe/NNP based/VBN on/IN fear/NN will/MD win/VB the/DT day/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB take/VB steps/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN that/DT ,/, we/PRP will/MD fail/VB ultimately/RB ./.

Before/IN giving/VBG the/DT floor/NN again/RB to/TO the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP must/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN ,/, pursuant/JJ to/TO Rule/NNP 37/CD ,/, seven/CD motions/NNS for/IN resolutions/NNS to/TO conclude/VB the/DT debate/NN ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB you/PRP to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO raise/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN order/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT activities/NNS organised/VBD today/NN by/IN the/DT Association/NNP of/IN Parliamentary/NNP Assistants/NNP in/IN support/NN of/IN their/PRP$ call/NN for/IN a/DT statute/NN for/IN assistants/NNS to/TO be/VB adopted/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN on/IN 26/CD January/NNP the/DT association/NN wrote/VBD to/TO the/DT College/NNP of/IN Quaestors/NNP requesting/VBG permission/NN to/TO set/VB up/RP a/DT table/NN outside/IN the/DT Hemicycle/NNP today/NN to/TO publicise/VB their/PRP$ initiative/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT same/JJ day/NN ,/, I/PRP understand/VBP ,/, Mr/NNP Balfe/NNP gave/VBD permission/NN for/IN the/DT assistants/NNS to/TO go/VB ahead/RB ./.

The/DT Parliament/NNP services/NNS asked/VBD to/TO meet/VB with/IN the/DT assistants/NNS yesterday/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT necessary/JJ physical/JJ arrangements/NNS ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB indicated/VBN why/WRB permission/NN was/VBD withdrawn/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT tangible/JJ gesture/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB a/DT solution/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN underway/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO call/VB on/IN the/DT Presidency/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO consider/VB that/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ for/IN the/DT Presidency/NNP itself/PRP to/TO invite/VB the/DT Members/NNS to/TO do/VB likewise/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT let/VBD me/PRP say/VBP that/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN full/JJ support/NN of/IN a/DT statute/NN for/IN assistants/NNS ./.

As/IN all/DT colleagues/NNS will/MD know/VB -/: and/CC many/JJ of/IN you/PRP have/VBP approached/VBN me/PRP over/IN the/DT last/JJ six/CD months/NNS -/: all/DT exhibitions/NNS and/CC such/JJ like/VBP are/VBP filtered/VBN first/RB of/IN all/DT through/IN the/DT Comart/NNP committee/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

To/TO give/VB a/DT non-contentious/JJ example/NN ,/, no/DT commercial/JJ exhibitions/NNS can/MD be/VB held/VBN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP for/IN obvious/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

Following/VBG a/DT letter/NN I/PRP received/VBD yesterday/NN ,/, I/PRP immediately/RB informed/VBD the/DT assistants/NNS that/IN we/PRP would/MD propose/VB that/IN they/PRP be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO hold/VB a/DT meeting/NN or/CC demonstration/NN ,/, probably/RB in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN and/CC possibly/RB in/IN the/DT next/JJ month/NN ./.

But/CC all/DT exhibitions/NNS must/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT do/VBP not/RB interfere/VB with/IN the/DT orderly/JJ running/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP signed/VBD a/DT letter/NN yesterday/NN afternoon/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Bureau/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT assistants/NNS were/VBD informed/VBN of/IN this/DT ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT problem/NN with/IN them/PRP telling/VBG us/PRP the/DT way/NN they/PRP feel/VBP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT problem/NN with/IN a/DT possible/JJ meeting/NN during/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS next/JJ part-session/NN ./.

But/CC all/DT exhibitions/NNS are/VBP in/IN fact/NN looked/VBN at/IN first/JJ by/IN the/DT so-called/JJ Comart/NNP committee/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB we/PRP have/VBP many/JJ exhibitions/NNS around/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, whether/IN they/PRP be/VB about/RB different/JJ countries/NNS or/CC whatever/WDT ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB an/DT attempt/NN to/TO either/DT censor/VB or/CC go/VB against/IN the/DT very/RB real/JJ and/CC justifiable/JJ principle/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD have/VB a/DT statute/NN for/IN assistants/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP your/PRP$ intervention/NN may/MD clarify/VB various/JJ points/NNS that/WDT were/VBD raised/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO point/VB out/RP an/DT important/JJ matter/NN of/IN principle/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD now/RB proceed/VB to/TO the/DT vote/NN .1/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ delegation/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP ,/, the/DT delegation/NN of/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ People/NNS '/'' s/VBZ Party/NNP ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO Mrs/NNP Terr脙/NNP 鲁/NNP n/NNP i/FW Cus脙/NNP '/'' s/VBZ resolution/NN on/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ./.

There/EX have/VBP been/VBN some/DT votes/NNS where/WRB we/PRP have/VBP not/RB followed/VBN the/DT guidelines/NNS of/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Terr脙/CD 鲁/NNS n/JJ i/FW Cus脙/NN resolution/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP consider/VBP on/IN the/DT whole/NN to/TO be/VB excellent/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN Recital/NNP J/NNP which/WDT ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN what/WP I/PRP ,/, as/IN draftsperson/NN of/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Citizens/NNP '/POS Freedoms/NNS ,/, proposed/VBD to/TO that/DT Committee/NNP ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP also/RB voted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN paragraph/NN 13/CD ./.

Does/NNP the/DT Council/NNP believe/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ permissible/JJ to/TO consolidate/VB future/JJ overfishing/NN which/WDT violates/VBZ the/DT originally/RB established/VBN TAC/NN of/IN 33/CD 000/CD metric/JJ tonnes/NNS per/IN year/NN ,/, given/VBN the/DT current/JJ evidence/NN for/IN the/DT critical/JJ state/NN of/IN anchovy/JJ stocks/NNS ?/.

What/WDT measures/NNS does/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP intend/VB to/TO adopt/VB ,/, and/CC when/WRB ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO taking/VBG proper/JJ account/NN of/IN the/DT critical/JJ state/NN of/IN anchovy/JJ stocks/NNS ,/, the/DT aforesaid/JJ quota/NN transfer/NN and/CC the/DT principle/NN of/IN relative/JJ stability/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP is/VBZ extremely/RB anxious/JJ to/TO give/VB a/DT comprehensive/JJ answer/NN to/TO this/DT question/NN ,/, particularly/RB because/IN it/PRP broaches/VBZ an/DT issue/NN which/WDT concerns/VBZ Portugal/NNP in/IN a/DT positive/JJ way/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP shall/MD explain/VB how/WRB ./.

The/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN the/DT critical/JJ level/NN of/IN anchovy/JJ stocks/NNS in/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP to/TO which/WDT Mr/NNP Ortuondo/NNP Larrea/NNP refers/VBZ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD also/RB stipulated/VBN that/IN this/DT would/MD be/VB revised/VBN in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN new/JJ scientific/JJ information/NN on/IN preserving/VBG species/NNS ,/, of/IN which/WDT we/PRP hope/VBP to/TO see/VB examples/NNS in/IN the/DT first/JJ six/CD months/NNS of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT Southern/JJ stocks/NNS of/IN anchovy/NN in/IN ICES/NNP zone/NNP IX/NNP ,/, the/DT TAC/NNP was/VBD fixed/VBN at/IN 10/CD 000/CD tonnes/NNS for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN 2000/CD as/IN opposed/VBN to/TO 13/CD 000/CD tonnes/NNS in/IN 1999/CD ./.

Fishing/VBG quota/NN transfers/NNS between/IN Portugal/NNP and/CC France/NNP were/VBD reduced/VBN proportionally/RB from/IN 5/CD 008/CD tonnes/NNS in/IN 1999/CD to/TO 3/CD 000/CD tonnes/NNS in/IN 2000/CD ,/, for/IN fishing/VBG in/IN French/JJ waters/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO state/NN that/IN this/DT transfer/NN will/MD not/RB increase/VB the/DT pressure/NN of/IN fishing/NN on/IN anchovy/JJ stocks/NNS overall/RB ,/, over/IN the/DT whole/JJ Community/NNP fishing/NN area/NN ./.

In/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN relative/JJ stability/NN ,/, 90/CD %/NN of/IN stocks/NNS of/IN anchovy/NN in/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP are/VBP allocated/VBN to/TO Spain/NNP and/CC only/RB 10/CD %/NN to/TO France/NNP ./.

Without/IN this/DT transfer/NN from/IN Portuguese/NNP waters/NNS ,/, the/DT level/NN of/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP TAC/NNP would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB multiplied/VBN by/IN ten/CD in/IN order/NN to/TO grant/VB adequate/JJ catches/NNS to/TO France/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ quite/RB positive/JJ from/IN Portugal/NNP '/POS s/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

This/DT situation/NN would/MD obviously/RB be/VB even/RB more/RBR damaging/JJ to/TO the/DT level/NN of/IN stocks/NNS than/IN the/DT risk/NN referred/VBD to/TO by/IN Mr/NNP Ortuondo/NNP Larrea/NNP ,/, which/WDT we/PRP also/RB understand/VBP ./.

Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN your/PRP$ comments/NNS have/VBP not/RB satisfied/VBN me/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN Portugal/NNP is/VBZ affected/VBN by/IN this/DT ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN claiming/VBG since/IN 1995/CD ,/, that/IN this/DT move/NN is/VBZ appalling/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, if/IN Portugal/NNP and/CC France/NNP wish/VBP to/TO reach/VB an/DT agreement/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ fine/JJ by/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC these/DT anchovies/NNS should/MD be/VB fished/VBN in/IN Portuguese/NNP fishing/NN grounds/NNS and/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP ./.

Today/NN ,/, scientific/JJ studies/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT anchovy/JJ population/NN in/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP is/VBZ in/IN danger/NN of/IN extinction/NN ,/, and/CC now/RB there/EX will/MD be/VB measures/NNS to/TO restrict/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN anchovy/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB fished/VBN in/IN that/DT Bay/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ ,/, representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ,/, of/IN your/PRP$ responsibility/NN over/IN these/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN 2000/CD as/RB well/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT plight/NN of/IN the/DT families/NNS who/WP live/VBP on/IN anchovy/JJ fishing/NN in/IN the/DT north/NN of/IN the/DT Iberian/NNP Peninsular/NNP ./.

The/DT Court/NNP also/RB stated/VBD that/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN relative/JJ stability/NN had/VBD not/RB been/VBN violated/VBN since/IN the/DT anchovy/JJ quota/NN allocated/VBN to/TO Spain/NNP in/IN zone/NN VIII/CD had/VBD been/VBN maintained/VBN at/IN 90/CD %/NN and/CC France/NNP '/POS s/VBZ at/IN 10/CD %/NN ./.

Accordingly/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Ortuondo/NNP Larrea/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP reiterates/VBZ its/PRP$ opinion/NN that/IN without/IN this/DT transfer/NN ,/, greater/JJR account/NN would/MD be/VB taken/VBN of/IN France/NNP '/POS s/JJ possibilities/NNS for/IN anchovy/JJ fishing/NN in/IN the/DT Bay/NNP of/IN Biscay/NNP ./.

The/DT Council/NNP therefore/RB reiterates/VBZ its/PRP$ opinion/NN that/IN fishing/NN pressure/NN would/MD be/VB greater/JJR and/CC more/RBR damaging/JJ to/TO population/NN numbers/NNS than/IN the/DT solution/NN which/WDT was/VBD eventually/RB chosen/VBN ./.

In/IN concrete/JJ terms/NNS ,/, 3/CD 000/CD tonnes/NNS represent/VBP 57.5/CD %/NN of/IN Portugal/NNP '/POS s/JJ fishing/NN opportunities/NNS in/IN 2000/CD against/IN 5/CD 008/CD tonnes/NNS or/CC 73.9/CD %/NN in/IN 1999/CD ./.

These/DT numbers/NNS represent/VBP ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, a/DT real/JJ improvement/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN conservation/NN in/IN comparison/NN with/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN 80/CD %/NN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN Council/NNP Regulation/NNP 685/95/CD ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ resolution/NN referring/VBG to/TO specific/JJ atrocities/NNS committed/VBN against/IN Serbs/NNPS and/CC Romanies/NNPS ,/, Parliament/NNP also/RB vigorously/RB condemns/VBZ the/DT continuing/VBG violence/NN against/IN the/DT Serb/NNP population/NN and/CC calls/VBZ on/IN the/DT leaders/NNS of/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP Albanians/NNS to/TO fully/RB respect/VB UN/NNP Resolution/NNP 1244/CD ./.

The/DT resolution/NN also/RB stresses/VBZ that/IN previous/JJ persecution/NN of/IN the/DT Albanians/NNS can/MD not/RB constitute/VB a/DT pretext/NN for/IN killings/NNS ,/, abductions/NNS ,/, detentions/NNS ,/, intimidation/NN ,/, arson/NN ,/, looting/NN ,/, destruction/NN of/IN property/NN and/CC the/DT taking-over/NN of/IN houses/NNS etc./NN ./.

Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP the/DT greatest/JJS sympathy/NN for/IN the/DT concern/NN underlying/VBG the/DT issue/NN you/PRP have/VBP raised/VBN ./.

We/PRP genuinely/RB share/VBP your/PRP$ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT threatening/JJ situation/NN which/WDT exists/VBZ in/IN Kosovo/NNP for/IN ethnic/JJ minorities/NNS ,/, for/IN both/PDT the/DT Serb/NNP and/CC Romany/NNP populations/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT incidents/NNS of/IN discrimination/NN ,/, harassment/NN and/CC intimidation/NN which/WDT continue/VBP to/TO take/VB place/NN in/IN that/DT region/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ always/RB stressed/VBN the/DT need/NN to/TO seek/VB prosecution/NN of/IN all/PDT those/DT who/WP have/VBP perpetrated/VBN such/JJ acts/NNS and/CC of/IN those/DT who/WP continue/VBP to/TO perpetrate/VB such/JJ acts/NNS ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ contacts/NNS with/IN senior/JJ political/JJ figures/NNS amongst/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP Albanians/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP stressed/VBN -/: and/CC the/DT Portuguese/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP did/VBD this/DT very/RB recently/RB -/: that/IN persecution/NN of/IN the/DT Serb/NNP population/NN ,/, the/DT Romany/NNP population/NN and/CC other/JJ ethnic/JJ groups/NNS is/VBZ totally/RB unacceptable/JJ ./.

It/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB tolerated/VBN ,/, and/CC must/MD stop/VB immediately/RB ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN communicated/VBN explicitly/RB and/CC repeatedly/RB to/TO Kosovar/NNP leaders/NNS that/IN international/JJ support/NN will/MD depend/VB to/TO a/DT large/JJ extent/NN on/IN the/DT way/NN non-Albanian/JJ minorities/NNS are/VBP treated/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ point/NN :/: this/DT sense/NN of/IN conditionality/NN ,/, which/WDT underlies/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN ,/, is/VBZ being/VBG maintained/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC will/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB maintained/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP fully/RB supported/VBN the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS mission/NN and/CC the/DT international/JJ security/NN forces/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP to/TO prevent/VB further/JJ outbreaks/NNS of/IN violence/NN against/IN minorities/NNS and/CC to/TO protect/VB the/DT populations/NNS under/IN threat/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP -/: as/IN I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP all/RB do/VB -/: that/IN Portugal/NNP ,/, its/PRP$ former/JJ president/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Soares/NNP ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ government/NN ,/, maintained/VBD a/DT cautious/JJ and/CC middle-of-the-road/JJ stance/NN during/IN the/DT bombings/NNS in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

Today/NNP '/POS s/VBZ political/JJ statement/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN was/VBD very/RB positive/JJ indeed/RB ,/, and/CC one/CD which/WDT I/PRP welcome/VBP ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ some/DT concern/NN over/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN progress/NN made/VBN despite/IN the/DT good/JJ and/CC honest/JJ intentions/NNS expressed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT United/NNP Nation/NNP '/POS s/NN ,/, and/CC Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP '/POS s/NN ,/, mission/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ended/VBD in/IN failure/NN ./.

This/DT failure/NN is/VBZ illustrated/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN after/IN an/DT entire/JJ war/NN that/WDT was/VBD waged/JJ to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO ethnic/JJ cleansing/NN ,/, we/PRP now/RB have/VBP ethnic/JJ cleansing/NN from/IN the/DT opposite/JJ side/NN ./.

And/CC so/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO repeat/VB my/PRP$ question/NN as/RB to/TO whether/IN the/DT Council/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO take/VB more/RBR specific/JJ action/NN to/TO debate/VB these/DT issues/NNS with/IN Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ a/DT major/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP today/NN ./.

The/DT structure/NN being/VBG implemented/VBN in/IN Kosovo/NNP is/VBZ under/IN the/DT auspices/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT structure/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN as/IN much/JJ support/NN as/IN it/PRP can/MD and/CC to/TO which/WDT the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP have/VBP contributed/VBN in/IN various/JJ ways/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP R脙艗big/NNP ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, I/PRP understand/VBP your/PRP$ concerns/NNS very/RB well/RB ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB delicate/JJ issue/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP should/MD all/RB be/VB questioning/VBG the/DT logic/NN behind/IN this/DT resolution/NN and/CC its/PRP$ chances/NNS of/IN being/VBG implemented/VBN ./.

We/PRP advocate/NN that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB implemented/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ entirety/NN ./.

We/PRP in/IN the/DT Council/NNP will/MD be/VB trying/VBG to/TO provide/VB information/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN during/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Seixas/NNP da/NNP Costa/NNP ,/, I/PRP totally/RB agree/VBP with/IN you/PRP ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP but/CC the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN on/IN which/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ working/VBG ,/, namely/RB Resolution/NNP 1244/CD ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ responsibility/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ both/DT yours/JJ and/CC ours/JJ ,/, is/VBZ to/TO try/VB and/CC move/VB beyond/IN the/DT provisional/JJ nature/NN of/IN Resolution/NNP 1244/CD and/CC devise/VB a/DT future/JJ scenario/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ region/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT failure/NN to/TO define/VB this/DT scenario/NN which/WDT is/VBZ causing/VBG or/CC encouraging/VBG the/DT excesses/NNS ,/, accidents/NNS and/CC assassinations/NNS mentioned/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NN and/CC ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, the/DT Portuguese/NN Presidency/RB in/IN particular/JJ ,/, are/VBP extremely/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT problems/NNS Mr/NNP Gallagher/NNP '/POS s/JJ question/NN raises/VBZ and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP always/RB paid/VBN the/DT utmost/JJ attention/NN to/TO Community/NNP policies/NNS for/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN in/IN May/NNP 1999/CD we/PRP adopted/VBD a/DT new/JJ system/NN for/IN supporting/VBG rural/JJ development/NN which/WDT was/VBD the/DT fourth/JJ Community/NNP reference/NN framework/NN for/IN sustainable/JJ rural/JJ development/NN ./.

Through/IN the/DT European/JJ Agricultural/NNP Guarantee/NNP and/CC Guidance/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, the/DT EAGGF/NNP ,/, this/DT Community/NNP support/NN framework/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO help/VB reverse/RB the/DT trend/NN of/IN abandoning/VBG rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, an/DT issue/NN you/PRP are/VBP quite/RB right/JJ to/TO raise/VB ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Regional/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, the/DT ERDF/NNP ,/, also/RB contributes/VBZ as/IN part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ role/NN to/TO promoting/VBG social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ cohesion/NN ,/, by/IN redressing/VBG the/DT main/JJ regional/JJ imbalances/NNS and/CC encouraging/VBG rural/JJ areas/NNS to/TO take/VB part/NN in/IN development/NN and/CC conversion/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP worked/VBN closely/RB with/IN Portuguese/NNP NGOs/NNPS and/CC with/IN some/DT initiatives/NNS they/PRP have/VBP proposed/VBN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP combining/VBG with/IN the/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN concerns/NNS underpinning/VBG our/PRP$ whole/JJ programme/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP no/DT specific/JJ ,/, concrete/JJ initiatives/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN but/CC that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP closed/VBN to/TO the/DT idea/NN that/IN an/DT initiative/NN proposed/VBN to/TO us/PRP by/IN NGOs/NNP in/IN this/DT area/NN might/MD be/VB considered/VBN during/IN our/PRP$ presidency/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB obvious/JJ that/IN our/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO act/VB is/VBZ linked/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ scope/NN for/IN intervening/VBG ,/, through/IN its/PRP$ right/NN of/IN initiative/NN ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN administrative/JJ expenditure/NN on/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP is/VBZ -/: in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN -/: still/RB excessive/JJ is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD and/CC indeed/RB always/RB must/MD criticise/VB ,/, although/IN it/PRP almost/RB seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP as/RB though/IN this/DT is/VBZ unavoidable/JJ with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ support/NN programmes/NNS ./.

We/PRP ask/VBP for/IN a/DT guarantee/NN that/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ bodies/NNS for/IN the/DT projects/NNS are/VBP represented/VBN equally/RB by/IN three/CD elements/NNS :/: political/JJ representatives/NNS and/CC public/JJ administrations/NNS ,/, companies/NNS and/CC economic/JJ operators/NNS ,/, and/CC social/JJ operators/NNS ,/, including/VBG unions/NNS and/CC non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, before/IN addressing/VBG the/DT EQUAL/NNP report/NN itself/PRP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN principle/NN in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT employment/NN guidelines/NNS on/IN which/WDT the/DT report/NN is/VBZ based/VBN ./.

The/DT basic/JJ objectives/NNS of/IN an/DT EU-wide/JJ employment/NN policy/NN are/VBP laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS and/CC include/VBP employability/NN ,/, entrepreneurship/NN and/CC adaptability/NN ./.

These/DT objectives/NNS are/VBP obviously/RB intended/VBN to/TO make/VB employees/NNS as/RB useful/JJ and/CC usable/VB as/RB possible/JJ to/TO the/DT economy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT aim/NN of/IN an/DT approach/NN which/WDT really/RB sought/VBD to/TO reduce/VB discrimination/NN effectively/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB people/NNS '/POS s/JJ self-determination/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN has/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, turned/VBD out/RP very/RB well/RB ,/, at/IN least/JJS where/WRB the/DT prescribed/JJ guidelines/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP adopted/VBD this/DT opinion/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/JJ report/NN at/IN its/PRP$ concluding/JJ discussion/NN with/IN no/DT votes/NNS against/IN and/CC one/CD abstention/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB a/DT ceiling/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB set/VBN for/IN administrative/JJ expenditure/NN ./.

The/DT committee/NN based/VBD its/PRP$ conclusions/NNS on/IN these/DT critical/JJ comments/NNS ./.

We/PRP attached/VBD particular/JJ importance/NN to/TO linking/VBG the/DT creation/NN of/IN new/JJ jobs/NNS for/IN disadvantaged/JJ and/CC excluded/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT social/JJ sector/NN ,/, in/IN tourism/NN and/CC in/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS with/IN promoting/VBG the/DT establishment/NN of/IN new/JJ small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN the/DT necessary/JJ economic/JJ structural/JJ change/NN ./.

Dovetailing/VBG the/DT activities/NNS under/IN the/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN with/IN the/DT European/JJ employment/NN initiatives/NNS is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ requirement/NN and/CC a/DT crucial/JJ prerequisite/NN for/IN attaining/VBG the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP programme/NN ./.

The/DT specific/JJ target/NN of/IN deriving/VBG European/JJ added/VBN value/NN brings/VBZ the/DT regional/JJ cooperation/NN up/RP to/TO European/JJ level/NN while/IN retaining/VBG the/DT cooperation/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ regional/JJ operators/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ approach/NN and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP have/VBP also/RB supported/VBN it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteurs/NNS ,/, who/WP have/VBP managed/VBN to/TO produce/VB excellent/JJ reports/NNS in/IN just/RB a/DT short/JJ time/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, criticism/NN has/VBZ been/VBN voiced/VBN within/IN my/PRP$ group/NN over/IN the/DT timing/NN of/IN the/DT preparatory/JJ work/NN of/IN the/DT committee/NN ./.

The/DT reports/NNS are/VBP late/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN addition/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD very/RB hastily/RB discussed/JJ by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP ./.

A/DT good/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO discuss/VB the/DT results/NNS ,/, good/JJ practices/NNS and/CC shortcomings/NNS of/IN the/DT earlier/JJR programmes/NNS was/VBD therefore/RB lost/VBN ./.

Our/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ keen/JJ to/TO stress/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN cross-border/JJ activity/NN under/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP programme/NN and/CC especially/RB cooperation/NN focusing/VBG on/IN areas/NNS outside/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Such/JJ important/JJ areas/NNS include/VBP the/DT Balkans/NNPS and/CC the/DT Adriatic/JJ region/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB ignore/VB cooperation/NN with/IN Russia/NNP either/RB ./.

Our/PRP$ group/NN would/MD once/RB again/RB like/VB to/TO raise/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT practical/JJ monitoring/NN of/IN funds/NNS and/CC emphasise/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN better/JJR coordination/NN of/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP ,/, TACIS/NNP ,/, ISPA/NNP and/CC PHARE/NNP programmes/NNS ./.

This/DT coordination/NN is/VBZ at/IN present/JJ lacking/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ not/RB as/RB yet/RB made/VBN any/DT precise/JJ proposals/NNS to/TO improve/VB it/PRP ./.

We/PRP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP are/VBP waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO give/VB the/DT committee/NN a/DT more/RBR detailed/JJ explanation/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ of/IN decisive/JJ importance/NN to/TO get/VB local/JJ business/NN ,/, organisations/NNS and/CC other/JJ players/NNS involved/VBN in/IN the/DT practical/JJ implementation/NN of/IN programmes/NNS ./.

Experience/NN shows/VBZ that/IN projects/NNS of/IN cooperation/NN need/VBP better/JJR planning/NN and/CC closer/JJR monitoring/NN and/CC need/VBP to/TO be/VB generally/RB more/RBR successful/JJ ./.

Projects/NNPS have/VBP often/RB remained/VBN half-finished/JJ ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ efficiency/NN has/VBZ been/VBN drained/VBN by/IN administration/NN and/CC bureaucracy/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB have/VBP to/TO demand/VB that/IN our/PRP$ partners/NNS in/IN cooperation/NN be/VB committed/VBN to/TO projects/NNS and/CC fulfil/VB their/PRP$ share/NN of/IN the/DT agreement/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ reviewing/VBG a/DT few/JJ amendments/NNS that/WDT were/VBD rejected/VBN by/IN the/DT committee/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB here/RB again/RB the/DT URBAN/NNP report/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT explanatory/JJ statements/NNS ,/, has/VBZ dealt/VBN admirably/RB with/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT minimum/JJ sum/NN of/IN EUR/CD 500/CD per/IN inhabitant/NN as/IN per/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ guidelines/NNS ./.

It/PRP will/MD not/RB work/VB as/IN an/DT automatic/JJ target/NN ,/, but/CC must/MD be/VB applied/VBN in/IN the/DT target/NN area/NN according/VBG to/TO prevailing/VBG conditions/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ such/PDT an/DT important/JJ matter/NN for/IN consideration/NN that/IN firm/NN conclusions/NNS have/VBP to/TO drawn/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, INTERREG/RB is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS European/JJ of/IN all/PDT the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

Here/RB ,/, projects/NNS covering/VBG only/RB one/CD region/NN or/CC one/CD country/NN will/MD not/RB receive/VB support/NN ;/: they/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO cover/VB neighbouring/VBG regions/NNS in/IN two/CD or/CC more/JJR countries/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB this/DT is/VBZ only/RB true/JJ for/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB for/IN the/DT borders/NNS within/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT regions/NNS on/IN borders/NNS with/IN third/JJ countries/NNS which/WDT need/VBP an/DT operational/JJ instrument/NN to/TO foster/VB cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

The/DT regulation/NN pretends/VBZ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ one/CD ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ not/RB ./.

The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ not/RB amended/VBD the/DT regulation/NN for/IN years/NNS ,/, although/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN calling/VBG for/IN it/PRP to/TO do/VB so/RB for/IN some/DT time/NN ./.

The/DT practical/JJ consequence/NN for/IN these/DT regions/NNS in/IN the/DT immediate/JJ future/NN is/VBZ that/IN support/NN for/IN border/NN areas/NNS will/MD again/RB be/VB downgraded/VBN ./.

Since/IN 1996/CD ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN calling/VBG for/IN a/DT joint/JJ fund/NN to/TO be/VB created/VBN for/IN cooperation/NN with/IN third/JJ countries/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO resolve/VB difficulties/NNS ./.

Nothing/NN has/VBZ happened/VBN !/. ./.

The/DT difficulties/NNS are/VBP once/RB again/RB being/VBG allowed/VBN to/TO persist/VB ,/, to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN the/DT regions/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ here/RB renewing/VBG its/PRP$ call/NN for/IN an/DT improvement/NN and/CC for/IN cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO a/DT joint/JJ fund/NN being/VBG created/VBN and/CC to/TO the/DT regulation/NN being/VBG amended/VBD once/RB more/RBR in/IN cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT other/JJ Commissioners/NNS ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT Europe/NNP for/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC not/RB a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN paper-pushers/NNS !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, a/DT third/JJ of/IN EU/NNP money/NN is/VBZ invested/VBN in/IN funds/NNS for/IN all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN development/NN causes/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ excellent/JJ if/IN ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, deprivation/NN within/IN regions/NNS ,/, towns/NNS and/CC population/NN groups/NNS is/VBZ eliminated/VBN or/CC if/IN health/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN improved/VBD ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT question/NN of/IN solidarity/NN and/CC progress/NN ./.

But/CC dishing/VBG out/RP increasing/VBG amounts/NNS of/IN money/NN is/VBZ no/DT guarantee/NN for/IN improved/VBN spending/NN ./.

The/DT local/JJ councils/NNS and/CC regions/NNS where/WRB the/DT money/NN ends/VBZ up/RP have/VBP since/IN gained/VBN practical/JJ experience/NN ./.

Anything/NN related/VBN to/TO economic/JJ growth/NN and/CC infrastructure/NN usually/RB scores/VBZ quite/RB highly/RB ,/, but/CC social/JJ goals/NNS and/CC environmental/JJ causes/NNS often/RB can/MD not/RB count/VB on/IN approval/NN ./.

Since/IN there/EX is/VBZ great/JJ uncertainty/NN surrounding/VBG the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT rules/NNS are/VBP interpreted/VBN ,/, local/JJ councils/NNS and/CC regions/NNS have/VBP now/RB started/VBN to/TO enlist/VB the/DT services/NNS of/IN expensive/JJ bureaux/NN ./.

The/DT task/NN of/IN these/DT experts/NNS is/VBZ to/TO gauge/VB to/TO what/WDT extent/NN European/JJ Commission/NNP officials/NNS would/MD be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO approve/VB plans/NNS ./.

In/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, I/PRP get/VBP the/DT impression/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB about/IN solidarity/VBG or/CC alleviating/VBG the/DT most/RBS desperate/JJ problems/NNS ,/, but/CC about/IN propaganda/VBG and/CC upholding/VBG vested/JJ interests/NNS in/IN exchange/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ blessing/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN the/DT key/JJ goal/NN there/RB has/VBZ become/VBN the/DT construction/NN and/CC painting/NN of/IN propaganda/NN panels/NNS advertising/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN such/JJ and/CC such/PDT a/DT project/NN has/VBZ been/VBN co-financed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Too/RB much/RB money/NN is/VBZ wasted/VBN on/IN propaganda/NN and/CC investigation/NN bureaux/NN ,/, consultation/NN and/CC control/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN money/NN ends/VBZ up/RB back/RB in/IN the/DT country/NN where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD collected/VBN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.

After/IN the/DT planned/VBN accession/NN of/IN new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS with/IN their/PRP$ 100/CD million/CD inhabitants/NN ,/, the/DT prosperity/NN level/NN of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN one/CD third/JJ or/CC two/CD thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT average/JJ level/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNP ,/, this/DT squandering/NN will/MD generate/VB even/RB more/JJR protest/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP ,/, the/DT Confederal/NNP Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP United/NNP Left/NNP was/VBD in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT draftsman/NN of/IN the/DT opinion/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Nogueira/NNP Rom脙/NNP 隆/NNP n/NNP ,/, on/IN LEADER/NNP ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT choice/NN between/IN investing/VBG in/IN innovation/NN projects/NNS or/CC injecting/VBG most/JJS of/IN the/DT funding/NN into/IN bringing/VBG on/IN deprived/VBN areas/NNS ,/, we/PRP would/MD opt/VB for/IN the/DT latter/NN as/IN this/DT does/VBZ the/DT most/JJS to/TO benefit/VB equality/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, innovation/NN in/IN areas/NNS that/WDT have/VBP already/RB grown/VBN prosperous/JJ is/VBZ paying/VBG dividends/NNS even/RB now/RB and/CC taking/VBG place/NN without/IN European/JJ funding/NN ./.

A/DT second/JJ point/NN where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO focus/VB our/PRP$ attention/NN is/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN of/IN nepotism/NN and/CC abuse/NN of/IN power/NN within/IN regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ councils/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT variants/NNS considered/VBN is/VBZ reminiscent/JJ of/IN the/DT Dutch/JJ polder/NN model/NN ,/, the/DT structurally/RB planned/VBN cooperation/NN between/IN government/NN ,/, trade/NN unions/NNS and/CC employers/NNS '/'' organisations/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/IN elections/NNS for/IN local/JJ councils/NNS and/CC regional/JJ parliaments/NNS are/VBP held/VBN so/RB as/RB to/TO represent/VB the/DT entire/JJ population/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, really/RB ,/, these/DT bodies/NNS should/MD already/RB provide/VB for/IN a/DT balance/NN ,/, and/CC take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT wishes/NNS of/IN the/DT union/NN movement/NN and/CC environmental/JJ movement/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT objections/NNS is/VBZ that/IN ,/, due/JJ to/TO the/DT restricted/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT elected/VBN bodies/NNS ,/, businesses/NNS gain/VBP more/JJR influence/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP in/IN `/`` one/CD man/NN ,/, one/CD vote/NN '/'' more/RBR than/IN `/`` one/CD share/NN ,/, one/CD vote/NN '/'' ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, quite/RB a/DT few/JJ towns/NNS and/CC cities/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP have/VBP to/TO contend/VB with/IN deprivation/NN ./.

The/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS do/VBP not/RB always/RB have/VB sufficient/JJ means/NNS at/IN their/PRP$ disposal/NN to/TO address/VB this/DT deprivation/NN adequately/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ useful/JJ for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO continue/VB to/TO support/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, give/VB additional/JJ support/NN under/IN URBAN/NNP ./.

Over/IN the/DT next/JJ seven/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposals/NNS concerning/VBG URBAN/NNP will/MD entail/VB a/DT reduction/NN in/IN both/PDT the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN areas/NNS standing/VBG to/TO benefit/VB ./.

In/IN common/JJ with/IN Mrs/NNP McCarthy/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO note/VB that/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN areas/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN drastically/RB reduced/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ desirable/JJ for/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO have/VB a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN freedom/NN to/TO determine/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN projects/NNS themselves/PRP within/IN the/DT confines/NNS of/IN a/DT certain/JJ budget/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, as/IN already/RB stated/VBD ,/, URBAN/NNP is/VBZ there/EX to/TO support/VB and/CC complement/VB national/JJ policy/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO generate/VB extra/JJ means/NNS if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ entirely/RB logical/JJ to/TO turn/VB first/RB to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC private/JJ investors/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB support/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 2/CD of/IN the/DT Greens/NNP ,/, as/IN borne/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT committee/NN meeting/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN funding/NN for/IN a/DT town/NN or/CC neighbourhood/NN ,/, especially/RB where/WRB Community/NNP contributions/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, should/MD incentivise/VB ./.

Structural/JJ support/NN is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO cause/VB subsidy-dependence/JJ ./.

We/PRP would/MD then/RB be/VB overreaching/VBG ourselves/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO finish/VB off/RP by/IN making/VBG a/DT general/JJ comment/NN on/IN INTERREG/NNP ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, funding/NN for/IN cross-border/JJ initiatives/NNS should/MD only/RB be/VB provided/VBN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ actually/RB required/VBN by/IN the/DT regions/NNS ./.

When/WRB projects/NNS are/VBP implemented/VBN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ that/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB contravene/VB general/JJ Community/NNP legislation/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT report/NN issued/VBN by/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS on/IN the/DT year/NN 1998/CD ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB an/DT imagined/JJ risk/NN ./.

Hence/RB our/PRP$ amendment/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB contradictions/NNS between/IN general/JJ policy/NN and/CC actual/JJ projects/NNS ./.

Before/IN I/PRP begin/VBP I/PRP will/MD take/VB the/DT liberty/NN of/IN expressing/VBG my/PRP$ consternation/NN at/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT Austria/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN prejudged/VBN by/IN 14/CD Council/NNP representatives/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS the/DT Community/NNP initiatives/NNS are/VBP being/VBG pruned/VBN to/TO a/DT total/NN of/IN four/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT delayed/JJ presentation/NN of/IN the/DT draft/NN guidelines/NNS has/VBZ caused/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN problems/NNS ./.

The/DT regions/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN sufficiently/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT preparation/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS ,/, although/IN this/DT demand/NN was/VBD often/RB made/VBN in/IN the/DT debate/NN about/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT direct/JJ transition/NN between/IN INTERREG/NNP II/NNP and/CC III/NNP ,/, the/DT practical/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN which/WDT are/VBP uncertainty/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN planning/NN and/CC gaps/NNS in/IN funding/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT shame/NN because/IN it/PRP threatens/VBZ perfectly/RB sensible/JJ projects/NNS ./.

When/WRB INTERREG/NNP is/VBZ implemented/VBN ,/, it/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB coordinated/VBN and/CC synchronised/VBN with/IN the/DT other/JJ financial/JJ instruments/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT funds/NNS deployed/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, problems/NNS will/MD arise/VB in/IN particular/JJ from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN under/IN PHARE/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, funds/NNS are/VBP managed/VBN on/IN an/DT annual/JJ basis/NN and/CC allocation/NN of/IN appropriations/NNS is/VBZ project-related/JJ ,/, whereas/IN INTERREG/NNP funds/NNS are/VBP multiannual/JJ and/CC are/VBP allocated/VBN on/IN a/DT measures-related/JJ basis/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD cause/VB practical/JJ problems/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN despite/IN this/DT it/PRP will/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO implement/VB INTERREG/VBG effectively/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN LEADER/NN proved/VBD itself/PRP to/TO be/VB an/DT effective/JJ instrument/NN to/TO initiate/VB innovative/JJ developments/NNS and/CC pilot/NN projects/NNS both/DT within/IN and/CC outside/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

The/DT preservation/NN of/IN this/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN in/IN particular/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ version/NN -/: LEADER/NNP +/NNP -/: is/VBZ therefore/RB greatly/RB to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

The/DT new/JJ LEADER/NNP +/NNP programme/NN now/RB covers/VBZ all/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD open/VB up/RP greater/JJR possibilities/NNS for/IN potential/JJ projects/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN there/EX to/TO be/VB coordination/NN between/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP and/CC the/DT other/JJ support/NN initiatives/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, but/CC coordination/NN with/IN other/JJ national/JJ support/NN schemes/NNS is/VBZ also/RB just/RB as/RB important/JJ ./.

For/IN similar/JJ reasons/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN paragraph/NN 14/CD which/WDT ,/, with/IN the/DT oral/JJ amendment/NN ,/, dealt/VBD with/IN certain/JJ very/RB justifiable/JJ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, since/IN political/JJ rights/NNS ,/, not/RB just/RB voting/NN in/IN local/JJ elections/NNS ,/, but/CC political/JJ rights/NNS in/IN general/JJ terms/NNS ,/, form/VBP part/NN of/IN the/DT sovereignty/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Given/VBN the/DT oral/JJ amendment/NN ,/, we/PRP felt/VBD we/PRP could/MD vote/VB in/IN favour/NN and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN ./.

This/DT report/NN which/WDT I/PRP voted/VBD against/IN is/VBZ less/RBR concerned/VBN with/IN human/JJ rights/NNS than/IN with/IN `/`` communitisation/NN '/'' or/CC the/DT consolidation/NN of/IN Fortress/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT supposed/VBN progress/NN achieved/VBN in/IN 1999/CD and/CC mentioned/VBN by/IN the/DT report/NN only/RB occurred/VBD in/IN the/DT Dublin/NNP Conventions/NNP and/CC Schengen/NNP Agreements/NNP and/CC a/DT further/JJ action/NN plan/NN from/IN Tampere/NNP which/WDT all/DT restrict/VBP the/DT rights/NNS of/IN immigrants/NNS ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT backward/JJ step/NN ./.

Europe/NNP is/VBZ continuing/VBG to/TO expel/VB nationals/NNS arriving/VBG from/IN countries/NNS regarded/VBN as/RB dangerous/JJ by/IN the/DT Office/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS High/NNP Commissioner/NNP for/IN Refugees/NNP ./.

The/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Schengen/NNP clearly/RB finds/VBZ it/PRP much/RB easier/JJR to/TO hound/VB the/DT persecuted/NN from/IN the/DT south/NN than/IN dictators/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT UN/NNP estimates/VBZ that/IN we/PRP will/MD need/VB 159/CD million/CD immigrants/NNS to/TO maintain/VB a/DT stable/JJ population/NN between/IN now/RB and/CC the/DT year/NN 2025/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN I/PRP was/VBD Mayor/NNP of/IN Bilbao/NNP during/IN the/DT nineties/NNS ,/, which/WDT gave/VBD me/PRP the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO present/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ urban/JJ pilot/NN projects/NNS to/TO be/VB subsidised/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

In/IN view/NN of/IN this/DT concentration/NN on/IN a/DT limited/JJ number/NN of/IN projects/NNS ,/, the/DT publication/NN and/CC dissemination/NN of/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ URBAN/NNP Community/NNP Initiative/NNP will/MD perhaps/RB be/VB particularly/RB important/JJ to/TO achieve/VB a/DT multiplier/NN effect/NN ./.

Clearly/RB some/DT people/NNS are/VBP profiting/VBG from/IN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO indulge/VB in/IN another/DT budget/NN bidding/NN race/NN which/WDT is/VBZ particularly/RB mistimed/JJ when/WRB the/DT convergence/JJ criteria/NNS for/IN EMU/NNP are/VBP imposing/VBG a/DT very/RB strict/JJ slimming/JJ regime/NN on/IN the/DT national/JJ budgets/NNS ./.

Decourri脙拧re/JJ report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0028/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT INTERREG/NNP programme/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB close/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ hearts/NNS ./.

Like/IN many/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO safeguard/VB this/DT initiative/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP live/VBP in/IN the/DT Sarre-Lor-Lux/JJ Sud/NNP region/NN of/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP well/RB aware/JJ that/IN the/DT regions/NNS are/VBP where/WRB Europe/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG created/VBN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP where/WRB we/PRP live/VBP the/DT European/JJ experience/NN on/IN a/DT daily/JJ basis/NN and/CC where/WRB the/DT people/NNS make/VBP European/JJ construction/NN come/VB alive/JJ ./.

These/DT projects/NNS must/MD therefore/RB be/VB properly/RB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN and/CC must/MD integrate/VB sustainable/JJ development/NN ./.

Why/WRB am/VBP I/PRP stressing/VBG this/DT point/NN ?/.

The/DT answer/NN is/VBZ quite/RB simply/JJ because/IN the/DT projects/NNS currently/RB being/VBG submitted/VBN are/VBP still/RB too/RB often/RB damaging/JJ to/TO the/DT environment/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT way/NN they/PRP are/VBP submitted/VBN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, to/TO accept/VB new/JJ roads/NNS is/VBZ to/TO accept/VB new/JJ pollution/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT goes/VBZ totally/RB against/IN the/DT policies/NNS which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG to/TO fight/VB greenhouse/NN gas/NN emissions/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT environmental/JJ pillar/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ integrated/VBN into/IN the/DT projects/NNS submitted/VBN and/CC that/IN the/DT goal/NN of/IN reducing/VBG CO2/NNP for/IN example/NN forms/VBZ an/DT experimental/JJ added/VBN value/NN in/IN the/DT projects/NNS proposed/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP particularly/RB thinking/VBG in/IN this/DT respect/NN of/IN certain/JJ infrastructures/NNS which/WDT are/VBP under/IN construction/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP still/RB wavering/VBG ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, between/IN rail/NN and/CC road/NN for/IN routes/NNS through/IN vulnerable/JJ areas/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Pyrenees/NNP ,/, as/RB in/IN the/DT Aspe/NNP valley/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP also/RB thinking/VBG of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ region/NN where/WRB my/PRP$ government/NN is/VBZ still/RB debating/VBG whether/IN to/TO route/VB the/DT railway/NN or/CC to/TO build/VB a/DT second/JJ motorway/NN ,/, the/DT A32/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN too/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB particularly/RB attentive/JJ about/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN there/EX is/VBZ real/JJ cohesion/NN between/IN the/DT various/JJ policies/NNS ,/, specifically/RB in/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP programmes/NNS which/WDT are/VBP being/VBG submitted/VBN ./.

These/DT frontiers/NNS stretch/VBP as/RB far/RB as/IN African/JJ states/NNS and/CC the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP :/: we/PRP must/MD take/VB greater/JJR account/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ to/TO develop/VB coastal/JJ regions/NNS in/IN every/DT part/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

As/IN an/DT MEP/NNP from/IN a/DT border/NN region/NN ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP this/DT third/JJ INTERREG/NN initiative/NN with/IN great/JJ interest/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD never/RB talk/VB enough/RB about/RB the/DT difficulties/NNS experienced/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN by/IN maritime/JJ and/CC landlocked/JJ border/NN regions/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN cut/VBN off/RP economically/RB ,/, socially/NNP and/CC culturally/NN ./.

Due/JJ to/TO the/DT existence/NN of/IN these/DT borders/NNS ,/, they/PRP have/VBP become/VBN peripheral/JJ areas/NNS within/IN the/DT countries/NNS to/TO which/WDT they/PRP belong/VBP ./.

This/DT has/VBZ too/RB often/RB led/VBN the/DT national/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO neglect/VB these/DT regions/NNS in/IN national/JJ policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT INTERREG/NNP Community/NNP Initiative/NNP was/VBD launched/VBN in/IN 1990/CD ./.

This/DT programme/NN was/VBD designed/VBN to/TO encourage/VB cross-border/JJ ,/, transnational/JJ and/CC interregional/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC to/TO promote/VB balanced/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP territory/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO enhance/VB economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

INTERREG/NNP serves/VBZ principally/RB to/TO fund/VB Community/NNP schemes/NNS to/TO develop/VB SMEs/NNP ,/, education/NN and/CC training/NN ,/, cultural/JJ exchanges/NNS ,/, action/NN to/TO combat/NN health/NN problems/NNS ,/, the/DT protection/NN and/CC improvement/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, energy/NN ,/, transport/NN and/CC telecommunications/NN networks/NNS ./.

I/PRP must/MD stress/VB that/IN interregional/JJ cooperation/NN significantly/RB encourages/VBZ the/DT involvement/NN of/IN local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN ./.

More/RBR active/JJ participation/NN by/IN these/DT authorities/NNS in/IN Community/NNP initiatives/NNS should/MD be/VB promoted/VBN ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS they/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB limited/VBN capacity/NN for/IN cooperation/NN because/RB of/IN the/DT different/JJ legal/JJ frameworks/NNS and/CC different/JJ levels/NNS of/IN development/NN on/IN either/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT border/NN ./.

In/IN cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, greater/JJR emphasis/NN must/MD be/VB placed/VBN on/IN improving/VBG the/DT conditions/NNS for/IN the/DT economic/JJ activity/NN of/IN the/DT small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ undertakings/NNS which/WDT are/VBP the/DT job/NN creators/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT same/JJ respect/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN structural/JJ unemployment/NN is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN 50/CD %/NN of/IN all/DT unemployment/NN ,/, the/DT INTERREG/NNP funds/NNS made/VBN available/JJ must/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO supplement/VB national/JJ measures/NNS promoting/VBG employment/NN ./.

Obstacles/NNS too/RB often/RB caused/VBN by/IN double/JJ taxation/NN and/CC social/JJ protection/NN are/VBP preventing/VBG ,/, braking/VBG or/CC hindering/VBG cross-border/JJ mobility/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT projects/NNS included/VBD within/IN the/DT programmes/NNS can/MD help/VB to/TO provide/VB solutions/NNS to/TO these/DT problems/NNS and/CC to/TO implement/VB in/IN practical/JJ terms/NNS the/DT principle/NN of/IN free/JJ movement/NN of/IN workers/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ in/IN a/DT bad/JJ way/NN in/IN my/PRP$ region/NN !/. ./.

INTERREG/NNP resources/NNS must/MD also/RB contribute/VB to/TO the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ research/NN area/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ ,/, expectations/NNS in/IN the/DT regions/NNS about/IN this/DT initiative/NN are/VBP high/JJ given/VBN that/IN small/JJ towns/NNS not/RB eligible/JJ for/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD funding/NN are/VBP hoping/VBG to/TO obtain/VB compensation/NN through/IN INTERREG/VBG !/. ./.

The/DT challenges/NNS are/VBP therefore/RB immense/JJ ./.

The/DT integration/NN of/IN the/DT border/NN regions/NNS will/MD be/VB an/DT essential/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT future/JJ European/JJ regional/JJ development/NN policy/NN !/. ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP everyone/NN ,/, like/IN Mr/NNP Decourri脙拧re/NNP ,/, whom/WP I/PRP congratulate/VB ,/, will/MD realise/VB this/DT !/. ./.

-/: -LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- The/DT INTERREG/NNP Community/NNP Initiative/NNP is/VBZ just/RB one/CD element/NN of/IN an/DT ill-fated/JJ European/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

This/DT apparently/RB generous/JJ policy/NN ,/, officially/RB intended/VBN to/TO help/VB problem/NN regions/NNS ,/, is/VBZ a/DT fool/NN '/POS s/JJ bargain/NN for/IN French/JJ taxpayers/NNS ./.

France/NNP contributes/VBZ 17/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ budget/NN yet/RB will/MD receive/VB only/RB 8/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT regional/JJ Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

Between/IN 1994/CD and/CC 1999/CD ,/, our/PRP$ regions/NNS annually/RB received/VBD an/DT average/NN of/IN FF/NNP 15.4/CD billion/CD but/CC will/MD receive/VB only/RB FF/NNP 14.7/CD billion/CD between/IN 2000/CD and/CC 2006/CD ./.

My/PRP$ region/NN of/IN Nord-Pas-de-Calais/NNP will/MD be/VB particularly/RB affected/VBN with/IN French/NNP Hainaut/NNP losing/VBG the/DT aid/NN paid/VBN to/TO Objective/VB 1/CD regions/NNS ./.

This/DT loss/NN is/VBZ unjustified/VBN in/IN a/DT region/NN whose/WP$ main/JJ activities/NNS have/VBP been/VBN ruined/VBN by/IN free-trade/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT European/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN also/RB reinforces/VBZ the/DT centralism/NN of/IN Brussels/NNP with/IN which/WDT the/DT regional/JJ authorities/NNS are/VBP invited/VBN to/TO negotiate/VB directly/RB on/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN regions/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT regions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP weaker/JJR than/IN the/DT nation/NN states/NNS ,/, will/MD easily/RB submit/VB to/TO Brussels/NNP ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN ,/, launched/VBN in/IN 1990/CD to/TO prepare/VB the/DT border/NN regions/NNS for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP without/IN borders/NNS and/CC therefore/RB without/IN nations/NNS ,/, sits/VBZ comfortably/RB within/IN this/DT philosophy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Decourri脙拧re/NNP does/VBZ show/VB some/DT common/JJ sense/NN by/IN denouncing/VBG the/DT failings/NNS of/IN the/DT Brussels/NNP technocrats/NNS ./.

These/DT failings/NNS will/MD result/VB in/IN particular/JJ in/IN the/DT late/JJ implementation/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP and/CC therefore/RB in/IN financial/JJ losses/NNS for/IN the/DT regions/NNS in/IN receipt/NN of/IN aid/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN about/IN asking/VBG for/IN more/JJR attention/NN to/TO be/VB paid/VBN to/TO small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ undertakings/NNS and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, about/IN refusing/VBG to/TO use/VB outside/JJ service/NN providers/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT procedures/NNS which/WDT caused/VBD the/DT corruption/NN scandal/NN in/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, these/DT isolated/VBD elements/NNS which/WDT make/VBP sense/NN and/CC for/IN which/WDT we/PRP voted/VBD ,/, in/IN no/DT way/NN remedy/VB the/DT Eurofederalist/NNP philosophy/NN which/WDT characterises/VBZ the/DT Community/NNP initiatives/NNS ,/, particularly/RB INTERREG/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT National/NNP Front/NNP voted/VBD against/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ delivered/VBN an/DT opinion/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP Community/NNP Initiative/NNP concerning/VBG cross-border/JJ ,/, transnational/JJ and/CC interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO defend/VB an/DT amendment/NN tabled/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ group/NN on/IN the/DT maritime/JJ aspect/NN of/IN this/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB involve/VB the/DT concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT Atlantic/NNP Arc/NNP but/CC rather/RB the/DT need/NN to/TO integrate/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN maritime/JJ borders/NNS into/IN strand/JJ A/NN on/IN cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT Commission/NNP guidelines/NNS ,/, few/JJ maritime/NN areas/NNS are/VBP eligible/JJ for/IN INTERREG/NNP IIIA/NNP ./.

The/DT amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT Decourri脙拧re/NNP report/NN aim/VBP to/TO make/VB INTERREG/NNP more/RBR maritime-oriented/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ development/NN which/WDT must/MD be/VB supported/VBN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN stake/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ reluctance/NN on/IN this/DT subject/NN as/IN it/PRP announced/VBD during/IN the/DT symposium/NN on/IN the/DT presentation/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP last/JJ November/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN preventing/VBG the/DT recognition/NN of/IN maritime/JJ borders/NNS amounts/VBZ to/TO denying/VBG the/DT existence/NN of/IN an/DT area/NN which/WDT has/VBZ great/JJ potential/NN for/IN projects/NNS and/CC innovation/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB has/VBZ excellent/JJ cultural/JJ and/CC relational/JJ links/NNS ,/, through/IN twinnings/NNS for/IN example/NN ./.

INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ,/, strand/JJ A/NN ,/, would/MD allow/VB the/DT regions/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN to/TO advance/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN structural/JJ projects/NNS needed/VBN to/TO develop/VB small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ undertakings/NNS and/CC to/TO promote/VB research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN through/IN knowledge/NN transfer/NN ./.

This/DT policy/NN would/MD have/VB important/JJ economic/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN the/DT fishing/NN industry/NN in/IN Brittany/NNP in/IN that/WDT catches/NNS could/MD be/VB unloaded/VBN at/IN Irish/JJ advance/NN bases/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO then/RB be/VB transported/VBN to/TO the/DT Breton/NNP agri-foodstuffs/JJ industry/NN ./.

The/DT integration/NN of/IN the/DT maritime/JJ border/NN into/IN strand/JJ A/NN would/MD finally/RB allow/VB the/DT western/JJ periphery/NN to/TO be/VB recognised/VBN as/IN a/DT unique/JJ and/CC important/JJ economic/JJ area/NN which/WDT is/VBZ confronted/VBN by/IN the/DT `/`` continentalisation/NN '/'' of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT maritime/JJ world/NN has/VBZ great/JJ potential/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB must/MD not/RB leave/VB it/PRP out/IN of/IN innovative/JJ and/CC pilot/NN Community/NN programmes/NNS which/WDT will/MD allow/VB the/DT new/JJ geographical/JJ and/CC economic/JJ map/NN of/IN Europe/NNP to/TO be/VB defined/VBN ./. ./.

We/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO a/DT fruitful/JJ dialogue/NN with/IN you/PRP on/IN this/DT ./.

Regarding/VBG enlargement/NN :/: what/WDT plans/NNS does/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP have/VB to/TO involve/VB the/DT applicant/NN states/NNS in/IN debates/NNS on/IN these/DT new/JJ laws/NNS ,/, given/VBN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP clearly/RB expects/VBZ the/DT laws/NNS envisaged/VBD in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP to/TO form/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT acquis/JJ communautaire/NN by/IN 2003/CD ?/.

President/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mrs/NNP Ahern/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Jackson/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ words/NNS of/IN support/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

I/PRP find/VBP that/DT encouraging/JJ and/CC I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO further/JJ discussions/NNS with/IN them/PRP and/CC other/JJ Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT issues/NNS that/IN they/PRP raised/VBD ./.

Mrs/NNP Ahern/NNP raised/VBD the/DT issue/NN of/IN liability/NN ./.

That/DT of/IN course/NN is/VBZ not/RB specifically/RB addressed/VBN in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP except/IN for/IN the/DT reference/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD be/VB putting/VBG in/IN place/NN provisions/NNS -/: and/CC there/EX are/VBP already/RB some/DT -/: relating/VBG to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN traceability/NN ./.

Once/IN that/DT is/VBZ done/VBN ,/, issues/NNS such/JJ as/IN liability/NN can/MD be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP not/RB given/VBN full/JJ and/CC detailed/JJ consideration/NN to/TO issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO and/CC surrounding/VBG questions/NNS of/IN liability/NN despite/IN my/PRP$ background/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN there/EX may/MD very/RB well/RB be/VB subsidiarity/JJ issues/NNS involved/VBN ./.

But/CC I/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN on/IN board/NN your/PRP$ suggestion/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD give/VB it/PRP further/JJ consideration/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP asked/VBD me/PRP about/IN establishing/VBG a/DT positive/JJ list/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT issues/NNS that/IN we/PRP address/VBP in/IN the/DT annex/NN to/TO the/DT legislation/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT intention/NN is/VBZ to/TO establish/VB a/DT positive/JJ list/NN for/IN feed/NN material/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN the/DT list/NN is/VBZ ,/, as/IN I/PRP say/VBP ,/, a/DT negative/JJ list/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ added/VBN to/TO as/IN required/JJ ./.

The/DT establishment/NN of/IN the/DT positive/JJ list/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT issues/NNS set/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT annex/NN with/IN a/DT date/NN attached/VBN to/TO it/PRP ,/, 2002/CD in/IN fact/NN ./.

The/DT rapid/JJ alert/JJ system/NN for/IN feed/NN is/VBZ something/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN as/IN a/DT gap/NN in/IN the/DT legislation/NN ./.

Rapid/NNP alert/NNP is/VBZ there/RB for/IN food/NN but/CC not/RB for/IN feed/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ wrong/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO identify/VB it/PRP and/CC to/TO establish/VB legislation/NN to/TO close/VB that/DT gap/NN and/CC that/WDT will/MD be/VB done/VBN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT next/JJ time/NN you/PRP ask/VBP me/PRP the/DT question/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO give/VB you/PRP more/RBR detailed/JJ information/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Jackson/NNP has/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP 24/CD new/JJ and/CC 20/CD amending/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN legislation/NN and/CC asks/VBZ whether/IN this/DT compounds/VBZ over-regulation/JJ ./.

I/PRP should/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT pieces/NNS of/IN legislation/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO close/VB gaps/NNS in/IN existing/VBG legislation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB so/RB much/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN new/JJ regimes/NNS or/CC further/JJ regulation/NN ,/, although/IN that/DT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC of/IN identifying/VBG where/WRB there/EX are/VBP gaps/NNS and/CC loopholes/NNS in/IN the/DT chain/NN from/IN farm/NN to/TO table/NN and/CC closing/VBG them/PRP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT reference/NN to/TO applicant/NN states/NNS and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ something/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP in/IN mind/NN ./.

Standards/NNP of/IN food/NN safety/NN and/CC indeed/RB other/JJ areas/NNS of/IN safety/NN are/VBP obviously/RB of/IN critical/JJ importance/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO enlargement/VB and/CC this/DT is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP drawn/VBN to/TO the/DT attention/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Verheugen/NNP ./.

What/WP I/PRP would/MD very/RB much/RB like/VB you/PRP to/TO tell/VB me/PRP is/VBZ how/WRB you/PRP intend/VBP to/TO guarantee/VB that/IN a/DT new/JJ authority/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, whatever/WDT name/NN it/PRP goes/VBZ by/IN ,/, will/MD be/VB given/VBN influence/NN over/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, who/WP in/IN this/DT authority/NN will/MD have/VB the/DT say/NN in/IN matters/NNS ,/, and/CC who/WP will/MD issue/VB orders/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO dictate/VB anything/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN content/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD insist/VB on/IN Parliament/NNP retaining/VBG the/DT rights/NNS accorded/VBN it/PRP under/IN Maastricht/NNP and/CC Amsterdam/NNP ,/, and/CC even/RB extending/VBG them/PRP ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB fear/VBP that/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO have/VB yet/RB another/DT authority/NN that/WDT flies/VBZ through/IN Europe/NNP anonymously/NNP like/IN a/DT satellite/NN ;/: an/DT authority/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN would/MD be/VB anathema/VBN to/TO me/PRP and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB come/VB to/TO that/DT ./.

I/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

But/CC do/VBP you/PRP envisage/VB that/IN the/DT Food/NNP Safety/NNP Agency/NNP will/MD have/VB enough/JJ teeth/NNS to/TO prevent/VB something/NN like/IN the/DT beef/NN war/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN and/CC France/NNP 's/POS refusal/NN to/TO lift/VB the/DT ban/NN ?/.

You/PRP mentioned/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP being/VBG able/JJ to/TO withhold/VB grants/NNS and/CC subsidies/NNS from/IN countries/NNS who/WP are/VBP acting/VBG in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN France/NNP is/VBZ acting/VBG ./.

Would/MD you/PRP also/RB propose/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD give/VB interim/JJ payments/NNS for/IN instance/NN ,/, similar/JJ to/TO the/DT one/NN that/IN the/DT British/JJ farmers/NNS are/VBP asking/VBG for/IN at/IN the/DT moment/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, you/PRP said/VBD during/IN last/JJ week/NN '/POS s/JJ information/NN session/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD your/PRP$ view/NN that/IN any/DT future/JJ EU/NNP food/NN agency/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB located/VBN on/IN the/DT periphery/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP did/VBD not/RB mention/VB what/WP that/DT periphery/NN was/VBD ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT EU/JJ unit/NN located/VBN in/IN Dublin/NNP has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN physical/JJ distance/NN is/VBZ no/DT barrier/NN these/DT days/NNS to/TO communication/NN and/CC having/VBG an/DT effective/JJ influence/NN on/IN matters/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN suggested/VBN that/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ tasks/NNS of/IN a/DT future/JJ food/NN authority/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO gather/VB ,/, publish/VB and/CC coordinate/VB data/NNS ,/, make/VB recommendations/NNS for/IN improved/VBN food/NN safety/NN ,/, and/CC -/: as/IN you/PRP said/VBD -/: collect/VB scientific/JJ data/NNS and/CC popularise/NNS that/DT information/NN for/IN consumers/NNS ./.

All/PDT this/DT will/MD be/VB managed/VBN with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN modern/JJ technology/NN in/IN any/DT area/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP on/IN what/WP you/PRP base/VBP your/PRP$ ideas/NNS for/IN a/DT location/NN ?/.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT makeup/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN :/: first/RB of/IN all/DT it/PRP will/MD employ/VB in-house/JJ scientists/NNS who/WP will/MD liaise/VB with/IN and/CC consult/VB with/IN scientists/NNS who/WP are/VBP experts/NNS in/IN the/DT particular/JJ field/NN that/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG considered/VBN at/IN any/DT particular/JJ time/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO that/DT ,/, the/DT food/NN safety/NN authority/NN will/MD have/VB a/DT board/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD notice/VB in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN specific/JJ about/IN the/DT makeup/NN of/IN that/DT board/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN which/WDT I/PRP expect/VBP will/MD be/VB discussed/VBN between/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS and/CC months/NNS ./.

I/PRP envisage/VBP that/IN the/DT board/NN 's/POS membership/NN will/MD be/VB made/VBN up/RP from/IN stakeholders/NNS or/CC representatives/NNS of/IN stakeholders/NNS ./.

Its/PRP$ function/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB set/VBN out/RP in/IN detail/NN in/IN the/DT proposal/NN I/PRP will/MD bring/VB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN September/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP not/RB done/VBN that/DT yet/CC but/CC it/PRP will/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN September/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB expect/VB that/IN the/DT board/NN will/MD have/VB any/DT function/NN in/IN directing/VBG the/DT scientists/NNS how/WRB to/TO do/VB their/PRP$ work/NN ./.

That/DT would/MD erode/VB the/DT independence/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ advice/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP would/MD have/VB an/DT overall/JJ remit/NN ,/, particularly/RB ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, in/IN requesting/VBG the/DT authority/NN to/TO investigate/VB particular/JJ areas/NNS requiring/VBG research/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP asks/VBZ whether/IN Parliament/NNP will/MD have/VB a/DT say/NN in/IN that/DT ./.

That/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN for/IN consideration/NN and/CC discussion/NN ./.

There/EX may/MD be/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN views/NNS on/IN that/DT ./.

Some/DT may/MD take/VB the/DT view/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB inappropriate/JJ for/IN Parliament/NNP or/CC Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP -/: or/CC indeed/RB Parliament/NNP nominees/NNS -/: to/TO be/VB members/NNS of/IN the/DT board/NN ./.

Others/NNS may/MD take/VB the/DT view/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT valuable/JJ exercise/NN if/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, through/IN nominees/NNS or/CC even/RB MEPs/NNP themselves/PRP ,/, were/VBD able/JJ to/TO have/VB an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO discuss/VB what/WP issues/NNS should/MD be/VB investigated/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN for/IN consideration/NN but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN ruled/VBN out/RP ./.

Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP also/RB raised/VBD the/DT question/NN of/IN anonymity/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ that/IN he/PRP raised/VBD it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ for/IN this/DT authority/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT high/JJ profile/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB visible/JJ ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB known/VBN ./.

Consumers/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD know/VB of/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN authority/NN ./.

They/PRP will/MD be/VB aware/JJ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN from/IN the/DT authority/NN before/IN under/IN other/JJ circumstances/NNS and/CC hopefully/RB will/MD have/VB some/DT bedrock/NN of/IN confidence/NN already/RB built/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT pronouncements/NNS from/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ fundamentally/RB essential/JJ therefore/RB that/IN the/DT authority/NN is/VBZ not/RB anonymous/JJ ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB visible/JJ ./.

I/PRP will/MD do/VB everything/NN I/PRP can/MD to/TO promote/VB that/DT high/JJ profile/NN role/NN for/IN the/DT authority/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Lynne/NNP asks/VBZ whether/IN the/DT authority/NN will/MD have/VB sufficient/JJ teeth/NNS ./.

I/PRP suspect/VBP that/IN the/DT question/NN is/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN where/WRB the/DT competence/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN begins/VBZ and/CC ends/VBZ and/CC where/WRB the/DT competence/NN and/CC authority/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN agencies/NNS in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS begin/VB and/CC end/VB ./.

There/EX would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB an/DT interaction/NN at/IN scientific/JJ level/NN ./.

Quite/RB clearly/RB it/PRP is/VBZ undesirable/JJ to/TO have/VB situations/NNS develop/VBP whereby/WRB scientists/NNS working/VBG for/IN ,/, or/CC advising/VBG ,/, the/DT food/NN safety/NN authority/NN at/IN Community/NNP level/NN may/MD be/VB in/IN disagreement/NN with/IN some/DT scientific/JJ opinion/NN at/IN Member/NNP State/NNP level/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ an/DT undesirable/JJ situation/NN ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB that/DT situation/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN things/NNS that/WDT undermine/VBP consumer/NN confidence/NN -/: lack/NN of/IN information/NN is/VBZ one/CD ./.

But/CC information/NN which/WDT includes/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ disagreement/NN between/IN scientists/NNS on/IN core/JJ issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO food/NN safety/NN is/VBZ also/RB an/DT issue/NN of/IN serious/JJ concern/NN ./.

Over/IN time/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/VBD a/DT moment/NN ago/RB ,/, not/RB only/JJ will/MD the/DT profile/NN of/IN the/DT authority/NN be/VB raised/VBN but/CC its/PRP$ expertise/NN ,/, its/PRP$ moral/JJ authority/NN will/MD be/VB increased/VBN and/CC enhanced/VBN over/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN so/RB that/IN its/PRP$ views/NNS are/VBP accepted/VBN and/CC not/RB challenged/VBD ./.

This/DT situation/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN over/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN ./.

You/PRP can/MD not/RB legislate/VB for/IN consumer/NN confidence/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ earned/VBN over/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD have/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN seeing/VBG that/IN the/DT opinions/NNS of/IN the/DT Authority/NNP on/IN scientific/JJ matters/NNS are/VBP enforced/VBN by/IN way/NN of/IN passing/VBG legislation/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT function/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Parliament/NNP and/CC Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP realise/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT somewhat/RB time-consuming/JJ exercise/NN but/CC ,/, nonetheless/RB ,/, the/DT establishment/NN of/IN legislation/NN arising/VBG out/RP of/IN the/DT opinions/NNS of/IN the/DT Authority/NNP is/VBZ -/: I/PRP believe/VBP -/: the/DT way/NN forward/RB ./.

Any/DT failure/NN to/TO comply/VB with/IN legislation/NN is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN the/DT courts/NNS in/IN the/DT normal/JJ way/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT issues/NNS that/IN we/PRP may/MD have/VB to/TO address/VB over/IN time/NN is/VBZ the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT speed/NN of/IN response/NN in/IN such/JJ circumstance/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP to/TO see/VB if/IN something/NN can/MD be/VB put/VBN in/IN place/NN to/TO get/VB us/PRP a/DT faster/JJR response/NN from/IN the/DT court/NN process/NN ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO grants/NNS and/CC subsidies/NNS :/: yes/RB ,/, consideration/NN has/VBZ been/VBN given/VBN to/TO that/DT issue/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD require/VB the/DT advice/NN of/IN legal/JJ services/NNS and/CC that/DT will/MD be/VB sought/VBN ,/, particularly/RB bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN it/PRP may/MD provide/VB a/DT speedy/JJ response/NN to/TO a/DT failure/NN to/TO comply/VB with/IN Community/NNP law/NN pending/VBG a/DT court/NN ruling/NN ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO Mrs/NNP Lynne/NNP 's/POS question/NN on/IN interim/JJ payments/NNS :/: that/DT is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN that/WDT might/MD very/RB well/RB be/VB addressed/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP as/IN it/PRP relates/VBZ to/TO budget/NN issues/NNS ./.

Mrs/NNP Myller/NNP then/RB asked/VBD me/PRP about/IN the/DT location/NN of/IN the/DT Authority/NNP ./.

No/DT decision/NN has/VBZ been/VBN taken/VBN in/IN relation/NN to/TO that/DT other/JJ than/IN to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR likely/JJ that/IN the/DT Authority/NNP will/MD be/VB located/JJ centrally/RB rather/RB than/IN on/IN the/DT periphery/NN ./.

I/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN the/DT FEO/NNP is/VBZ located/VBN in/IN Dublin/NNP and/CC ,/, although/IN I/PRP come/VBP from/IN that/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN myself/PRP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO accept/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT centre/NN of/IN Europe/NNP !/NNP ./.

But/CC the/DT FVO/NNP is/VBZ in/IN quite/RB a/DT different/JJ situation/NN from/IN the/DT Food/NNP Safety/NNP Authority/NNP ./.

The/DT FVO/NNP is/VBZ made/VBN up/RP of/IN independent/JJ scientists/NNS and/CC vets/NNS and/CC so/RB on/IN who/WP travel/VBP from/IN some/DT location/NN where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT airport/NN -/: quite/RB clearly/RB we/PRP have/VBP an/DT airport/NN in/IN Dublin/NNP ./.

The/DT Food/NNP Safety/NNP Authority/NNP 's/POS situation/NN is/VBZ quite/RB different/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB close/RB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP because/RB of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN interaction/NN between/IN the/DT scientists/NNS involved/VBN in/IN the/DT Food/NNP Safety/NNP Authority/NNP and/CC those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN the/DT initiation/NN of/IN legislation/NN ./.

Equally/RB ,/, the/DT scientists/NNS will/MD wish/VB to/TO have/VB some/DT input/NN into/IN the/DT legal/JJ process/NN or/CC the/DT policy-making/VBG process/NN or/CC the/DT law-drafting/JJ process/NN ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT legislation/NN meets/VBZ the/DT ills/NNS that/IN they/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP desirable/JJ for/IN an/DT authority/NN of/IN this/DT type/NN to/TO be/VB centrally/RB located/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ judgement/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.

It/PRP may/MD be/VB a/DT matter/NN for/IN discussion/NN here/RB and/CC elsewhere/RB and/CC I/PRP will/MD listen/VB to/TO any/DT suggestions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP made/VBN but/CC my/PRP$ preliminary/JJ conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT Authority/NNP should/MD be/VB located/JJ centrally/RB rather/RB than/IN on/IN the/DT periphery/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP feel/VBP that/IN these/DT sessions/NNS after/IN a/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN are/VBP important/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD suggest/VB that/IN we/PRP require/VBP more/JJR time/NN than/IN the/DT half-hour/NN that/WDT is/VBZ allocated/VBN to/TO them/PRP ./.

As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB ,/, half-an-hour/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB anything/NN like/IN enough/JJ time/NN for/IN such/PDT a/DT session/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ following/VBG with/IN interest/NN the/DT planned/VBN construction/NN of/IN a/DT nuclear/JJ power/NN plant/NN in/IN Akkuyu/NNP ,/, Turkey/NNP and/CC recognises/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ plant/NN follows/VBZ the/DT highest/JJS internationally/RB accepted/VBD nuclear/JJ safety/NN standards/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO our/PRP$ information/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN on/IN the/DT selection/NN of/IN a/DT bidder/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN taken/VBN yet/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP acknowledges/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN Turkey/NNP has/VBZ signed/VBN and/CC ratified/VBN the/DT convention/NN on/IN nuclear/JJ safety/NN and/CC recognises/VBZ that/IN the/DT responsibility/NN for/IN granting/VBG licences/NNS and/CC regulating/VBG the/DT siting/NN ,/, construction/NN ,/, commissioning/NN ,/, operation/NN and/CC decommissioning/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ power/NN plants/NNS in/IN Turkey/NNP rests/VBZ entirely/RB with/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ Atomic/NNP Energy/NNP Authority/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB a/DT mandate/NN to/TO impose/VB any/DT limits/NNS on/IN decisions/NNS taken/VBN by/IN any/DT country/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN energy/NN production/NN ,/, including/VBG the/DT nuclear/JJ option/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN the/DT public/JJ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT recorded/VBN seismic/JJ activity/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN the/DT Ecemis/NNP fault/NN line/NN located/VBN in/IN the/DT vicinity/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN plant/NN site/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO information/NN received/VBN from/IN the/DT International/NNP Atomic/NNP Agency/NNP ,/, the/DT design/NN of/IN the/DT plant/NN takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN earthquakes/NNS stronger/JJR than/IN any/DT ever/RB recorded/VBN in/IN the/DT area/NN and/CC particularly/RB more/JJR than/IN ten/CD times/NNS stronger/JJR than/IN the/DT one/NN registered/JJ in/IN June/NNP 1998/CD in/IN Adana/NNP ./.

Large/JJ design/NN margins/NNS are/VBP being/VBG provided/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB safe/JJ operation/NN of/IN the/DT plant/NN according/VBG to/TO the/DT environmental/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN the/DT site/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ also/RB aware/JJ of/IN concern/NN about/IN the/DT possible/JJ intention/NN of/IN using/VBG the/DT plant/NN to/TO produce/VB weapons-grade/JJ material/NN ./.

It/PRP acknowledges/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN Turkey/NNP has/VBZ signed/VBN and/CC ratified/VBN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN the/DT Non-proliferation/NN of/IN Nuclear/NNP Weapons/NNP and/CC has/VBZ subsequently/RB concluded/VBN a/DT comprehensive/JJ safeguards/NNS agreement/NN with/IN the/DT International/NNP Atomic/NNP Energy/NNP Agency/NNP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ reply/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT following/VBG points/NNS :/: Turkey/NNP is/VBZ now/RB a/DT candidate/NN country/NN ./.

This/DT plan/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ energy/NN potential/NN by/IN 2/CD %/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, it/PRP also/RB wishes/VBZ to/TO acquire/VB Cadou/NNP type/NN reactors/NNS from/IN Canada/NNP ,/, which/WDT we/PRP now/RB know/VBP have/VBP already/RB been/VBN used/VBN for/IN nuclear/JJ weapons/NNS in/IN Pakistan/NNP and/CC India/NNP ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ therefore/RB a/DT serious/JJ risk/NN that/IN some/DT idiot/NN will/MD decide/VB that/IN the/DT new/JJ geopolitical/JJ balance/NN of/IN power/NN in/IN the/DT Caucasus/NNPS calls/VBZ for/IN a/DT nearby/JJ country/NN with/IN weapons/NNS grade/NN nuclear/JJ technology/NN ./.

So/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT political/JJ aspect/NN ./.

Now/RB to/TO the/DT technical/JJ aspect/NN ./.

The/DT safety/NN factor/NN in/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN project/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG as/IN an/DT engineer/NN ,/, has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN increasing/VBG safety/NN levels/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT risk/NN of/IN collapse/NN by/IN a/DT factor/NN of/IN ten/CD or/CC twenty/CD ./.

In/IN cases/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ uncertainty/NN ,/, simulators/NNS are/VBP used/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB used/VBD simulators/NNS in/IN cases/NNS relating/VBG to/TO nuclear/JJ energy/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, all/DT high/JJ seismic/JJ risk/NN areas/NNS must/MD be/VB excluded/VBN a/FW priori/FW for/IN nuclear/JJ installations/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT ./.

Therefore/VBN ,/, and/CC given/VBN that/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Turkey/NNP has/VBZ now/RB changed/VBN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ idea/NN if/IN Turkey/NNP discussed/VBD certain/JJ matters/NNS relating/VBG both/DT to/TO the/DT safety/NN of/IN the/DT area/NN in/IN general/NN and/CC the/DT peaceful/JJ development/NN of/IN Turkey/NNP within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

A/DT couple/NN of/IN weeks/NNS ago/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT debate/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN the/DT nuclear/JJ safety/NN issue/NN with/IN special/JJ regard/NN to/TO the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP explained/VBN the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO accept/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT acquis/JJ communautaire/NN on/IN nuclear/JJ safety/NN ./.

So/CC what/WP we/PRP did/VBD was/VBD use/VB political/JJ means/NNS to/TO convince/VB some/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB decommissioning/VBG plans/NNS for/IN some/DT reactors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP considered/VBN not/RB to/TO be/VB upgradable/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Turkey/NNP it/PRP is/VBZ different/JJ ./.

The/DT plant/NN is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB there/RB ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, Mr/NNP Andrews/NNP ,/, you/PRP must/MD understand/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN your/PRP$ interpretation/NN of/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN '/POS s/JJ speech/NN during/IN the/DT meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Development/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT contradiction/NN between/IN our/PRP$ two/CD positions/NNS ,/, quite/RB the/DT opposite/JJ ./.

Unless/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO act/VB like/IN megalomaniacs/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN one/CD presidency/NN perform/VB an/DT exhaustive/JJ inventory/NN of/IN all/DT possible/JJ and/CC imaginary/JJ situations/NNS relating/VBG to/TO all/PDT the/DT enormous/JJ issues/NNS we/PRP face/VBP ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN external/JJ relations/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP can/MD understand/VB ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB easy/JJ to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

All/DT we/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO do/VB is/VBZ get/VB a/DT directory/NN of/IN development/NN and/CC put/VB all/PDT the/DT items/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ programme/NN ,/, one/CD after/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP sufficiently/RB responsible/JJ to/TO realise/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD only/RB include/VB those/DT which/WDT we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO manage/VB during/IN the/DT term/NN of/IN our/PRP$ Presidency/NN and/CC -/: we/PRP should/MD always/RB be/VB aware/JJ of/IN this/DT -/: within/IN governments/NNS '/POS ability/NN to/TO act/NN and/CC within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD understand/VB that/IN there/EX are/VBP limitations/NNS on/IN what/WP we/PRP can/MD achieve/VB ,/, particularly/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN managing/VBG national/JJ indicative/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

You/PRP have/VBP mentioned/VBN Ethiopia/NNP ,/, which/WDT falls/VBZ within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN national/JJ indicative/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, several/JJ Community/NNP actions/NNS to/TO combat/VB AIDS/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP right/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS will/MD probably/RB not/RB do/VB any/DT better/RBR ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN development/NN aid/NN policy/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Europe/NNP has/VBZ absolutely/RB nothing/NN to/TO worry/VB about/RP for/IN the/DT simple/JJ reason/NN that/IN our/PRP$ behaviour/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN compares/VBZ very/RB favourably/JJ with/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Your/PRP$ question/NN switched/VBD to/TO the/DT subject/NN of/IN arms/NNS ,/, a/DT broader/JJR policy/NN issue/NN which/WDT I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB falls/VBZ within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN this/DT question/NN but/CC which/WDT the/DT Council/NNP will/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, address/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, if/IN it/PRP sees/VBZ fit/JJ and/CC if/IN it/PRP decides/VBZ to/TO put/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT specific/JJ context/NN ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT social/JJ problems/NNS caused/VBN by/IN the/DT export/NN of/IN food/NN by/IN the/DT EU/NNP to/TO developing/VBG countries/NNS at/IN prices/NNS below/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN production/NN ?/.

Does/NNP the/DT presidency/NN intend/VB to/TO do/VB anything/NN about/IN this/DT ?/.

Since/IN the/DT author/NN is/VBZ not/RB present/JJ ,/, Question/VB No/DT 13/CD lapses/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD personally/RB like/VB to/TO welcome/VB him/PRP and/CC the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

Please/UH allow/VB me/PRP to/TO remark/VB on/IN how/WRB well-versed/JJ and/CC well-informed/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ on/IN European/JJ affairs/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ case/NN ,/, he/PRP did/VBD not/RB provide/VB what/WP I/PRP would/MD call/VB a/DT satisfactory/JJ answer/NN ./.

Since/IN the/DT Council/NNP recognises/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/WDT culture/NN is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ economic/JJ asset/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, demonstrate/VB this/DT in/IN practice/NN ./.

Saying/VBG that/IN the/DT cultural/JJ dimension/NN is/VBZ governed/VBN by/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN and/CC that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB national/JJ governments/NNS who/WP are/VBP responsible/JJ is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP afraid/JJ ,/, just/RB an/DT excuse/NN ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN answered/VBN ,/, is/VBZ why/WRB ,/, when/WRB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ looking/VBG to/TO increase/VB appropriations/NNS to/TO fund/VB cultural/JJ programmes/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP are/VBP cutting/VBG back/RP on/IN appropriations/NNS and/CC at/IN times/NNS cutting/VBG them/PRP out/RP altogether/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT true/JJ example/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ indifference/NN towards/IN culture/NN ,/, despite/IN its/PRP$ assurances/NNS to/TO the/DT contrary/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN to/TO which/WDT it/PRP attaches/VBZ great/JJ importance/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO ask/VB the/DT Council/NN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ prepared/VBN henceforth/RB to/TO support/VB culture/NN with/IN the/DT same/JJ readiness/NN as/IN it/PRP supported/VBD bananas/NNS ,/, hops/NNP ,/, cows/NNS and/CC Indian/JJ hemp/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Marinos/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB adopting/VBG a/DT purely/RB economic/JJ approach/NN to/TO managing/VBG the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, and/CC therefore/RB ,/, the/DT cultural/JJ dimension/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP will/MD appreciate/VB ,/, one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ main/JJ concerns/NNS ./.

These/DT cultural/JJ dimensions/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, almost/RB always/RB have/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ economic/JJ dimension/NN in/IN turn/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT level/NN of/IN resources/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB called/VBN on/IN specifically/RB to/TO provide/VB aid/NN for/IN cultural/JJ initiatives/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT dimension/NN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO go/VB beyond/IN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, and/CC especially/RB within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

For/IN our/PRP$ part/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD be/VB attempting/VBG to/TO strengthen/VB and/CC consolidate/VB the/DT European/JJ position/NN on/IN cultural/JJ goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS and/CC on/IN activities/NNS in/IN this/DT sphere/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT identifying/JJ feature/NN which/WDT is/VBZ crucial/JJ to/TO the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ image/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ particular/JJ identity/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ ,/, and/CC will/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB ,/, connected/VBN with/IN developments/NNS within/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, both/CC we/PRP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP have/VBP addressed/VBN this/DT issue/NN appropriately/RB ./.

In/IN specific/JJ terms/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO find/VB a/DT common/JJ language/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT mandate/NN given/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT next/JJ round/NN of/IN WTO/NNP negotiations/NNS ,/, at/IN which/WDT this/DT will/MD be/VB a/DT central/JJ issue/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO add/VB that/DT with/IN regard/NN to/TO cultural/JJ policy/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ the/DT audiovisual/JJ dimension/NN ,/, the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP will/MD be/VB paying/VBG very/RB close/JJ attention/NN to/TO extending/VBG and/CC enriching/VBG European/NNP audiovisual/JJ policy/NN by/IN adopting/VBG a/DT Media-Plus/NNP programme/NN which/WDT could/MD go/VB some/DT way/NN towards/IN allaying/VBG Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ main/JJ fears/NNS ./.

We/PRP also/RB intend/VBP to/TO initiate/VB a/DT new/JJ debate/NN ,/, a/DT more/RBR innovative/JJ one/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ film/NN heritage/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN this/DT must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ factors/NNS in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ cultural/JJ identity/NN and/CC of/IN a/DT European/JJ audiovisual/JJ economy/NN ./.

The/DT Presidency/NNP will/MD also/RB concentrate/VB on/IN discussions/NNS about/IN creating/VBG a/DT digital/JJ television/NN system/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB the/DT subject/NN of/IN a/DT conference/NN that/IN we/PRP shall/MD be/VB organising/VBG during/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN February/NNP 2000/CD ./.

But/CC ,/, Mr/NNP Marinos/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT EU/NNP context/NN ,/, culture/NN is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN which/WDT is/VBZ repeatedly/RB raised/VBN in/IN connection/NN with/IN IGC/NNP agendas/NNS ./.

If/IN ,/, by/IN chance/NN ,/, it/PRP were/VBD possible/JJ to/TO agree/VB to/TO include/VB the/DT cultural/JJ dimension/NN in/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN called/VBN the/DT fifth/JJ negotiating/NN box/NN of/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, then/RB this/DT could/MD be/VB suggested/VBN ,/, both/DT by/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ Parliament/NNP taking/NN part/NN in/IN the/DT preparatory/JJ group/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, if/IN consensus/NN could/MD be/VB reached/VBN on/IN this/DT issue/NN at/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, there/EX might/MD eventually/RB be/VB progress/NN ./.

Between/IN EUR/$ 1/CD 500/CD and/CC 2/CD 000/CD billion/CD are/VBP traded/VBN every/DT day/NN on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

In/IN three/CD or/CC four/CD days/NNS ,/, this/DT can/MD equal/VB the/DT total/JJ figure/NN of/IN annual/JJ global/JJ production/NN ,/, or/CC global/JJ GDP/NNS ,/, of/IN approximately/RB EUR/$ 6/CD 000/CD billion/CD ./.

The/DT bulk/NN of/IN these/DT financial/JJ transactions/NNS are/VBP purely/RB speculative/JJ and/CC do/VBP not/RB involve/VB any/DT trade/NN in/IN goods/NNS or/CC investments/NNS ./.

Yet/CC the/DT erratic/JJ movement/NN of/IN these/DT massive/JJ sums/NNS of/IN capital/NN can/MD ,/, in/IN a/DT few/JJ hours/NNS ,/, cause/VB the/DT collapse/NN of/IN a/DT currency/NN or/CC the/DT economy/NN of/IN a/DT country/NN ,/, plunging/VBG its/PRP$ whole/JJ population/NN into/IN recession/NN ./.

Note/NN that/IN this/DT proposed/VBN tax/NN ,/, which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB producing/VBG strong/JJ emotions/NNS in/IN some/DT people/NNS ,/, would/MD be/VB the/DT lowest/JJS tax/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC the/DT lowest/JJS in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN global/JJ taxation/NN ./.

Yet/CC it/PRP would/MD represent/VB the/DT recapture/NN of/IN the/DT areas/NNS seized/VBN from/IN democracy/NN by/IN the/DT financial/JJ sphere/NN ./.

One/CD reason/NN for/IN the/DT acceptance/NN of/IN this/DT proposal/NN ,/, and/CC of/IN the/DT campaigns/NNS by/IN NGOs/NNP such/JJ as/IN ATTAC/NNP ,/, SOLIDAR/NNP or/CC others/NNS which/WDT have/VBP popularised/VBD this/DT proposal/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP would/MD release/VB resources/NNS which/WDT could/MD be/VB allocated/VBN to/TO development/NN programmes/NNS in/IN the/DT poorest/JJS countries/NNS ,/, in/IN areas/NNS such/JJ as/IN education/NN or/CC health/NN ./.

It/PRP could/MD act/VB as/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN asset/NN redistribution/NN in/IN a/DT world/NN where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ both/DT increasing/VBG wealth/NN and/CC increasing/VBG poverty/NN ./.

Many/JJ personalities/NNS and/CC institutions/NNS have/VBP come/VBN out/RP in/IN favour/NN of/IN this/DT tax/NN such/JJ as/IN the/DT Brazilian/JJ President/NN ,/, Fernando/NNP Cardoso/NNP ,/, the/DT Finnish/JJ Government/NN ,/, the/DT Canadian/JJ Parliament/NNP last/JJ March/NN and/CC also/RB Lionel/NNP Jospin/NNP in/IN 1995/CD ./.

This/DT question/NN has/VBZ been/VBN debated/VBN in/IN several/JJ national/JJ parliaments/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

The/DT common/JJ response/NN has/VBZ been/VBN that/IN this/DT tax/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB applied/VBN solely/RB at/IN national/JJ level/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT right/JJ platform/NN for/IN tackling/VBG this/DT is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT oral/JJ question/NN to/TO the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Commission/NNP which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP tabled/VBN with/IN 37/CD other/JJ Members/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ with/IN the/DT compromise/NN motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN with/IN the/DT GUE/NGL/NNP ,/, Greens/EFA/NNP ,/, ELDR/NNP and/CC PSE/NNP Groups/NNS ./.

This/DT motion/NN asks/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO present/VB a/DT report/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP within/IN six/CD months/NNS on/IN the/DT feasibility/NN of/IN this/DT tax/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB asks/VBZ for/IN an/DT examination/NN of/IN the/DT pressures/NNS and/CC financial/JJ sanctions/NNS which/WDT could/MD be/VB applied/VBN against/IN countries/NNS which/WDT encourage/VBP tax/NN evasion/NN or/CC which/WDT maintain/VBP tax/NN havens/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJS common/JJ objections/NNS is/VBZ that/IN such/PDT a/DT tax/NN would/MD be/VB too/RB complex/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT could/MD be/VB said/VBN of/IN any/DT tax/NN ./.

If/IN this/DT argument/NN had/VBD been/VBN accepted/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, then/RB no/DT taxes/NNS would/MD ever/RB have/VB been/VBN created/VBN ./.

The/DT motion/NN also/RB asks/VBZ that/IN a/DT position/NN document/NN ,/, drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Council/NNP ,/, should/MD be/VB submitted/VBN before/IN the/DT next/JJ annual/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT IMF/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD take/VB the/DT initiative/NN and/CC must/MD also/RB ,/, as/IN demanded/VBD in/IN the/DT motion/NN ,/, propose/VB this/DT initiative/NN to/TO the/DT G7/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ primarily/RB a/DT political/JJ question/NN ./.

Europe/NNP must/MD play/VB a/DT role/NN in/IN this/DT new/JJ international/JJ regulation/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP extremely/RB happy/JJ that/DT today/NN ,/, with/IN this/DT debate/NN and/CC this/DT motion/NN ,/, this/DT question/NN is/VBZ now/RB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN European/JJ construction/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO add/VB on/IN this/DT subject/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB discussed/VBN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN introducing/VBG a/DT tax/NN on/IN movements/NNS of/IN capital/NN as/IN Professor/NNP Tobin/NNP suggested/VBD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT creative/JJ initiative/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP know/VBP has/VBZ been/VBN welcomed/VBN by/IN different/JJ industries/NNS across/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC by/IN various/JJ sides/NNS in/IN European/JJ politics/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB put/VBN forward/RP any/DT proposal/NN or/CC initiative/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

As/IN it/PRP falls/VBZ to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO propose/VB any/DT such/JJ initiative/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO adopt/VB a/DT position/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT revenue/NN basis/NN of/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB made/VBN up/RP of/IN very/RB short-term/JJ exchange/NN transactions/NNS ./.

Such/JJ transactions/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT argument/NN ,/, bear/VBP very/RB little/JJ relation/NN to/TO fundamental/JJ economic/JJ variables/NNS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ also/RB just/RB been/VBN underlined/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP D脙/NNP 漏/NNP sir/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, according/VBG to/TO proponents/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Mr/NNP D脙/NNP 漏/NNP sir/NNP ,/, an/DT internationally/NN applied/VBD Tobin/NNP tax/NN would/MD ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, reduce/VB speculative/JJ transactions/NNS and/CC ,/, hence/RB ,/, the/DT volatility/NN of/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD lead/VB to/TO an/DT improvement/NN in/IN economic/JJ prosperity/NN ./.

Taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT considerable/JJ volume/NN of/IN short-term/JJ financial/JJ streams/NNS ,/, even/RB a/DT low/JJ nominal/JJ Tobin/NN tax/NN would/MD yield/VB respectable/JJ sums/NNS of/IN tax/NN revenue/NN ./.

In/IN reality/NN ,/, the/DT motive/NN underlying/VBG the/DT increased/VBN interest/NN in/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN and/CC other/JJ sources/NNS of/IN international/JJ finance/NN in/IN the/DT mid-nineties/NNS was/VBD non-economic/JJ ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD fuelled/VBN by/IN the/DT potential/NN of/IN this/DT tax/NN to/TO generate/VB income/NN for/IN international/JJ ,/, public/JJ programmes/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB demand/NN for/IN such/JJ funds/NNS was/VBD rising/VBG quickly/RB and/CC funding/NN was/VBD increasingly/RB harder/JJR to/TO come/VB by/IN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP recently/RB observed/VBD renewed/VBN interest/NN in/IN a/DT global/JJ tax/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT means/NN of/IN achieving/VBG socially/RB responsible/JJ globalisation/NN ,/, so/RB to/TO speak/VB ./.

Mr/NNP D脙/NNP 漏/NNP sir/NNP too/RB has/VBZ mentioned/VBN this/DT growing/VBG interest/NN on/IN all/DT sides/NNS ./.

But/CC if/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB applied/VBN unilaterally/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB attacks/NNS on/IN a/DT specific/JJ currency/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT tax/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB effective/JJ and/CC it/PRP could/MD harm/VB the/DT internal/JJ financial/JJ market/NN ./.

Put/VB more/RBR strongly/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ that/IN for/IN large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN funds/NNS ,/, the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN will/MD be/VB evaded/VBN by/IN shifting/VBG foreign/JJ exchange/NN rate/NN transactions/NNS to/TO off-shore/JJ tax/NN havens/NNS ./.

In/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT tax/NN could/MD lead/VB to/TO a/DT net/JJ loss/NN of/IN total/JJ economic/JJ prosperity/NN ./.

So/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB effective/JJ if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT sufficient/JJ number/NN of/IN industrialised/JJ countries/NNS which/WDT are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO participate/VB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, even/RB if/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO curb/VB speculations/NNS with/IN currencies/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB the/DT risk/NN that/IN even/RB non-speculative/JJ streams/NNS would/MD be/VB affected/VBN ,/, and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT intention/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT reasons/NNS set/VBN out/RP above/IN ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB see/VB a/DT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN introducing/VBG a/DT European/JJ Tobin/NNP tax/NN ./.

At/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ against/IN any/DT attempt/NN to/TO restrict/VB capital/NN movement/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

In/IN more/JJR direct/JJ terms/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN this/DT measure/NN could/MD be/VB deemed/VBN an/DT indirect/JJ restriction/NN on/IN capital/NN streams/NNS ,/, this/DT would/MD contravene/VB the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP ./.

The/DT correct/JJ speculative/JJ approach/NN ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP ,/, is/VBZ to/TO remove/VB the/DT real/JJ causes/NNS which/WDT lead/VBP to/TO financial/JJ chaos/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN attempting/VBG to/TO suppress/VB its/PRP$ symptoms/NNS by/IN introducing/VBG obstacles/NNS to/TO the/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT markets/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB once/RB again/RB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS on/IN the/DT modus/JJ operandi/NN and/CC the/DT ideological/JJ tactics/NNS behind/IN this/DT oral/JJ question/NN ./.

Also/RB because/IN I/PRP know/VBP how/WRB many/JJ social/JJ democrats/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP share/VBP our/PRP$ criticism/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB just/RB the/DT economic/JJ and/CC financial/JJ policy/NN experts/NNS ./.

We/PRP know/VBP what/WP the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ :/: instability/NN on/IN the/DT markets/NNS as/IN the/DT result/NN of/IN speculation/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT people/NNS asking/VBG the/DT question/NN need/VBP to/TO know/VB that/IN not/RB every/DT instance/NN of/IN instability/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ just/RB so/RB impressively/RB told/VBN us/PRP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT result/NN of/IN speculation/NN ./.

The/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO prevent/VB the/DT crises/NNS in/IN the/DT EEA/NNP in/IN 1992/CD and/CC 1993/CD or/CC the/DT crises/NNS in/IN the/DT south-east/JJ Asian/JJ currencies/NNS in/IN 1997/CD ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP say/VBP this/DT quite/RB clearly/RB ,/, the/DT question/NN is/VBZ ideologically/RB motivated/JJ rather/RB than/IN solution-focused/JJ ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP this/DT to/TO be/VB the/DT wrong/JJ way/NN forward/RB for/IN several/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

Why/WRB do/VBP we/PRP reject/VB the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN and/CC consider/VB it/PRP so/RB questionable/JJ ?/.

First/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ also/RB confirmed/VBN this/DT ,/, because/IN it/PRP places/VBZ a/DT heavy/JJ burden/NN on/IN the/DT capital/NN markets/NNS ./.

Even/RB a/DT small/JJ tax/NN would/MD have/VB serious/JJ repercussions/NNS on/IN the/DT capital/NN markets/NNS ,/, because/IN this/DT sort/NN of/IN speculation/NN tax/NN would/MD reduce/VB the/DT profitability/NN of/IN investments/NNS considerably/RB ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, this/DT sort/NN of/IN measure/NN would/MD also/RB seriously/RB hamper/VB the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS and/CC would/MD stand/VB in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN capital/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT central/JJ tenets/NNS of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, speculative/JJ capital/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB difficult/JJ to/TO identify/VB ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, unless/IN they/PRP are/VBP introduced/VBN in/IN all/DT countries/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, tax/NN measures/NNS are/VBP easy/JJ to/TO circumvent/VB because/IN there/EX are/VBP otherwise/RB too/RB many/JJ loopholes/NNS ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, technically/RB speaking/VBG ,/, this/DT measure/NN is/VBZ highly/RB impracticable/JJ and/CC will/MD result/VB in/IN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN bureaucracy/NN and/CC administration/NN and/CC be/VB impossible/JJ to/TO control/VB ./.

The/DT measure/NN which/WDT we/PRP should/MD be/VB taking/VBG is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT resolution/NN before/IN us/PRP here/RB today/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP stronger/JJR banking/NN supervision/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO clarify/VB the/DT liability/NN for/IN transactions/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT framework/NN of/IN regulations/NNS at/IN international/JJ level/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO examine/VB national/JJ laws/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO check/VB that/IN they/PRP comply/VB with/IN the/DT rules/NNS of/IN the/DT Basle/NNP committee/NN and/CC how/WRB the/DT dissemination/NN of/IN these/DT rules/NNS can/MD be/VB stepped/VBN up/RP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP a/DT serious/JJ problem/NN with/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT central/JJ points/NNS of/IN this/DT resolution/NN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB as/IN it/PRP stands/VBZ ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP to/TO point/VB 9/CD ./.

Having/VBG listened/VBD to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP just/RB now/RB ,/, we/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT facts/NNS will/MD result/VB in/IN a/DT `/`` no/RB '/'' to/TO the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT facts/NNS and/CC this/DT debate/NN and/CC the/DT arguments/NNS are/VBP as/IN we/PRP say/VBP ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP right/JJ ,/, then/RB to/TO take/VB up/RP another/DT six/CD months/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ time/NN and/CC occasion/VB uncertainty/NN on/IN the/DT financial/JJ and/CC capital/NN markets/NNS would/MD be/VB irresponsible/JJ ./.

The/DT capital/NN markets/NNS do/VBP not/RB want/VB uncertainty/NN from/IN us/PRP ,/, they/PRP want/VBP clarity/RB ;/: which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP reject/VB point/NN 9/CD and/CC call/VB for/IN a/DT split/NN vote/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT debate/NN on/IN a/DT tax/NN on/IN short-term/JJ financial/JJ actions/NNS is/VBZ not/RB a/DT new/JJ one/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN discussing/VBG the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN proposal/NN for/IN twenty/CD years/NNS and/CC yet/RB the/DT question/NN is/VBZ still/RB topical/JJ because/IN we/PRP need/VBP really/RB concrete/JJ and/CC honest/JJ answers/NNS based/VBN on/IN careful/JJ studies/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB just/RB how/WRB desirable/JJ and/CC feasible/JJ a/DT tax/NN on/IN short-term/JJ transactions/NNS really/RB is/VBZ ./.

This/DT question/NN has/VBZ now/RB entered/VBN a/DT different/JJ dimension/NN ,/, a/DT dimension/NN in/IN which/WDT USD/VBP 1/CD 500/CD billion/CD roam/JJ the/DT world/NN twenty-four/JJ hours/NNS a/DT day/NN looking/VBG for/IN attractive/JJ investments/NNS ,/, no/DT more/JJR than/IN 3/CD %/NN of/IN which/WDT have/VBP anything/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT real/JJ economy/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN stability/NN on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, not/RB for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, but/CC because/IN this/DT has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN own/JJ growth/NN ,/, our/PRP$ own/JJ investments/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ own/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD ask/VB what/WP instruments/VBD we/PRP can/MD use/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO create/VB the/DT order/NN here/RB which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN missing/VBG in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP done/VBN everything/NN to/TO help/VB liberalise/JJ financial/JJ transactions/NNS ,/, but/CC so/RB far/RB we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN no/DT working/VBG set/NN of/IN rules/NNS ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP learned/VBN from/IN the/DT bitter/JJ lessons/NNS of/IN the/DT repercussions/NNS of/IN the/DT Asian/JJ and/CC Latin/JJ American/JJ crises/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB high/JJ time/NN that/IN we/PRP thought/VBD both/DT about/IN supervisory/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC about/IN transparency/NN on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ information/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN we/PRP know/VBP who/WP the/DT actors/NNS are/VBP and/CC what/WP their/PRP$ credit/NN rating/NN is/VBZ ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB ask/VB if/IN there/EX is/VBZ not/RB a/DT need/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ justice/NN ./.

At/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB the/DT tax/NN burden/NN on/IN the/DT work/NN factor/NN is/VBZ increasing/VBG throughout/IN Europe/NNP and/CC internationally/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD consider/VB how/WRB we/PRP can/MD achieve/VB efficient/JJ taxation/NN of/IN investment/NN income/NN and/CC that/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB to/TO tax/VB short-term/JJ financial/JJ transactions/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT intention/NN behind/IN the/DT question/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD then/RB follow/VB the/DT ordinary/JJ procedures/NNS of/IN reports/NNS from/IN committees/NNS and/CC plenary/NN debate/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO reach/VB a/DT balanced/JJ and/CC really/RB forward-looking/JJ proposal/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO repeat/VB these/DT arguments/NNS ,/, modestly/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT intervention/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT same/JJ issue/NN has/VBZ arisen/VBN once/RB again/RB ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN tax/NN because/IN its/PRP$ application/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT event/NN that/IN it/PRP could/MD happen/VB ,/, would/MD not/RB achieve/VB the/DT aims/NNS which/WDT Mr/NNP Tobin/NNP presented/VBD at/IN the/DT time/NN and/CC which/WDT the/DT Left/NNP in/IN this/DT House/NNP wishes/VBZ to/TO revive/VB ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT evidence/NN that/IN the/DT tax/NN on/IN international/JJ capital/NN movements/NNS could/MD reduce/VB the/DT dangers/NNS of/IN volatility/NN and/CC instability/NN in/IN the/DT international/JJ markets/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ certain/JJ that/IN not/RB all/DT countries/NNS would/MD accept/VB it/PRP ,/, we/PRP would/MD open/VB the/DT way/NN to/TO speculation/NN and/CC fraud/NN and/CC that/DT really/RB would/MD create/VB volatility/NN ,/, instability/NN ,/, insecurity/NN ,/, opacity/NN and/CC unfair/JJ competition/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN financial/JJ services/NNS operating/VBG on/IN an/DT international/JJ level/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT idea/NN of/IN obtaining/VBG resources/NNS to/TO apply/VB them/PRP to/TO the/DT more/RBR economically/RB needy/VBN countries/NNS presents/VBZ such/JJ complexity/NN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP consider/VBP their/PRP$ application/NN in/IN practice/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP appears/VBZ simply/RB impossible/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT false/JJ debate/NN whose/WP$ aim/NNS is/VBZ purely/RB political/JJ ,/, and/CC has/VBZ no/DT basis/NN or/CC technical/JJ viability/NN ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, the/DT French/JJ delegation/NN in/IN our/PRP$ group/NN was/VBD unable/JJ to/TO accept/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT federalist/JJ faction/NN have/VBP diverted/VBN the/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN from/IN its/PRP$ original/JJ purpose/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO detract/VB still/RB further/RBR from/IN the/DT political/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT nations/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP no/DT intention/NN of/IN giving/VBG Brussels/NNP the/DT job/NN of/IN regulating/VBG regional/JJ planning/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, as/IN suggested/VBD in/IN recital/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

We/PRP only/RB ask/VBP one/CD thing/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP :/: that/IN it/PRP confine/VBP itself/PRP to/TO ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN joint/JJ policies/NNS does/VBZ not/RB upset/VB the/DT balance/NN of/IN regional/JJ planning/NN in/IN our/PRP$ territories/NNS ./.

Just/RB as/IN elderly/JJ people/NNS in/IN cities/NNS are/VBP very/RB isolated/JJ ,/, so/IN the/DT elderly/JJ are/VBP fast/RB becoming/VBG the/DT sole/JJ inhabitants/NN of/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS because/IN young/JJ people/NNS are/VBP moving/VBG to/TO the/DT cities/NNS :/: they/PRP are/VBP drawn/VBN by/IN the/DT bright/JJ lights/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT pubs/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT countryside/NN and/CC rural/JJ areas/NNS are/VBP being/VBG emptied/VBN ./.

In/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN rural/JJ development/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB address/VB the/DT issues/NNS of/IN agriculture/NN and/CC agricultural/JJ production/NN in/IN a/DT consistent/JJ way/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ ./.

Without/IN agriculture/NN ,/, the/DT rural/JJ world/NN will/MD disappear/VB ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN any/DT strategy/NN for/IN rural/JJ development/NN must/MD be/VB based/VBN on/IN agriculture/NN '/POS s/JJ internal/JJ potential/JJ while/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN developing/VBG as/IN many/JJ other/JJ activities/NNS as/RB possible/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT desertification/NN of/IN the/DT rural/JJ world/NN ./.

Both/DT LEADER/JJ 1/CD and/CC LEADER/CD 2/CD ,/, which/WDT were/VBD implemented/VBN in/IN the/DT 1990s/NNS ,/, were/VBD ingredients/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ CAP/NN that/WDT emerged/VBD after/IN its/PRP$ review/NN in/IN 1992/CD and/CC ,/, along/RB with/IN other/JJ respective/JJ measures/NNS ,/, they/PRP constituted/VBD the/DT so-termed/JJ second/JJ pillar/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ rural/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ proved/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN in/IN the/DT areas/NNS where/WRB those/DT initiatives/NNS were/VBD implemented/VBN ,/, farming/NN incomes/NNS and/CC employment/NN decreased/VBD rapidly/RB ,/, which/WDT resulted/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ depopulation/NN ./.

A/DT characteristic/JJ example/NN is/VBZ Greece/NNP ,/, which/WDT as/IN an/DT Objective/NNP 1/CD country/NN was/VBD included/VBN as/IN a/DT whole/NN in/IN the/DT LEADER/NNP Community/NNP initiatives/NNS ,/, and/CC where/WRB the/DT average/JJ annual/JJ reduction/NN in/IN employment/NN in/IN the/DT farming/NN sector/NN reached/VBD approximately/RB 2.3/CD %/NN ,/, while/IN between/IN 1994/CD and/CC 1999/CD farming/NN incomes/NNS decreased/VBD by/IN 15.2/CD %/NN ./.

The/DT real/JJ aims/NNS of/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP are/VBP the/DT same/JJ as/IN those/DT of/IN LEADERs/NNP 1/CD and/CC 2/CD ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS to/TO moderate/VB and/CC disguise/VB the/DT negative/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT CAP/NNP to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD and/CC the/DT WTO/NNP ./.

The/DT present/JJ CAP/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ worse/JJR than/IN its/PRP$ predecessor/NN and/CC it/PRP also/RB starts/VBZ from/IN a/DT worse/JJR basis/NN ,/, granted/VBN that/IN the/DT 1992/CD CAP/NNP review/NN and/CC the/DT GATT/NNP agreement/NN in/IN 1995/CD have/VBP created/VBN serious/JJ problems/NNS and/CC impasses/NNS for/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ economy/NN ./.

The/DT selection/NN criteria/NNS and/CC the/DT activities/NNS that/WDT are/VBP subsidised/VBN under/IN LEADER/NNP do/VBP ,/, in/IN the/DT best/JJS case/NN ,/, moderate/VB some/DT partial/JJ problems/NNS of/IN the/DT countryside/NN ,/, which/WDT are/VBP of/IN secondary/JJ importance/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT worst/JJS case/NN they/PRP degenerate/VBZ into/IN expenditure/VBG for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN public/JJ relations/NNS and/CC pandering/VBG to/TO conscience/NN ./.

In/IN no/DT case/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, are/VBP they/PRP programmes/NNS for/IN the/DT integrated/VBN development/NN of/IN the/DT selected/VBN areas/NNS and/CC they/PRP do/VBP not/RB create/VB permanent/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN the/DT countryside/NN because/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT activities/NNS there/RB are/VBP not/RB productive/JJ in/IN nature/NN ./.

The/DT actual/JJ appropriations/NNS available/JJ for/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP compared/VBN with/IN LEADER/NNP 2/CD are/VBP smaller/JJR despite/IN their/PRP$ increase/NN by/IN 15/CD %/NN -LRB-/-LRB- from/IN EUR/$ 1/CD 775/CD million/CD for/IN LEADER/NNP 2/CD to/TO EUR/$ 2/CD 020/CD million/CD for/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

This/DT is/VBZ because/IN the/DT 15/CD %/NN increase/NN is/VBZ nominal/JJ and/CC not/RB real/JJ ,/, granted/VBN that/IN average/JJ yearly/JJ inflation/NN in/IN the/DT Community/NNP during/IN those/DT years/NNS was/VBD approximately/RB 2/CD %/NN ./.

LEADER/NNP +/NNP will/MD last/VB a/DT year/NN longer/RBR than/IN LEADER/NNP 2/CD ./.

We/PRP disagree/VBP with/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT report/NN '/POS s/JJ views/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD cut/VB off/RP the/DT supply/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ source/NN of/IN danger/NN ,/, i.e./JJ harmful/JJ additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS ./.

Otherwise/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP beavering/VBG away/RP at/IN the/DT symptoms/NNS ,/, but/CC not/RB the/DT causes/NNS ./.

People/NNS are/VBP especially/RB wary/JJ of/IN GMOs/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD confront/VB increasing/VBG public/JJ awareness/NN of/IN GMOs/NNP by/IN regulating/VBG their/PRP$ use/NN in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS accordingly/RB ./.

First/RB ,/, if/IN an/DT additive/NN consists/VBZ of/IN or/CC contains/VBZ genetically-modified/JJ organisms/NNS ,/, then/RB it/PRP should/MD only/RB be/VB authorised/VBN if/IN it/PRP poses/VBZ no/DT risk/NN to/TO human/JJ health/NN or/CC the/DT environment/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ sense/NN to/TO issue/NN provisions/NNS for/IN genetically-modified/JJ feedingstuff/NN additives/NNS similar/JJ to/TO the/DT regulations/NNS in/IN seed/NN marketing/NN legislation/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ said/VBN ./.

And/CC thirdly/RB ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT transparent/JJ consumer/NN policy/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO label/VB genetically-modified/JJ feedingstuffs/NNS ./.

A/DT clear/JJ declaration/NN on/IN feedingstuffs/NNS will/MD allow/VB double/JJ freedom/NN of/IN choice/NN ,/, both/DT for/IN the/DT party/NN using/VBG the/DT feedingstuff/NN and/CC the/DT subsequent/JJ consumer/NN ./.

Responsible/JJ citizens/NNS should/MD ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, have/VB a/DT choice/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT talk/VBP of/IN scandalised/JJ citizens/NNS who/WP have/VBP lost/VBN confidence/NN in/IN food/NN safety/NN ./.

By/IN regulating/VBG additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS consistently/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD help/VB significantly/RB to/TO restore/VB confidence/NN ./.

I/CD too/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, can/MD hardly/RB wait/VB to/TO hear/VB what/WP you/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB to/TO our/PRP$ proposed/VBN amendments/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP too/RB shall/MD also/RB vote/VB to/TO reserve/VB our/PRP$ right/NN to/TO refer/VB the/DT proposal/NN back/RB to/TO committee/NN if/IN need/MD be/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT proposal/NN to/TO amend/VB the/DT 1970/CD directive/NN on/IN additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ in/IN a/DT whole/JJ series/NN of/IN proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN feedingstuffs/NNS ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP shall/MD be/VB discussing/VBG other/JJ proposals/NNS here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ./.

That/IN this/DT subject/NN is/VBZ of/IN paramount/JJ importance/NN is/VBZ borne/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT huge/JJ public/JJ attention/NN which/WDT the/DT dioxin/JJ ,/, antibiotic/JJ ,/, sludge/JJ and/CC other/JJ scandals/NNS have/VBP attracted/VBN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ facet/NN of/IN public/JJ health/NN protection/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN Article/NNP 152/NNP should/MD be/VB taken/VBN as/IN the/DT legal/JJ base/NN ,/, not/RB Article/NNP 37/CD ,/, as/IN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT amendment/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN ,/, namely/RB equal/JJ treatment/NN for/IN additives/NNS authorised/VBD before/IN or/CC after/IN 31/CD December/NNP 1987/CD ,/, is/VBZ uncontested/VBN and/CC has/VBZ our/PRP$ full/JJ support/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP and/CC Rural/NNP Development/NNP has/VBZ voted/VBN unanimously/RB on/IN some/DT important/JJ amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN ./.

The/DT regulation/NN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP conceals/VBZ the/DT danger/NN of/IN creating/VBG a/DT marketing/NN monopoly/NN for/IN certain/JJ additives/NNS ./.

Only/RB companies/NNS which/WDT obtained/VBD the/DT original/JJ authorisation/NN will/MD have/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO apply/VB and/CC companies/NNS which/WDT obtained/VBD authorisation/NN at/IN a/DT later/JJ date/NN will/MD be/VB excluded/VBN ./.

This/DT sort/NN of/IN monopoly/NN ,/, which/WDT could/MD lead/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, to/TO an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN feedingstuffs/NNS ,/, should/MD be/VB prevented/VBN by/IN granting/VBG provisional/JJ authorisation/NN to/TO all/DT companies/NNS which/WDT had/VBD marketed/VBN a/DT specific/JJ substance/NN by/IN 1/CD April/NNP 1998/CD ./.

This/DT would/MD then/RB apply/VB until/IN the/DT re-assessment/JJ procedure/NN has/VBZ been/VBN completed/VBN ./.

The/DT most/RBS important/JJ amendment/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN is/VBZ the/DT inclusion/NN ,/, as/IN recommended/VBD by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, of/IN genetically-modified/JJ organisms/NNS in/IN the/DT directive/NN on/IN additives/NNS ,/, taking/VBG the/DT compromise/NN negotiated/VBN between/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN authorisation/NN for/IN GMOs/NNP outside/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT release/NN directive/NN as/IN the/DT starting/JJ point/NN ./.

This/DT already/RB gives/VBZ us/PRP a/DT basis/NN for/IN the/DT authorisation/NN of/IN GMOs/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB only/RB logical/JJ that/IN we/PRP make/VBP provision/NN for/IN genetically/RB modified/JJ feedingstuff/NN additives/NNS in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, just/RB as/IN we/PRP have/VBP in/IN regulations/NNS already/RB passed/VBN in/IN other/JJ areas/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN forest/NN reproductive/JJ material/NN ,/, to/TO mention/VB just/RB one/CD example/NN ./.

The/DT labelling/NN of/IN genetically-modified/JJ additives/NNS is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, it/PRP enables/VBZ farmers/NNS to/TO make/VB an/DT informed/VBN decision/NN as/RB to/TO whether/IN or/CC not/RB they/PRP wish/VBP to/TO use/VB such/JJ feedingstuffs/NNS and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, it/PRP enables/VBZ consumers/NNS to/TO avoid/VB foodstuffs/NNS produced/VBN using/VBG GMOs/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, our/PRP$ group/NN should/MD like/VB once/RB again/RB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, who/WP has/VBZ gone/VBN to/TO a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN trouble/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD all/RB hardly/RB wait/VB to/TO hear/VB Mr/NNP Byrne/NNP '/POS s/JJ reply/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT report/NN deals/VBZ mainly/RB with/IN formalities/NNS ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, the/DT manner/NN in/IN which/WDT additives/NNS will/MD be/VB authorised/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ less/RBR concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT types/NNS of/IN additives/NNS and/CC how/WRB they/PRP work/VBP ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO stress/VB how/WRB important/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN future/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT directives/NNS are/VBP dealt/VBN with/IN under/IN Article/NNP 152/CD ,/, since/IN both/DT food/NN safety/NN and/CC environmental/JJ issues/NNS require/VBP a/DT coherent/JJ policy/NN and/CC a/DT comprehensive/JJ overview/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB carry/VB on/RP as/IN we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN up/RP until/IN now/RB ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB dealing/VBG with/IN each/DT detail/NN on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, often/RB only/RB after/IN the/DT harm/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN done/VBN ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN places/VBZ the/DT emphasis/NN on/IN the/DT testing/NN and/CC labelling/NN of/IN GMOs/NNP in/IN feed/NN additives/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB once/RB again/RB to/TO raise/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN antibiotics/NNS ./.

Certainly/RB ,/, five/CD of/IN the/DT nine/CD antibiotics/NNS that/WDT were/VBD originally/RB permitted/VBN in/IN animal/NN feed/NN have/VBP now/RB been/VBN banned/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nevertheless/RB extremely/RB important/JJ to/TO ban/VB the/DT remaining/JJ four/CD ,/, both/DT in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN human/JJ health/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT animals/NNS themselves/PRP ./.

We/PRP now/RB know/VBP that/IN resistance/NN to/TO antibiotics/NNS poses/VBZ a/DT very/RB serious/JJ threat/NN to/TO people/NNS 's/POS health/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN small/JJ children/NNS ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP already/RB able/JJ to/TO show/VB conclusively/RB that/IN improper/JJ practices/NNS in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT keeping/VBG of/IN livestock/NN are/VBP totally/RB unnecessary/JJ ./.

Several/JJ countries/NNS phased/VBD out/RP antibiotics/NNS in/IN animal/NN feedingstuffs/NNS a/DT long/JJ time/NN ago/RB and/CC others/NNS are/VBP in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN successfully/RB doing/VBG the/DT same/JJ ./.

We/PRP talk/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN about/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN but/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN antibiotics/NNS ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ long/RB since/IN been/VBN forgotten/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ another/DT environmental/JJ principle/NN at/IN stake/NN ,/, namely/RB the/DT exchange/NN principle/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS about/IN coccidiostats/NNS ./.

They/PRP are/VBP a/DT zootechnical/JJ product/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB totally/RB necessary/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT substitute/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO vaccinate/VB chickens/NNS ./.

Although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT little/RB more/RBR expensive/JJ ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB harm/VB the/DT environment/NN ./.

Coccidiostats/NNS now/RB accompany/VB the/DT manure/NN that/WDT is/VBZ spread/VBN on/IN the/DT fields/NNS ./.

In/IN that/DT way/NN ,/, they/PRP end/VBP up/RP in/IN our/PRP$ water/NN supplies/NNS which/WDT ,/, as/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP ,/, are/VBP our/PRP$ most/RBS vital/JJ resource/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT report/NN on/IN additives/NNS in/IN animal/NN feedingstuffs/NNS concerns/VBZ the/DT technical/JJ and/CC economic/JJ problem/NN of/IN restoring/VBG the/DT competitive/JJ balance/NN between/IN different/JJ additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS and/CC between/IN producers/NNS of/IN these/DT additives/NNS ./.

Yet/CC after/IN the/DT serious/JJ dioxin/NN crisis/NN which/WDT affected/VBD Belgium/NNP and/CC other/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS last/JJ summer/NN we/PRP can/MD not/RB just/RB view/VB this/DT issue/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN competition/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD recall/VB ,/, even/RB though/IN this/DT passed/VBD virtually/RB unnoticed/JJ by/IN the/DT general/JJ public/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ scientific/JJ experts/NNS discovered/VBD industrial/JJ residues/NNS of/IN dioxin-loaded/JJ chemical/NN lime/NN in/IN the/DT pulp/NN of/IN citrus/JJ fruit/NN imported/VBN from/IN Brazil/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD therefore/RB closely/RB examine/VB all/PDT the/DT elements/NNS of/IN the/DT chain/NN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT manufacture/NN of/IN feedingstuffs/NNS for/IN production/NN animals/NNS ./.

Incidentally/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ ironic/JJ that/IN the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ much/RB less/RBR serious/JJ for/IN the/DT feedingstuffs/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ dogs/NNS ,/, cats/NNS and/CC other/JJ domestic/JJ animals/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ it/PRP because/RB of/IN cut-throat/JJ and/CC globalised/JJ competition/NN that/IN industrialists/NNS have/VBP allowed/VBN this/DT sector/NN to/TO become/VB a/DT way/NN of/IN recycling/VBG all/PDT the/DT waste/NN from/IN the/DT agri-foodstuffs/JJ industry/NN ?/.

Such/PDT a/DT serious/JJ issue/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB limited/VBN to/TO a/DT technical/JJ debate/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT directive/NN itself/PRP which/WDT limits/VBZ the/DT authorisation/NN of/IN antibiotics/NNS and/CC other/JJ growth/NN promoters/NNS ./.

The/DT precautions/NNS which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP preparing/VBG to/TO take/VB in/IN respect/NN of/IN feedingstuffs/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB applied/VBN to/TO the/DT food/NN for/IN the/DT very/JJ farm/NN animals/NNS which/WDT reach/VBP our/PRP$ plates/NNS ./.

As/IN forcefully/RB underlined/VBD by/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, labelling/NNP is/VBZ an/DT absolute/JJ necessity/NN so/RB that/IN each/DT farmer/NN on/IN his/PRP$ holding/NN is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN all/PDT the/DT ingredients/NNS in/IN the/DT feed/NN which/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ giving/VBG his/PRP$ livestock/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Seattle/NNP demonstrators/NNS argued/VBD that/IN free/JJ trade/NN is/VBZ bad/JJ for/IN the/DT less/JJR -/: and/CC least-developed/JJ countries/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ purely/RB a/DT rich/JJ country/NN selfish/JJ interest/NN ./.

Yet/CC we/PRP might/MD consider/VB the/DT rate/NN of/IN economic/JJ progress/NN and/CC the/DT rate/NN of/IN eliminating/VBG poverty/NN in/IN countries/NNS such/JJ as/IN India/NNP and/CC Tanzania/NNP over/IN the/DT 40/CD or/CC 50/CD years/NNS since/IN they/PRP became/VBD independent/JJ ./.

There/EX the/DT theory/NN went/VBD that/IN protectionism/NN and/CC state/NN intervention/NN would/MD preserve/VB jobs/NNS ,/, allow/VBP industry/NN to/TO adjust/VB gradually/RB and/CC without/IN pain/NN ./.

It/PRP did/VBD not/RB work/VB ;/: poverty/NN became/VBD worse/RBR than/IN ever/RB ./.

The/DT medicine/NN may/MD not/RB taste/VB too/RB good/JJ in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN ,/, but/CC opening/VBG one/CD '/POS s/VBZ economy/NN to/TO competition/NN at/IN home/NN and/CC abroad/RB forces/VBZ optimal/JJ application/NN of/IN resources/NNS and/CC leads/NNS to/TO a/DT higher/JJR standard/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN life/NN in/IN the/DT not/RB so/RB longer/JJR term/NN ./.

Is/VBZ that/DT not/RB the/DT lesson/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP itself/PRP and/CC of/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN in/IN particular/NN ?/.

As/IN Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP said/VBD ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT fine/JJ example/NN to/TO those/DT countries/NNS and/CC regions/NNS aspiring/VBN to/TO greater/JJR prosperity/NN ./.

Yet/CC preaching/VBG the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN free/JJ trade/NN to/TO the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

We/PRP also/RB have/VBP to/TO practise/VB what/WP we/PRP preach/VBP in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ accessibility/NN for/IN imports/NNS from/IN these/DT countries/NNS ./.

Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ resolution/NN on/IN the/DT WTO/NNP negotiations/NNS advocated/VBD a/DT free/JJ import/NN policy/NN by/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB clear/JJ that/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN of/IN development/NN policy/NN with/IN trade/NN policy/NN diminishes/VBZ our/PRP$ development/NN efforts/NNS and/CC must/MD also/RB diminish/VB the/DT political/JJ regard/NN of/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS for/IN Europe/NNP and/CC our/PRP$ fine/JJ words/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT last/JJ couple/NN of/IN days/NNS we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN fine/JJ words/NNS about/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN greater/JJR coherence/NN ,/, coordination/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN in/IN the/DT external/JJ aid/NN programmes/NNS of/IN the/DT Community/NNP and/CC of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD relatively/RB small/JJ area/NN of/IN activity/NN with/IN enormous/JJ public/JJ visibility/NN which/WDT would/MD be/VB a/DT litmus/NN test/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ ability/NN to/TO match/VB words/NNS with/IN action/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO the/DT continuing/VBG tragedy/NN of/IN anti-personnel/JJ landmines/NNS which/WDT present/VBP an/DT obstacle/NN to/TO so/RB many/JJ development/NN programmes/NNS ,/, to/TO post-conflict/VB reconstruction/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT ruin/VBP the/DT lives/NNS of/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT most/RBS vulnerable/JJ in/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT poorest/JJS parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

Over/IN recent/JJ years/NNS the/DT Community/NNP has/VBZ spent/VBN some/DT EUR/$ 200/CD million/CD in/IN mine/NN clearance/NN ,/, assistance/NN to/TO victims/NNS and/CC related/VBN activities/NNS ./.

The/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP spent/VBN similar/JJ amounts/NNS ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ still/RB enormous/JJ inefficiency/NN and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN will/NN to/TO implement/VB a/DT strategy/NN agreed/VBN with/IN other/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN to/TO overcome/VB the/DT anti-personnel/JJ landmine/NN problem/NN within/IN a/DT finite/JJ time/NN span/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Nielson/NNP identified/VBD the/DT problems/NNS of/IN lack/NN of/IN concerted/JJ action/NN and/CC the/DT need/NN for/IN better/JJR complementarity/NN with/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN talked/VBN about/IN for/IN years/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO carry/VB out/RP internal/JJ organisational/JJ changes/NNS ,/, strengthen/VB the/DT coherence/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN of/IN its/PRP$ actions/NNS ,/, ideally/NN with/IN a/DT properly/RB resourced/JJ central/JJ mine/NN action/NN policy/NN cell/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD also/RB need/VB more/JJR rapid/JJ contractual/NN and/CC implementation/NN procedures/NNS and/CC an/DT enhanced/VBN multiannual/JJ budget/NN line/NN and/CC much/JJ improved/VBN management/NN of/IN its/PRP$ programmes/NNS ./.

A/DT proper/JJ stock-taking/NN of/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN mine/NN action/NN programmes/NNS needs/VBZ to/TO take/VB place/NN in/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT countries/NNS seriously/RB afflicted/VBN by/IN landmines/NNS ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT landmine/JJ issue/NN encapsulates/VBZ so/RB many/JJ of/IN the/DT organisational/JJ ,/, procedural/JJ ,/, financial/JJ management/NN and/CC operational/JJ difficulties/NNS which/WDT have/VBP afflicted/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Are/VBP these/DT afflictions/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, or/CC will/MD we/PRP find/VB that/IN in/IN this/DT relatively/RB compact/VBN and/CC limited/VBN area/NN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ still/RB unable/JJ to/TO meet/VB its/PRP$ aspirations/NNS ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Nielson/NNP ,/, the/DT conclusion/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ ACP-EU/JJ Convention/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ step/NN towards/IN greater/JJR coherence/NN ./.

For/IN these/DT are/VBP prerequisite/JJ to/TO any/DT development/NN ./.

If/IN these/DT criteria/NNS are/VBP not/RB adhered/VBN to/TO ,/, then/RB development/NN does/VBZ not/RB stand/VB a/DT chance/NN ./.

The/DT same/JJ goes/VBZ for/IN Cuba/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Modrow/NNP ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN Cuba/NNP is/VBZ getting/VBG closer/RBR to/TO joining/VBG this/DT process/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP are/VBP all/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT reports/NNS from/IN Amnesty/NNP International/NNP ./.

It/PRP may/MD well/RB be/VB that/IN you/PRP ,/, having/VBG belonged/VBN to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT last/JJ Communist/JJ dictatorships/NNS ,/, view/VBP the/DT situation/NN somewhat/RB differently/RB to/TO the/DT majority/NN of/IN people/NNS in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP ,/, and/CC that/IN you/PRP have/VBP problems/NNS where/WRB good/JJ governance/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, these/DT are/VBP important/JJ criteria/NNS for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT second/JJ issue/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO raise/VB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG coherence/NN here/RB ./.

Many/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP cited/VBN examples/NNS of/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT various/JJ policies/NNS are/VBP not/RB coherent/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT development/NN policy/NN itself/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB more/RBR coherent/JJ too/RB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT coherence/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT effective/JJ coordination/NN with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC there/EX are/VBP some/DT projects/NNS being/VBG carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN the/DT developing/VBG countries/NNS which/WDT are/VBP very/RB much/JJ at/IN odds/NNS with/IN one/CD another/DT ./.

Nor/CC is/VBZ there/RB coherence/NN vis-脙/NNS -/: vis/JJ the/DT European/JJ taxpayer/NN when/WRB we/PRP draft/VB a/DT development/NN policy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ accommodated/VBN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ budget/NN but/CC the/DT EDF/NNP remains/VBZ outside/IN it/PRP ./.

With/IN Europe/NNP preparing/VBG to/TO enlarge/VB ,/, communitising/VBG the/DT EDF/NNP would/MD make/VB it/PRP easy/JJ to/TO hide/VB a/DT lack/NN of/IN commitment/NN behind/IN the/DT screen/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN ,/, quite/RB apart/RB from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP would/MD be/VB wasting/VBG a/DT fruitful/JJ and/CC promising/JJ opportunity/NN of/IN associating/VBG our/PRP$ southern/JJ partners/NNS with/IN our/PRP$ cooperation/NN policy/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ ,/, in/IN the/DT recent/JJ past/NN ,/, had/VBN trouble/NN managing/VBG the/DT funds/NNS for/IN development/NN and/CC humanitarian/JJ aid/NN transparently/NNS ,/, as/IN Mrs/NNP Maes/NNP has/VBZ just/RB reminded/VBN us/PRP so/RB opportunely/JJ ./.

Why/WRB should/MD we/PRP add/VB to/TO them/PRP ?/.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP find/VBP it/PRP most/RBS regrettable/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP Corrie/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN should/MD mention/VB the/DT trade/NN and/CC development/NN agreement/NN with/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP because/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, this/DT report/NN is/VBZ typical/JJ of/IN the/DT amateur/JJ diplomacy/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG ever/RB more/RBR frequent/JJ recourse/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ perfectly/RB astounding/JJ that/IN the/DT Union/NNP could/MD have/VB negotiated/VBN an/DT agreement/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN which/WDT a/DT fundamental/JJ section/NN is/VBZ quite/RB simply/RB left/NN blank/JJ ./.

And/CC let/VB me/PRP say/VBP in/IN passing/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR astonishing/JJ that/IN the/DT Council/NNP allowed/VBD it/PRP to/TO ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP now/RB in/IN the/DT absurd/JJ position/NN of/IN negotiating/VBG from/IN a/DT position/NN of/IN weakness/NN on/IN vital/JJ aspects/NNS such/JJ as/IN wine/NN and/CC agricultural/JJ production/NN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN an/DT agreement/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP already/RB signed/VBN ./.

The/DT part/NN of/IN this/DT agreement/NN which/WDT blocks/VBZ negotiations/NNS could/MD mean/VB that/IN the/DT Union/NNP ends/VBZ up/RP paying/VBG producers/NNS to/TO stop/VB producing/VBG sherry/NN ,/, port/NN and/CC a/DT whole/JJ host/NN of/IN products/NNS which/WDT are/VBP purely/JJ and/CC simply/RB copies/NNS under/IN international/JJ commercial/JJ law/NN ./.

Imagine/VB the/DT potential/JJ cost/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT precedent/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, a/DT word/NN on/IN the/DT general/JJ thinking/NN behind/IN the/DT Corrie/NNP report/VBP ./.

Nowadays/NNS ,/, let/VB us/PRP face/VB it/PRP ,/, the/DT Joint/NNP Assembly/NNP is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN an/DT obstacle/NN to/TO free/VB international/JJ trade/NN by/IN the/DT dogmatisers/NNS in/IN Geneva/NNP and/CC Washington/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT chance/NN to/TO reiterate/VB that/IN our/PRP$ original/NN and/CC exemplary/JJ mode/NN of/IN cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT southern/JJ countries/NNS should/MD be/VB developed/VBN and/CC strengthened/VBN ./.

The/DT Corrie/NNP report/NN missed/VBD this/DT chance/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD ,/, regrettably/RB ,/, punish/VB it/PRP for/IN losing/VBG so/RB much/RB ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- PT/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, by/IN way/NN of/IN both/PDT a/DT conclusion/NN and/CC a/DT summary/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO highlight/VB three/CD key/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, many/JJ speakers/NNS stressed/VBD that/IN globalisation/NN accentuates/VBZ regional/JJ imbalances/NNS and/CC social/JJ inequality/NN ,/, and/CC increases/VBZ poverty/NN ./.

This/DT suggests/VBZ that/IN something/NN must/MD be/VB done/VBN ,/, failing/VBG which/WDT tensions/NNS will/MD be/VB aggravated/VBN and/CC conflicts/NNS jeopardising/VBG international/JJ peace/NN and/CC stability/NN will/MD arise/VB or/CC worsen/VB ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB important/JJ to/TO approach/VB development/NN policies/NNS from/IN a/DT different/JJ angle/NN in/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN their/PRP$ capacity/NN for/IN correcting/VBG imbalances/NNS and/CC reducing/VBG inequality/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT importance/NN that/IN everyone/NN has/VBZ attached/VBN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN in/IN international/JJ development/NN policies/NNS is/VBZ significant/JJ ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN it/PRP may/MD be/VB necessary/JJ ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP stressed/VBN ,/, to/TO change/VB the/DT model/NN and/CC move/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT post-colonial/JJ model/NN towards/IN a/DT more/RBR European/JJ approach/NN to/TO development/NN policies/NNS ./. ./.

I/PRP sense/VBP some/DT degree/NN of/IN frustration/NN in/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT contributions/NNS to/TO this/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP given/VBN you/PRP a/DT statement/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP provides/VBZ a/DT useful/JJ background/NN to/TO this/DT discussion/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD furnish/VB more/JJR detailed/JJ material/NN relating/VBG directly/RB to/TO all/PDT the/DT issues/NNS concerning/VBG coherence/NN ./.

This/DT discussion/NN is/VBZ not/RB new/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP currently/RB working/VBG on/RP it/PRP in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC when/WRB that/DT work/NN is/VBZ done/VBN I/PRP will/MD report/VB on/IN it/PRP ,/, as/IN many/DT have/VBP been/VBN asking/VBG if/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT report/NN on/IN coherence/NN ./.

This/DT also/RB calls/VBZ for/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN further/JJ new/JJ mechanisms/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP system/NN which/WDT may/MD very/RB well/RB include/VB ,/, as/IN suggested/VBD by/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT political/JJ groups/NNS in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT setting/NN up/RB of/IN a/DT special/JJ intra-service/JJ working/VBG group/NN and/CC the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN coherence/NN watch/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP read/VBN -/: and/CC heard/VBN in/IN the/DT debate/NN -/: that/IN coherence/NN is/VBZ being/VBG used/VBN as/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN a/DT miracle/NN formula/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ care/NN of/IN everything/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO keep/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT relatively/RB clearly/RB defined/JJ discipline/NN of/IN trying/VBG to/TO reduce/VB inconsistencies/NNS where/WRB they/PRP really/RB exist/VBP ,/, and/CC we/PRP certainly/RB do/VBP have/VB them/PRP ./.

Much/RB of/IN this/DT has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN real/JJ disagreement/NN between/IN sector/NN interests/NNS in/IN each/DT and/CC every/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN very/RB honestly/JJ said/VBD here/RB in/IN this/DT House/NNP :/: people/NNS more/JJR or/CC less/JJR identify/VB with/IN their/PRP$ spheres/NNS of/IN interest/NN ,/, and/CC all/PDT this/DT is/VBZ legitimate/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, warn/VB against/IN the/DT illusion/NN that/IN incoherence/NN is/VBZ the/DT product/NN of/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN a/DT mechanical/JJ deficiency/NN in/IN the/DT system/NN ./.

This/DT exists/VBZ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB a/DT small/JJ part/NN of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG ./.

The/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN well/RB known/VBN established/JJ differences/NNS of/IN interest/NN between/IN sexes/NNS and/CC so/RB on/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT problem/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Mulder/NNP mentioned/VBD that/IN no/DT farmer/NN will/MD start/VB producing/VBG anything/NN if/IN the/DT price/NN is/VBZ too/RB low/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ true/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ part/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ partners/NNS and/CC beneficiaries/NNS in/IN Africa/NNP have/VBP a/DT slightly/RB different/JJ perspective/NN ./.

They/PRP farm/VBZ ,/, not/RB just/RB for/IN a/DT living/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN order/NN to/TO live/VB ,/, and/CC this/DT makes/VBZ a/DT difference/NN ./.

Subsistence/JJ farming/NN is/VBZ not/RB based/VBN on/IN price/NN calculations/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT hope/NN of/IN rain/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ season/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB apply/VB to/TO all/DT farming/NN in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS but/CC to/TO the/DT poverty-focusing/NN which/WDT we/PRP need/VBP to/TO deliver/VB better/RBR than/IN so/RB far/RB ./.

From/IN that/DT perspective/NN ,/, what/WP I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG here/RB is/VBZ of/IN deep/JJ relevance/NN ./.

Other/JJ issues/NNS have/VBP been/VBN mentioned/VBN :/: cattle-farming/VBG in/IN Namibia/NNP ,/, tomatoes/NNS and/CC milk/NN powder/NN in/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB too/RB masochistic/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT limit/NN to/TO how/WRB useful/JJ that/WDT is/VBZ ./.

All/PDT these/DT cases/NNS are/VBP characterised/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN taken/VBN care/VB of/IN ./.

The/DT intervention/NN prices/NNS have/VBP been/VBN regulated/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT problems/NNS we/PRP had/VBD with/IN beef/NN in/IN Western/NNP Africa/NNP and/CC in/IN Namibia/NNP were/VBD actually/RB solved/VBN by/IN reducing/VBG the/DT intervention/NN support/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP real/JJ problems/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP have/VBP all/RB been/VBN dealt/VBN with/IN ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT issue/NN of/IN cacao/NN ,/, chocolate/NN :/: I/PRP repeat/VB that/IN the/DT 5/CD %/NN has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN creating/VBG a/DT basis/NN for/IN a/DT living/NN in/IN the/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN here/RB are/VBP the/DT local/JJ nuts/NNS which/WDT are/VBP as/RB important/JJ to/TO the/DT people/NNS collecting/VBG them/PRP and/CC making/VBG a/DT living/VBG out/RP of/IN them/PRP in/IN Burkina/NNP Faso/NNP as/IN coconuts/NNS for/IN farmers/NNS in/IN Ghana/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT clear/JJ case/NN of/IN incoherence/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR a/DT case/NN of/IN a/DT competition/NN between/IN suppliers/NNS ./.

What/WP was/VBD mentioned/VBN concerning/VBG sugar/NN in/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP is/VBZ more/RBR complicated/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP committed/JJ to/TO try/VB to/TO create/VB a/DT balance/NN in/IN all/PDT these/DT issues/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD mention/VB the/DT achievement/NN of/IN the/DT trade/NN development/NN and/CC cooperation/NN agreement/NN with/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP ./.

In/IN all/DT modesty/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD claim/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT documents/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO walk/VB or/CC fly/VB the/DT extra/JJ mile/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB coherence/NN between/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN development/NN cooperation/NN and/CC the/DT perspective/NN of/IN trade/NN interests/NNS ./.

We/PRP certainly/RB have/VBP done/VBN our/PRP$ share/NN to/TO solve/VB that/DT problem/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP sincerely/RB hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP now/RB will/MD have/VB a/DT soft/JJ landing/NN and/CC a/DT peaceful/JJ implementation/NN in/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ years/NNS of/IN that/DT agreement/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP thank/VBP you/PRP again/RB for/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN eight/CD motions/NNS for/IN resolutions/NNS tabled/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Rule/NNP 37/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP at/IN 12.00/CD p.m./RB Next/JJ session/NN of/IN UN/NNP Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT statement/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP on/IN EU/JJ priorities/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT UN/NNP Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP on/IN 20/CD March/NNP 2000/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP played/VBD an/DT active/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT 55th/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP held/VBD in/IN Geneva/NNP in/IN March/NNP and/CC April/NNP 1999/CD ./.

It/PRP tabled/VBD resolutions/NNS on/IN the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS situation/NN in/IN Iran/NNP ,/, Iraq/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT Israeli/JJ settlements/NNS ,/, in/IN Burma/Myanmar/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT Democratic/JJ Republic/NN of/IN the/DT Congo/NNP and/CC in/IN Sudan/NNP ,/, and/CC negotiated/VBD statements/NNS to/TO be/VB issued/VBN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT chairman/NN on/IN Colombia/NNP and/CC on/IN East/NNP Timor/NNP ./.

For/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP tabled/VBD a/DT resolution/NN on/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD enormously/RB successful/JJ ,/, and/CC led/VBD work/NN on/IN a/DT resolution/NN concerning/VBG children/NNS '/POS s/JJ rights/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT joint/JJ initiative/NN with/IN the/DT Latin/NNP American/NNP group/NN of/IN countries/NNS ./.

The/DT Union/NNP will/MD continue/VB to/TO play/VB this/DT role/NN at/IN the/DT 56th/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB held/VBN in/IN Geneva/NNP in/IN March/NNP and/CC April/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD continue/VB discussions/NNS on/IN preparations/NNS for/IN the/DT 56th/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP at/IN the/DT next/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Group/NNP in/IN March/NNP ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT discussion/NN of/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN tabling/VBG a/DT draft/NN resolution/NN on/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, at/IN the/DT 55th/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP held/VBN last/JJ year/NN ,/, the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS decided/VBD ,/, at/IN a/DT very/RB late/JJ stage/NN ,/, to/TO table/VB a/DT draft/NN resolution/NN on/IN China/NNP ./.

This/DT draft/NN resolution/NN was/VBD defeated/VBN by/IN a/DT Chinese/JJ no-action/JJ motion/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP voted/VBD against/IN that/DT motion/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ by/IN no/DT means/NN certain/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP could/MD have/VB maintained/VBN a/DT united/VBN front/NN if/IN this/DT resolution/NN had/VBD been/VBN put/VBN to/TO the/DT vote/NN ./.

The/DT United/NNP States/NNPS of/IN America/NNP will/MD be/VB tabling/VBG a/DT draft/NN resolution/NN on/IN China/NNP at/IN the/DT 56th/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP and/CC are/VBP putting/VBG pressure/NN on/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO support/VB this/DT draft/NN resolution/NN ./.

This/DT initiative/NN has/VBZ provoked/VBN a/DT strong/JJ reaction/NN on/IN China/NNP '/POS s/JJ part/NN :/: the/DT Chinese/JJ authorities/NNS are/VBP making/VBG representations/NNS to/TO the/DT countries/NNS and/CC institutions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO persuade/VB them/PRP not/RB to/TO support/VB the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS '/POS initiative/NN ./.

This/DT initiative/NN is/VBZ being/VBG discussed/VBN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, but/CC with/IN no/DT hope/NN of/IN a/DT decision/NN in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO keep/VB all/PDT its/PRP$ options/NNS open/JJ for/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ,/, and/CC in/IN any/DT case/NN at/IN least/JJS until/IN after/IN the/DT EU-China/JJ human/JJ rights/NNS dialogue/NN meeting/NN is/VBZ held/VBN on/IN 25/CD February/NNP 2000/CD ./.

In/IN view/NN of/IN changes/NNS made/VBN to/TO the/DT membership/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP ,/, we/PRP estimate/VBP the/DT vote/NN on/IN the/DT no-action/JJ motion/NN will/MD be/VB close/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ this/DT year/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD reach/VB a/DT consensus/NN on/IN the/DT position/NN to/TO take/VB in/IN any/DT vote/NN on/IN the/DT resolution/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO note/VB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP regularly/RB opposes/VBZ requests/NNS by/IN China/NNP that/IN the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS dialogue/NN should/MD automatically/RB rule/VB out/RP tabling/VBG a/DT resolution/NN at/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP in/IN Geneva/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP also/RB regularly/RB informs/VBZ China/NNP that/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP is/VBZ the/DT appropriate/JJ body/NN for/IN considering/VBG human/JJ rights/NNS issues/NNS ,/, and/CC whether/IN or/CC not/RB it/PRP agrees/VBZ with/IN this/DT initiative/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ in/IN any/DT case/NN legitimate/JJ from/IN this/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ human/JJ rights/NNS dialogue/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN on/IN 25/CD February/NNP in/IN Lisbon/NNP ,/, and/CC will/MD include/VB seminars/NNS on/IN legal/JJ issues/NNS and/CC on/IN women/NNS '/POS s/JJ rights/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ expected/VBN that/IN representatives/NNS from/IN the/DT academic/JJ world/NN and/CC from/IN civil/JJ society/NN will/MD take/VB part/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ discussing/VBG issues/NNS on/IN which/WDT it/PRP hopes/VBZ that/IN China/NNP will/MD take/VB concrete/JJ measures/NNS ,/, and/CC on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN these/DT discussions/NNS the/DT presidency/NN will/MD convey/VB to/TO the/DT Chinese/JJ authorities/NNS the/DT message/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP hopes/VBZ China/NNP will/MD announce/VB positive/JJ measures/NNS at/IN the/DT session/NN on/IN 25/CD February/NNP ./.

The/DT presidency/NN will/MD also/RB present/VB to/TO the/DT Chinese/JJ authorities/NNS a/DT list/NN of/IN individual/JJ cases/NNS on/IN which/WDT it/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO express/VB its/PRP$ serious/JJ concern/NN ./.

On/IN various/JJ occasions/NNS the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ reiterated/VBN to/TO the/DT Chinese/JJ authorities/NNS its/PRP$ disappointment/NN with/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT dialogue/NN ,/, and/CC has/VBZ stressed/VBN that/IN it/PRP hoped/VBD for/IN better/JJR outcomes/NNS in/IN certain/JJ more/RBR sensitive/JJ areas/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD decided/VBN that/IN the/DT dialogue/NN should/MD continue/VB ,/, but/CC in/IN a/DT more/RBR targeted/JJ and/CC effective/JJ way/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN China/NNP has/VBZ agreed/VBN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN to/TO restructure/VB the/DT dialogue/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN better/JJR use/NN of/IN experts/NNS and/CC to/TO establish/VB a/DT closer/JJR link/NN with/IN the/DT seminars/NNS ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, during/IN the/DT next/JJ Human/NNP Rights/NNP Commission/NNP there/EX will/MD also/RB be/VB a/DT debate/NN on/IN rationalising/VBG the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP ./.

A/DT working/VBG party/NN has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT express/JJ task/NN of/IN revising/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ mechanisms/NNS ./.

This/DT working/VBG party/NN has/VBZ worked/VBN hard/RB to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO enhance/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ mechanisms/NNS and/CC to/TO make/VB them/PRP more/RBR rigorous/JJ ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT financial/JJ field/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD oppose/VB any/DT spurious/JJ attempt/NN to/TO use/VB this/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ activities/NNS to/TO limit/VB its/PRP$ capacity/NN for/IN intervention/NN by/IN restricting/VBG its/PRP$ sphere/NN of/IN influence/NN and/CC its/PRP$ ongoing/JJ monitoring/NN of/IN all/DT human/JJ rights/NNS issues/NNS at/IN world/NN level/NN ./. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT presidency/NN for/IN the/DT work/NN it/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN Geneva/NNP on/IN subjects/NNS like/IN racism/NN ,/, civil/JJ and/CC political/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT right/NN to/TO development/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT presidency/NN said/VBD ,/, much/RB remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN ,/, despite/IN the/DT understandable/JJ request/NN by/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC many/JJ NGOs/NNS that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD set/VB out/RP its/PRP$ position/NN well/RB in/IN advance/NN of/IN the/DT Geneva/NNP session/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ easier/JJR said/VBD than/IN done/VBN -/: we/PRP are/VBP still/RB discussing/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT toughest/JJS issues/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, discussion/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG place/VB about/RB many/JJ of/IN the/DT matters/NNS raised/VBN in/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ resolution/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB early/JJ to/TO predict/VB the/DT outcome/NN in/IN all/DT cases/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB surprising/JJ that/IN the/DT debate/NN is/VBZ long/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ ./.

That/DT does/VBZ not/RB suggest/VB any/DT lack/NN of/IN commitment/NN to/TO the/DT improvement/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ indicate/VB the/DT usual/JJ concern/NN to/TO get/VB our/PRP$ approach/NN right/RB so/RB that/IN we/PRP really/RB make/VBP a/DT difference/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP reflect/VB that/DT concern/NN by/IN referring/VBG to/TO three/CD controversial/JJ issues/NNS :/: the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ,/, Cuba/NNP and/CC China/NNP ./.

I/PRP suppose/VBP that/IN the/DT first/JJ thing/NN they/PRP say/VBP will/MD be/VB ,/, `/`` let/VB us/PRP see/VB whether/IN you/PRP are/VBP capable/JJ of/IN reaching/VBG a/DT fiscal/JJ agreement/NN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS ./.

In/IN itself/PRP ,/, globalisation/NN is/VBZ positive/JJ ./.

The/DT economy/NN has/VBZ never/RB grown/VBN so/RB much/RB nor/CC favoured/VBD so/RB many/JJ countries/NNS on/IN a/DT global/JJ level/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO progressive/JJ opening/VBG up/RP and/CC greater/JJR freedom/NN in/IN the/DT international/JJ trade/NN in/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS and/CC also/RB a/DT greater/JJR capacity/NN for/IN adequate/JJ movement/NN of/IN capital/NN ./.

Any/DT analysis/NN of/IN economic/JJ development/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, if/IN objective/NN ,/, will/MD show/VB ,/, through/IN the/DT figures/NNS ,/, that/IN they/PRP have/VBP no/DT political/JJ colour/NN or/CC orientation/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB opposed/VBN to/TO such/PDT a/DT study/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN does/VBZ not/RB lie/VB in/IN the/DT ideology/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN but/CC in/IN its/PRP$ political/JJ nature/NN ./.

As/IN Mrs/NNP Randzio-Plath/NNP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP must/MD remember/VB that/IN the/DT reason/NN why/WRB certain/JJ Members/NNS want/VBP to/TO revive/VB this/DT question/NN is/VBZ because/RB of/IN the/DT recent/JJ international/JJ financial/JJ crises/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ economic/JJ ,/, social/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ consequences/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN felt/VBN by/IN all/DT in/IN some/DT countries/NNS ./.

The/DT main/JJ objective/NN of/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT instruments/NNS available/JJ to/TO the/DT international/JJ community/NN for/IN stabilising/VBG the/DT international/JJ financial/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ system/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Bolkestein/NNP ,/, the/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB separated/VBN from/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP look/VBP carefully/RB ,/, this/DT proposed/VBN tax/NN on/IN capital/NN is/VBZ just/RB one/CD of/IN several/JJ instruments/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN forcing/VBG international/JJ investors/NNS to/TO behave/VB responsibly/RB on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT motion/NN does/VBZ not/RB say/VB that/IN we/PRP want/VBP a/DT solely/RB European/JJ initiative/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP explicitly/RB refer/VBP to/TO the/DT autumn/NN session/NN of/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP so/RB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC also/RB the/DT Council/NNP ,/, can/MD decide/VB how/WRB it/PRP will/MD defend/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO stabilise/VB the/DT international/JJ financial/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ system/NN and/CC introduce/VB international/JJ taxation/NN ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT confusion/NN in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

As/IN environmentalists/NNS ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB an/DT excuse/NN for/IN a/DT motion/NN ./.

Although/IN a/DT study/NN produced/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP would/MD doubtless/RB be/VB interesting/JJ ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB need/VB another/DT to/TO add/VB to/TO those/DT already/RB available/JJ ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT argument/NN that/IN this/DT initiative/NN would/MD increase/VB uncertainty/NN ,/, very/RB short-term/JJ capital/NN movements/NNS are/VBP specifically/RB intended/VBN to/TO play/VB on/IN uncertainty/NN and/CC to/TO bet/VB on/IN changes/NNS between/IN currencies/NNS or/CC various/JJ short-term/JJ financial/JJ assets/NNS ./.

This/DT argument/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB not/RB relevant/JJ ./.

I/PRP will/MD not/RB go/VB into/IN the/DT basic/JJ issue/NN any/DT further/RBR for/IN everyone/NN has/VBZ their/PRP$ arguments/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD highlight/VB not/RB only/JJ paragraph/NN 9/CD of/IN the/DT motion/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB paragraph/NN 10/CD ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ Group/NNP is/VBZ extremely/RB delighted/JJ that/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG place/NN today/NN ,/, particularly/RB as/IN we/PRP have/VBP spared/VBN no/DT effort/NN along/IN with/IN Members/NNS of/IN other/JJ groups/NNS to/TO bring/VB this/DT about/RB ./.

Obviously/RB we/PRP all/DT have/VBP different/JJ approaches/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ debate/NN and/CC the/DT motions/NNS for/IN a/DT resolution/NN tabled/VBN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, our/PRP$ Group/NNP is/VBZ pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT step/NN forward/RB which/WDT the/DT compromise/NN motion/NN represents/VBZ ./.

This/DT invites/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO present/VB a/DT report/NN within/IN six/CD months/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP can/MD play/VB its/PRP$ role/NN by/IN taking/VBG the/DT initiative/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP does/VBZ so/RB timidly/JJ ,/, on/IN this/DT subject/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN that/IN ,/, if/IN paragraph/NN 9/CD were/VBD challenged/VBN ,/, this/DT motion/NN would/MD clearly/RB lose/VB its/PRP$ substance/NN ./.

This/DT debate/NN concerns/VBZ a/DT vital/JJ question/NN which/WDT increasing/VBG numbers/NNS of/IN people/NNS are/VBP legitimately/RB raising/VBG ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT respective/JJ places/NNS of/IN people/NNS and/CC finance/NN in/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ economy/NN ?/.

USD/NNP 1/CD 800/CD billion/CD is/VBZ the/DT volume/NN of/IN money/NN moved/VBD every/DT day/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ currency/NN markets/NNS ./.

This/DT represents/VBZ over/IN a/DT quarter/NN of/IN the/DT annual/JJ global/JJ volume/NN of/IN trade/NN in/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS ./.

By/IN putting/VBG finance/NN at/IN the/DT helm/NN ,/, this/DT has/VBZ reinforced/VBD the/DT demands/NNS of/IN profitability/NN and/CC toughened/VBD the/DT operating/NN conditions/NNS everywhere/RB ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ led/VBN to/TO a/DT growth/NN in/IN mergers/NNS ,/, acquisitions/NNS and/CC company/NN restructuring/NN and/CC to/TO gigantic/JJ sums/NNS being/VBG raised/VBN with/IN increasing/VBG frequency/NN on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

Unemployment/NN and/CC pressure/NN on/IN employees/NNS worldwide/RB is/VBZ increasing/VBG ./.

Openings/NNS and/CC real/JJ growth/NN are/VBP being/VBG hampered/VBN and/CC the/DT sudden/JJ influx/NN or/CC withdrawal/NN of/IN speculative/JJ capital/NN is/VBZ threatening/VBG the/DT economies/NNS of/IN many/JJ countries/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN collapse/NN ,/, as/RB in/IN Asia/NNP ,/, Russia/NNP and/CC Brazil/NNP ./.

Faced/VBN with/IN this/DT neoliberal/JJ globalisation/NN dominated/VBN by/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, demand/NN ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ motion/NN recognises/VBZ ,/, is/VBZ developing/VBG from/IN a/DT different/JJ idea/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN which/WDT common/JJ law/NN stipulates/VBZ a/DT duty/NN of/IN solidarity/NN in/IN an/DT increasingly/RB interdependent/JJ world/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN can/MD ignore/VB the/DT challenge/NN to/TO civilisation/NN posed/VBN by/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN nearly/RB one/CD billion/CD jobs/NNS and/CC the/DT need/NN to/TO make/VB unprecedented/JJ efforts/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN development/NN and/CC access/NN to/TO information/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, all/DT ideas/NNS deserve/VBP to/TO be/VB considered/VBN ,/, including/VBG the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN which/WDT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, just/RB like/IN other/JJ forms/NNS of/IN transaction/NN which/WDT may/MD be/VB envisaged/JJ ./.

When/WRB the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT ability/NN of/IN politics/NNS to/TO influence/NN economics/NNS goes/VBZ global/JJ ,/, the/DT establishment/NN of/IN this/DT tax/NN could/MD become/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT symbols/NNS of/IN the/DT political/JJ desire/NN to/TO recapture/VB the/DT democratic/JJ areas/NNS seized/VBN by/IN the/DT international/JJ financial/JJ operators/NNS ./.

The/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN that/IN a/DT minimum/JJ number/NN of/IN industrialised/JJ countries/NNS would/MD be/VB needed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ./.

I/PRP would/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN industrialised/JJ countries/NNS and/CC ,/, like/IN Mr/NNP D脙/NNP 漏/NNP sir/NNP and/CC several/JJ other/JJ speakers/NNS ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP forming/VBG can/MD take/VB the/DT initiative/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP would/MD be/VB honoured/VBN to/TO take/VB up/RP the/DT call/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS to/TO control/VB the/DT world/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT sense/NN of/IN well-being/NN for/IN everyone/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB am/VBP delighted/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP having/VBG this/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP only/RB regret/VBP that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN so/RB long/JJ in/IN coming/VBG ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN each/DT generation/NN has/VBZ ,/, over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, blindly/RB bought/VBN into/IN what/WP could/MD be/VB called/VBN a/DT dominant/JJ ideology/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT set/NN of/IN prejudices/NNS accepted/VBD as/IN such/JJ due/NN to/TO a/DT general/JJ conformism/NN ,/, but/CC whose/WP$ dramatic/JJ nature/NN can/MD be/VB seen/VBN by/IN subsequent/JJ generations/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ world/NN is/VBZ now/RB dominated/VBN by/IN a/DT single/JJ logic/NN or/CC ,/, I/PRP could/MD say/VB ,/, a/DT single/JJ god/NN of/IN money/NN at/IN work/NN instead/RB of/IN people/NNS at/IN work/NN ./.

With/IN a/DT figure/NN for/IN trade/NN in/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS of/IN FRF/NNP 36/CD 000/CD billion/CD only/RB being/VBG equal/JJ to/TO the/DT product/NN of/IN four/CD days/NNS '/POS speculation/NN ,/, the/DT financial/JJ bubble/NN owes/VBZ very/RB little/JJ to/TO the/DT productive/JJ activity/NN of/IN individuals/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD natural/JJ that/IN these/DT 脙/NNP 漏/NNP lites/NNS would/MD exclude/VB any/DT political/JJ concerns/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ field/NN of/IN manoeuvre/NN ,/, thus/RB protecting/VBG themselves/PRP from/IN any/DT democratic/JJ control/NN and/CC basically/RB managing/VBG to/TO be/VB both/DT illegitimate/JJ and/CC irresponsible/JJ ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, although/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT aims/NNS of/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN are/VBP fairly/RB worthy/JJ of/IN support/NN ,/, introducing/VBG the/DT tax/NN exclusively/RB within/IN the/DT territory/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT first/JJ area/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB ,/, would/MD sound/VB the/DT death/NN knell/NN for/IN the/DT European/JJ currency/NN markets/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/CD other/JJ important/JJ currency/NN trading/NN areas/NNS were/VBD to/TO be/VB excluded/VBN from/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN tax/NN was/VBD liable/JJ to/TO be/VB paid/VBN in/IN Europe/NNP would/MD lead/VB to/TO currency/NN dealing/VBG moving/VBG to/TO those/DT areas/NNS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN made/VBN clear/JJ a/DT number/NN times/NNS in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ that/IN all/PDT the/DT world/NN '/POS s/NNS industrialised/VBD countries/NNS should/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT scheme/NN ,/, as/IN then/RB currency/NN trading/NN would/MD move/VB to/TO tax/NN havens/NNS outside/IN that/DT group/NN of/IN countries/NNS ./.

There/EX should/MD therefore/RB be/VB a/DT universal/JJ application/NN :/: it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ that/IN the/DT G7/CD countries/NNS or/CC the/DT other/JJ industrialised/JJ countries/NNS are/VBP involved/VBN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB so/RB difficult/JJ to/TO bring/VB the/DT scheme/NN into/IN force/NN everywhere/RB in/IN the/DT world/NN at/IN precisely/RB the/DT same/JJ time/NN -/: and/CC personally/RB speaking/VBG ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB we/PRP can/MD achieve/VB this/DT -/: that/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN dream/NN might/MD as/RB well/RB be/VB buried/VBN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, although/IN there/EX might/MD be/VB international/JJ consensus/NN on/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT scheme/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN would/MD remain/VB regarding/VBG how/WRB the/DT tax/NN revenue/NN would/MD be/VB distributed/VBN ./.

The/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ currency/NN dealing/VBG centres/NNS will/MD hardly/RB agree/VB to/TO the/DT tax/NN revenue/NN being/VBG used/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN well-meaning/JJ ,/, UN-backed/JJ purposes/NNS throughout/IN the/DT world/NN without/IN a/DT considerable/JJ amount/NN of/IN the/DT revenue/NN remaining/VBG with/IN them/PRP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN as/IN a/DT means/NN of/IN preventing/VBG future/JJ currency/NN crises/NNS ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB realised/VBN that/IN the/DT causes/NNS of/IN a/DT currency/NN being/VBG overvalued/VBN can/MD not/RB be/VB averted/VBN through/IN taxation/NN ./.

For/IN that/DT reason/NN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Karas/NNP also/RB said/VBD ,/, we/PRP should/MD give/VB more/JJR attention/NN to/TO the/DT policies/NNS that/WDT lead/VBP to/TO a/DT certain/JJ currency/NN being/VBG overvalued/VBN in/IN relation/NN to/TO its/PRP$ actual/JJ potential/JJ value/NN ./.

This/DT again/RB would/MD require/VB measures/NNS to/TO regulate/VB the/DT exportation/NN and/CC importation/NN of/IN capital/NN ;/: otherwise/RB it/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB possible/JJ to/TO focus/VB on/IN policies/NNS in/IN this/DT way/NN ./.

Although/IN it/PRP seems/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ scheme/NN ,/, the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN is/VBZ not/RB without/IN its/PRP$ problems/NNS ,/, even/RB if/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB agreement/NN as/IN to/TO its/PRP$ implementation/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB there/EX will/MD ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB remembered/VBN that/IN money/NN at/IN present/NN is/VBZ first/JJ and/CC foremost/JJ information/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT global/JJ economy/NN will/MD ,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, rotate/VB more/RBR and/CC more/RBR on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN information/NN and/CC intellectual/JJ capital/NN ./.

For/IN that/DT reason/NN ,/, the/DT uninterrupted/JJ flow/NN of/IN assets/NNS in/IN massive/JJ volumes/NNS between/IN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ centres/NNS is/VBZ not/RB merely/RB speculative/JJ activity/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT real/JJ economy/NN ./.

Hence/RB ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Karas/NNP has/VBZ stated/VBN to/TO his/PRP$ credit/NN ,/, our/PRP$ Group/NNP is/VBZ resolutely/RB opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP speak/VBP as/IN someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ in/IN support/NN of/IN a/DT tax/NN on/IN speculative/JJ capital/NN movements/NNS across/IN currency/NN borders/NNS ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP blindingly/RB self-evident/JJ that/IN some/DT action/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ ./.

The/DT size/NN ,/, unpredictability/NN and/CC irrationality/NN of/IN the/DT global/JJ foreign/JJ exchange/NN markets/NNS have/VBP made/VBN it/PRP harder/JJR and/CC harder/JJR to/TO manage/VB national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ economies/NNS ./.

Computer-controlled/JJ selling/NN programmes/NNS turned/VBD a/DT random/JJ blip/NN into/IN an/DT avalanche/NN ,/, burying/VBG jobs/NNS ,/, lives/NNS and/CC industries/NNS across/IN the/DT globe/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ arguments/NNS against/IN it/PRP are/VBP :/: firstly/RB ,/, it/PRP would/MD impair/VB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT foreign/JJ exchange/NN market/NN -/: a/DT little/JJ fanciful/NN in/IN light/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ feeding/NN frenzies/VBZ we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN that/IN have/VBP destroyed/VBN jobs/NNS throughout/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, in/IN East/NNP Asia/NNP ,/, Europe/NNP and/CC Latin/NNP America/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Chirac/NNP has/VBZ described/VBN those/DT who/WP engage/VBP in/IN this/DT as/IN the/DT Aids/NNP virus/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN economy/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ necessary/JJ is/VBZ to/TO throw/VB some/DT sand/NN into/IN the/DT wheels/NNS of/IN the/DT currency/NN speculators/NNS ,/, stockbrokers/NNS and/CC option/NN traders/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, this/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB done/VBN in/IN one/CD country/NN ;/: it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB done/VBN within/IN the/DT single/JJ currency/NN area/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP could/MD be/VB done/VBN at/IN international/JJ level/NN with/IN global/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Europe/NNP ,/, Japan/NNP and/CC the/DT US/NNP -/: the/DT euro/NN ,/, the/DT yen/NN and/CC the/DT dollar/NN ,/, would/MD constitute/VB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, such/PDT a/DT block/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP disappointed/VBN in/IN the/DT EPP/NNP ./.

I/PRP thought/VBD at/IN least/JJS they/PRP read/VBD the/DT resolutions/NNS they/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO vote/VB on/RP ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO vote/VB on/IN tomorrow/NN is/VBZ to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO study/VB the/DT matter/NN ,/, to/TO look/VB at/IN what/WP steps/VBZ and/CC what/WP conditions/NNS would/MD be/VB necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT tax/NN ./.

Equally/RB I/PRP understand/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP failing/VBG to/TO endorse/VB such/PDT a/DT tax/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP can/MD not/RB understand/VB why/WRB he/PRP failed/VBD to/TO have/VB the/DT courage/NN to/TO welcome/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT truth/NN of/IN his/PRP$ position/NN by/IN a/DT study/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN so/RB closed/JJ as/IN a/DT closed/VBN mind/NN ./.

The/DT tax/NN has/VBZ the/DT support/NN of/IN 47/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT UK/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO a/DT recent/JJ survey/NN by/IN War/NNP on/IN Want/NNP ./.

In/IN France/NNP it/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN enormous/JJ resonance/NN ,/, particularly/RB when/WRB linked/VBN to/TO a/DT demand/NN to/TO use/VB the/DT proceeds/NNS to/TO help/VB the/DT Third/NNP World/NNP out/RP of/IN its/PRP$ debt/NN and/CC poverty/NN ./.

This/DT issue/NN can/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB ignored/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP or/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ now/RB a/DT weight/NN of/IN public/JJ opinion/NN demanding/VBG an/DT answer/NN more/RBR sophisticated/JJ than/IN :/: ``/`` It/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN done/VBN before/RB ''/'' ./.

In/IN the/DT new/JJ millennium/NN ,/, with/IN new/JJ global/JJ problems/NNS requiring/VBG new/JJ global/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, they/PRP need/VBP to/TO give/VB good/JJ arguments/NNS why/WRB it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB done/VBN now/RB ,/, rather/RB than/IN why/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN done/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, a/DT compromise/NN resolution/NN on/IN the/DT usefulness/NN of/IN a/DT tax/NN on/IN international/JJ financial/JJ flows/NNS would/MD constitute/VB a/DT first/JJ step/NN towards/IN the/DT essential/JJ amendment/NN of/IN many/JJ international/JJ rules/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP two/CD or/CC three/CD points/NNS to/TO make/VB in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ demands/NNS of/IN the/DT demonstrators/NNS in/IN Seattle/NNP was/VBD ,/, rightly/RB ,/, the/DT establishment/NN of/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN tax/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB by/IN chance/NN ./.

Everyone/NN feels/VBZ that/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN joint/JJ tax/NN is/VBZ a/DT virtuous/JJ measure/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB prevent/VB trade/NN but/CC is/VBZ aimed/VBN primarily/RB at/IN speculation/NN and/CC its/PRP$ perverse/JJ effects/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB maintain/VB a/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT income/NN from/IN non-economic/JJ activities/NNS increases/VBZ more/RBR and/CC more/RBR quickly/RB ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN demonstrated/VBN in/IN Germany/NNP that/IN income/NN from/IN monetary/JJ assets/NNS has/VBZ almost/RB doubled/VBN from/IN 7.6/CD %/NN of/IN overall/JJ economic/JJ income/NN since/IN Tobin/NNP developed/VBD his/PRP$ idea/NN ./.

Why/WRB should/MD it/PRP be/VB impracticable/JJ to/TO set/VB this/DT tax/NN at/IN a/DT rate/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB jeopardise/VB the/DT long-term/JJ investments/NNS needed/VBN by/IN the/DT economy/NN but/CC which/WDT finally/RB makes/VBZ short-term/JJ and/CC speculative/JJ investments/NNS unattractive/JJ ./.

Numerous/JJ very/RB difficult/JJ questions/NNS are/VBP bound/VBN to/TO arise/VB ,/, but/CC the/DT only/RB real/JJ problem/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD see/VB so/RB far/RB is/VBZ one/CD of/IN political/JJ will/NN and/CC the/DT St./NNP Florian/NNP principle/NN of/IN shifting/VBG responsibility/NN from/IN one/CD agency/NN to/TO another/DT which/WDT has/VBZ now/RB taken/VBN hold/VB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB asking/VBG for/IN more/JJR bureaucracy/NN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Karas/NNP put/VBD it/PRP just/RB a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS ago/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN solutions/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN capital/NN markets/NNS need/VBP clarity/RB -/: that/DT is/VBZ actually/RB the/DT idea/NN ./.

The/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN will/MD bring/VB some/DT transparency/NN to/TO a/DT very/RB obscure/JJ question/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT more/JJR progress/NN is/VBZ made/VBN towards/IN trade/NN liberalisation/NN ,/, the/DT more/JJR rules/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN ''/'' ,/, as/IN Commissioner/NNP Lamy/NNP said/VBD during/IN the/DT Millennium/NNP Round/NNP in/IN Seattle/NNP ./.

We/PRP citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN can/MD not/RB afford/VB the/DT current/JJ rate/NN of/IN speculation/NN ./.

To/TO continue/VB would/MD be/VB economic/JJ suicide/NN ./.

Honourable/JJ Members/NNS ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB said/VBD that/IN Europe/NNP has/VBZ succeeded/VBN in/IN stabilising/VBG the/DT economic/JJ sector/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ only/RB true/JJ if/IN we/PRP confine/VBP ourselves/PRP purely/RB to/TO the/DT public/JJ sector/NN ./.

The/DT debt/NN burdens/NNS of/IN the/DT private/JJ sector/NN and/CC the/DT corresponding/JJ excessive/JJ inflation/NN of/IN Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP securities/NNS ,/, the/DT two/CD main/JJ market/NN stability/NN indicators/NNS ,/, have/VBP ,/, for/IN some/DT time/NN ,/, been/VBN at/IN danger/NN levels/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP report/NN on/IN the/DT economic/JJ situation/NN in/IN Europe/NNP clearly/RB illustrates/VBZ ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT public/NN accepts/VBZ such/JJ rates/NNS and/CC does/VBZ not/RB just/RB abandon/VB all/DT financial/JJ activities/NNS in/IN a/DT panic/NN can/MD be/VB explained/VBN by/IN overambitious/JJ expectations/NNS over/IN future/JJ gains/NNS ./.

Speculative/JJ activities/NNS are/VBP growing/VBG beyond/IN measure/NN and/CC are/VBP ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, generating/VBG profits/NNS which/WDT will/MD eventually/RB prove/VB to/TO be/VB merely/RB fictitious/JJ ./.

We/PRP ought/MD to/TO face/VB it/PRP regardless/RB of/IN how/WRB difficult/JJ it/PRP may/MD seem/VB ./.

Modern/NNP economic/JJ science/NN has/VBZ provided/VBN an/DT exceptional/JJ instrument/NN with/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP proposal/NN and/CC others/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO use/VB if/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT political/JJ will/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT start/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP lacking/VBG ,/, Commissioner/NNP :/: the/DT political/JJ will/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT start/NN in/IN tackling/VBG speculation/NN ./.

No/DT longer/JJR should/MD there/RB be/VB a/DT place/NN in/IN democracy/NN for/IN the/DT worship/NN of/IN ,/, or/CC for/IN this/DT fatalist/JJ approach/NN towards/NNP ,/, market/NN forces/NNS as/RB adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT liberals/NNS -/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sorry/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP Gas脙/NNP 虏/NNP liba/NN I/NN B脙/NNP 露/NNP hm/NNP has/VBZ left/VBN -/: as/IN this/DT will/MD only/RB lead/VB to/TO its/PRP$ ruin/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Bolkestein/NNP ,/, the/DT ignorance/NN surrounding/VBG this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ unbelievable/JJ ./.

We/PRP needed/VBD a/DT Greek/JJ Member/NN to/TO finally/RB tell/VB us/PRP what/WP this/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN means/VBZ ./.

You/PRP reject/VBP it/PRP flatly/RB because/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB understand/VB the/DT first/JJ thing/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/DT !/NN ./.

But/CC now/RB I/PRP call/VBP on/RP you/PRP ,/, in/IN all/DT consciousness/NN ,/, to/TO help/VB put/VB a/DT stop/NN to/TO speculative/JJ financial/JJ transactions/NNS and/CC undermining/VBG long-term/JJ projects/NNS with/IN long-term/JJ capital/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN done/VBN in/IN south-east/JJ Asia/NNP ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN done/VBN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP can/MD understand/VB why/WRB Mr/NNP Karas/NNP from/IN Austria/NNP has/VBZ left/VBN the/DT chamber/NN ,/, given/VBN Austria/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ record/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP all/DT tarred/NNP with/IN the/DT same/JJ dirty/JJ brush/NN !/. ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN to/TO give/VB us/PRP a/DT fiscal/JJ instrument/NN with/IN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD intervene/VB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP totally/RB appalled/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN ,/, i.e./VBZ Mr/NNP Bolkestein/NNP '/POS s/NN ,/, political/JJ ignorance/NN !/. ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB have/VBP found/VBN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT debate/NN quite/RB bizarre/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ perhaps/RB not/RB by/IN chance/NN that/IN the/DT Conservative/JJ benches/NNS have/VBP emptied/VBN because/IN that/DT which/WDT is/VBZ represented/VBN as/IN market/NN freedom/NN no/RB longer/RB has/VBZ anything/NN in/IN common/JJ with/IN the/DT noble/JJ principles/NNS of/IN the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN which/WDT has/VBZ brought/VBN so/RB much/JJ prosperity/NN to/TO us/PRP here/RB in/IN western/JJ Europe/NNP over/IN recent/JJ decades/NNS ./.

Those/DT who/WP own/VBP the/DT monetary/JJ assets/NNS are/VBP currently/RB amassing/VBG huge/JJ fortunes/NNS which/WDT are/VBP again/RB screaming/VBG out/RP to/TO be/VB reinvested/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP asset/NN inflation/NN of/IN global/JJ proportions/NNS ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, speculative/JJ bubbles/NNS continually/RB arise/VBP on/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ,/, causing/VBG growing/VBG economic/JJ instability/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, jeopardises/VBZ the/DT entire/JJ economy/NN ./.

And/CC it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT medium-sized/JJ undertakings/NNS and/CC large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN employees/NNS who/WP suffer/VBP as/IN a/DT result/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD take/VB action/NN against/IN this/DT ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ ./.

The/DT minimum/JJ requirements/NNS for/IN this/DT would/MD be/VB for/IN a/DT proper/JJ study/NN to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP at/IN long/JJ last/JJ ,/, not/RB only/JJ by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC by/IN reputable/JJ economic/JJ institutes/NNS throughout/IN Europe/NNP ./.

That/DT too/RB is/VBZ feasible/JJ ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN requires/VBZ these/DT products/NNS to/TO be/VB clearly/RB traceable/JJ at/IN all/DT stages/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ marketing/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, before/IN labelling/VBG we/PRP need/VBP clear/JJ rules/NNS ./.

Straight/JJ questions/NNS must/MD be/VB asked/VBN about/IN the/DT real/JJ end-use/NN of/IN animal/NN meal/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

Although/IN we/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG at/IN all/PDT the/DT problems/NNS caused/VBN by/IN these/DT products/NNS in/IN ethical/JJ and/CC health/NN terms/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ their/PRP$ use/NN which/WDT must/MD be/VB questioned/VBN today/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT chapter/NN of/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN which/WDT deals/VBZ with/IN feedingstuffs/NNS must/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT working/VBG basis/NN for/IN going/VBG beyond/IN mere/JJ commercial/JJ questions/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ on/IN many/JJ occasions/NNS used/VBN the/DT farm-to-table/JJ example/NN which/WDT our/PRP$ colleague/NN in/IN the/DT PPE/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ just/RB underlined/VBD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ idea/NN but/CC it/PRP must/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO be/VB meaningful/JJ and/CC ,/, to/TO do/VB this/DT ,/, the/DT problems/NNS linked/VBN to/TO animals/NNS and/CC those/DT linked/VBN to/TO consumer/NN health/NN must/MD be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.

Also/RB ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 4/CD and/CC 5/CD to/TO the/DT new/JJ Article/NNP 2a/NN must/MD be/VB approved/VBN as/IN these/DT will/MD ensure/VB that/IN genetically/RB modified/JJ additives/NNS are/VBP clearly/RB identified/VBN as/IN such/JJ ,/, thus/RB allowing/VBG users/NNS to/TO make/VB fully/RB informed/VBN decisions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, because/RB of/IN the/DT availability/NN of/IN high-technology/JJ additives/NNS in/IN the/DT feedingstuffs/JJ industry/NN ,/, detailed/JJ information/NN on/IN their/PRP$ use/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN from/IN the/DT actors/NNS ,/, and/CC as/IN we/PRP know/VBP there/EX are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN them/PRP ,/, so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD put/VB a/DT stop/NN to/TO practices/NNS which/WDT infringe/VB Community/NNP law/NN ./.

This/DT directive/NN on/IN additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS can/MD not/RB achieve/VB this/DT on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

Other/JJ directives/NNS will/MD follow/VB and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP is/VBZ well/RB placed/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.

Up/IN the/DT point/NN at/IN which/WDT meat/NN ,/, milk/NN ,/, bread/NN and/CC other/JJ products/NNS are/VBP sold/VBN over/IN the/DT shop/NN counter/NN ,/, feedingstuffs/NNS and/CC additives/NNS are/VBP structured/VBN ,/, mixed/JJ ,/, blended/VBN ,/, cut/VBN and/CC transported/VBN several/JJ times/NNS ./.

The/DT fight/NN by/IN feedingstuff/NN manufacturers/NNS to/TO gain/VB maximum/JJ market/NN shares/NNS causes/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN problems/NNS ,/, just/RB as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ in/IN the/DT foodstuffs/NNS industry/NN ./.

The/DT negative/JJ consequences/NNS are/VBP well/RB known/JJ ,/, the/DT positive/JJ ones/NNS less/RBR so/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP firmly/RB convinced/JJ that/IN the/DT most/RBS sensible/JJ way/NN of/IN protecting/VBG the/DT health/NN of/IN European/JJ citizens/NNS in/IN the/DT ecological/JJ chain/NN is/VBZ through/IN the/DT production/NN of/IN feedingstuffs/NNS in/IN the/DT region/NN for/IN the/DT region/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, more/JJR work/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN on/IN this/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP commence/JJ by/IN congratulating/VBG the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP ,/, on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

It/PRP reflects/VBZ the/DT views/NNS and/CC concerns/NNS of/IN all/DT EU/NNP citizens/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN food/NN safety/NN and/CC quality/NN ./.

The/DT events/NNS of/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS have/VBP certainly/RB created/VBN an/DT awareness/NN and/CC concern/NN about/IN the/DT real/JJ threat/NN to/TO food/NN safety/NN and/CC public/JJ health/NN ./.

The/DT swift/JJ action/NN taken/VBN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP must/MD be/VB seen/VBN by/IN all/DT citizens/NNS as/IN their/PRP$ greatest/JJS guarantee/NN for/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, for/IN you/PRP have/VBP set/VBN an/DT agenda/NN on/IN food/NN quality/NN to/TO which/WDT Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD conform/VB ./.

But/CC even/RB in/IN this/DT crucial/JJ area/NN of/IN administration/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP reflects/VBZ its/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO subsidiarity/VB by/IN encouraging/VBG Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO take/VB on/RP and/CC to/TO face/VB up/RP to/TO their/PRP$ responsibility/NN ./.

In/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ,/, we/PRP have/VBP in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN prioritised/JJ policies/NNS that/WDT are/VBP of/IN direct/JJ concern/NN to/TO citizens/NNS :/: food/NN safety/NN ,/, water/NN quality/NN ,/, environmental/JJ protection/NN and/CC rural/JJ development/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP pursue/VB this/DT agenda/NN with/IN commitment/NN and/CC diligence/NN ,/, the/DT early/JJ years/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ millennium/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT milestone/NN in/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN policies/NNS that/WDT are/VBP people-focused/JJ and/CC very/RB much/RB reflect/VB community/NN needs/NNS ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP in/IN particular/NN the/DT proposed/JJ new/JJ and/CC strict/JJ authorisation/NN procedures/NNS for/IN additives/NNS in/IN animal/NN feeds/VBZ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN his/PRP$ excellent/JJ work/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP particularly/RB pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT unanimity/NN shown/VBN on/IN this/DT issue/NN within/IN the/DT group/NN ./.

A/DT coherent/JJ legal/JJ framework/NN must/MD be/VB re-established/JJ ./.

As/IN of/IN October/NNP 1999/CD the/DT Commission/NNP proposed/VBD introducing/VBG a/DT legal/JJ basis/NN into/IN Directive/NNP 70/524/EEC/CD for/IN the/DT replacement/NN of/IN the/DT authorisations/NNS ./.

Genetically/JJ modified/VBN additives/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB clearly/RB identified/VBN in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO allow/VB the/DT end-consumer/NN to/TO choose/VB food/NN without/IN GMO/NNP components/NNS or/CC based/VBN on/IN GMO/NNP components/NNS and/CC to/TO guarantee/VB this/DT ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO determine/VB the/DT choice/NN of/IN legal/JJ basis/NN by/IN excluding/VBG any/DT reference/NN to/TO health/NN policy/NN and/CC we/PRP would/MD suddenly/RB find/VB ourselves/PRP up/RP against/IN an/DT Article/NNP 37/CD ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO comment/VB briefly/RB on/IN two/CD other/JJ points/NNS ./.

First/NNP ,/, genetically/RB modified/JJ micro-organisms/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB just/RB refer/VB to/TO vertical/JJ legislation/NN and/CC say/VB that/IN at/IN some/DT point/NN we/PRP will/MD need/VB another/DT law/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB another/DT law/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, and/CC until/IN we/PRP do/VBP ,/, we/PRP must/MD deal/VB with/IN genetically-modified/JJ micro-organisms/NNS as/IN and/CC when/WRB we/PRP pass/VBP legislation/NN ;/: we/PRP must/MD include/VB them/PRP as/IN an/DT add-on/JJ and/CC insist/VB that/IN they/PRP be/VB labelled/VBN ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ done/VBN just/RB that/WDT and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ sign/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ equally/RB important/JJ to/TO have/VB strict/JJ hygiene/NN requirements/NNS for/IN the/DT manufacture/NN of/IN additives/NNS and/CC for/IN proper/JJ controls/NNS to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

There/EX are/VBP serious/JJ shortcomings/NNS in/IN both/DT areas/NNS and/CC we/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN work/NN to/TO do/VB yet/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD no/DT doubt/NN be/VB reconsidering/VBG on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN occasions/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

What/WP has/VBZ happened/VBN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS has/VBZ brought/VBN to/TO our/PRP$ attention/NN the/DT tremendous/JJ problems/NNS facing/VBG not/RB only/JJ to/TO the/DT producers/NNS of/IN food/NN but/CC also/RB the/DT consumers/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD strike/VB a/DT balance/NN between/IN them/PRP ./.

We/PRP must/MD resolve/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN consumers/NNS should/MD regain/VB confidence/NN in/IN the/DT food/NN they/PRP eat/VBP ./.

One/CD way/NN to/TO achieve/VB this/DT is/VBZ to/TO have/VB total/JJ transparency/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN food/NN labelling/NNS is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

GMOs/NNS are/VBP the/DT new/JJ challenge/NN facing/VBG us/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/IN people/NNS are/VBP very/RB worried/VBN about/IN and/CC quite/RB rightly/RB so/RB :/: I/PRP myself/PRP share/VB these/DT concerns/NNS ./.

But/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP should/MD not/RB allow/VB our/PRP$ concerns/NNS about/IN GMOs/NNP to/TO overshadow/VB our/PRP$ concerns/NNS about/IN growth/NN promoters/NNS used/VBN in/IN animal/NN feed/NN or/CC antibiotics/NNS used/VBN in/IN compound/JJ feed/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB allow/VB GMOs/NNP to/TO obscure/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN meat/NN and/CC bonemeal/NN are/VBP still/RB included/VBN in/IN animal/NN feeds/VBZ in/IN many/JJ countries/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

One/CD factor/NN behind/IN these/DT developments/NNS that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN referred/VBN to/TO in/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ competition/NN -/: competition/NN between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS on/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT production/NN of/IN food/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP all/DT areas/NNS in/IN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP to/TO ensure/VB a/DT level/NN playing/NN field/NN :/: food/NN must/MD be/VB of/IN the/DT same/JJ standard/NN in/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT dioxin/NN scare/NN ,/, BSE/NNP and/CC many/JJ other/JJ problems/NNS ./.

The/DT main/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ a/DT financial/JJ one/NN ,/, namely/RB who/WP bears/VBZ the/DT cost/NN ?/.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT cost/NN is/VBZ not/RB shared/VBN equally/RB between/IN the/DT consumer/NN and/CC the/DT producer/NN :/: the/DT producer/NN has/VBZ been/VBN forced/VBN to/TO bear/VB all/PDT the/DT cost/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP an/DT equitable/JJ distribution/NN of/IN the/DT extra/JJ cost/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN incurred/VBN ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB ensure/VB that/IN the/DT food/NN that/WDT is/VBZ imported/VBN into/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP meets/VBZ the/DT standards/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB maintain/VB those/DT standards/NNS for/IN imported/VBN food/NN then/RB we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO encounter/VB greater/JJR difficulties/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./. ./.

I/PRP should/MD first/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP and/CC Rural/NNP Development/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ,/, the/DT committee/NN chairman/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP ,/, for/IN examining/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS proposal/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN is/VBZ ,/, as/IN some/DT of/IN you/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, rather/RB technical/JJ ./.

Nonetheless/RB it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT relatively/RB simple/JJ objective/NN :/: to/TO harmonise/VB procedures/NNS governing/VBG the/DT authorisation/NN of/IN feed/NN additives/NNS ./.

At/IN present/JJ there/EX is/VBZ a/DT difference/NN in/IN treatment/NN between/IN authorisations/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/IN whether/IN applications/NNS were/VBD submitted/VBN before/IN or/CC after/IN 1/CD January/NNP 1988/CD ./.

The/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS proposal/NN is/VBZ to/TO harmonise/VB procedures/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN no/DT such/JJ difference/NN exists/VBZ ./.

The/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN amendment/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB very/RB limited/JJ ./.

Five/CD amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP regret/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO accept/VB these/DT amendments/NNS ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP fully/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT views/NNS and/CC commitment/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Agricultural/NNP Committee/NNP and/CC ,/, in/IN particular/NN ,/, the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP ,/, on/IN these/DT issues/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD deal/VB with/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT individual/JJ amendments/NNS separately/RB ./.

The/DT first/JJ amendment/NN proposes/VBZ to/TO change/VB the/DT legal/JJ base/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN by/IN replacing/VBG Article/NNP 37/CD with/IN Article/NNP 152/CD ./.

I/PRP would/MD simply/RB point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN makes/VBZ no/DT reference/NN to/TO health/NN or/CC consumer/NN protection/NN ./.

The/DT proposed/VBN amendment/NN is/VBZ technical/JJ and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB interpreted/VBN as/IN having/VBG as/RB its/PRP$ primary/JJ objective/NN the/DT protection/NN of/IN public/JJ health/NN ./.

I/PRP note/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP also/RB accepts/VBZ that/IN Article/NNP 37/CD is/VBZ the/DT appropriate/JJ legal/JJ base/NN ./.

I/PRP remind/VB Parliament/NNP that/IN in/IN Article/NNP 152/CD the/DT primary/JJ objective/NN is/VBZ the/DT protection/NN of/IN health/NN ./.

I/PRP commend/VB to/TO you/PRP the/DT arguments/NNS set/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT letter/NN from/IN the/DT Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS Committee/NNP which/WDT sets/VBZ out/RP the/DT position/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, with/IN precision/NN ,/, clarity/JJ and/CC commendable/JJ brevity/NN ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 2/CD and/CC 3/CD go/VBP much/RB further/RBR than/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN since/IN they/PRP aim/VBP to/TO introduce/VB additional/JJ provisions/NNS on/IN genetically/RB modified/JJ additives/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO accept/VB that/IN GMOs/NNP are/VBP a/DT very/RB important/JJ issue/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB accept/VBP and/CC acknowledge/VBP that/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN initiatives/NNS to/TO update/VB EU/JJ legislation/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN GMOs/NNP are/VBP necessary/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT technical/JJ amendment/NN is/VBZ not/RB the/DT correct/JJ instrument/NN to/TO introduce/VB such/JJ initiatives/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ of/IN the/DT view/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ premature/JJ to/TO amend/VB the/DT rules/NNS currently/RB laid/VBN down/RP by/IN Directive/NNP 70/524/CD on/IN genetically/RB modified/JJ additives/NNS at/IN this/DT stage/NN ./.

Instead/RB it/PRP is/VBZ appropriate/JJ to/TO await/VB developments/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT common/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT amendment/NN to/TO Directive/NNP 90/220/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB in/IN second/JJ reading/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP envisages/NNS going/VBG much/RB further/RBR than/IN is/VBZ currently/RB proposed/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN its/PRP$ amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD also/RB assure/VB Parliament/NNP that/IN I/PRP will/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT pertinent/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN Directive/NNP 90/220/CD are/VBP included/VBN in/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT recasting/NN of/IN Directive/NNP 70/524/CD that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN to/TO present/VB to/TO Parliament/NNP before/IN July/NNP 2001/CD ./.

I/PRP can/MD also/RB assure/VB Parliament/NNP that/IN all/DT observations/NNS made/VBN here/RB today/NN will/MD be/VB fully/RB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 4/CD and/CC 5/CD are/VBP also/RB unacceptable/JJ because/IN they/PRP give/VBP undue/JJ preference/NN to/TO copy/VB products/NNS by/IN granting/VBG them/PRP authorisation/NN to/TO be/VB placed/VBN into/IN circulation/NN even/RB before/IN an/DT application/NN for/IN authorisation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN submitted/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP insists/VBZ on/IN first/RB evaluating/VBG such/JJ applications/NNS as/IN to/TO their/PRP$ safety/NN and/CC efficacy/NN before/IN giving/VBG authorisations/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB ask/VB you/PRP again/RB to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN the/DT technical/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN and/CC to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT substantive/JJ proposal/NN for/IN a/DT new/JJ directive/NN on/IN additives/NNS in/IN feedingstuffs/NNS to/TO address/VB wider/JJR issues/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO deal/VB with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT specific/JJ issues/NNS that/WDT were/VBD raised/VBN during/IN the/DT debate/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, regarding/VBG the/DT observations/NNS made/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO assure/VB him/PRP that/IN we/PRP will/MD change/VB the/DT procedure/NN for/IN authorisation/NN of/IN GMO/NNP additives/NNS in/IN the/DT Additives/NNP Directive/NNP 70/524/CD ,/, and/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT Novel/NNP Feed/NNP Directive/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT directive/NN that/WDT deals/VBZ more/RBR specifically/RB with/IN raw/JJ materials/NNS rather/RB than/IN with/IN additives/NNS ./.

The/DT text/NN taken/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ from/IN the/DT Directive/NN which/WDT was/VBD adopted/VBN in/IN 1998/CD ./.

But/CC the/DT vertical/JJ legislation/NN in/IN Directive/NNP 90/220/CD on/IN how/WRB to/TO carry/VB out/RP the/DT environmental/JJ risk/NN assessment/NN of/IN GMOs/NNP has/VBZ changed/VBN since/IN then/RB and/CC is/VBZ still/RB changing/VBG ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ before/IN Parliament/NNP for/IN second/JJ reading/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ belief/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD await/VB the/DT final/JJ outcome/NN of/IN Directive/NNP 90/220/CD and/CC in/IN particular/JJ ,/, Article/NNP 11/CD ./.

Reference/NNP was/VBD also/RB made/VBN to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN whether/IN this/DT proposal/NN could/MD give/VB rise/NN to/TO the/DT risk/NN of/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN monopolies/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Kindermann/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Auroi/NNP made/VBD reference/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

There/EX are/VBP just/RB a/DT few/JJ points/NNS I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB on/IN that/DT issue/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, this/DT matter/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN the/DT pipeline/NN since/IN 1993/CD ,/, so/IN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB really/RB been/VBN sprung/VBN on/IN any/DT other/JJ commodity/NN producers/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB any/DT such/JJ applicants/NNS can/MD still/RB apply/VB in/IN respect/NN of/IN their/PRP$ particular/JJ product/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB stress/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ never/RB approved/VBN any/DT application/NN for/IN an/DT authorisation/NN for/IN GMOs/NNP to/TO be/VB included/VBN in/IN additives/NNS ./.

Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP made/VBD reference/NN to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT appropriate/JJ legal/JJ base/NN ,/, whether/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB Article/NNP 37/CD or/CC Article/NNP 152/CD ./.

I/PRP again/RB refer/VB to/TO what/WP I/PRP said/VBD earlier/RBR in/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT and/CC assure/VB her/PRP$ and/CC the/DT House/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB entirely/RB inappropriate/JJ for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO seek/VB to/TO justify/VB any/DT measure/NN based/VBN on/IN Article/NNP 37/CD merely/RB by/IN excluding/VBG from/IN the/DT provision/NN any/DT reference/NN to/TO public/JJ health/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN looked/VBN at/IN on/IN at/IN least/JJS two/CD separate/JJ occasions/NNS by/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ laid/VBN down/RP the/DT legal/JJ criteria/NNS for/IN situations/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT where/WRB the/DT appropriate/JJ legal/JJ base/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB properly/RB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN when/WRB putting/VBG forward/RP legislation/NN ./.

The/DT jurisprudence/NN of/IN the/DT Court/NNP appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB quite/RB clear/JJ in/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN you/PRP made/VBD reference/NN -/: Mr/NNP Nicholson/NNP in/IN particular/NN -/: to/TO the/DT issue/NN surrounding/VBG labelling/VBG ./.

Directive/NNP 70/524/CD foresees/VBZ the/DT issue/NN of/IN labelling/VBG in/IN the/DT genetic/JJ modification/NN of/IN additives/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ already/RB included/JJ now/RB :/: ``/`` indication/NN of/IN the/DT particular/JJ characteristics/NNS due/JJ to/TO the/DT manufacturing/VBG products/NNS ''/'' ./.

So/IN this/DT issue/NN will/MD be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

That/DT formula/NN enabled/VBD us/PRP to/TO oblige/VB applicants/NNS to/TO put/VB on/IN the/DT label/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN genetic/JJ modification/NN techniques/NNS have/VBP been/VBN used/VBN in/IN the/DT product/NN ,/, the/DT subject/NN matter/NN of/IN the/DT application/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, allow/VB me/PRP to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP one/CD more/JJR question/NN ./.

First/NNP allow/VBP me/PRP to/TO point/VB out/RP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Byrne/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ no/DT right/NN of/IN legislative/JJ initiative/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP do/VBP reserve/JJ the/DT right/NN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP propose/VBP to/TO amend/VB a/DT directive/NN or/CC a/DT regulation/NN ,/, to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT whole/JJ regulation/NN and/CC not/RB just/RB the/DT part/NN which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP singled/VBN out/RP ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP confined/VBN ourselves/PRP in/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN amendments/NNS to/TO bringing/VBG the/DT text/NN into/IN line/NN with/IN that/DT of/IN other/JJ directives/NNS and/CC we/PRP have/VBP disregarded/VBD the/DT question/NN of/IN content/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, you/PRP did/VBD not/RB go/VB into/IN antibiotics/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB talking/VBG about/IN harmonising/VBG the/DT legal/JJ provisions/NNS in/IN the/DT individual/JJ directives/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP Byrne/NNP is/VBZ this/DT :/: the/DT UN/NNP conference/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP decided/VBD that/IN genetically-modified/JJ organisms/NNS must/MD be/VB labelled/VBN for/IN international/JJ trade/NN ./.

Do/VBP you/PRP really/RB believe/VB that/IN ,/, if/IN we/PRP could/MD ,/, Parliament/NNP would/MD permit/VB labelling/VBG to/TO be/VB left/VBN off/RP feedingstuff/NN additives/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ?/.

Commissioner/NNP Byrne/NNP ,/, it/PRP appears/VBZ that/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO engage/VB in/IN a/DT test/NN of/IN strength/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

We/PRP negotiated/VBD the/DT seed/NN marketing/NN legislation/NN for/IN two/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT next/JJ round/NN ./. ./.

I/PRP would/MD stress/VB that/IN no/DT GMOs/NNPS have/VBP been/VBN approved/VBN under/IN this/DT directive/NN ;/: it/PRP applies/VBZ only/RB to/TO additives/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB say/VB in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT questions/NNS surrounding/VBG labelling/VBG that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT complex/JJ issue/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ being/VBG addressed/VBN and/CC will/MD be/VB addressed/VBN in/IN a/DT comprehensive/JJ way/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN Directive/NNP 90/220/CD ./.

This/DT issue/NN is/VBZ before/IN Parliament/NNP at/IN the/DT moment/NN and/CC there/EX will/MD be/VB other/JJ directives/NNS dealing/VBG it/PRP ,/, which/WDT will/MD also/RB come/VB under/IN the/DT legal/JJ base/NN of/IN Article/NNP 152/CD which/WDT gives/VBZ Parliament/NNP full/JJ competence/NN in/IN the/DT areas/NNS of/IN codecision/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD assure/VB Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ by/IN no/DT means/NN my/PRP$ intention/NN or/CC wish/VB to/TO have/VB any/DT clash/NN or/CC test/NN of/IN strength/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ intention/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN ,/, to/TO work/VB in/IN cooperation/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT results/NNS we/PRP achieve/VBP are/VBP the/DT very/RB best/JJS results/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ best/JJS to/TO wait/VB for/IN that/DT debate/NN which/WDT ,/, I/PRP understand/VBP ,/, will/MD take/VB place/NN fairly/RB soon/RB ./.

All/DT of/IN these/DT matters/NNS will/MD be/VB addressed/VBN in/IN that/DT legislation/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ taken/VBN due/JJ note/NN of/IN your/PRP$ comments/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB correct/JJ that/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN is/VBZ technically/RB impracticable/JJ -/: it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB feasible/JJ in/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN the/DT computer/NN ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN tax/NN havens/NNS are/VBP frequently/RB nothing/NN but/CC hard/JJ disk/NN storage/NN space/NN for/IN large/JJ European/JJ banks/NNS here/RB at/IN home/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB ignored/VBN ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, we/PRP must/MD not/RB allow/VB real/JJ capital/NN and/CC speculative/JJ capital/NN to/TO become/VB so/RB remote/JJ from/IN each/DT other/JJ ,/, because/IN otherwise/RB we/PRP shall/MD be/VB steering/VBG towards/IN situations/NNS which/WDT we/PRP experienced/VBN on/IN this/DT continent/NN time/NN and/CC again/RB during/IN the/DT last/JJ century/NN and/CC which/WDT had/VBD catastrophic/JJ results/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VB us/PRP indeed/RB tax/VB money/NN speculation/NN :/: it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB produce/VB anything/NN new/JJ ./.

The/DT tax/NN would/MD be/VB targeted/VBN at/IN the/DT right/JJ place/NN :/: at/IN the/DT speculators/NNS ./.

Who/WP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO defend/VB these/DT speculators/NNS ,/, when/WRB nurses/NNS and/CC teachers/NNS are/VBP paying/VBG top/JJ rates/NNS of/IN tax/NN ?/.

Article/NNP 73/CD c/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP establishing/VBG the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP provides/VBZ scope/NN for/IN taxation/NN on/IN transactions/NNS ./.

Those/DT who/WP oppose/VBP taxation/NN on/IN currency/NN dealing/NN are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN those/DT tax-recycling/JJ centres/NNS ,/, the/DT tax/NN havens/NNS ,/, of/IN which/WDT there/EX are/VBP 62/CD in/IN all/DT ./.

The/DT Union/NNP should/MD make/VB a/DT tax/NN pact/NN ,/, which/WDT any/DT countries/NNS could/MD initially/RB be/VB party/NN to/TO ./.

The/DT low/JJ rate/NN Tobin/NN tax/NN would/MD not/RB cause/VB tax-recycling/JJ problems/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ strange/JJ to/TO claim/VB that/IN if/IN everyone/NN is/VBZ not/RB included/VBN it/PRP would/MD be/VB impossible/JJ to/TO bring/VB into/IN effect/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP was/VBD founded/VBN through/IN the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ countries/NNS ,/, and/CC you/PRP see/VBP how/WRB we/PRP are/VBP today/NN ./.

The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ the/DT greatest/JJS problem/NN is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ one/NN :/: they/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO tax/NN capital/NN ,/, but/CC raise/VB personal/JJ taxation/NN instead/RB ./.

In/IN the/DT end/NN tax/NN would/MD politicise/VB the/DT global/JJ ,/, undemocratic/JJ system/NN of/IN financial/JJ power/NN ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, we/PRP must/MD challenge/VB the/DT monopoly/NN the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ speculative/JJ elite/NN have/VBP on/IN planning/VBG the/DT world/NN '/POS s/JJ economy/NN by/IN remaining/VBG outside/IN the/DT tax/NN system/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP begin/VB by/IN extending/VBG a/DT heartfelt/JJ thanks/NNS to/TO all/DT speakers/NNS and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT of/IN course/NN ,/, Mr/NNP D脙/NNP 漏/NNP sir/VB ,/, for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG place/NN this/DT evening/NN ./.

Whatever/WDT one/PRP may/MD think/VB about/IN the/DT topic/NN of/IN debate/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ evident/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ one/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN around/RB for/IN years/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ satisfying/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG afforded/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN this/DT evening/NN to/TO give/VB a/DT response/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN underlining/VBG two/CD remarks/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP of/IN your/PRP$ Parliament/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Gas脙/NNP 虏/NNP liba/NN ./.

He/PRP said/VBD that/IN globalisation/NN is/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ phenomenon/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP share/VBP his/PRP$ view/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, as/IN indeed/RB already/RB remarked/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Gas脙/NNP 虏/NNP liba/NNP ,/, globalisation/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, positive/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ contributed/VBN to/TO a/DT new/JJ international/JJ distribution/NN of/IN labour/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN pursued/VBN by/IN many/JJ people/NNS for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ./.

A/DT second/JJ remark/NN made/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Gas脙/NNP 虏/NNP liba/NNP was/VBD that/IN there/EX is/VBZ currently/RB no/DT evidence/NN that/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN will/MD stabilise/VB the/DT exchange/NN rates/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ correct/JJ in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

I/PRP too/RB am/VBP not/RB aware/JJ of/IN any/DT reason/NN why/WRB a/DT tax/NN on/IN exchange/NN rate/NN transactions/NNS would/MD lead/VB to/TO a/DT stabilisation/NN of/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN these/DT are/VBP two/CD important/JJ remarks/NNS ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP am/VBP reiterating/VBG them/PRP here/RB ./.

Madam/VB President/NNP ,/, could/MD I/PRP furthermore/RB point/VB out/RP that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT speakers/NNS this/DT evening/NN has/VBZ drawn/VBN a/DT link/NN between/IN the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN and/CC the/DT functioning/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP on/IN the/DT other/JJ ?/.

Surely/RB we/PRP are/VBP all/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP and/CC know/VBP that/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT four/CD freedoms/NNS is/VBZ the/DT freedom/NN of/IN capital/NN movement/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD assure/VB your/PRP$ Parliament/NNP that/IN my/PRP$ day-to-day/JJ work/NN consists/VBZ partly/RB of/IN attempting/VBG ,/, in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN my/PRP$ offices/NNS and/CC colleagues/NNS ,/, to/TO completely/RB integrate/VB the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS within/IN Europe/NNP ,/, thus/RB enabling/VBG financial/JJ transactions/NNS to/TO run/VB as/RB easily/RB and/CC smoothly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ capacity/NN as/IN Commissioner/NNP for/IN the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, opposed/VBN to/TO all/DT measures/NNS which/WDT hamper/VB international/JJ financial/JJ transactions/NNS ./.

You/PRP could/MD hardly/RB expect/VB this/DT Commissioner/NNP to/TO agree/VB with/IN a/DT tax/NN which/WDT would/MD ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, impede/VB international/JJ economic/JJ movement/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, at/IN odds/NNS with/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ ,/, theoretical/JJ objection/NN which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN considered/VBN by/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT speakers/NNS this/DT evening/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, apart/RB from/IN these/DT -/: to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN -/: quite/RB fundamental/JJ observations/NNS ,/, there/RB are/VBP also/RB practical/JJ objections/NNS to/TO the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ,/, as/IN already/RB underlined/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Karas/NNP and/CC other/JJ speakers/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ unfortunately/RB been/VBN observed/VBN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ failed/VBN to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN internally/RB on/IN specific/JJ tax/NN measures/NNS ./.

This/DT indicates/VBZ how/WRB difficult/JJ these/DT dossiers/NNS are/VBP ./.

If/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN internally/RB ,/, I/PRP wonder/VBP whether/IN we/PRP will/MD then/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO convince/VB the/DT other/JJ trade/NN partners/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB problematic/JJ ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP has/VBZ stated/VBN that/IN this/DT could/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT measures/NNS for/IN stabilising/VBG the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO remove/VB these/DT causes/NNS ,/, one/PRP has/VBZ to/TO look/VB at/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN the/DT countries/NNS in/IN question/NN ./.

Is/VBZ it/PRP the/DT case/NN that/IN these/DT countries/NNS can/MD boast/VB of/IN what/WP is/VBZ termed/VBN in/IN English/NNP `/`` good/JJ governance/NN '/'' ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP the/DT case/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ low/JJ inflation/NN and/CC that/IN there/EX are/VBP low/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ?/.

That/DT the/DT markets/NNS for/IN production/NN factors/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT labour/NN market/NN ,/, operate/VBP flexibly/RB ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB always/RB the/DT case/NN ./.

So/IN if/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO look/VB into/IN what/WP causes/VBZ exchange/NN rate/NN instability/NN ,/, then/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT elements/NNS of/IN good/JJ governance/NN and/CC focus/VB on/IN these/DT first/JJ ./.

In/IN addition/NN -/: and/CC this/DT has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN already/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Gas脙/NNP 虏/NNP liba/NNP I/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP hm/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB by/IN others/NNS -/: there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN more/JJR supervision/NN ./.

More/JJR supervision/NN nationally/RB -/: supervision/NN by/IN national/JJ governments/NNS of/IN national/JJ banks/NNS -/: and/CC internationally/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT IMF/NNP ./.

So/IN I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO tackle/VB the/DT causes/NNS is/VBZ by/IN ensuring/VBG ,/, on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, that/IN good/JJ governance/NN is/VBZ observed/VBN in/IN the/DT countries/NNS in/IN question/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ more/JJR supervision/NN nationally/RB and/CC internationally/VBG in/IN order/NN to/TO avoid/VB these/DT lapses/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO various/JJ Members/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ Parliament/NNP ,/, more/JJR funding/NN should/MD still/RB be/VB made/VBN available/JJ for/IN major/JJ projects/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Kreissl-D脙/NNP 露/NNP rfler/NNP spoke/VBD in/IN English/NNP about/IN `/`` long-term/JJ capital/NN for/IN long-term/JJ projects/NNS '/'' -/: this/DT is/VBZ an/DT obvious/JJ issue/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO leave/VB it/PRP here/RB ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT resolution/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, of/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN a/DT draft/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD await/VB the/DT vote/NN and/CC will/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN this/DT ,/, determine/VB its/PRP$ stance/NN ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP you/PRP for/IN giving/VBG me/PRP the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO take/VB part/NN in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN four/CD motions/NNS for/IN a/DT resolution/NN ,/, tabled/VBN pursuant/JJ to/TO Rule/NNP 40/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 5/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, unfortunately/RB I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB your/PRP$ mastery/NN of/IN the/DT French/JJ language/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP would/MD be/VB obliged/VBN if/IN Mr/NNP Bolkestein/NNP would/MD just/RB listen/VB for/IN a/DT minute/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP he/PRP can/MD not/RB do/VB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN talking/VBG to/TO Mrs/NNP Randzio-Plath/NNP ./.

Could/MD you/PRP please/VB draw/VB his/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP something/NN to/TO say/VB to/TO him/PRP ?/.

Monsieur/NNP Bolkestein/NNP ,/, je/VB veux/NN vous/NNS dire/JJ quelque/NN chose/VBD !/. ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, my/PRP$ Dutch/JJ is/VBZ not/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN yours/NNP ./.

But/CC I/PRP would/MD rather/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB something/NN else/RB to/TO you/PRP ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ not/RB taking/VBG the/DT initiative/NN and/CC supporting/VBG a/DT Tobin/NNP type/NN tax/NN just/RB to/TO annoy/VB the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO examine/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN introducing/VBG a/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD be/VB just/RB one/CD of/IN several/JJ instruments/NNS and/CC hopefully/RB you/PRP will/MD be/VB on/IN our/PRP$ side/NN in/IN this/DT ./.

From/IN a/DT political/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, I/PRP always/RB fret/VBP when/WRB people/NNS say/VBP ,/, we/PRP neither/CC need/VB ,/, want/VB nor/CC can/MD we/PRP achieve/VB these/DT things/NNS !/. ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB your/PRP$ job/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ job/NN to/TO decide/VB on/IN that/DT ./.

It/PRP also/RB has/VBZ something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT newly/RB awoken/JJ self-consciousness/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO discuss/VB it/PRP with/IN you/PRP ,/, no/RB more/RBR and/CC no/RB less/RBR ./.

We/PRP can/MD do/VB so/RB without/IN going/VBG off/RP at/IN other/JJ tangents/NNS ./.

I/PRP respect/VB you/PRP as/IN a/DT serious/JJ Commissioner/NNP who/WP wants/VBZ to/TO take/VB his/PRP$ work/NN seriously/RB ./.

Please/VB respect/VB us/PRP as/IN Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP who/WP want/VBP to/TO take/VB our/PRP$ work/NN seriously/RB ,/, and/CC that/DT includes/VBZ the/DT Tobin/NNP tax/NN !/. ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, an/DT omission/NN appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB been/VBN made/VBN ./.

In/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN tabled/JJ motions/NNS for/IN a/DT resolution/NN which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP just/RB read/VBN out/RP ,/, no/DT mention/NN is/VBZ made/VBN of/IN the/DT compromise/NN motion/NN tabled/VBN jointly/RB by/IN the/DT PSE/NNP ,/, ELDR/NNP ,/, GUE/NGL/NNP and/CC Greens/EFA/NNP Groups/NNS and/CC by/IN Mrs/NNP Kuntz/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Co脙/NNP ''/'' teaux/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP simply/RB wanted/VBD to/TO pass/VB on/IN some/DT news/NN ./.

I/PRP note/VBP your/PRP$ comments/NNS with/IN particular/JJ keenness/NNS ,/, as/IN you/PRP may/MD expect/VB ,/, given/VBN that/IN I/PRP too/RB am/VBP Spanish/JJ ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, allow/VB me/PRP to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN tomorrow/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT second/JJ anniversary/NN of/IN the/DT Cermis/NNP tragedy/NN ./.

Two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, in/IN Cavalese/NNP in/IN Italy/NNP ,/, an/DT American/JJ aeroplane/NN from/IN the/DT Aviano/NNP NATO/NNP base/NN cut/VBD through/IN the/DT cables/NNS of/IN a/DT cable/NN car/NN during/IN a/DT low-flying/JJ exercise/NN which/WDT exceeded/VBD safe/JJ limits/NNS ,/, causing/VBG the/DT deaths/NNS of/IN more/JJR than/IN 20/CD Europeans/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN note/NN of/IN your/PRP$ comment/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT order/NN of/IN business/NN ./.

Is/VBZ there/EX anyone/NN who/WP wishes/VBZ to/TO speak/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN this/DT proposal/NN ?/.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP would/MD really/RB be/VB very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO imagine/VB a/DT debate/NN which/WDT is/VBZ more/JJR in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Rule/NNP 50/CD of/IN our/PRP$ Rules/NNS of/IN Procedure/NNP ./.

This/DT debate/NN is/VBZ topical/JJ ,/, exceptionally/RB important/JJ and/CC urgent/JJ ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB believe/VBP that/IN the/DT agenda/NN should/MD be/VB amended/VBN to/TO include/VB it/PRP ./.

Is/VBZ there/EX anyone/NN who/WP wishes/VBZ to/TO speak/VB against/IN this/DT proposal/NN ?/.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP shall/MD speak/VB against/IN this/DT proposal/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN a/DT principle/NN which/WDT I/PRP consider/VBP absolutely/RB vital/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO observance/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, and/CC with/IN particular/JJ regard/NN to/TO Article/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, until/IN now/RB we/PRP believed/VBD that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP was/VBD ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Rome/NNP and/CC the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Paris/NNP founding/VBG the/DT European/JJ Communities/NNS ,/, and/CC subsequently/RB the/DT Union/NNP ,/, an/DT association/NN of/IN free/JJ ,/, independent/JJ ,/, sovereign/JJ states/NNS ./.

Even/RB though/IN many/JJ developments/NNS cast/VBD doubt/NN on/IN this/DT ,/, we/PRP did/VBD believe/VB ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN everything/NN ,/, that/IN this/DT was/VBD the/DT case/NN and/CC ,/, more/RBR recently/RB ,/, reference/NN was/VBD made/VBN ,/, albeit/IN half-heartedly/CD ,/, to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP ratify/VBZ .../: Mr/NNP Gollnisch/NNP ,/, excuse/VB me/PRP ,/, you/PRP have/VBP one/CD minute/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN you/PRP always/RB take/VB particular/JJ care/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP are/VBP observed/JJ ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD I/PRP had/VBD three/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Do/VB forgive/VB me/PRP ./.

If/IN you/PRP ratify/VB this/DT development/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP are/VBP ratifying/VBG the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP into/IN a/DT body/NN which/WDT violates/VBZ the/DT sovereignty/NN and/CC the/DT freedom/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC we/PRP should/MD then/RB have/VB no/DT option/NN but/CC to/TO withdraw/VB from/IN such/PDT a/DT Union/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN one/CD speaker/NN in/IN favour/NN and/CC one/NN against/IN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD now/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, put/VB this/DT proposal/NN for/IN an/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT agenda/NN to/TO the/DT vote/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Parliament/NNP gave/VBD its/PRP$ assent/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

This/DT debate/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB added/VBN at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT order/NN of/IN business/NN ./.

TOPICAL/NNP AND/CC URGENT/NNP DEBATE/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT debate/NN on/IN topical/JJ and/CC urgent/JJ subjects/NNS of/IN major/JJ importance/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT talks/NNS in/IN Austria/NNP on/IN forming/VBG a/DT government/NN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD immediately/RB give/VB the/DT floor/NN to/TO Mr/NNP Seixas/NNPS da/NNP Costa/NNP ,/, President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Party/NNP of/IN European/JJ Socialists/NNS hopes/VBZ that/IN this/DT debate/NN will/MD send/VB three/CD messages/NNS to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN ./.

Let/VB it/PRP be/VB noted/VBN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP completely/RB united/VBN on/IN all/DT three/CD counts/NNS ./.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, these/DT common/JJ values/NNS are/VBP in/IN complete/JJ opposition/NN to/TO those/DT held/VBN by/IN the/DT party/NN ironically/RB known/VBN as/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Freedom/NNP Party/NNP ./.

I/PRP will/MD say/VB one/CD thing/NN ./.

For/IN many/JJ years/NNS I/PRP was/VBD a/DT traitor/NN to/TO my/PRP$ country/NN ;/: at/IN least/JJS that/WDT was/VBD General/NNP Franco/NNP '/POS s/JJ view/NN ./.

President/NNP Guterres/NNP was/VBD also/RB a/DT traitor/NN in/IN Salazar/NNP '/POS s/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/IN I/PRP believe/VBP should/MD also/RB be/VB stated/VBN and/CC defended/VBN by/IN the/DT PPE-DE/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, or/CC President/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, has/VBZ acted/VBN as/IN a/DT guardian/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD remind/VB him/PRP that/IN ,/, during/IN his/PRP$ inaugural/JJ debate/NN ,/, he/PRP described/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP as/IN a/DT European/JJ government/NN ./.

A/DT government/NN must/MD have/VB more/JJR nerve/NN and/CC more/JJR courage/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP am/VBP asking/VBG President/NNP Prodi/NNP for/IN at/IN this/DT moment/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO send/VB a/DT very/RB clear/JJ message/NN to/TO the/DT Austrian/JJ people/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT appeal/NN to/TO the/DT majority/NN of/IN Austrians/NNP who/WP have/VBP not/RB voted/VBN for/IN Haider/NNP ,/, who/WP have/VBP voted/VBN for/IN the/DT clearly/RB democratic/JJ options/NNS ,/, committed/VBN to/TO Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP must/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN Mr/NNP Sch脙艗ssel/NNP may/MD have/VB been/VBN Minister/NNP for/IN Finance/NNP ,/, but/CC Chancellor/NNP Vranitzky/NNP also/RB contributed/VBD to/TO Austria/NNP '/POS s/JJ integration/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB so/RB politically/RB partisan/JJ ./.

The/DT accession/NN of/IN Austria/NNP to/TO the/DT Community/NNP was/VBD a/DT joint/JJ venture/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT took/VBD part/NN in/IN it/PRP ,/, not/RB just/RB one/CD group/NN ./.

We/PRP support/VBP the/DT Council/NN and/CC we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ right/NN and/CC our/PRP$ obligation/NN to/TO appeal/VB to/TO the/DT Austrian/JJ people/NNS to/TO seriously/RB reconsider/VB this/DT completely/RB crazy/JJ option/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Applause/NN from/IN the/DT PSE/VBZ Group/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN debating/VBG the/DT need/NN to/TO reinforce/VB the/DT founding/JJ principles/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD uphold/VB them/PRP together/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP astonished/VBN by/IN the/DT political/JJ naivety/NN of/IN people/NNS who/WP ,/, with/IN thoughtless/JJ words/NNS ,/, have/VBP bolstered/VBN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN in/IN Austria/NNP and/CC made/VBD the/DT Union/NNP look/VBP ridiculous/JJ ,/, riding/VBG roughshod/NN over/IN Article/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP by/IN announcing/VBG unconstitutional/JJ measures/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP never/RB before/RB seen/VBN such/JJ serious/JJ ,/, clumsy/JJ interference/NN in/IN the/DT internal/JJ affairs/NNS of/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB violate/VB the/DT founding/VBG values/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, the/DT Italian/JJ Prime/NNP Minister/NNP stated/VBD that/IN these/DT principles/NNS are/VBP included/VBN in/IN a/DT treaty/NN :/: he/PRP mentioned/VBD the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Copenhagen/NNP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP ,/, like/IN you/PRP ,/, have/VBP never/RB heard/VBN of/IN because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB exist/VB ./.

Maybe/RB he/PRP was/VBD referring/VBG to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, Article/NNP 6/CD of/IN which/WDT lists/VBZ certain/JJ principles/NNS and/CC Article/NNP 7/CD certain/JJ procedures/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO establish/VB that/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP is/VBZ seriously/RB and/CC continuously/RB violating/VBG the/DT principles/NNS referred/VBD to/TO in/IN Article/NNP 6/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, up/RB till/IN now/RB ,/, Austria/NNP has/VBZ committed/VBN no/DT serious/JJ or/CC persistent/JJ violation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN the/DT aim/NN of/IN stepping/VBG up/RP networking/NN between/IN eligible/JJ zones/NNS under/IN LEADER/NNP is/VBZ very/RB welcome/JJ ./.

Agriculture/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT cornerstones/NNS of/IN the/DT rural/JJ environment/NN and/CC it/PRP must/MD be/VB possible/JJ for/IN it/PRP to/TO have/VB a/DT part/NN in/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ initiative/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ,/, through/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ initiative/NN ,/, structural/JJ change/NN in/IN agriculture/NN can/MD be/VB supported/VBN by/IN creating/VBG new/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

Attention/VB must/MD be/VB paid/VBN in/IN the/DT LEADER/NNP +/NNP programme/NN to/TO all/PDT the/DT sectors/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ;/: only/RB a/DT combined/JJ effort/NN will/MD reap/VB an/DT optimal/JJ result/NN ./.

LEADER/NNP must/MD now/RB move/VB into/IN the/DT implementation/NN phase/NN ./.

The/DT operational/JJ programmes/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB approved/VBN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, which/WDT implies/VBZ practical/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ administration/NN of/IN applications/NNS and/CC completion/NN of/IN the/DT application/NN approval/NN process/NN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Five/CD months/NNS are/VBP provided/VBN for/IN this/DT ./.

That/DT seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO be/VB rather/RB too/RB long/JJ ./.

Efforts/NNS should/MD be/VB made/VBN here/RB to/TO achieve/VB shorter/JJR times/NNS ./.

Because/IN anyone/NN who/WP develops/VBZ a/DT project/NN and/CC has/VBZ it/PRP ready/JJ will/MD also/RB want/VB to/TO start/VB implementing/VBG it/PRP as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Despite/IN all/PDT the/DT delight/NN over/IN the/DT reworking/NN of/IN this/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN LEADER/NN +/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP still/RB have/VB one/CD further/JJ concern/NN ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ proposal/NN the/DT Commission/NNP called/VBD for/IN an/DT observatory/NN for/IN the/DT LEADER/NNP +/NNP programme/NN without/IN going/VBG into/IN detail/NN on/IN how/WRB this/DT proposal/NN would/MD be/VB implemented/VBN ./.

For/IN me/PRP this/DT raises/VBZ the/DT following/VBG questions/NNS :/: who/WP will/MD work/VB there/RB ?/.

How/WRB will/MD these/DT people/NNS be/VB selected/VBN ?/.

Where/WRB ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, will/MD the/DT required/JJ money/NN come/VB from/IN ,/, and/CC where/WRB should/MD this/DT observatory/RB be/VB located/VBN ?/.

I/PRP do/VBP think/VBP ,/, though/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT LEADER/NNP +/NNP programme/NN has/VBZ not/RB got/VBN a/DT penny/NN to/TO spare/VB on/IN additional/JJ administrative/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN the/DT normal/JJ course/NN of/IN events/NNS would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN any/DT case/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, experience/NN from/IN other/JJ fields/NNS where/WRB observatories/NNS have/VBP been/VBN set/VBN up/RP shows/VBZ that/IN ,/, apart/RB from/IN rather/RB dubiously/RB creating/VBG jobs/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP not/RB of/IN any/DT great/JJ benefit/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB call/VB on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO fulfil/VB its/PRP$ monitoring/NN duties/NNS directly/RB itself/PRP and/CC to/TO do/VB all/DT it/PRP can/MD to/TO ensure/VB that/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP programmes/NNS run/VBP smoothly/RB ./.

Assessment/NNP and/CC publication/NN are/VBP part/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ of/IN course/NN assumed/VBN responsibility/NN for/IN these/DT in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT borders/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP divided/VBN Europe/NNP for/IN centuries/NNS ,/, were/VBD artificially/RB created/VBN ,/, separating/VBG single/JJ geographic/JJ spaces/NNS and/CC creating/VBG serious/JJ disparities/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN balanced/JJ development/NN and/CC cohesion/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ internal/JJ borders/NNS ,/, or/CC what/WDT remains/VBZ of/IN them/PRP ,/, no/RB longer/RB cause/VBP wars/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP do/VBP continue/VB to/TO generate/VB economic/JJ backwardness/NNS ,/, social/JJ barriers/NNS and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN cultural/JJ communication/NN between/IN the/DT peoples/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS are/VBP obliged/JJ to/TO work/VB towards/IN overcoming/VBG these/DT border/NN scars/NNS ,/, which/WDT contradict/VB the/DT spirit/NN of/IN European/JJ unity/NN ./.

The/DT economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN which/WDT we/PRP propose/VBP is/VBZ based/VBN ,/, by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN ,/, on/IN territorial/JJ cohesion/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT integration/NN of/IN border/NN areas/NNS and/CC the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ continent/NN ./.

INTERREG/NNP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN a/DT genuine/JJ Community/NNP policy/NN for/IN regional/JJ planning/NN and/CC a/DT truly/RB polycentric/JJ notion/NN of/IN our/PRP$ European/JJ territory/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP supports/VBZ this/DT initiative/NN ,/, our/PRP$ only/JJ regret/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO approve/VB a/DT resolution/NN on/IN it/PRP before/IN we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN any/DT evaluation/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP II/NNP ./.

The/DT people/NNS who/WP have/VBP participated/VBN in/IN this/DT initiative/NN have/VBP learnt/VBN the/DT importance/NN of/IN learning/VBG together/RB ,/, of/IN innovation/NN ,/, of/IN sharing/VBG projects/NNS and/CC good/JJ practices/NNS and/CC of/IN understanding/VBG and/CC tolerating/VBG each/DT other/JJ ./.

There/EX are/VBP many/JJ interesting/JJ questions/NNS relating/VBG to/TO it/PRP ,/, the/DT monitoring/NN centre/NN ,/, the/DT principle/NN of/IN concentration/FW etc./FW ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN the/DT management/NN bodies/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD create/VB joint/NN ,/, interregional/NN and/CC transnational/JJ management/NN bodies/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT all/DT local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ operators/NNS ,/, play/VBP an/DT active/JJ role/NN ./.

There/EX must/MD not/RB be/VB any/DT repetition/NN of/IN cases/NNS of/IN parallel/JJ projects/NNS on/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN a/DT border/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD create/VB a/DT cross-border/JJ culture/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO this/DT end/NN we/PRP must/MD be/VB innovative/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO administrative/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, imaginatively/RB overcoming/VBG existing/VBG barriers/NNS and/CC overcoming/VBG the/DT difficulties/NNS posed/VBN by/IN the/DT differing/VBG levels/NNS of/IN competence/NN in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, in/IN each/DT region/NN and/CC each/DT municipality/NN ./.

A/DT project/NN must/MD never/RB fail/VB to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN difficulties/NNS in/IN communication/NN ./.

During/IN debates/NNS in/IN committee/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP also/RB pointed/VBN out/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS involved/VBN in/IN coordinating/VBG INTERREG/VBG with/IN other/JJ annual/JJ or/CC biannual/JJ financial/JJ instruments/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN MEDA/NNP ,/, TACIS/NNP or/CC PHARE/NNP ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN has/VBZ been/VBN very/RB attentive/JJ to/TO these/DT difficulties/NNS ,/, making/VBG proposals/NNS capable/JJ of/IN solving/VBG them/PRP to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC setting/VBG reasonable/JJ deadlines/NNS for/IN making/VBG the/DT necessary/JJ changes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ reason/NN for/IN wanting/VBG to/TO contribute/VB to/TO this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ because/IN the/DT URBAN/NNP initiative/NN ,/, in/IN Ireland/NNP in/IN particular/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN quite/RB successful/JJ and/CC I/PRP am/VBP keen/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP make/VBP a/DT further/JJ contribution/NN in/IN that/DT area/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT sad/JJ fact/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ hundreds/NNS ,/, if/IN not/RB thousands/NNS ,/, of/IN communities/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP suffering/VBG very/RB severe/JJ poverty/NN and/CC disadvantage/NN ./.

Even/RB in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC cities/NNS that/WDT are/VBP extremely/RB wealthy/JJ we/PRP have/VBP large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN people/NNS living/VBG in/IN ghettos/NNS ,/, in/IN situations/NNS where/WRB there/EX are/VBP inadequate/JJ facilities/NNS ,/, where/WRB schooling/NN is/VBZ very/RB poor/JJ ,/, where/WRB the/DT physical/JJ infrastructure/NN is/VBZ under-developed/JJ and/CC where/WRB drugs/NNS and/CC other/JJ phenomena/NNS are/VBP rife/JJ ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN in/IN order/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT role/NN in/IN helping/VBG the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP it/PRP must/MD give/VB assistance/NN to/TO Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN the/DT Union/NNP works/VBZ for/IN these/DT citizens/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ families/NNS ./.

The/DT programme/NN has/VBZ been/VBN extremely/RB successful/JJ in/IN Ireland/NNP ,/, as/IN indeed/RB I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN successful/JJ in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD quite/RB slow/JJ in/IN getting/VBG off/RP the/DT ground/NN there/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD slow/JJ because/IN it/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ to/TO have/VB the/DT local/JJ people/NNS themselves/PRP develop/VBP these/DT programmes/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN they/PRP use/VBP their/PRP$ initiative/NN and/CC their/PRP$ own/JJ local/JJ expertise/NN in/IN developing/VBG this/DT initiative/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB easy/JJ to/TO have/VB these/DT programmes/NNS developed/VBN quickly/RB and/CC on/IN time/NN if/IN you/PRP brought/VBD in/IN outside/JJ professional/JJ experts/NNS but/CC that/WDT would/MD undermine/VB the/DT whole/JJ purpose/NN of/IN the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB one/CD further/JJ point/NN before/IN I/PRP conclude/VBP :/: we/PRP should/MD insist/VB where/WRB this/DT money/NN is/VBZ being/VBG allocated/VBN and/CC where/WRB this/DT programme/NN is/VBZ being/VBG developed/VBN that/IN it/PRP be/VB done/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT serious/JJ URBAN/NNP development/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP ./.

I/PRP applaud/VBP the/DT innovative/JJ approach/NN of/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP programme/NN and/CC the/DT aim/NN of/IN integrating/VBG discriminated/JJ groups/NNS into/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ./.

The/DT development/NN partnerships/NNS are/VBP a/DT very/RB clever/JJ idea/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN they/PRP are/VBP experimental/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP two/CD major/JJ concerns/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, about/IN the/DT development/NN partnerships/NNS ./.

They/PRP should/MD be/VB accessible/JJ to/TO smaller/JJR groups/NNS ,/, accessible/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO devise/VB ,/, implement/VB and/CC monitor/VB the/DT programmes/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT wide/JJ element/NN of/IN flexibility/NN within/IN the/DT programme/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP also/RB expressed/VBN concern/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN about/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN simple/JJ language/NN and/CC not/RB using/VBG jargon/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ accessible/JJ to/TO everyone/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN this/DT was/VBD accepted/VBN into/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP can/MD not/RB agree/VB with/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 9/CD because/IN that/DT amendment/NN really/RB is/VBZ not/RB expressed/VBN in/IN simple/JJ language/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ concern/NN was/VBD that/IN some/DT discriminated/JJ groups/NNS have/VBP specific/JJ problems/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, disabled/VBN people/NNS '/POS s/JJ access/NN to/TO the/DT workplace/NN ./.

Projects/NNPS should/MD also/RB specifically/RB address/VB this/DT problem/NN ./.

These/DT concerns/NNS must/MD be/VB looked/VBN at/IN while/IN setting/VBG up/RP the/DT programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP certainly/RB intend/VBP to/TO do/VB that/DT with/IN organisations/NNS and/CC groups/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ constituency/NN in/IN the/DT West/NNP Midlands/NNPS ./.

I/PRP now/RB turn/VBP to/TO the/DT controversial/JJ issue/NN of/IN asylum-seekers/NNS and/CC refugees/NNS ./.

Although/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN those/DT refugees/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN refused/VBN refugee/NN status/NN and/CC threatened/VBN with/IN repatriation/NN ,/, having/VBG access/NN to/TO EQUAL/VB ,/, I/PRP would/MD support/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN access/NN for/IN all/DT other/JJ asylum-seekers/NNS and/CC refugees/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB fair/JJ and/CC right/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO access/VB EQUAL/NNP in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN as/IN everyone/NN else/RB ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ report/NN ,/, rural/JJ development/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ to/TO the/DT fore/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB happen/VB all/PDT that/DT often/RB and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ gratifying/VBG ,/, especially/RB as/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ programmes/NNS have/VBP been/VBN key/JJ elements/NNS in/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ rural/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB pointed/VBN out/RP that/IN these/DT programmes/NNS have/VBP not/RB only/RB been/VBN instrumental/JJ in/IN structuring/VBG regional/JJ planning/NN ,/, but/CC have/VBP also/RB been/VBN vital/JJ instruments/NNS for/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN in/IN often/RB vulnerable/JJ areas/NNS such/JJ as/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, areas/NNS experiencing/VBG depopulation/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB stressed/VBN that/IN in/IN order/NN to/TO become/VB eligible/JJ under/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ programme/NN ,/, local/JJ operators/NNS have/VBP combined/VBN forces/NNS ,/, debated/VBN and/CC prepared/VBN projects/NNS ./.

These/DT programmes/NNS have/VBD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, been/VBN important/JJ channels/NNS for/IN participative/JJ democracy/NN ,/, the/DT rationale/NN of/IN the/DT citizen/NN for/IN Europe/NNP ./.

So/RB ,/, the/DT concept/NN for/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP should/MD retain/VB all/PDT the/DT positive/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN previous/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

One/CD urgent/JJ question/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB raised/VBN :/: why/WRB ,/, when/WRB this/DT programme/NN has/VBZ been/VBN successfully/RB run/VBN for/IN ten/CD years/NNS ,/, is/VBZ LEADER/NNP +/NNP still/RB classed/VBN as/RB experimental/JJ ?/.

Are/VBP there/EX so/RB many/JJ other/JJ European/JJ schemes/NNS which/WDT can/MD boast/VB 800/CD specific/JJ original/JJ experiments/NNS which/WDT were/VBD particularly/RB successful/JJ ?/.

For/IN how/WRB much/RB longer/RBR is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP going/VBG to/TO leave/VB LEADER/NNP at/IN the/DT experimental/JJ stage/NN instead/RB of/IN bringing/VBG it/PRP online/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT general/JJ concept/NN of/IN mainstreaming/VBG of/IN rural/JJ development/NN ?/.

Moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP wonder/VBP at/IN the/DT reduced/JJ guidelines/NNS to/TO which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP wishes/VBZ to/TO restrict/VB LEADER/NNP +/NNP ./.

At/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, after/IN Seattle/NNP ,/, we/PRP Europeans/NNPS are/VBP fighting/VBG on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN multifunctionality/NN in/IN rural/JJ development/NN projects/NNS ,/, why/WRB should/MD we/PRP confine/VB ourselves/PRP to/TO a/DT few/JJ limited/JJ criteria/NNS with/IN resources/NNS that/WDT are/VBP far/RB from/IN sufficient/JJ ?/.

As/IN an/DT ecologist/NN ,/, let/VB met/VBN tell/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN and/CC sustainable/JJ development/NN require/VBP much/RB more/JJR diversified/JJ and/CC many-sided/JJ approaches/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ proposing/VBG to/TO limit/VB yet/CC further/RBR the/DT cooperation/NN actions/NNS of/IN local/JJ action/NN groups/NNS to/TO only/JJ candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

A/DT better/JJR solution/NN would/MD be/VB ,/, as/IN indeed/RB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP suggests/VBZ ,/, strengthened/VBD coordination/NN between/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP and/CC the/DT Community/NNP cooperation/NN and/CC partnership/NN programmes/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN INTERREG/NNP ,/, PHARE/NNP ,/, SAPARD/NNP or/CC MEDA/NNP ./.

The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ ,/, showing/VBG solidarity/NN with/IN Eastern/NNP Europe/NNP ,/, is/VBZ all/RB very/RB well/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

The/DT tradition/NN which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN established/VBN by/IN the/DT previous/JJ programmes/NNS with/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT south/NN ,/, particularly/RB the/DT countries/NNS around/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP ,/, must/MD not/RB be/VB abandoned/VBN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, once/RB more/RBR ,/, we/PRP can/MD stress/VB that/IN what/WP the/DT area/NN of/IN agriculture/NN and/CC rural/JJ development/NN really/RB needs/VBZ is/VBZ codecision/JJ ./.

Codecision/NNP would/MD give/VB us/PRP effective/JJ means/NNS to/TO progress/VB programmes/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN ,/, which/WDT require/VBP cooperation/NN and/CC cross-disciplinary/NN application/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT few/JJ very/RB brief/JJ comments/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG the/DT planning/NN phase/NN and/CC guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT four/CD Community/NNP initiatives/NNS without/IN access/NN to/TO any/DT substantive/JJ and/CC complete/JJ appraisal/NN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ period/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB very/RB good/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.

Programmes/NNS and/CC objectives/NNS usually/RB turn/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB far/RB too/RB ambitious/JJ and/CC their/PRP$ results/NNS are/VBP not/RB always/RB satisfactory/JJ ,/, while/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN transparency/NN and/CC complexity/NN of/IN the/DT plans/NNS often/RB allow/VB considerable/JJ scope/NN for/IN mismanagement/NN and/CC even/RB fraud/NN ./.

The/DT Community/NNP initiatives/NNS we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG could/MD play/VB a/DT positive/JJ part/NN subject/NN to/TO certain/JJ preconditions/NNS ./.

They/PRP must/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, not/RB be/VB subordinated/JJ to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS and/CC aspirations/NNS of/IN a/DT more/JJR generally/RB negative/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ policy/NN ,/, but/CC must/MD develop/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ self-sufficient/JJ role/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, adapting/NNP EQUAL/NNP to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN employability/NN and/CC the/DT flexibilisation/NN of/IN labour/NN relations/NNS transforms/VBZ this/DT initiative/NN into/IN a/DT new/JJ version/NN of/IN local/JJ employment/NN contracts/NNS ./.

Extending/VBG the/DT LEADER/JJ initiative/NN to/TO every/DT area/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP entails/VBZ the/DT risk/NN of/IN marginalising/VBG deprived/VBN areas/NNS even/RB more/RBR ,/, to/TO the/DT benefit/NN of/IN more/RBR developed/VBN areas/NNS ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN must/MD include/VB eligible/JJ areas/NNS with/IN special/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN border/NN areas/NNS ,/, islands/NNS and/CC both/DT mountain/NN and/CC non-mountain/JJ areas/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT prefecture/NN of/IN Arta/NNP in/IN Greece/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ omission/NN from/IN Annex/NNP I/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ communication/NN is/VBZ ill-considered/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, rural/JJ development/NN has/VBZ been/VBN identified/VBN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP as/IN a/DT priority/NN policy/NN area/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB here/RB today/NN the/DT Commissioner/NNP responsible/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP Fischler/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ response/NN to/TO rural/JJ decline/NN has/VBZ come/VBN late/RB in/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP suppose/VBP better/RBR late/RB than/IN never/RB ./.

Family/NNP farming/NNP is/VBZ now/RB recognised/VBN as/RB central/JJ to/TO the/DT European/JJ agricultural/JJ model/NN and/CC is/VBZ an/DT objective/NN to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN ,/, certainly/RB within/IN the/DT time-scale/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS will/MD decide/VB the/DT future/NN of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN marginal/JJ family/NN farms/NNS ./.

It/PRP behoves/VBZ all/DT of/IN us/PRP to/TO do/VB everything/NN possible/JJ to/TO ensure/VB their/PRP$ survival/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP knows/VBZ ,/, farming/NN alone/RB will/MD not/RB be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO ensure/VB the/DT sustainability/NN of/IN rural/JJ communities/NNS ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN we/PRP need/VBP the/DT coordination/NN of/IN all/DT policy/NN areas/NNS capable/JJ of/IN impacting/VBG positively/RB on/IN rural/JJ development/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN LEADER/NNP has/VBZ established/VBN itself/PRP as/IN an/DT effective/JJ development/NN initiative/NN ./.

It/PRP provides/VBZ the/DT opportunity/NN for/IN local/JJ communities/NNS to/TO identify/VB their/PRP$ development/NN potential/NN and/CC become/VB actively/RB involved/VBN in/IN addressing/VBG those/DT problems/NNS ./.

The/DT voluntary/JJ participation/NN of/IN people/NNS in/IN development/NN programmes/NNS is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB always/RB fully/RB appreciated/VBN ./.

Yet/CC ,/, through/IN LEADER/NNP ,/, there/EX can/MD be/VB no/RB doubting/VBG its/PRP$ effectiveness/NN as/IN an/DT integral/JJ part/NN of/IN broader/JJR EU/JJ and/CC national/JJ policy/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, while/IN welcoming/VBG Commission/NNP approval/NN for/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT time/NN delay/NN between/IN the/DT ending/NN of/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP and/CC the/DT commencement/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ programme/NN ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP you/PRP to/TO look/VB seriously/RB at/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.

A/DT break/NN in/IN continuity/NN will/MD have/VB serious/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN the/DT programme/NN and/CC certainly/RB a/DT disruptive/JJ effect/NN on/IN voluntary/JJ and/CC professional/JJ workers/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT relevant/JJ Councils/NNS of/IN Ministers/NNP permit/VBP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB that/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP should/MD be/VB given/VBN more/JJR information/NN on/IN the/DT procedures/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP projects/NNS and/CC ,/, beyond/IN that/WDT ,/, of/IN similar/JJ initiatives/NNS ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB even/RB better/JJR if/IN they/PRP were/VBD involved/VBN to/TO a/DT greater/JJR extent/NN in/IN the/DT processes/NNS of/IN framing/VBG and/CC implementing/VBG the/DT programmes/NNS concerned/VBN ,/, otherwise/RB it/PRP will/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO determine/VB and/CC defend/VB their/PRP$ role/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT local/JJ and/CC national/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC even/RB the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN of/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP report/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP ,/, very/RB warmly/JJ for/IN all/PDT the/DT efforts/NNS she/PRP has/VBZ made/VBN to/TO master/VB this/DT very/RB complex/JJ subject/NN matter/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP ./.

EQUAL/NNP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB difficult/JJ programme/NN because/IN it/PRP attempts/VBZ to/TO combine/VB so/RB many/JJ old/JJ programmes/NNS and/CC yet/RB aims/VBZ to/TO view/VB them/PRP in/IN a/DT different/JJ light/NN ,/, doing/VBG so/RB with/IN less/JJR money/NN than/IN was/VBD available/JJ in/IN the/DT previous/JJ funds/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT arduous/JJ task/NN ./.

Only/RB ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN people/NNS affected/VBN by/IN these/DT programmes/NNS has/VBZ not/RB really/RB dropped/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB hard/JJ to/TO strike/VB a/DT balance/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ between/IN the/DT different/JJ countries/NNS or/CC the/DT different/JJ components/NNS ,/, but/CC especially/RB between/IN the/DT different/JJ groups/NNS listed/VBN in/IN the/DT programme/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN fact/NN this/DT is/VBZ what/WP has/VBZ preoccupied/VBN us/PRP to/TO date/NN ./.

Comments/NNS are/VBP made/VBN here/RB and/CC there/RB to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN one/CD group/NN should/MD get/VB more/JJR funding/NN than/IN another/DT ./.

I/PRP ,/, for/IN my/PRP$ part/NN ,/, have/VBP focused/VBN on/IN the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT handicapped/NNS and/CC the/DT elderly/JJ within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN their/PRP$ position/NN could/MD well/RB have/VB been/VBN overlooked/VBN altogether/RB if/IN it/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN for/IN the/DT European/JJ Parliament/NNP devoting/VBG special/JJ attention/NN to/TO them/PRP ./.

Although/IN a/DT few/JJ other/JJ groups/NNS have/VBP been/VBN mentioned/VBN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, which/WDT are/VBP on/IN the/DT lookout/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, I/PRP know/VBP of/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP that/WDT would/MD like/VB to/TO use/VB a/DT large/JJ proportion/NN of/IN the/DT entire/JJ programme/NN for/IN one/CD component/NN ,/, namely/RB refugees/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, ask/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN a/DT balance/NN is/VBZ struck/VBN between/IN these/DT different/JJ groups/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN that/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN calling/VBG on/IN the/DT subsidiarity/JJ principle/NN ,/, can/MD decide/VB that/IN all/DT funding/NN should/MD go/VB to/TO one/CD group/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB monitored/VBN closely/RB because/IN otherwise/RB we/PRP will/MD end/VB up/RP in/IN that/DT situation/NN against/IN which/WDT Mr/NNP Meijer/NNP has/VBZ warned/VBN us/PRP so/RB vehemently/RB ,/, to/TO wit/NN ,/, that/IN vested/JJ interests/NNS will/MD emerge/VB and/CC that/IN people/NNS will/MD think/VB that/IN the/DT money/NN is/VBZ theirs/PRP to/TO spend/VB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN !/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB redistributed/VBN time/NN and/CC again/RB ./.

It/PRP should/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN innovative/JJ projects/NNS and/CC it/PRP should/MD not/RB completely/RB disappear/VB into/IN the/DT Finance/NNP Minister/NNP '/POS s/JJ treasury/NN funds/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT intention/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ point/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN here/RB ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT remaining/VBG problems/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP faced/VBN within/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, and/CC which/WDT in/IN large/JJ part/NN stem/VBP from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB difficult/JJ to/TO strike/VB the/DT right/JJ balance/NN ,/, can/MD be/VB solved/VBN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP it/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO join/VB in/IN the/DT compromise/NN that/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG concluded/VBN here/RB in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, mainly/RB with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO reaching/VBG a/DT balance/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ actually/RB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.

The/DT position/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN this/DT whole/JJ procedure/NN is/VBZ somewhat/RB unclear/JJ ./.

The/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP do/VBP not/RB shed/VB any/DT more/JJR light/NN on/IN the/DT matter/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB why/WRB this/DT back/JJ burner/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB useful/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN promotes/VBZ efforts/NNS to/TO achieve/VB economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB INTERREG/NNP '/POS s/JJ particular/JJ importance/NN for/IN the/DT Balkan/NNP area/NN ,/, where/WRB political/JJ developments/NNS and/CC hostilities/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS have/VBP had/VBN major/JJ economic/JJ repercussions/NNS for/IN neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS and/CC especially/RB for/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, Greece/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP on/IN that/DT long-suffering/JJ peninsula/NN ./.

For/IN Greece/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT neighbouring/VBG countries/NNS Italy/NNP and/CC Austria/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB for/IN Europe/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ restoration/NN of/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ,/, bringing/VBG political/JJ stability/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT vitally/RB important/JJ matter/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, some/DT Balkan/NNP countries/NNS have/VBP received/VBN aid/NN from/IN the/DT PHARE/NNP and/CC Obnova/NNP programmes/NNS ,/, while/IN others/NNS have/VBP not/RB ./.

Accordingly/RB ,/, we/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT related/VBN references/NNS in/IN Chapter/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposed/VBN general/JJ guidelines/NNS for/IN INTERREG/NNP ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO end/VB by/IN saying/VBG that/IN the/DT planning/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ inter-state/JJ cooperation/NN zones/NNS has/VBZ taken/VBN no/DT account/NN of/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP '/POS s/JJ geographical/JJ peculiarities/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD justify/VB the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT special/JJ zone/NN for/IN coastal/JJ and/CC island/NN regions/NNS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB ask/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO pay/VB special/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN maritime/NN and/CC island/NN cooperation/NN when/WRB zone/NN planning/NN next/JJ comes/VBZ up/RP for/IN review/NN ./.

I/PRP end/VBP by/IN stressing/VBG the/DT need/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO persist/VB with/IN such/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, which/WDT strive/VBP to/TO eliminate/VB inequalities/NNS between/IN our/PRP$ regions/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO foster/VB their/PRP$ harmonious/JJ development/NN ./.

And/CC since/IN this/DT is/VBZ St./NNP Valentine/NNP '/POS s/JJ day/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT former/JJ Mayor/NNP of/IN a/DT regional/JJ city/NN ,/, I/PRP propose/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD all/RB declare/VB our/PRP$ love/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT European/JJ regions/NNS which/WDT need/VBP that/DT love/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Fischler/NNP ,/, rural/JJ development/NN can/MD and/CC must/MD tackle/VB the/DT problem/NN from/IN three/CD different/JJ angles/NNS :/: preservation/NN of/IN jobs/NNS ,/, stewardship/NN of/IN the/DT countryside/NN and/CC ,/, not/RB least/JJS ,/, local/JJ culture/NN ,/, because/IN that/DT is/VBZ of/IN the/DT utmost/JJ importance/NN ./.

Only/RB if/IN the/DT population/NN can/MD stay/VB in/IN the/DT countryside/NN will/MD the/DT quality/NN of/IN life/NN in/IN the/DT countryside/NN also/RB be/VB permanently/RB assured/VBN ./.

We/PRP can/MD observe/VB the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN migration/NN from/IN the/DT countryside/NN in/IN several/JJ areas/NNS of/IN the/DT Alps/NNPS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP devastating/VBG ./.

But/CC I/PRP warn/VBP against/IN using/VBG these/DT programmes/NNS to/TO take/VB urban/JJ culture/NN to/TO the/DT countryside/NN ./.

And/CC neither/DT should/MD we/PRP create/VB structures/NNS which/WDT are/VBP reliant/JJ on/IN subsidies/NNS and/CC which/WDT will/MD be/VB dependent/JJ on/IN them/PRP forevermore/RB ./.

To/TO really/RB guarantee/VB sustainability/NN -/: a/DT buzzword/NN which/WDT has/VBZ ,/, since/IN it/PRP gained/VBD new/JJ currency/NN ,/, become/VBN relatively/RB devoid/JJ of/IN meaning/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP all/DT know/VBP what/WP we/PRP mean/VBP by/IN it/PRP -/: what/WP is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, amongst/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, is/VBZ an/DT integrated/VBN approach/NN in/IN the/DT countryside/NN towards/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, tourism/NN and/CC agriculture/NN ./.

The/DT investment/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB visionary/JJ ./.

Young/NNP ,/, creative/JJ individuals/NNS must/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO feel/VB an/DT attachment/NN to/TO the/DT countryside/NN ./.

If/IN they/PRP all/RB leave/VB then/RB nothing/NN much/RB will/MD go/VB on/IN there/RB any/DT more/RBR ./.

None/NN of/IN us/PRP think/VBP much/RB of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN indiscriminate/JJ ,/, all-round/JJ distribution/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT pilot/NN projects/NNS need/VBP to/TO act/VB ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, like/IN avalanches/NNS and/CC trigger/VB other/JJ similar/JJ projects/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD be/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN supporting/VBG self-contained/JJ cycles/NNS of/IN projects/NNS and/CC ,/, even/RB though/IN LEADER/NNP I/NNP and/CC LEADER/NNP II/NNP may/MD have/VB had/VBN shortcomings/NNS here/RB and/CC there/RB ,/, overall/RB they/PRP were/VBD certainly/RB positive/JJ ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB that/IN we/PRP consider/VBP granting/VBG derogations/NNS not/RB only/JJ in/IN the/DT Nordic/JJ countries/NNS but/CC also/RB for/IN mountainous/JJ areas/NNS -/: the/DT Alps/NNPS ,/, the/DT Pyrenees/NNP and/CC the/DT Sierra/NNP Nevada/NNP ,/, from/IN where/WRB I/PRP have/VBP just/RB returned/VBN -/: in/IN respect/NN of/IN population/NN size/NN and/CC density/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO talk/VB about/IN the/DT EQUAL/JJ report/NN ,/, especially/RB the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT policy/NN on/IN refugees/NNS ./.

Last/JJ week/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD a/DT very/RB impassioned/JJ discussion/NN about/IN the/DT formation/NN of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Government/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS startling/JJ aspect/NN of/IN her/PRP$ original/JJ report/NN was/VBD that/IN she/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO limit/VB aid/NN to/TO the/DT small/JJ group/NN of/IN refugees/NNS covered/VBN by/IN the/DT Geneva/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB so-called/JJ quota/NN refugees/NNS or/CC UN/NN refugees/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD and/CC always/RB will/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN life/NN '/POS s/JJ mysteries/NNS ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT unsolved/JJ riddles/NNS of/IN the/DT follow-up/NN to/TO the/DT BSE/NNP crisis/NN ,/, that/IN we/PRP still/RB have/VBP no/DT Community/NNP rules/NNS for/IN the/DT control/NN of/IN scrapie/NN in/IN sheep/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, like/VB to/TO add/VB that/IN no/DT new/JJ scientific/JJ knowledge/NN was/VBD needed/VBN which/WDT proved/VBD that/IN the/DT experimental/JJ infection/NN of/IN sheep/NN by/IN feeding/VBG them/PRP BSE-infected/JJ feed/NN produced/VBD a/DT clinical/JJ expression/NN of/IN the/DT disease/NN which/WDT is/VBZ indistinguishable/JJ from/IN the/DT symptoms/NNS of/IN scrapie/NN ./.

No/DT new/JJ knowledge/NN was/VBD needed/VBN ,/, because/IN the/DT theory/NN from/IN the/DT beginning/NN was/VBD that/IN BSE/NNP and/CC scrapie/NNP must/MD be/VB related/VBN and/CC this/DT theory/NN has/VBZ increasingly/RB taken/VBN hold/VB ./.

From/IN this/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN we/PRP are/VBP slightly/RB behind/IN the/DT times/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB in/IN complete/JJ agreement/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN on/IN scrapie/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, like/VB to/TO add/VB that/IN it/PRP only/RB makes/VBZ sense/NN if/IN we/PRP ensure/VB that/IN the/DT new/JJ TSE/NNP regulation/NN allows/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ symbiosis/NNS between/IN consumer/NN protection/NN and/CC practicable/NN suggestions/NNS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB need/VBP to/TO take/VB consistent/JJ account/NN of/IN six/CD or/CC seven/CD points/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/VBG debate/NN on/IN the/DT TSE/NNP proposal/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT of/IN course/NN includes/VBZ scrapie/JJ ./.

When/WRB we/PRP discuss/VB the/DT TSE/NNP regulation/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, we/PRP must/MD also/RB clarify/VB that/IN we/PRP shortly/RB intend/VBP to/TO discuss/VB separate/JJ proposals/NNS under/IN Article/NNP 152/CD as/IN the/DT corresponding/JJ legal/JJ base/NN for/IN products/NNS excluded/VBN from/IN this/DT regulation/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN cosmetics/NNS ,/, medicinal/JJ products/NNS or/CC animal/NN feed/NN ./.

We/PRP insist/VBP on/IN this/DT ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, that/DT means/VBZ that/IN fundamental/JJ core/NN provisions/NNS in/IN this/DT proposed/VBN regulation/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB relegated/VBN yet/RB again/RB to/TO the/DT Annex/NNP but/CC included/VBN in/IN the/DT body/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ regulation/NN because/IN we/PRP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP want/VBP to/TO and/CC will/MD assume/VB joint/JJ responsibility/NN here/RB ./.

It/PRP also/RB means/VBZ that/IN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP fighting/VBG these/DT diseases/NNS ,/, the/DT problem/NN of/IN destroying/VBG whole/JJ herds/NNS in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN an/DT outbreak/NN of/IN scrapie/NNP or/CC BSE/NNP and/CC the/DT question/NN of/IN defining/VBG geographical/JJ areas/NNS are/VBP items/NNS which/WDT also/RB remain/VBP on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN discussing/VBG the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT future/JJ application/NN of/IN tests/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD of/IN course/NN bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP still/RB not/RB reached/VBN the/DT point/NN where/WRB tests/NNS are/VBP generally/RB applicable/JJ ./.

At/IN first/JJ we/PRP were/VBD somewhat/RB irresolute/JJ and/CC we/PRP regret/VBP that/DT now/RB ./.

But/CC I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD in/IN fact/NN quite/RB clever/JJ timing/NN ./.

This/DT debate/NN does/VBZ in/IN fact/NN give/VBP us/PRP an/DT excellent/JJ opportunity/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Byrne/NNP ,/, to/TO give/VB the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT few/JJ things/NNS to/TO think/VB about/RP ./.

Although/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB a/DT very/RB positive/JJ exchange/NN on/IN Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN earlier/RBR on/IN and/CC will/MD certainly/RB have/VB to/TO agree/VB to/TO disagree/VB ,/, things/NNS may/MD be/VB different/JJ with/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD become/VB more/RBR difficult/JJ once/IN we/PRP see/VBP the/DT TSE/NNP proposal/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Byrne/NNP ./.

When/WRB we/PRP have/VBP the/DT chance/NN to/TO ask/VB direct/JJ questions/NNS ,/, the/DT questions/NNS which/WDT Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NNP referred/VBD to/TO will/MD be/VB asked/VBN ./.

Questions/NNS will/MD be/VB asked/VBN -/: questions/NNS which/WDT I/PRP shall/MD have/VB to/TO put/VB to/TO you/PRP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP representatives/NNS in/IN committee/NN -/: on/IN how/WRB things/NNS stand/VBP with/IN the/DT BSE/NNP status/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC other/JJ third/JJ countries/NNS ./.

How/WRB will/MD BSE/NNP status/NN in/IN fact/NN be/VB defined/VBN then/RB ?/.

Do/VBP you/PRP envisage/VB circumstances/NNS under/IN which/WDT the/DT BSE/NNP status/NN will/MD depend/VB on/IN the/DT willingness/NN to/TO apply/VB a/DT BSE/NNP test/NN ?/.

And/CC then/RB there/EX is/VBZ my/PRP$ standing/NN question/NN to/TO you/PRP Mr/NNP Byrne/NNP ,/, a/DT question/NN you/PRP certainly/RB already/RB know/VBP and/CC which/WDT will/MD not/RB surprise/VB you/PRP ./.

What/WDT about/IN the/DT BSE/NNP test/NN ?/.

When/WRB will/MD you/PRP make/VB it/PRP compulsory/RB ?/.

Perhaps/RB you/PRP will/MD do/VB so/RB before/IN Parliament/NNP debates/NNS the/DT TSE/NNP report/NN ./.

Not/RB that/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO put/VB it/PRP off/RP ,/, but/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT gesture/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, if/IN you/PRP could/MD say/VB :/: here/RB is/VBZ the/DT proposed/VBN legislation/NN on/IN the/DT BSE/NNP test/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN I/PRP am/VBP a/DT thorn/NN in/IN your/PRP$ side/NN on/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC sometimes/RB that/IN is/VBZ my/PRP$ job/NN ./.

I/PRP say/VBP quite/RB emphatically/RB ,/, even/RB after/IN the/DT report/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Graefe/NNP zu/NNP Baringdorf/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ completely/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT whole/JJ idea/NN ,/, that/DT animal/NN feeding/NN ,/, animal/NN rearing/NN ,/, animal/NN production/NN must/MD be/VB suited/VBN to/TO the/DT species/NN and/CC must/MD also/RB ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, cause/VB no/DT harm/NN or/CC danger/NN to/TO human/JJ beings/NNS ./.

Cosmetic/NN ,/, medical/JJ and/CC other/JJ products/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB excluded/VBN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN they/PRP cause/VBP no/DT harm/NN or/CC are/VBP not/RB dangerous/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ ,/, without/IN doubt/NN ,/, too/RB short/JJ ,/, too/RB sweet/JJ and/CC too/RB little/JJ ./.

You/PRP are/VBP lucky/JJ that/IN Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NN '/'' s/VBZ report/VB only/JJ deals/NNS with/IN this/DT on/IN the/DT sidelines/NNS ;/: with/IN my/PRP$ report/NN you/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO justify/VB yourself/PRP more/RBR thoroughly/RB and/CC you/PRP will/MD have/VB more/JJR trouble/NN doing/VBG so/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, just/RB one/CD more/JJR brief/JJ comment/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Byrne/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

Whether/IN or/CC not/RB we/PRP will/MD agree/VB with/IN the/DT work/NN carried/VBD out/RP by/IN this/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, only/RB time/NN will/MD tell/VB ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN we/PRP certainly/RB will/MD not/RB let/VB you/PRP get/VB away/RP with/IN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN ,/, as/IN a/DT lawyer/NN and/CC politician/NN you/PRP will/MD understand/VB this/DT ./.

Important/JJ issues/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB regulated/VBN in/IN annexes/NNS ./.

They/PRP belong/VBP in/IN the/DT legislative/JJ text/NN ./.

I/PRP might/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ if/IN I/PRP were/VBD a/DT Commissioner/NNP ,/, because/IN I/PRP could/MD simply/RB change/VB an/DT annex/NN under/IN a/DT comitology/JJ procedure/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD not/RB always/RB need/VB to/TO work/VB with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT takes/VBZ so/RB long/RB and/CC is/VBZ so/RB difficult/JJ ./.

But/CC you/PRP must/MD understand/VB that/IN we/PRP can/MD not/RB let/VB you/PRP get/VB away/RP with/IN this/DT ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, whenever/WRB I/PRP get/VBP the/DT chance/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD take/VB everything/NN out/RP of/IN the/DT annexes/NNS and/CC cram/VB it/PRP into/IN the/DT legislative/JJ text/NN ./.

And/CC you/PRP would/MD be/VB well/RB advised/VBN to/TO do/VB likewise/RB from/IN the/DT outset/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT composition/NN of/IN our/PRP$ food/NN chain/NN and/CC how/WRB important/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN this/DT chain/NN to/TO provide/VB us/PRP with/IN safe/JJ ,/, healthy/JJ food/NN which/WDT is/VBZ produced/VBN ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN principle/NN ,/, without/IN any/DT questionable/JJ or/CC risky/JJ interim/NN or/CC end/NN products/NNS ./.

Over/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, these/DT basic/JJ principles/NNS have/VBP often/RB been/VBN neglected/VBN in/IN animal/NN husbandry/NN and/CC in/IN epidemiological/JJ matters/NNS because/RB of/IN shoddy/JJ practice/NN or/CC greed/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ already/RB taken/VBN a/DT clear/JJ stand/NN on/IN BSE/NNP and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD do/VB likewise/RB on/IN all/DT epidemics/NNS in/IN animals/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB allow/VB food/NN safety/NN to/TO be/VB compromised/VBN because/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ health/NN which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN stake/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN encompasses/VBZ both/PDT the/DT transportation/NN and/CC the/DT placing/NN on/IN the/DT market/NN of/IN sheep/NN and/CC goats/NNS and/CC a/DT Community/NNP regulation/NN to/TO fight/VB scrapie/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR important/JJ given/VBN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT clear/JJ proof/NN that/IN BSE/NNP and/CC scrapie/NNP are/VBP unrelated/JJ ./.

Animals/NNS are/VBP bought/VBN throughout/IN Europe/NNP and/CC transported/VBN over/IN the/DT entire/JJ continent/NN ./.

The/DT spread/NN of/IN an/DT epidemic/NN as/IN the/DT result/NN of/IN bringing/VBG in/IN one/CD sick/JJ animal/NN can/MD have/VB huge/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN farmers/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP should/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN ,/, for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN history/NN ,/, a/DT case/NN of/IN scrapie/NN was/VBD detected/VBN in/IN Austria/NNP about/RB four/CD weeks/NNS ago/RB ./.

Scrapie/NNP is/VBZ a/DT particularly/RB insidious/JJ disease/NN because/IN the/DT pathogen/NN can/MD remain/VB active/JJ in/IN dust/NN for/IN years/NNS and/CC is/VBZ then/RB ingested/VBN in/IN food/NN ./.

The/DT disease/NN is/VBZ always/RB fatal/JJ ./.

As/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT vaccination/NN ,/, farmers/NNS can/MD only/RB protect/VB themselves/PRP by/IN not/RB buying/VBG animals/NNS from/IN countries/NNS in/IN which/WDT there/EX are/VBP cases/NNS of/IN scrapie/NN ./.

Even/RB if/IN scrapie/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB passed/VBN on/IN to/TO human/JJ beings/NNS ,/, the/DT connection/NN with/IN BSE/NNP has/VBZ still/RB not/RB been/VBN clarified/VBN ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/VBN ./.

As/IN a/DT farmer/NN myself/PRP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP most/RBS concerned/VBN that/IN consumer/NN health/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB put/VBN at/IN risk/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN preventive/JJ measures/NNS ,/, starting/VBG with/IN feeding/NN which/WDT is/VBZ suitable/JJ for/IN the/DT species/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN measures/NNS to/TO combat/VB an/DT epidemic/NN once/IN it/PRP has/VBZ broken/VBN out/RP ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ initiative/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT new/JJ legal/JJ base/NN for/IN combating/VBG scrapie/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NNP '/POS s/VBZ report/NN on/IN measures/NNS to/TO prevent/VB TSE/NNP diseases/NNS is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT proposals/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP temporary/NNP BSE/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NNP was/VBD responsible/JJ for/IN some/DT invaluable/JJ work/NN on/IN this/DT committee/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT relief/NN to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT job/NN of/IN monitoring/VBG the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT BSE/NNP Committee/NNP in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP and/CC Rural/NNP Development/NNP has/VBZ fallen/VBN to/TO him/PRP :/: he/PRP is/VBZ the/DT one/NN with/IN the/DT experience/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN my/PRP$ speech/NN to/TO be/VB part/NN of/IN a/DT discussion/NN that/WDT would/MD have/VB also/RB treated/VBN the/DT second/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB it/PRP appropriate/JJ to/TO have/VB to/TO conduct/VB in/IN part/NN the/DT same/JJ discussion/NN when/WRB Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN from/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP is/VBZ featured/VBN in/IN the/DT plenary/JJ session/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT previous/JJ speech/NN Mrs/NNP Schierhuber/NNP said/VBD that/IN scrapies/NNS is/VBZ an/DT insidious/JJ disease/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ indeed/RB ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO stress/VB how/WRB important/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN us/PRP to/TO remain/VB free/JJ of/IN disease/NN ./.

The/DT possibility/NN ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, of/IN having/VBG additional/JJ inspections/NNS of/IN animals/NNS in/IN these/DT areas/NNS is/VBZ not/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN artificial/JJ protectionism/NN or/CC the/DT restriction/NN of/IN freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN ,/, as/IN there/EX really/RB is/VBZ justification/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT inspections/NNS must/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN being/VBG fair/JJ and/CC cost-effective/JJ action/NN to/TO promote/VB the/DT wellbeing/NN of/IN animals/NNS and/CC prevent/VB increased/VBN expenditure/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/JJ Democrats/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD support/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN on/IN Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NN '/POS s/JJ report/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ debate/NN on/IN Mrs/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN we/PRP must/MD look/VB again/RB at/IN the/DT position/NN of/IN those/DT countries/NNS where/WRB TSEs/NNP do/VBP not/RB occur/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO offer/VB my/PRP$ congratulations/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN Mr/NNP B脙/NNP 露/NNP ge/NNP and/CC the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP are/VBP now/RB tremendous/JJ experts/NNS in/IN this/DT field/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP continuing/VBG to/TO monitor/VB this/DT issue/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ./.

Regardless/RB of/IN the/DT many/JJ other/JJ concerns/NNS we/PRP may/MD have/VB ,/, BSE/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN us/PRP a/DT terrible/JJ legacy/NN that/WDT has/VBZ to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN and/CC resolved/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB clear/JJ that/IN the/DT incidence/NN of/IN scrapie/NN in/IN sheep/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT contributing/JJ factor/NN to/TO the/DT overall/JJ problem/NN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT legal/JJ base/NN being/VBG set/VBN and/CC the/DT comprehensive/JJ way/NN the/DT new/JJ rules/NNS will/MD ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, address/VB this/DT situation/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN nothing/NN can/MD enter/VB the/DT food/NN chain/NN or/CC the/DT animal/NN compound/NN feed/NN to/TO allow/VB what/WP we/PRP have/VBP experienced/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN to/TO happen/VB again/RB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

No-one/NNP would/MD want/VB to/TO see/VB what/WP happened/VBD to/TO farmers/NNS with/IN BSE/NNP happen/VB ever/RB again/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO bring/VB in/IN the/DT most/RBS stringent/JJ rules/NNS and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO make/VB them/PRP work/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ both/DT for/IN the/DT producer/NN and/CC the/DT consumer/NN that/IN we/PRP restore/VB confidence/NN and/CC the/DT only/JJ way/NN we/PRP can/MD do/VB it/PRP is/VBZ by/IN rigorously/RB tackling/VBG the/DT problem/NN and/CC resolving/VBG it/PRP ./.

BSE/NNP has/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB gone/VBN away/RP ./.

You/PRP can/MD see/VB it/PRP in/IN different/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO point/VB the/DT finger/NN at/IN any/DT particular/JJ country/NN ,/, but/CC many/JJ countries/NNS are/VBP now/RB facing/VBG similar/JJ problems/NNS to/TO those/DT we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN in/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

It/PRP will/MD be/VB there/RB for/IN some/DT time/NN to/TO come/VB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT whole/JJ system/NN of/IN traceability/NN ,/, of/IN following/VBG the/DT animal/NN from/IN birth/NN until/IN slaughter/NN and/CC right/NN through/IN the/DT whole/JJ food/NN chain/NN ,/, is/VBZ part/NN of/IN that/DT confidence-building/JJ mechanism/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB that/DT then/RB we/PRP will/MD have/VB tremendous/JJ trouble/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP certainly/RB believed/VBN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ,/, coming/VBG from/IN an/DT agricultural/JJ background/NN myself/PRP ,/, that/IN if/IN we/PRP had/VBD fed/VBN the/DT animals/NNS the/DT proper/JJ food/NN and/CC if/IN the/DT animal/NN feedstuffs/NNS had/VBD been/VBN made/VBN up/RP of/IN the/DT proper/JJ compounds/NNS we/PRP would/MD never/RB have/VB had/VBN BSE/NNP in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD never/RB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT farmer/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD the/DT food/NN compounders/NNS who/WP caused/VBD this/DT problem/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN it/PRP never/RB happens/VBZ again/RB ./. ./.

Climate/NN change/NN ,/, global/JJ resources/NNS ,/, river/NN quality/NN and/CC groundwater/NN aquifer/NN quality/NN are/VBP major/JJ challenges/NNS which/WDT threaten/VBP our/PRP$ common/JJ future/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO make/VB these/DT directives/NNS more/RBR understandable/JJ and/CC more/RBR compatible/JJ with/IN each/DT other/JJ and/CC to/TO give/VB them/PRP clearer/JJR objectives/NNS ./.

The/DT preparation/NN of/IN this/DT framework/NN directive/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB prompted/VBN by/IN a/DT desire/NN for/IN rationalisation/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, at/IN first/JJ reading/NN this/DT House/NNP insisted/VBD that/IN the/DT current/JJ directive/NN should/MD not/RB only/RB be/VB compatible/JJ with/IN the/DT commitments/NNS made/VBN ,/, like/IN OSPAR/NNP ,/, but/CC should/MD allow/VB us/PRP to/TO reverse/VB the/DT course/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ./.

For/IN despite/IN these/DT directives/NNS and/CC frequent/JJ declarations/NNS about/IN the/DT effort/NN which/WDT must/MD be/VB made/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN water/NN protection/NN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN Europe/NNP we/PRP can/MD see/VB that/IN the/DT objectives/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN achieved/VBN ./.

In/IN many/JJ cases/NNS the/DT situation/NN has/VBZ deteriorated/VBN and/CC we/PRP therefore/RB can/MD not/RB settle/VB for/IN just/RB rationalisation/NN of/IN the/DT texts/NNS ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT House/NNP rose/VBD and/CC observed/VBD a/DT minute/NN '/POS s/JJ silence/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Would/MD it/PRP be/VB appropriate/JJ for/IN you/PRP ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO write/VB a/DT letter/NN to/TO the/DT Sri/NNP Lankan/NNP President/NNP expressing/VBG Parliament/NNP 's/POS regret/NN at/IN his/PRP$ and/CC the/DT other/JJ violent/JJ deaths/NNS in/IN Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP and/CC urging/VBG her/PRP to/TO do/VB everything/NN she/PRP possibly/RB can/MD to/TO seek/VB a/DT peaceful/JJ reconciliation/NN to/TO a/DT very/RB difficult/JJ situation/NN ?/.

If/IN the/DT House/NNP agrees/VBZ ,/, I/PRP shall/MD do/VB as/IN Mr/NNP Evans/NNP has/VBZ suggested/VBN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, on/IN a/DT point/NN of/IN order/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB your/PRP$ advice/NN about/IN Rule/NNP 143/NNP concerning/VBG inadmissibility/RB ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN relates/VBZ to/TO something/NN that/WDT will/MD come/VB up/RP on/IN Thursday/NNP and/CC which/WDT I/PRP will/MD then/RB raise/VB again/RB ./.

The/DT Cunha/NNP report/NN on/IN multiannual/JJ guidance/NN programmes/NNS comes/VBZ before/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN Thursday/NNP and/CC contains/VBZ a/DT proposal/NN in/IN paragraph/NN 6/CD that/IN a/DT form/NN of/IN quota/NN penalties/NNS should/MD be/VB introduced/VBN for/IN countries/NNS which/WDT fail/VBP to/TO meet/VB their/PRP$ fleet/NN reduction/NN targets/NNS annually/RB ./.

It/PRP says/VBZ that/IN this/DT should/MD be/VB done/VBN despite/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN relative/JJ stability/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN relative/JJ stability/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ legal/JJ principle/NN of/IN the/DT common/JJ fisheries/NNS policy/NN and/CC a/DT proposal/NN to/TO subvert/VB it/PRP would/MD be/VB legally/RB inadmissible/JJ ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB whether/IN one/PRP can/MD raise/VB an/DT objection/NN of/IN that/WDT kind/NN to/TO what/WP is/VBZ merely/RB a/DT report/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT legislative/JJ proposal/NN ,/, and/CC whether/IN that/DT is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP can/MD competently/RB do/VB on/IN Thursday/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT time/NN when/WRB you/PRP may/MD ,/, if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP ,/, raise/VB this/DT question/NN ,/, i.e./VBN on/IN Thursday/NNP prior/RB to/TO the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT presentation/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT request/NN of/IN a/DT French/JJ Member/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Zimeray/NNP ,/, a/DT petition/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN presented/VBN ,/, which/WDT many/JJ people/NNS signed/VBD ,/, including/VBG myself/PRP ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB in/IN keeping/VBG with/IN the/DT positions/NNS this/DT House/NNP has/VBZ always/RB adopted/VBN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO a/DT case/NN in/IN which/WDT this/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ consistently/RB shown/VBN an/DT interest/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT case/NN of/IN Alexander/NNP Nikitin/NNP ./.

All/DT of/IN us/PRP here/RB are/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT courts/NNS have/VBP acquitted/VBN him/PRP and/CC made/VBN it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN in/IN Russia/NNP ,/, too/RB ,/, access/NN to/TO environmental/JJ information/NN is/VBZ a/DT constitutional/JJ right/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ to/TO go/VB before/IN the/DT courts/NNS once/RB more/RBR because/IN the/DT public/JJ prosecutor/NN is/VBZ appealing/JJ ./.

Yes/UH ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB pleased/JJ to/TO look/VB into/IN the/DT facts/NNS of/IN this/DT case/NN when/WRB I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN your/PRP$ letter/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO compliment/VB you/PRP on/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN you/PRP have/VBP kept/VBN your/PRP$ word/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, during/IN this/DT first/JJ part-session/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ year/NN ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN television/NN channels/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ offices/NNS has/VBZ indeed/RB increased/VBN considerably/RB ./.

But/CC ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ personal/JJ request/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN met/VBN ./.

Although/IN there/EX are/VBP now/RB two/CD Finnish/JJ channels/NNS and/CC one/CD Portuguese/NNP one/CD ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT Dutch/JJ channel/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP had/VBD requested/VBN because/IN Dutch/JJ people/NNS here/RB like/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO follow/VB the/DT news/NN too/RB when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP sent/VBN to/TO this/DT place/NN of/IN exile/NN every/DT month/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB once/RB more/RBR ask/VB you/PRP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP get/VBP a/DT Dutch/JJ channel/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Mrs/VB Plooij-van/NNP Gorsel/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN this/DT matter/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT agenda/NN for/IN the/DT Quaestors/NNPS '/POS meeting/NN on/IN Wednesday/NNP ./.

It/PRP will/MD ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, be/VB examined/VBN in/IN a/DT positive/JJ light/NN ./.

Why/WRB has/VBZ no/DT air/NN quality/NN test/NN been/VBN done/VBN on/IN this/DT particular/JJ building/NN since/IN we/PRP were/VBD elected/VBN ?/.

Why/WRB has/VBZ there/EX been/VBN no/DT Health/NNP and/CC Safety/NNP Committee/NNP meeting/NN since/IN 1998/CD ?/.

Why/WRB has/VBZ there/EX been/VBN no/DT fire/NN drill/NN ,/, either/CC in/IN the/DT Brussels/NNP Parliament/NNP buildings/NNS or/CC the/DT Strasbourg/NNP Parliament/NNP buildings/NNS ?/.

Why/WRB are/VBP there/EX no/DT fire/NN instructions/NNS ?/.

Why/WRB have/VBP the/DT staircases/NN not/RB been/VBN improved/VBN since/IN my/PRP$ accident/NN ?/.

Why/WRB are/VBP no-smoking/JJ areas/NNS not/RB enforced/VBN ?/.

It/PRP seems/VBZ absolutely/RB disgraceful/JJ that/IN we/PRP pass/VBP legislation/NN and/CC do/VBP not/RB adhere/VB to/TO it/PRP ourselves/PRP ./.

Mrs/NNP Lynne/NNP ,/, you/PRP are/VBP quite/RB right/JJ and/CC I/PRP shall/MD check/VB whether/IN this/DT has/VBZ actually/RB not/RB been/VBN done/VBN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD also/RB refer/VB the/DT matter/NN to/TO the/DT College/NNP of/IN Quaestors/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP certain/JJ that/IN they/PRP will/MD be/VB keen/JJ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP comply/VB with/IN the/DT regulations/NNS we/PRP ourselves/MD vote/VB on/RP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP D脙ez/NNP Gonz脙/NNP 隆/NNP lez/NNP and/CC I/PRP had/VBD tabled/VBN questions/NNS on/IN certain/JJ opinions/NNS of/IN the/DT Vice-President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP de/IN Palacio/NNP ,/, which/WDT appeared/VBD in/IN a/DT Spanish/JJ newspaper/NN ./.

The/DT competent/JJ services/NNS have/VBP not/RB included/VBN them/PRP in/IN the/DT agenda/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN answered/VBN in/IN a/DT previous/JJ part-session/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB that/IN they/PRP reconsider/VB ,/, since/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN ./.

The/DT questions/NNS answered/VBN previously/RB referred/VBD to/TO Mrs/NNP de/IN Palacio/NNP '/POS s/JJ intervention/NN ,/, on/IN another/DT occasion/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB to/TO these/DT comments/NNS which/WDT appeared/VBD in/IN the/DT ABC/NNP newspaper/NN on/IN 18/CD November/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Berenguer/NNP Fuster/NNP ,/, we/PRP shall/MD check/VB all/PDT this/DT ./.

I/PRP admit/VBP that/IN ,/, at/IN present/JJ ,/, the/DT matter/NN seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB somewhat/RB confused/VBN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD therefore/RB look/VB into/IN it/PRP properly/RB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN everything/NN is/VBZ as/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.

Today/NNP 's/POS decision/NN not/RB to/TO renew/VB the/DT embargo/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB dangerous/JJ considering/VBG the/DT situation/NN there/RB ./.

So/IN Parliament/NNP should/MD send/VB a/DT message/NN ,/, since/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT wish/NN of/IN the/DT vast/JJ majority/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ irresponsible/JJ of/IN EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO refuse/VB to/TO renew/VB the/DT embargo/NN ./.

As/IN people/NNS have/VBP said/VBD ,/, the/DT situation/NN there/RB is/VBZ extremely/RB volatile/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT risk/NN of/IN a/DT military/JJ coup/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG ./.

So/RB why/WRB should/MD EU/NNP arms/NNP producers/NNS profit/VB at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN innocent/JJ people/NNS ?/.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, this/DT question/NN is/VBZ not/RB presently/RB included/VBN among/IN the/DT requests/NNS for/IN topical/JJ and/CC urgent/JJ debate/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT verification/NN of/IN the/DT final/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT draft/NN agenda/NN as/RB drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT Conference/NN of/IN Presidents/NNS at/IN its/PRP$ meeting/NN of/IN 13/CD January/NNP pursuant/JJ to/TO Rule/CD 110/CD of/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP ./.

No/DT amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN relating/VBG to/TO Monday/NNP and/CC Tuesday/NNP ./.

Relating/VBG to/TO Wednesday/NNP :/: ./.

The/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Party/NNP of/IN European/JJ Socialists/NNS requests/VBZ that/IN a/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN be/VB included/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS and/CC on/IN the/DT administrative/JJ reform/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB Mr/NNP Bar脙/NNP 鲁/NNP n/NNP Crespo/NNP ,/, who/WP made/VBD the/DT request/NN ,/, to/TO speak/VB to/TO propose/VB it/PRP ./.

Then/RB we/PRP shall/MD follow/VB the/DT usual/JJ procedure/NN ,/, hearing/VBG one/CD speaker/NN in/IN favour/NN and/CC one/NN against/IN ./.

This/DT commitment/NN is/VBZ important/JJ because/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ a/DT body/NN with/IN a/DT monopoly/NN of/IN initiative/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, basically/RB dictates/VBZ this/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP political/JJ and/CC legislative/JJ activity/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, that/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP voted/VBD to/TO express/VB its/PRP$ confidence/NN in/IN President/NNP Prodi/NNP during/IN the/DT previous/JJ legislature/NN ./.

It/PRP did/VBD so/RB again/RB during/IN this/DT legislature/NN ,/, in/IN July/NNP ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, in/IN September/NNP ,/, it/PRP voted/VBD once/RB more/RBR to/TO approve/VB the/DT whole/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

There/EX has/VBZ therefore/RB been/VBN enough/JJ time/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO prepare/VB its/PRP$ programme/NN and/CC for/IN us/PRP to/TO become/VB familiar/JJ with/IN it/PRP and/CC explain/VB it/PRP to/TO our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

To/TO this/DT end/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT resolution/NN of/IN 15/CD September/NNP ,/, which/WDT recommended/VBD that/IN the/DT proposal/NN be/VB presented/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

The/DT events/NNS of/IN last/JJ week/NN -/: which/WDT originated/VBP outside/IN the/DT Conference/NN of/IN Presidents/NNS ,/, that/IN Conference/NNP being/VBG used/VBN simply/RB to/TO corroborate/VB and/CC ratify/VB decisions/NNS taken/VBN elsewhere/RB -/: present/VBP us/PRP with/IN a/DT dilemma/NN ./.

Either/CC the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB ready/JJ to/TO present/VB this/DT programme/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT case/NN it/PRP should/MD clarify/VB it/PRP ./.

According/VBG to/TO its/PRP$ President/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

Given/VBN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ represented/VBN by/IN Vice-President/NNP de/FW Palacio/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, before/IN voting/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD help/VB if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD let/VB us/PRP know/VB how/WRB ready/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO present/VB this/DT programme/NN ,/, as/RB agreed/VBN ./.

Alternatively/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP is/VBZ not/RB ready/JJ to/TO examine/VB this/DT programme/NN ,/, as/IN some/DT appear/VBP to/TO be/VB suggesting/VBG ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO request/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP express/VBP its/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN and/CC that/IN we/PRP then/RB proceed/VB to/TO the/DT vote/NN ./.

All/DT of/IN this/DT is/VBZ in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN and/CC is/VBZ therefore/RB to/TO be/VB greatly/RB welcomed/VBN ./.

Our/PRP$ amendments/NNS from/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN have/VBP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, been/VBN taken/VBN into/IN account/NN very/RB satisfactorily/VBN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP either/DT been/VBN accepted/VBN or/CC transposed/VBN with/IN no/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT substance/NN ,/, or/CC they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN rejected/VBN because/IN the/DT corresponding/JJ European/JJ arrangements/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN included/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN a/DT system/NN of/IN penalties/NNS for/IN violations/NNS of/IN the/DT rules/NNS or/CC a/DT complex/JJ classification/NN structure/NN for/IN related/VBN groups/NNS of/IN questions/NNS ./.

The/DT one/NN unanimously/RB adopted/VBD amendment/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP and/CC Transport/NNP ,/, which/WDT concerns/VBZ the/DT timetable/NN for/IN implementing/VBG the/DT directive/NN ,/, is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD urge/VB you/PRP to/TO support/VB ./.

By/IN not/RB setting/VBG a/DT specific/JJ date/NN for/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO implement/VB the/DT directive/NN and/CC instead/RB giving/VBG them/PRP a/DT period/NN of/IN three/CD months/NNS after/IN its/PRP$ entry/NN into/IN force/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP introducing/VBG a/DT flexibility/NN clause/NN which/WDT ensures/VBZ that/IN the/DT directive/NN will/MD be/VB implemented/VBN without/IN delay/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD urge/VB you/PRP to/TO endorse/VB this/DT ./.

If/IN we/PRP see/VBP in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN that/DT nuclear/JJ power/NN plant/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP concerns/NNS about/IN safety/NN we/PRP will/MD discuss/VB it/PRP with/IN Turkey/NNP ./.

If/IN the/DT conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN Turkey/NNP is/VBZ planning/VBG to/TO build/VB a/DT nuclear/JJ power/NN plant/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB meet/VB normal/JJ European/JJ safety/NN standards/NNS is/VBZ concerned/VBN then/RB we/PRP would/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ as/IN we/PRP did/VBD with/IN Lithuania/NNP ,/, Slovakia/NNP and/CC Bulgaria/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT right/NN of/IN a/DT Member/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO raise/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ concerns/NNS and/CC fears/NNS ./.

Mrs/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP has/VBZ the/DT floor/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP Bowe/NNP ,/, for/IN your/PRP$ question/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ monitored/VBN the/DT environmental/JJ effects/NNS of/IN the/DT conflict/NN from/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT NATO/NNP action/NN ./.

As/RB early/RB as/IN last/JJ June/NNP the/DT Commission/NNP financed/VBN a/DT first/JJ study/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT regional/JJ environment/NN centre/NN for/IN central/JJ and/CC eastern/JJ Europe/NNP and/CC concluded/VBN that/IN there/EX had/VBD been/VBN no/DT large-scale/JJ ecological/JJ catastrophe/NN ./.

None/NN of/IN the/DT subsequent/JJ evidence/NN or/CC analysis/NN has/VBZ overturned/VBN that/DT original/JJ assessment/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN closely/RB associated/VBN with/IN the/DT production/NN of/IN the/DT recent/JJ report/NN published/VBN by/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS environment/NN programme/NN -/: Balkan/NNP Task/NNP Force/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS detailed/JJ and/CC comprehensive/JJ report/NN to/TO date/NN on/IN the/DT environmental/JJ effects/NNS of/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP conflict/NN and/CC I/PRP recommend/VBP it/PRP to/TO those/DT who/WP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB studied/VBN it/PRP ./.

The/DT use/NN of/IN depleted/JJ uranium/NN weapons/NNS was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT many/JJ issues/NNS considered/VBN and/CC this/DT report/NN is/VBZ now/RB widely/RB available/JJ also/RB on/IN the/DT Net/NN ./.

The/DT Balkan/NNP Task/NNP Force/NNP was/VBD hampered/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN little/RB or/CC no/DT information/NN was/VBD available/JJ on/IN the/DT actual/JJ use/NN of/IN these/DT weapons/NNS during/IN the/DT conflict/NN ./.

No/DT indications/NNS of/IN contamination/NN were/VBD found/VBN in/IN Kosovo/NNP during/IN the/DT BTF/NNP fact-finding/JJ mission/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT does/VBZ not/RB exclude/VB the/DT possibility/NN that/IN areas/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP are/VBP contaminated/VBN by/IN depleted/JJ uranium/NN ./.

From/IN a/DT desk/NN assessment/NN coupled/VBN with/IN a/DT fact-finding/JJ mission/NN the/DT report/NN concludes/VBZ that/IN the/DT risks/NNS ,/, if/IN any/DT ,/, are/VBP limited/VBN to/TO an/DT area/NN around/IN the/DT target/NN ./.

Future/JJ actions/NNS will/MD take/VB place/NN within/IN the/DT stability/NN pact/NN for/IN south-eastern/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

A/DT special/JJ regional/JJ environmental/JJ reconstruction/NN plan/NN is/VBZ also/RB being/VBG developed/VBN ./.

It/PRP will/MD form/VB the/DT framework/NN for/IN emergency/NN assistance/NN for/IN combating/VBG war/NN damage/NN if/IN such/JJ action/NN should/MD be/VB needed/VBN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, can/MD I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN that/DT very/RB useful/JJ response/NN ./.

Clearly/RB the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN some/DT consideration/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN these/DT reports/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN produced/VBN so/RB far/RB have/VBP looked/VBN carefully/RB at/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT concern/NN with/IN depleted/JJ uranium/NN weapons/NNS is/VBZ about/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT they/PRP are/VBP used/VBN ./.

This/DT uranium/NN becomes/VBZ air-borne/JJ ,/, is/VBZ inhaled/VBN and/CC could/MD now/RB be/VB effectively/RB carried/VBN by/IN members/NNS of/IN the/DT population/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP with/IN rather/RB more/JJR long-term/JJ effects/NNS than/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN possible/JJ to/TO establish/VB so/RB far/RB ./.

This/DT seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT pattern/NN of/IN events/NNS that/WDT has/VBZ emerged/VBN after/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN depleted/JJ uranium/NN weapons/NNS in/IN the/DT Gulf/NNP war/NN ./.

How/WRB long/JJ will/MD you/PRP continue/VB to/TO monitor/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN these/DT weapons/NNS ?/.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP Bowe/NNP ,/, for/IN that/DT question/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO state/VB again/RB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT confirmation/NN that/WDT depleted/VBD uranium/NN was/VBD used/VBN in/IN the/DT conflict/NN and/CC no/DT depleted/JJ uranium/NN has/VBZ been/VBN detected/VBN in/IN the/DT clean-up/JJ of/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

But/CC those/DT symptoms/NNS and/CC those/DT problems/NNS that/IN you/PRP mentioned/VBD could/MD be/VB there/RB and/CC that/DT could/MD be/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN depleted/JJ uranium/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ also/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

No/DT transboundary/JJ effects/NNS have/VBP been/VBN detected/VBN and/CC most/JJS of/IN the/DT weapons/NNS will/MD have/VB been/VBN used/VBN on/IN the/DT territory/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT current/JJ political/JJ isolation/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN means/VBZ that/IN access/NN to/TO this/DT area/NN is/VBZ restricted/VBN ./.

A/DT big/JJ responsibility/NN rests/VBZ with/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS because/IN they/PRP are/VBP addressed/VBN with/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, so/IN they/PRP have/VBP to/TO take/VB responsibility/NN ./.

But/CC through/IN this/DT regional/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ reconstruction/NN plan/NN we/PRP can/MD continue/VB the/DT monitoring/NN and/CC the/DT assistance/NN we/PRP can/MD give/VB and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, for/IN the/DT time/NN being/NN ,/, the/DT kind/NN of/IN frame/NN we/PRP can/MD use/VB for/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO follow/VB up/RP and/CC it/PRP gives/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, something/NN to/TO think/VB about/IN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN concerning/VBG military/JJ secrets/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB has/VBZ a/DT long-term/JJ effect/NN on/IN thinking/VBG when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT use/NN of/IN these/DT sorts/NNS of/IN weapons/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Patten/NNP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP very/RB well-qualified/JJ to/TO comment/VB on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN you/PRP spent/VBD in/IN China/NNP ,/, and/CC you/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ of/IN how/WRB hard/JJ the/DT Tibetans/NNPS are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO initiate/VB a/DT debate/NN ,/, something/NN which/WDT has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN blocked/VBN hitherto/NN ./.

Your/PRP$ approach/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP am/VBP very/RB much/JJ in/IN favour/NN of/IN ,/, since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT coherent/JJ one/NN ,/, takes/VBZ its/PRP$ inspiration/NN from/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ;/: I/PRP wholeheartedly/RB agree/VBP that/IN we/PRP must/MD embrace/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP cut/VBD down/RP here/RB and/CC say/VBP that/IN the/DT Council/NNP now/RB shares/VBZ responsibility/NN for/IN this/DT ,/, then/RB I/PRP fear/VBP that/IN these/DT human/JJ rights/NNS issues/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB given/VBN the/DT attention/NN they/PRP deserve/VBP ./.

Let/VB me/PRP make/VB clear/JJ to/TO the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN what/WP the/DT position/NN is/VBZ ./.

As/IN it/PRP happens/VBZ ,/, we/PRP deal/VBP with/IN the/DT budgetary/JJ consequences/NNS ,/, the/DT Council/NNP makes/VBZ the/DT appointment/NN ./.

Some/DT may/MD think/VB that/IN the/DT budgetary/JJ point/NN should/MD be/VB looked/VBN at/IN in/IN due/JJ course/NN ./.

Putting/VBG that/DT on/IN one/CD side/NN ,/, because/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT situation/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT view/NN and/CC a/DT competence/NN in/IN human/JJ rights/NNS issues/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP long/RB believed/VBN that/IN we/PRP should/MD all/RB recognise/VB that/IN countries/NNS where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ best/JJS to/TO do/VB business/NN are/VBP countries/NNS that/WDT treat/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ citizens/NNS most/RBS decently/JJ -/: everywhere/RB in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB just/RB talking/VBG about/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT environment/NN where/WRB Tibet/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, rather/RB it/PRP is/VBZ about/RB a/DT unique/JJ cultural/JJ heritage/NN that/WDT is/VBZ also/RB able/JJ to/TO communicate/VB important/JJ values/NNS such/JJ as/IN peace/NN ,/, serenity/RB ,/, compassion/NN -/: as/IN the/DT Dalai/NNP Lama/NNP would/MD say/VB -/: to/TO us/PRP Europeans/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB to/TO be/VB brought/VBN in/IN as/IN a/DT ``/`` sort/NN of/IN optional/JJ add-on/NNS ''/'' ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT change/NN we/PRP must/MD impose/VB on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ action/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT manifesto/NN of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Democratic/NNP Freedom/NNP Party/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO justify/VB the/DT accusations/NNS that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ attacking/VBG the/DT principles/NNS of/IN freedom/NN ,/, democracy/NN and/CC respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, fundamental/JJ freedoms/NNS or/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ,/, enshrined/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 6/CD of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

I/PRP would/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, like/VB to/TO draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT President-in-Office/NN ,/, who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN so/RB critical/JJ of/IN Austria/NNP ,/, has/VBZ recently/RB consigned/VBN the/DT inhabitants/NN of/IN Macao/NNP to/TO the/DT sovereign/JJ rule/NN of/IN the/DT People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Democratic/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN China/NNP ./.

Perhaps/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ democracy/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD now/RB be/VB appropriate/JJ to/TO isolate/VB Austria/NNP and/CC criminalise/VB a/DT party/NN that/WDT was/VBD democratically/RB elected/JJ by/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ citizens/NNS ,/, while/IN bringing/VBG Turkey/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ ``/`` Grey/NNP Wolves/NNP ''/'' into/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG an/DT extremely/RB serious/JJ issue/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG nothing/NN less/CC than/IN the/DT presence/NN in/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP '/POS s/JJ government/NN of/IN a/DT political/JJ force/NN whose/WP$ doctrine/NN and/CC principles/NNS are/VBP incompatible/JJ with/IN the/DT conceptual/JJ and/CC moral/JJ bases/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP enshrined/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ founding/VBG Treaties/NNS ./.

A/DT simple/JJ reading/NN of/IN chapter/NN 4/CD ,/, article/NN 1/CD of/IN the/DT Austrian/NNP Freedom/NNP Party/NNP '/POS s/JJ manifesto/NN is/VBZ enough/JJ to/TO make/VB any/DT democratic/JJ conscience/NN shudder/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN Austria/NNP is/VBZ a/DT sovereign/JJ nation/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN we/PRP must/MD respect/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN non-interference/NN in/IN the/DT internal/JJ affairs/NNS of/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, that/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT problem/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ whether/IN the/DT Union/NNP can/MD remain/VB indifferent/JJ to/TO the/DT formation/NN of/IN a/DT government/NN in/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP which/WDT includes/VBZ such/PDT a/DT party/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ answer/NN to/TO this/DT crucial/JJ question/NN is/VBZ no/RB ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP with/IN its/PRP$ substance/NN ,/, its/PRP$ tone/NN and/CC its/PRP$ scope/NN ./.

Konrad/NNP Adenauer/NNP once/RB said/VBD -/: and/CC he/PRP knew/VBD what/WP he/PRP was/VBD saying/VBG -/: that/IN the/DT surest/JJS way/NN to/TO pacify/VB a/DT tiger/NN was/VBD to/TO allow/VB it/PRP to/TO devour/VB you/PRP ./.

History/NN is/VBZ a/DT compendium/NN of/IN events/NNS which/WDT could/MD have/VB been/VBN avoided/VBN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Loud/JJ applause/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP was/VBD built/VBN upon/IN the/DT idea/NN `/`` never/RB again/RB '/'' ,/, meaning/VBG never/RB again/RB do/VBP we/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB xenophobia/NN ,/, concentration/NN camps/NNS ,/, anti-Semitism/NNP ,/, heightened/VBN nationalism/NN or/CC war/NN ./.

The/DT one/NN and/CC only/JJ significance/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ the/DT will/NN to/TO transcend/VB the/DT atrocious/JJ history/NN of/IN the/DT twentieth/JJ century/NN which/WDT gave/VBD the/DT coup/FW de/FW gr脙/NN 垄/NN ce/VBN to/TO any/DT ideal/NN of/IN humanism/NN within/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC which/WDT is/VBZ still/RB highly/RB topical/JJ today/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB true/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN ,/, when/WRB a/DT government/NN forms/VBZ an/DT alliance/NN with/IN neo-Fascists/NNS somewhere/RB in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ merely/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN national/JJ sovereignty/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT Union/NNP of/IN ours/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT grouping/NN of/IN neighbouring/VBG nation/NN states/NNS who/WP are/VBP simply/RB coming/VBG to/TO mutual/JJ arrangements/NNS to/TO improve/VB their/PRP$ collective/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT Community/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ destined/VBN to/TO exist/VB ,/, in/IN which/WDT ,/, when/WRB the/DT main/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ under/IN threat/NN ,/, when/WRB values/NNS are/VBP under/IN threat/NN ,/, all/DT democrats/NNS must/MD bend/VB over/RP backwards/RB to/TO find/VB solutions/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN are/VBP never/RB made/VBN again/RB ./.

Let/VB us/PRP learn/VB the/DT lessons/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP currently/RB reviewing/VBG the/DT options/NNS and/CC possibilities/NNS for/IN introducing/VBG a/DT death/NN penalty/NN resolution/NN in/IN the/DT Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Commission/NNP ./.

This/DT has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN a/DT subject/NN about/IN which/WDT I/PRP personally/RB have/VBP felt/VBN extremely/RB strongly/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP always/RB voted/VBN against/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

Spurred/VBN on/IN by/IN Amnesty/NNP International/NNP and/CC others/NNS ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ decisions/NNS I/PRP took/VBD as/IN Governor/NNP of/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP was/VBD to/TO abolish/VB the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP what/WP happened/VBD recently/RB at/IN the/DT UN/NNP General/NNP Assembly/NNP ./.

We/PRP had/VBD to/TO freeze/VB our/PRP$ resolution/NN on/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN or/CC risk/VB the/DT passing/NN of/IN a/DT resolution/NN that/WDT would/MD have/VB incorporated/VBN wholly/RB unacceptable/JJ arguments/NNS that/WDT asserted/VBD that/IN human/JJ rights/NNS are/VBP not/RB universally/RB applicable/JJ and/CC valid/JJ ./.

The/DT New/NNP York/NNP stage/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN Geneva/NNP ./.

Last/JJ year/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP on/IN sovereignty/NN and/CC humanitarian/JJ intervention/NN was/VBD such/PDT a/DT sensitive/JJ topic/NN that/IN it/PRP influenced/VBD all/DT other/JJ issues/NNS ./.

It/PRP certainly/RB influenced/VBD the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT moratorium/NN on/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

The/DT debate/NN in/IN Geneva/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ more/RBR focused/JJ on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS issues/NNS ./.

We/PRP may/MD therefore/RB stand/VB a/DT better/JJR chance/NN of/IN making/VBG progress/NN there/RB ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, Cuba/NNP ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO address/VB this/DT issue/NN directly/RB because/IN we/PRP in/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP criticised/VBN unfairly/RB for/IN not/RB taking/VBG human/JJ rights/NNS there/RB sufficiently/RB seriously/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP extremely/RB concerned/JJ about/IN moves/NNS by/IN the/DT Cuban/JJ Government/NN over/IN the/DT last/JJ year/NN that/WDT have/VBP further/RBR curtailed/VBN public/JJ freedom/NN ,/, moves/NNS like/IN changes/NNS in/IN the/DT penal/JJ code/NN and/CC the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB worried/VBN by/IN the/DT recent/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN political/JJ detentions/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP monitoring/VBG the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS situation/NN through/IN the/DT reports/NNS of/IN NGOs/NNP and/CC the/DT work/NN of/IN our/PRP$ human/JJ rights/NNS working/VBG group/NN based/VBN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP embassies/NNS in/IN Havana/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP regularly/RB put/VBN our/PRP$ criticisms/NNS to/TO the/DT Cuban/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ done/VBN the/DT same/JJ ./.

But/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN the/DT right/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO try/VB to/TO isolate/VB Cuba/NNP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT fair/JJ and/CC open/JJ society/NN in/IN Cuba/NNP ,/, a/DT Cuba/NNP which/WDT respects/VBZ the/DT principles/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, the/DT sanctity/NN of/IN contract/NN and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO encourage/VB a/DT process/NN of/IN transition/NN to/TO democracy/NN and/CC respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC fundamental/JJ freedoms/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ views/NNS are/VBP exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT third/JJ subject/NN with/IN which/WDT I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO deal/VB ,/, namely/RB China/NNP ./.

Quite/VBG simply/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP us/PRP to/TO be/VB engaged/VBN with/IN China/NNP ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB self-indulgent/JJ and/CC self-defeating/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN insulting/JJ to/TO over/IN a/DT fifth/NN of/IN humanity/NN ,/, to/TO want/VB anything/NN else/RB ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO see/VB a/DT China/NNP transformed/VBN by/IN peaceful/JJ change/NN into/IN a/DT free/JJ pluralist/NN society/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB lock/VB up/RP democracy/NN activists/NNS or/CC religious/JJ believers/NNS ./.

So/RB what/WP should/MD we/PRP do/VB ?/.

Naturally/RB we/PRP should/MD trade/VB enthusiastically/RB with/IN China/NNP and/CC hope/VB that/IN we/PRP can/MD welcome/VB China/NNP into/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP on/IN sensible/JJ terms/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT misnomer/NN to/TO talk/VB about/IN a/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB include/VB China/NNP -/: or/CC Russia/NNP ,/, for/IN that/DT matter/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB today/NN ,/, nor/CC have/VB I/PRP ever/RB believed/VBN ,/, that/IN our/PRP$ burgeoning/VBG economic/JJ relationship/NN with/IN China/NNP -/: manifested/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, by/IN China/NNP '/POS s/VBN EUR/$ 25/CD billion/CD surplus/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP -/: should/MD silence/VB us/PRP when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO China/NNP '/POS s/NNP human/JJ rights/NNS record/NN ./.

For/IN me/PRP the/DT question/NN is/VBZ not/RB whether/IN we/PRP should/MD address/VB the/DT question/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN China/NNP -/: we/PRP have/VBP a/DT duty/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB and/CC a/DT legitimate/JJ interest/NN in/IN doing/VBG so/RB -/: but/CC rather/RB what/WP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS effective/JJ way/NN of/IN doing/VBG this/DT ?/.

So/RB what/WP should/MD be/VB our/PRP$ attitude/NN towards/IN a/DT Geneva/NNP resolution/NN this/DT year/NN ?/.

As/IN the/DT presidency/NN has/VBZ noted/VBN ,/, the/DT Union/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN is/VBZ considering/VBG its/PRP$ position/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP strongly/RB suggest/VBP there/EX are/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN factors/NNS of/IN which/WDT the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ought/MD to/TO take/VB proper/JJ account/NN ./.

First/RB ,/, while/IN some/DT people/NNS question/VBP whether/IN tabling/VBG a/DT Geneva/NNP resolution/NN makes/VBZ any/DT difference/NN ,/, several/JJ of/IN the/DT most/RBS distinguished/JJ Chinese/JJ advocates/NNS of/IN democracy/NN strongly/RB believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT valuable/JJ move/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS because/RB of/IN the/DT message/NN it/PRP sends/VBZ to/TO people/NNS in/IN China/NNP itself/PRP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT point/NN that/WDT deserves/VBZ serious/JJ consideration/NN ./.

Chinese/JJ leaders/NNS are/VBP in/IN no/DT doubt/NN about/IN our/PRP$ position/NN on/IN all/PDT these/DT issues/NNS and/CC on/IN developments/NNS in/IN Tibet/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP made/VBN our/PRP$ views/NNS very/RB clear/JJ to/TO them/PRP ./.

While/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN for/IN many/JJ people/NNS in/IN China/NNP there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT real/JJ long-term/JJ improvement/NN in/IN their/PRP$ economic/JJ prospects/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ liberties/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT dark/JJ side/NN to/TO the/DT picture/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Critics/NNS of/IN tabling/VBG a/DT resolution/NN say/VBP that/IN at/IN least/RBS we/PRP now/RB have/VBP a/DT human/JJ rights/NNS dialogue/NN with/IN China/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ true/JJ and/CC potentially/RB valuable/JJ ,/, although/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB -/: and/CC I/PRP have/VBP said/VBN to/TO Chinese/JJ officials/NNS as/IN has/VBZ the/DT presidency/NN -/: that/IN there/EX has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN nearly/RB as/RB much/JJ content/NN to/TO our/PRP$ dialogue/NN as/IN we/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN ./.

Of/IN course/NN the/DT dialogue/NN has/VBZ enabled/VBN us/PRP to/TO identify/VB and/CC implement/VB EU/JJ cooperation/NN programmes/NNS in/IN the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC legal/JJ spheres/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ very/RB welcome/JJ and/CC I/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ village/NN governance/NN programme/NN should/MD help/VB to/TO promote/VB democracy/NN at/IN grassroots/JJ level/NN ./.

Naturally/RB any/DT dialogue/NN as/RB complex/JJ as/IN the/DT one/NN on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT long-term/JJ process/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP could/MD point/VB to/TO more/JJR real/JJ gains/NNS ./.

The/DT next/JJ dialogue/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP on/IN 25/CD February/NNP will/MD be/VB an/DT important/JJ test/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD show/VB whether/IN the/DT dialogue/NN is/VBZ producing/VBG results/NNS or/CC not/RB ./.

What/WP ,/, finally/RB ,/, do/VBP we/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB as/IN the/DT first/JJ steps/NNS ?/.

Well/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB China/NNP move/NN from/IN signing/VBG the/DT UN/NNP Conventions/NNPS on/IN Civil/NNP and/CC Political/NNP Rights/NNPS and/CC on/IN Social/NNP and/CC Cultural/NNP Rights/NNPS toward/IN actually/RB ratifying/VBG them/PRP ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP we/PRP were/VBD closer/JJR to/TO that/DT ./.

Where/WRB does/VBZ all/DT that/DT leave/VB us/PRP this/DT year/NN ?/.

I/PRP repeat/VB that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS will/MD have/VB to/TO make/VB up/RP their/PRP$ minds/NNS ./.

What/WP I/PRP hope/VBP is/VBZ ,/, first/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP in/IN Europe/NNP will/MD adopt/VB a/DT common/JJ position/NN and/CC stick/VB to/TO it/PRP ,/, that/IN we/PRP will/MD not/RB allow/VB some/DT to/TO be/VB picked/VBN off/RP ,/, that/IN our/PRP$ position/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB based/VBN on/IN self-delusion/NN or/CC pretence/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT common/JJ position/NN and/CC a/DT sensible/JJ position/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN some/DT people/NNS say/VBP we/PRP must/MD have/VB a/DT better/JJR way/NN of/IN pressing/VBG our/PRP$ concern/NN about/IN human/JJ rights/NNS than/IN through/IN tabling/VBG resolutions/NNS ./.

But/CC if/IN that/DT is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, then/RB at/IN the/DT very/RB least/JJS we/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB more/RBR imaginative/JJ and/CC honest/JJ with/IN ourselves/PRP in/IN looking/VBG for/IN that/DT way/NN forward/RB ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO rest/VB our/PRP$ position/NN on/IN the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS dialogue/NN ,/, then/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO convince/VB you/PRP ,/, the/DT NGO/NNP community/NN and/CC the/DT public/NN at/IN large/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ actually/RB getting/VBG somewhere/RB ./.

That/DT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ judgement/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT challenge/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP grateful/JJ to/TO the/DT House/NNP for/IN its/PRP$ concern/NN about/IN human/JJ rights/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, and/CC particularly/RB in/IN China/NNP ./.

I/PRP only/RB need/VBP to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN we/PRP again/RB have/VBP salmon/NN in/IN the/DT Rhine/NNP ,/, which/WDT would/MD have/VB been/VBN unthinkable/JJ 20/CD years/NNS ago/RB and/CC that/IN salmon/NN are/VBP due/JJ to/TO be/VB released/VBN this/DT spring/NN in/IN the/DT Elbe/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD particularly/RB polluted/JJ ./.

That/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB still/RB have/VB huge/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO make/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB water/NN protection/NN yet/RB further/RBR and/CC maintain/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC ground/NN water/NN and/CC this/DT will/MD doubtless/RB cost/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN money/NN ./.

Farmers/NNP have/VBP voiced/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN concerns/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ days/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD only/RB farm/VB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP an/DT adequate/JJ supply/NN of/IN clean/JJ water/NN ./.

The/DT line/NN followed/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ group/NN for/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS with/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP will/MD allow/VB an/DT acceptable/JJ solution/NN to/TO be/VB found/VBN for/IN farmers/NNS too/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP horrified/VBN that/IN both/DT Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT public/NN have/VBP been/VBN misled/VBN by/IN false/JJ arguments/NNS in/IN this/DT difficult/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB highly/RB technical/JJ matter/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB extend/VBP my/PRP$ special/JJ thanks/NNS to/TO my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT group/NN who/WP helped/VBD us/PRP find/VBP compromises/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB extend/VBP my/PRP$ special/JJ thanks/NNS to/TO our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ,/, for/IN all/PDT her/PRP$ work/NN and/CC her/PRP$ cooperative/JJ attitude/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN we/PRP have/VBP agreed/VBN to/TO differ/VB on/IN certain/JJ points/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP also/RB thank/VBP the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, who/WP stood/VBD by/IN with/IN advice/NN and/CC expert/NN help/NN at/IN all/DT times/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP take/VBP an/DT equally/RB constructive/JJ approach/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP have/VBP no/DT doubt/NN that/IN together/RB we/PRP shall/MD find/VB an/DT even/RB better/JJR solution/NN to/TO the/DT problem/NN of/IN water/NN protection/NN in/IN Europe/NNP under/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN the/DT excellent/JJ work/NN which/WDT she/PRP has/VBZ presented/VBN and/CC on/IN her/PRP$ efforts/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN overcoming/VBG the/DT differences/NNS between/IN us/PRP with/IN regard/NN to/TO water/NN ./.

The/DT framework/NN directive/NN on/IN water/NN is/VBZ a/DT necessary/JJ initiative/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, given/VBN that/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN solidarity/NN is/VBZ central/JJ to/TO the/DT process/NN of/IN European/JJ construction/NN ,/, this/DT directive/NN must/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN water/NN resources/NNS should/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT factor/NN in/IN social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

Nobody/NN doubts/VBZ that/IN water/NN is/VBZ a/DT resource/NN of/IN interest/NN to/TO all/DT of/IN us/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN Spain/NNP and/CC the/DT other/JJ southern/JJ countries/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP an/DT unusual/JJ climate/NN ,/, the/DT management/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS require/VBP political/JJ action/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO rationalise/VB their/PRP$ use/NN and/CC other/JJ cooperative/NN measures/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT framework/NN directive/NN should/MD advocate/NN a/DT use/NN of/IN water/NN which/WDT allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO overcome/VB territorial/JJ imbalances/NNS and/CC ,/, to/TO this/DT end/NN ,/, I/PRP ask/VBP that/IN you/PRP support/VBP Amendment/NNP No/NNP 95/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN presented/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ group/NN ./.

We/PRP wish/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Article/NNP 1/CD of/IN the/DT directive/NN promotes/VBZ the/DT sustainable/JJ ,/, efficient/JJ ,/, fair/JJ and/CC considerate/JJ use/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP now/RB going/VBG to/TO briefly/RB discuss/VB the/DT main/JJ issues/NNS on/IN which/WDT the/DT Spanish/JJ Socialist/JJ delegation/NN differs/VBZ somewhat/RB from/IN certain/JJ positions/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN expressed/VBN here/RB ./.

One/CD example/NN is/VBZ water/NN transfers/NNS ./.

We/PRP would/MD prefer/VB the/DT future/JJ framework/NN directive/NN not/RB to/TO subject/VB the/DT implementation/NN of/IN transfers/NNS to/TO Community/NNP supervision/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS controversial/JJ points/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ debate/NN ,/, the/DT application/NN of/IN tariffs/NNS ,/, the/DT Spanish/NNP Socialists/NNPS have/VBP been/VBN arguing/VBG ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN that/IN the/DT polluter/NN should/MD pay/VB ,/, that/IN the/DT directive/NN should/MD propose/VB policies/NNS on/IN accessible/JJ prices/NNS for/IN all/DT levels/NNS of/IN consumption/NN ./.

In/IN Spain/NNP ,/, a/DT policy/NN of/IN full/JJ recuperation/NN of/IN water/NN costs/NNS would/MD clearly/RB not/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ effect/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT centre/NN and/CC north/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Spanish/NNP would/MD see/VB an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN water/NN for/IN its/PRP$ different/JJ uses/NNS ,/, owing/VBG to/TO the/DT scarcity/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS and/CC the/DT internalisation/NN of/IN the/DT environmental/JJ costs/NNS which/WDT will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB met/VBN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP therefore/RB always/RB argued/VBN for/IN a/DT progressive/JJ system/NN of/IN recuperation/NN of/IN costs/NNS ./.

This/DT system/NN should/MD take/VB good/JJ account/NN of/IN social/JJ ,/, environmental/JJ and/CC economic/JJ effects/NNS ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ implementation/NN should/MD be/VB modulated/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN differing/VBG geographical/NN and/CC climatic/JJ conditions/NNS ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO build/VB a/DT Europe/NNP with/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ and/CC healthy/JJ environment/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, an/DT environmental/JJ Europe/NNP can/MD not/RB ,/, in/IN any/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, be/VB built/VBN at/IN different/JJ speeds/NNS ,/, but/CC must/MD be/VB built/VBN from/IN a/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN solidarity/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT ecological/JJ disaster/NN in/IN the/DT Danube/NNP reminds/VBZ us/PRP of/IN how/WRB closely/RB linked/VBD all/PDT the/DT countries/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP and/CC how/WRB important/JJ water/NN is/VBZ to/TO us/PRP all/DT ./.

Discharges/NNS from/IN chemical/NN factories/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN in/IN the/DT north-west/NN of/IN England/NNP will/MD end/VB up/RP on/IN the/DT beaches/NNS of/IN mainland/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT brings/VBZ home/NN the/DT connections/NNS which/WDT bind/VBZ us/PRP together/RB ./.

This/DT framework/NN directive/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO paint/VB the/DT broad/JJ brushstrokes/NNS of/IN the/DT policy/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ decades/NNS and/CC there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN much/JJ panic/NN over/IN the/DT details/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO remember/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT framework/NN ./.

These/DT brushstrokes/NNS are/VBP indeed/RB very/RB broad/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ for/IN individual/JJ countries/NNS ,/, for/IN individual/JJ sectors/NNS of/IN industry/NN ,/, to/TO escape/VB the/DT effects/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN painted/VBN to/TO us/PRP in/IN recent/JJ days/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP many/JJ opportunities/NNS to/TO hide/VB ./.

The/DT reality/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT details/NNS of/IN this/DT legislation/NN will/MD be/VB set/VBN out/RP in/IN daughter/NN directives/NNS in/IN months/NNS and/CC years/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO debate/VB some/DT of/IN these/DT problems/NNS of/IN detail/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT chemical/JJ factory/NN in/IN the/DT north-west/NN which/WDT wrote/VBD to/TO me/PRP to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP must/MD vote/VB against/IN this/DT legislation/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO ask/VB them/PRP what/WP chemicals/NNS they/PRP are/VBP putting/VBG into/IN the/DT water/NN supply/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN and/CC why/WRB they/PRP are/VBP not/RB broadcasting/VBG to/TO all/PDT the/DT residents/NNS in/IN that/DT area/NN exactly/RB what/WP they/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/IN they/PRP prefer/VBP to/TO avoid/VB doing/VBG ./.

The/DT principle/NN also/RB concerns/VBZ water/NN charging/VBG ./.

The/DT basic/JJ understanding/NN which/WDT many/JJ of/IN us/PRP now/RB share/VBP is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO introduce/VB environmental/JJ taxation/NN to/TO encourage/VB conservation/NN ,/, to/TO use/VB the/DT carrot-and-stick/JJ approach/NN to/TO make/VB best/RBS use/NN of/IN our/PRP$ assets/NNS so/RB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB add/VB to/TO the/DT pollution/NN or/CC loss/NN of/IN a/DT valuable/JJ resource/NN like/IN water/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO refer/VB to/TO the/DT political/JJ position/NN here/RB ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN has/VBZ weakened/VBN the/DT stand/NN taken/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP at/IN first/JJ reading/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT NGOs/NNPS would/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT directive/NN as/RB now/RB framed/VBN is/VBZ worse/RBR than/IN useless/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT retrograde/JJ step/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO improve/VB the/DT situation/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB ourselves/PRP into/IN a/DT position/NN of/IN conciliation/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN vote/NN after/IN vote/NN lost/VBN ./.

Measure/NN after/IN measure/NN has/VBZ come/VBN out/RP of/IN the/DT Environment/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP failed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT environment/NN of/IN Europe/NNP has/VBZ failed/VBN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB into/IN that/DT conciliation/NN position/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP end/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT sensible/JJ ,/, balanced/JJ policy/NN of/IN real/JJ improvements/NNS at/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ cost/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, as/RB long/RB as/IN nearly/RB thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP made/VBD attempts/NNS to/TO draw/VB up/RP a/DT European/JJ water/NN policy/NN ./.

A/DT hundred/CD and/CC twenty-nine/JJ chemical/NN substances/NNS had/VBD to/TO be/VB regulated/VBN ./.

Eventually/RB ,/, standards/NNS were/VBD drawn/VBN up/RP for/IN only/RB a/DT dozen/NN or/CC so/RB substances/CD ./.

The/DT unanimity/JJ principle/NN was/VBD at/IN the/DT root/NN of/IN this/DT debacle/NN ./.

Some/RB seven/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, it/PRP still/RB looked/VBD like/IN the/DT European/JJ water/NN policy/NN was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB sacrificed/VBN on/IN the/DT altar/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

The/DT conservative/JJ government/NN leaders/NNS Messrs/NNPS Major/NNP and/CC Kohl/NNP decided/VBD in/IN a/DT cosy/RB fireside/JJ chat/NN at/IN the/DT Edinburgh/NNP Summit/NNP that/IN it/PRP was/VBD totally/RB unnecessary/JJ for/IN the/DT Spanish/NNP to/TO receive/VB drinking/NN water/NN supplies/NNS which/WDT were/VBD as/RB good/JJ as/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT Germans/NNP or/CC English/NNP ./.

This/DT sentiment/NN is/VBZ partly/RB reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN which/WDT came/VBD about/RP under/IN British/NNP Socialist/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

That/DT position/NN is/VBZ like/IN holey/JJ cheese/NN ,/, or/CC to/TO keep/VB it/PRP the/DT sphere/NN of/IN water/NN ,/, as/RB leaky/JJ as/IN a/DT sieve/NN ./.

It/PRP explains/VBZ the/DT ground/NN swell/NN of/IN amendments/NNS which/WDT were/VBD tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP :/: nearly/RB one/CD hundred/CD amendments/NNS for/IN the/DT second/JJ reading/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ unusual/JJ ,/, but/CC most/JJS of/IN these/DT amendments/NNS are/VBP desperately/RB needed/VBN to/TO plug/VB the/DT holes/NNS ./.

The/DT dangerous/JJ chemical/NN substances/NNS constitute/VBP a/DT big/JJ leak/NN ./.

The/DT chemical/JJ industry/NN and/CC ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT European/JJ Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP too/RB want/VBP to/TO draft/VB a/DT separate/JJ risk/NN analysis/NN for/IN each/DT dangerous/JJ substance/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB time-consuming/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, more/RBR importantly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT acceptable/JJ level/NN of/IN pollution/NN for/IN dangerous/JJ chemical/NN substances/NNS ./.

Only/RB the/DT background/NN level/NN of/IN the/DT ocean/NN is/VBZ acceptable/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP is/VBZ meant/VBN by/IN the/DT term/NN ``/`` close-to-zero/JJ ''/'' ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP already/RB has/VBZ a/DT list/NN of/IN 32/CD priority/NN substances/NNS ,/, many/DT of/IN which/WDT have/VBP a/DT hormone-deregulating/JJ effect/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP so-called/JJ endocrine/NN disrupters/NNS and/CC cause/NN ,/, even/RB in/IN extremely/RB minimal/JJ quantities/NNS ,/, changes/NNS in/IN the/DT gender/NN of/IN animals/NNS and/CC even/RB humans/NNS ,/, as/IN is/VBZ more/RBR and/CC more/RBR being/VBG ascertained/VBN by/IN scientists/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP declares/VBZ itself/PRP openly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT OSPAR/JJ objective/NN of/IN close-to-zero/NN by/IN the/DT year/NN 2020/CD ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB two/CD substances/NNS from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ list/NN :/: mercury/NN and/CC tributyl/NN ,/, abbreviated/VBD to/TO TBT/NNP ./.

On/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT Wadden/NNP Sea/NNP ,/, the/DT values/NNS of/IN mercury/NN and/CC TBT/NN are/VBP higher/JJR than/IN the/DT OSPAR/JJ value/NN ,/, to/TO wit/NN ,/, ten/CD and/CC one/CD thousand/CD times/NNS ,/, respectively/RB ./.

The/DT chemical/JJ industry/NN and/CC society/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN have/VBP to/TO learn/VB to/TO replace/VB these/DT dangerous/JJ chemical/NN substances/NNS by/IN harmless/JJ substitutes/NNS ,/, and/CC if/IN this/DT is/VBZ impossible/JJ ,/, to/TO apply/VB them/PRP in/IN closed/VBN systems/NNS ./.

For/IN the/DT substance/NN TBT/NN ,/, this/DT means/VBZ that/IN it/PRP can/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB used/VBN as/IN an/DT anti-fouling/JJ substance/NN ./.

A/DT sound/JJ alternative/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO clean/VB the/DT ship/NN '/POS s/JJ sides/NNS mechanically/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO finish/VB off/RP by/IN expressing/VBG the/DT hope/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD pick/VB up/RB once/RB again/RB its/PRP$ green/JJ image/NN and/CC will/MD argue/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT close-to-zero/JJ option/NN for/IN dangerous/JJ chemical/NN and/CC hormone-deregulating/NN substances/NNS by/IN the/DT year/NN 2020/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT Water/NNP Directive/NNP ./.

The/DT Council/NNP 's/POS common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ totally/RB inadequate/JJ in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN areas/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, our/PRP$ task/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB the/DT requirements/NNS in/IN the/DT directive/NN tighter/JJR and/CC more/RBR concrete/JJ ./.

As/IN members/NNS of/IN the/DT Confederal/NNP Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP United/NNP Left/Nordic/NNP Green/NNP Left/NNP ,/, we/PRP regarded/VBD certain/JJ principles/NNS as/IN particularly/RB important/JJ when/WRB we/PRP adopted/VBD a/DT position/NN on/IN the/DT different/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT time-frame/NN for/IN implementing/VBG the/DT proposed/VBN measures/NNS should/MD be/VB shorter/JJR than/IN that/DT proposed/VBD by/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB support/VBP the/DT proposal/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT time/NN allotted/VBN for/IN implementing/VBG different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB the/DT phasing/NN out/RB of/IN noxious/JJ materials/NNS to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP consistently/RB ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT initial/JJ delay/NN to/TO allow/VB new/JJ evaluation/NN criteria/NNS to/TO be/VB developed/VBN before/IN the/DT measures/NNS are/VBP implemented/VBN ./.

The/DT legislation/NN should/MD also/RB have/VB written/VBN into/IN it/PRP the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT international/JJ conventions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT OSPAR/NNP Convention/NNP must/MD be/VB respected/JJ ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD like/VB a/DT clear/JJ statement/NN regarding/VBG the/DT pricing/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT basic/JJ principle/NN must/MD be/VB that/IN the/DT price/NN should/MD represent/VB the/DT real/JJ cost/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN used/VBN ./.

Nowadays/RB ,/, taxpayers/NNS often/RB have/VBP to/TO subsidise/VB industry/NN and/CC farming/NN ./.

The/DT obvious/JJ point/NN of/IN departure/NN for/IN legislation/NN should/MD be/VB that/IN polluters/NNS or/CC consumers/NNS pay/VB ,/, although/IN exemptions/NNS would/MD be/VB permitted/VBN in/IN extreme/JJ cases/NNS ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD like/VB exemptions/NNS from/IN the/DT rules/NNS on/IN water/NN status/NN to/TO be/VB kept/VBN to/TO a/DT minimum/NN and/CC clearly/RB defined/VBN ./.

Fifthly/RB ,/, the/DT protection/NN of/IN groundwater/NN status/NN and/CC measures/NNS against/IN persistent/JJ pollution/NN of/IN the/DT groundwater/NN should/MD be/VB transparent/JJ and/CC clear/JJ ./.

Against/IN that/DT background/NN ,/, our/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ,/, the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, as/RB adopted/VBN in/IN committee/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB the/DT scope/NN of/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN points/NNS extended/VBN ./.

We/PRP will/MD therefore/RB vote/VB for/IN the/DT Greens/NNP '/POS Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 102/CD ,/, 103/CD and/CC 104/CD ,/, which/WDT we/PRP consider/VBP to/TO be/VB improvements/NNS on/IN the/DT present/JJ position/NN ./.

As/IN regards/JJ pricing/NN policy/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP sometimes/RB extreme/JJ cases/NNS which/WDT may/MD require/VB derogations/NNS from/IN the/DT principles/NNS laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

My/PRP$ own/JJ view/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT options/NNS for/IN allowing/VBG derogations/NNS had/VBD already/RB been/VBN given/VBN proper/JJ attention/NN in/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 43/CD ,/, tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT committee/NN and/CC been/VBN even/RB more/RBR clearly/RB set/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT Greens/NNP '/POS Amendment/NNP No/NNP 105/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB see/VB any/DT need/NN for/IN other/JJ derogations/NNS besides/IN those/DT specified/VBN in/IN the/DT two/CD amendments/NNS just/RB mentioned/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, some/DT people/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ political/JJ group/NN think/VBP otherwise/RB ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, Amendment/NNP No/NNP 107/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT same/JJ question/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN tabled/VBN by/IN one/CD section/NN of/IN our/PRP$ group/NN only/RB ./.

On/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT committee/NN 's/POS proposals/NNS set/VBD out/RP in/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP 's/POS report/NN and/CC think/VBP they/PRP could/MD provide/VB a/DT good/JJ basis/NN for/IN a/DT hard-won/JJ compromise/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, every/DT satellite/NN photo/NN proves/VBZ that/IN we/PRP do/VBP indeed/RB live/VB on/IN the/DT blue/JJ planet/NN ,/, yet/CC the/DT abundance/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ an/DT illusion/NN ./.

The/DT recent/JJ disaster/NN on/IN the/DT Danube/NNP serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT reminder/NN that/IN our/PRP$ rivers/NNS are/VBP the/DT lifelines/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ planet/NN and/CC that/IN pollution/NN does/VBZ not/RB respect/VB borders/NNS ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ a/DT renewable/JJ but/CC limited/JJ natural/JJ resource/NN ./.

It/PRP becomes/VBZ scarcer/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ mismanaged/VBN and/CC when/WRB the/DT geographical/JJ and/CC climatic/JJ conditions/NNS are/VBP unfavourable/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ issue/NN in/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP region/NN and/CC also/RB in/IN other/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG the/DT gradual/JJ drying/NN of/IN wet/JJ areas/NNS ./.

The/DT increase/NN in/IN vulnerable/JJ areas/NNS ,/, both/DT wet/JJ and/CC dry/JJ ,/, inequalities/NNS between/IN countries/NNS ,/, inequalities/NNS between/IN different/JJ regions/NNS within/IN countries/NNS and/CC unusual/JJ climatic/JJ ,/, economic/JJ ,/, geographical/JJ and/CC geological/JJ events/NNS are/VBP all/PDT the/DT evidence/NN we/PRP need/VBP ./.

However/RB ,/, these/DT must/MD not/RB lead/VB to/TO competition/NN distortions/NNS within/IN the/DT Community/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP therefore/RB tabled/VBN amendments/NNS to/TO highlight/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT special/JJ relationship/NN between/IN agriculture/NN and/CC water/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN water/NN is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ factor/NN in/IN the/DT occupation/NN and/CC development/NN of/IN the/DT land/NN ./.

Agricultural/NNP needs/NNS are/VBP clearly/RB much/RB greater/JJR in/IN the/DT south/NN and/CC this/DT specific/JJ point/NN must/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN in/IN the/DT framework/NN directive/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/JJ in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS that/IN solutions/NNS to/TO these/DT problems/NNS are/VBP being/VBG sought/VBN ./.

Last/JJ October/NNP in/IN Turin/NNP ,/, the/DT countries/NNS in/IN the/DT Euro-Mediterranean/NNP Partnership/NNP bluntly/RB demanded/VBD a/DT Marshall/NNP plan/NN for/IN water/NN for/IN the/DT south/JJ coast/NN of/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB ,/, fortunately/RB ,/, at/IN this/DT point/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP in/IN Europe/NNP experiencing/VBG droughts/NNS and/CC desertification/NN in/IN certain/JJ regions/NNS and/CC also/RB floods/NNS ,/, which/WDT the/DT directive/NN underlines/VBZ ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, France/NNP ,/, the/DT Rhine/JJ valley/NN and/CC central/JJ Europe/NNP recently/RB suffered/VBD flooding/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP this/DT framework/NN directive/NN as/IN an/DT essential/JJ element/NN of/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ development/NN policy/NN which/WDT must/MD make/VB the/DT various/JJ uses/NNS of/IN water/NN compatible/JJ with/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.

Yet/CC we/PRP also/RB need/VBP to/TO integrate/VB the/DT protection/NN and/CC conservation/NN of/IN biodiversity/NN into/IN this/DT new/JJ management/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

The/DT water/NN issue/NN will/MD definitely/RB not/RB be/VB settled/VBN today/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT problems/NNS of/IN enlargement/NN and/CC climate/NN change/NN will/MD offer/VB new/JJ prospects/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB likely/JJ that/IN ,/, during/IN this/DT century/NN ,/, good-quality/JJ water/NN will/MD be/VB of/IN even/RB more/RBR strategic/JJ importance/NN than/IN oil/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ enough/JJ reason/NN to/TO thank/VB Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP for/IN the/DT efforts/NNS she/PRP has/VBZ made/VBN to/TO obtain/VB sound/JJ surface/NN water/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ rather/RB complicated/VBN to/TO attain/VB a/DT proper/JJ European/JJ legislative/JJ framework/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT framework/NN directive/NN on/IN water/NN policy/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP hoping/VBG to/TO end/VB the/DT fragmentation/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ water/NN legislation/NN ./.

But/CC that/DT has/VBZ not/RB dismissed/VBN us/PRP from/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN drawing/VBG up/RP an/DT extensive/JJ and/CC complicated/JJ directive/NN which/WDT will/MD require/VB great/JJ care/NN in/IN its/PRP$ implementation/NN from/IN the/DT executive/JJ bodies/NNS ./.

More/RBR specifically/RB ,/, the/DT possibilities/NNS for/IN adopting/VBG a/DT specific/JJ policy/NN by/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC water/NN boards/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN set/VBN up/RP thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT catchment/JJ basin/NN approach/NN ,/, need/VBP to/TO be/VB maximised/VBN ./.

The/DT key/JJ goals/NNS remain/VBP the/DT prevention/NN from/IN further/JJ pollution/NN of/IN ground/NN and/CC surface/NN water/NN ,/, the/DT protection/NN of/IN eco/NN systems/NNS ,/, the/DT promotion/NN of/IN the/DT sustainable/JJ use/NN of/IN water/NN ,/, the/DT control/NN of/IN floods/NNS and/CC droughts/NNS and/CC the/DT termination/NN of/IN discharging/VBG dangerous/JJ substances/NNS into/IN surface/NN water/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT discharge/NN of/IN these/DT dangerous/JJ substances/NNS is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN the/DT Councils/NNPS '/POS objectives/NNS lack/VBP both/DT commitment/NN and/CC ambition/NN ./.

The/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP '/POS s/JJ present/JJ proposal/NN to/TO reduce/VB discharges/NNS to/TO close-to-zero/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN and/CC worthy/JJ of/IN emulation/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN attention/NN must/MD be/VB paid/VBN to/TO its/PRP$ viability/NN ./.

Consideration/NNP must/MD then/RB be/VB given/VBN to/TO natural/JJ background/NN emissions/NNS which/WDT can/MD not/RB be/VB influenced/VBN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN diffused/JJ emissions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP difficult/JJ to/TO control/VB ,/, and/CC which/WDT pollute/VB the/DT water/NN quite/RB substantially/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO get/VB used/VBN to/TO the/DT idea/NN in/IN the/DT 21st/JJ century/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO show/VB water/NN a/DT completely/RB new/JJ respect/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT 20th/JJ century/NN ,/, water/NN was/VBD merely/RB a/DT free/JJ evacuation/NN and/CC disposal/NN system/NN for/IN poisonous/JJ substances/NNS ,/, special/JJ waste/NN ,/, chemicals/NNS and/CC so/RB on/RB ./.

And/CC we/PRP can/MD already/RB see/VB the/DT consequences/NNS !/. ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO rethink/VB and/CC recognise/VB that/IN water/NN is/VBZ our/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ asset/NN and/CC that/IN our/PRP$ responsibility/NN towards/IN it/PRP goes/VBZ far/RB beyond/IN the/DT present/JJ generation/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD make/VB a/DT rapid/JJ ,/, strong/JJ and/CC united/JJ response/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN to/TO hear/VB your/PRP$ discussion/NN with/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ President/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Poettering/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ very/RB embarrassed/JJ today/NN at/IN the/DT dirty/JJ deal/NN that/IN government/NN has/VBZ done/VBN in/IN forming/VBG such/PDT an/DT alliance/NN ./.

So/IN our/PRP$ response/NN must/MD be/VB rapid/JJ and/CC strong/JJ ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT Treaty/NNP provides/VBZ us/PRP with/IN a/DT barrier/NN when/WRB things/NNS become/VBP intolerable/JJ ;/: I/PRP was/VBD almost/RB going/VBG to/TO say/VB `/`` irreparable/JJ '/'' ./.

History/NN has/VBZ taught/VBN us/PRP that/IN Fascists/NNP start/VBP to/TO blow/VB hot/JJ and/CC cold/JJ :/: using/VBG heated/JJ words/NNS first/RB ,/, in/IN populist/JJ ,/, xenophobic/JJ speeches/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB cool/VB words/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB themselves/PRP acceptable/JJ to/TO institutions/NNS and/CC to/TO infiltrate/VB them/PRP gradually/RB ,/, poisoning/NN them/PRP ,/, until/IN the/DT day/NN they/PRP start/VBP to/TO take/VB action/NN ./.

And/CC when/WRB that/DT day/NN comes/VBZ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB late/JJ ./.

So/IN our/PRP$ Treaty/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN provision/NN for/IN barriers/NNS for/IN the/DT time/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB late/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP are/VBP not/RB at/IN that/DT point/NN :/: today/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO take/VB steps/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB to/TO that/DT point/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD therefore/RB find/VB a/DT political/JJ solution/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ response/NN must/MD be/VB rapid/JJ ./.

If/IN today/NN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB staunchly/RB support/VB the/DT Council/NN ,/, then/RB history/NN will/MD judge/VB us/PRP ,/, saying/VBG that/IN we/PRP achieved/VBD the/DT political/JJ equivalent/NN of/IN the/DT Munich/NNP Agreement/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, in/IN Austria/NNP ,/, the/DT will/NN of/IN the/DT large/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS is/VBZ being/VBG respected/VBN and/CC that/IN this/DT formation/NN of/IN government/NN constitutes/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ eyes/NNS ,/, a/DT huge/JJ victory/NN for/IN democracy/NN ./.

Let/VB there/EX be/VB no/DT doubt/NN about/IN it/PRP :/: we/PRP decline/VBP with/IN thanks/NNS a/DT Europe/NNP which/WDT develops/VBZ into/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN ``/`` big/JJ brother/NN ''/'' and/CC which/WDT keeps/VBZ watch/VB over/RP left-wing/JJ political/JJ correctness/NNS in/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP or/CC another/DT in/IN a/DT Stalinist/JJ way/NN and/CC using/VBG Stalinist/JJ methods/NNS ./.

European/JJ democracy/NN and/CC Austrian/JJ democracy/NN should/MD not/RB receive/VB any/DT lessons/NNS from/IN anybody/NN and/CC certainly/RB not/RB from/IN a/DT Belgian/JJ Government/NN that/WDT embraces/VBZ corrupt/JJ parties/NNS financed/VBN by/IN arms/NNS dealers/NNS and/CC that/DT appointed/VBD the/DT leader/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT corrupt/JJ party/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD condemned/VBN by/IN the/DT court/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT post/NN of/IN European/NNP Commissioner/NNP ./.

Today/NN ,/, we/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Austrian/JJ people/NNS for/IN this/DT democratic/JJ triumph/NN which/WDT is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO all/DT nations/NNS within/IN Europe/NNP and/CC to/TO anyone/NN who/WP feels/VBZ particularly/RB strongly/RB about/IN freedom/NN and/CC freedom/NN of/IN speech/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT debate/NN was/VBD opened/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Da/NNP Costa/NNP ,/, who/WP merely/RB confirms/VBZ that/IN the/DT EU/NNP presidency/NN is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO influence/VB the/DT composition/NN of/IN a/DT government/NN of/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT debate/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT background/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, reinforced/VBD the/DT point/NN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP itself/PRP are/VBP dominated/VBN by/IN Socialists/NNPS ./.

My/PRP$ delegation/NN of/IN 37/CD Conservative/JJ and/CC Unionist/JJ Members/NNS from/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP reject/VBP absolutely/RB the/DT underlying/JJ philosophy/NN ,/, programme/NN and/CC tone/NN of/IN Austria/NNP '/POS s/NNP Freedom/NNP Party/NNP ./.

We/PRP share/VBP the/DT widespread/JJ outrage/NN at/IN its/PRP$ attitude/NN to/TO history/NN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ World/NNP War/NNP II/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB its/PRP$ policies/NNS on/IN enlargement/NN ,/, on/IN immigration/NN ,/, on/IN race/NN and/CC its/PRP$ attitude/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP itself/PRP ./.

We/PRP were/VBD also/RB outraged/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT tolerance/NN of/IN the/DT left/NN for/IN the/DT tyranny/NN ,/, the/DT terror/NN and/CC the/DT excesses/NNS of/IN the/DT former/JJ USSR/NN ./.

Even/RB today/NN ,/, surely/RB it/PRP is/VBZ high/JJ time/NN for/IN the/DT Party/NNP of/IN European/JJ Socialists/NNS to/TO break/VB their/PRP$ fraternal/JJ links/NNS with/IN China/NNP '/POS s/NNP Communist/NNP Party/NNP ./.

Not/RB a/DT word/NN was/VBD said/VBN by/IN these/DT same/JJ EU/CD governments/NNS about/IN coalition/NN governments/NNS involving/VBG fellow-travelling/JJ communists/NNS in/IN French/JJ or/CC Italian/JJ governments/NNS ,/, or/CC in/IN German/JJ state/NN governments/NNS ,/, or/CC even/RB the/DT British/JJ government/NN '/'' s/VBZ willingness/JJ to/TO promote/VB those/DT with/IN terrorist/JJ associations/NNS as/IN ministers/NNS in/IN Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP today/NN ./.

This/DT ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT hypocrisy/NN of/IN the/DT left/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD recognise/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT democratic/JJ process/NN sometimes/RB produces/VBZ uncomfortable/JJ results/NNS ./.

This/DT requires/VBZ action/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT underlying/VBG causes/NNS ,/, including/VBG an/DT examination/NN of/IN the/DT electoral/JJ process/NN itself/PRP ./.

That/DT should/MD be/VB our/PRP$ task/NN ,/, not/RB political/JJ posturing/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Representative/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, a/DT week/NN ago/IN ,/, the/DT big/JJ international/JJ Holocaust/NN Conference/NN ended/VBD in/IN Stockholm/NNP ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB an/DT insult/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN behind/IN this/DT conference/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN to/TO invite/VB ,/, at/IN this/DT time/NN ,/, into/IN the/DT institutions/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, a/DT xenophobic/JJ party/NN which/WDT flirts/VBZ with/IN Nazi/JJ ideas/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP must/MD be/VB consistent/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ behaviour/NN and/CC in/IN our/PRP$ evaluations/NNS ./.

We/PRP demand/VBP of/IN the/DT candidate/NN States/NNS and/CC of/IN the/DT countries/NNS with/IN which/WDT the/DT EU/NNP cooperates/VBZ under/IN the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Agreement/NNP that/IN they/PRP should/MD respect/VB human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC show/VB tolerance/NN towards/IN their/PRP$ neighbours/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ as/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP ourselves/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP reacting/VBG against/IN this/DT carry-on/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB acceptable/JJ to/TO continue/VB as/RB if/IN nothing/NN had/VBD happened/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP at/IN a/DT watershed/NN in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ not/RB only/JJ an/DT economic/JJ community/NN but/CC also/RB a/DT community/NN of/IN values/NNS ,/, something/NN which/WDT we/PRP take/VBP seriously/RB ./.

Something/NN has/VBZ happened/VBN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN finding/VBG its/PRP$ soul/NN and/CC getting/VBG some/DT steel/NN in/IN its/PRP$ spine/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN everyone/NN has/VBZ said/VBN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ day/NN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ meeting/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT meeting/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ institutions/NNS ,/, with/IN Austria/NNP or/CC Mr/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ party/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT meeting/NN of/IN Europe/NNP with/IN itself/PRP ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ raison/JJ d'/NN 脙陋tre/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP here/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP ./.

The/DT Austrian/JJ Freedom/NNP Party/NNP leader/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Haider/NNP ,/, has/VBZ repeatedly/RB repudiated/VBN these/DT values/NNS ./.

We/PRP made/VBD explicit/JJ reference/NN yesterday/NN morning/NN in/IN our/PRP$ statement/NN ,/, as/IN did/VBD the/DT President/NNP this/DT afternoon/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP share/VBP the/DT concern/NN demonstrated/VBD by/IN fourteen/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN their/PRP$ statement/NN on/IN Monday/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT complacency/NN ,/, no/DT fragility/NN and/CC no/DT ambiguity/NN about/IN any/DT of/IN that/DT at/IN all/DT ./.

Anyone/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, who/WP invites/VBZ Franz/NNP Fischler/NNP to/TO his/PRP$ house/NN to/TO somehow/RB account/VB for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN his/PRP$ nationality/NN is/VBZ Austrian/JJ ,/, should/MD examine/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ motives/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT debate/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN necessarily/RB shadowed/VBN by/IN references/NNS to/TO xenophobia/NN and/CC even/RB more/RBR lethal/JJ evils/NNS in/IN this/DT world/NN ./.

I/PRP say/VBP that/DT in/IN friendship/NN and/CC honour/NN to/TO my/PRP$ friend/NN and/CC colleague/NN ,/, Franz/NNP Fischler/NNP ./.

That/DT surely/RB is/VBZ in/IN everyone/NN '/POS s/JJ interests/NNS ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP is/VBZ upheld/VBN and/CC that/IN we/PRP sustain/VB what/WP was/VBD described/VBN as/IN the/DT Community/NNP machine/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP following/VBG the/DT course/NN of/IN action/NN which/WDT was/VBD set/VBN down/RP in/IN our/PRP$ statement/NN yesterday/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO do/VB that/DT ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, without/IN fear/NN or/CC favour/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ our/PRP$ duty/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN conviction/NN ./.

My/PRP$ final/JJ point/NN is/VBZ this/DT ./.

We/PRP understand/VBP the/DT context/NN of/IN this/DT essential/JJ debate/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP several/JJ people/NNS here/RB who/WP like/VBP myself/PRP for/IN many/JJ years/NNS past/NN have/VBP become/VBN familiar/JJ with/IN Herr/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ offensive/NN statements/NNS ,/, the/DT xenophobia/NN of/IN many/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ policy/NN elements/NNS and/CC the/DT strategy/NN that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ developed/VBN of/IN alternating/VBG aggressive/JJ statements/NNS with/IN apologies/NNS ,/, sometimes/RB on/IN successive/JJ days/NNS ./.

We/PRP understand/VBP that/DT ,/, and/CC we/PRP recall/VBP too/RB the/DT sometimes/RB short/JJ and/CC selective/JJ memory/NN that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ of/IN Nazism/NNP ./.

And/CC ,/, when/WRB we/PRP recall/VBP that/DT ,/, like/IN many/JJ others/NNS on/IN all/DT sides/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ and/CC my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS '/POS instincts/NNS are/VBP naturally/RB aroused/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ to/TO act/VB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN values/NNS and/CC law/NN and/CC not/RB only/RB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN instinct/NN ./.

And/CC that/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP came/VBD to/TO the/DT conclusion/NN we/PRP reached/VBD yesterday/NN morning/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP sustain/VB that/DT conclusion/NN as/IN we/PRP continue/VBP to/TO uphold/VB the/DT values/NNS and/CC the/DT law/NN ./.

Without/IN fragility/NN ,/, without/IN complacency/NN ,/, without/IN ambiguity/VBZ ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT service/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ Union/NNP and/CC every/DT Member/NNP State/NNP of/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ people/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO do/VB that/DT with/IN energy/NN and/CC with/IN consistency/NN and/CC as/IN Mr/NNP Cox/NNP said/VBN in/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, `/`` necessarily/RB with/IN acute/JJ vigilance/NN '/'' ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP just/RB had/VBN a/DT great/JJ political/JJ debate/NN ,/, equal/JJ to/TO the/DT situation/NN and/CC to/TO what/WP could/MD be/VB expected/VBN of/IN it/PRP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ./.

The/DT debate/NN on/IN topical/JJ and/CC urgent/JJ subjects/NNS of/IN major/JJ importance/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN 11/CD a.m./RB tomorrow/NN ./.

Recourse/VB to/TO the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN on/IN recourse/NN to/TO the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO start/VB by/IN saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO be/VB presenting/VBG this/DT communication/NN on/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN written/VBN together/RB with/IN David/NNP Byrne/NNP and/CC Erkki/NNP Liikanen/NNP ./.

The/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT new/JJ concept/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN used/VBN by/IN the/DT Community/NNP for/IN some/DT time/NN now/RB in/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN policy/NN areas/NNS ,/, environmental/JJ ,/, human/NN ,/, animal/NN and/CC plant/NN health/NN ;/: and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ explicitly/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN the/DT EC/NNP Treaty/NNP since/IN Maastricht/NNP ./.

It/PRP also/RB appears/VBZ in/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN international/JJ texts/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT Rio/NNP Declaration/NNP and/CC most/RBS recently/RB the/DT Bio-Safety/NNP Protocol/NNP ./.

The/DT essence/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ ./.

It/PRP involves/VBZ taking/VBG action/NN in/IN a/DT given/VBN policy/NN area/NN when/WRB the/DT science/NN is/VBZ not/RB clear/JJ ,/, but/CC where/WRB there/EX are/VBP reasonable/JJ grounds/NNS for/IN concern/NN that/IN the/DT potential/JJ risks/NNS are/VBP big/JJ enough/RB to/TO require/VB action/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN has/VBZ been/VBN increasingly/RB in/IN the/DT spotlight/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.

Events/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT BSE/NN and/CC dioxin/NN crisis/NN have/VBP stimulated/VBN a/DT growing/VBG public/JJ debate/NN about/IN the/DT circumstances/NNS in/IN which/WDT precautionary/JJ action/NN is/VBZ justified/JJ and/CC necessary/JJ ./.

In/IN view/NN of/IN this/DT growing/VBG interest/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP therefore/RB considered/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB useful/JJ to/TO present/VB a/DT communication/NN to/TO set/VB out/RP its/PRP$ position/NN on/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

The/DT basic/JJ aim/NN of/IN the/DT communication/NN is/VBZ twofold/VBN ./.

To/TO explain/VB in/IN a/DT clear/JJ and/CC coherent/JJ way/NN how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP applies/VBZ ,/, and/CC intends/VBZ to/TO apply/VB ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN in/IN its/PRP$ management/NN of/IN risk/NN and/CC to/TO set/VB out/RP guidelines/NNS for/IN its/PRP$ application/NN based/VBN on/IN reasoned/JJ and/CC coherent/JJ principles/NNS ./.

We/PRP also/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT communication/NN will/MD help/VB to/TO build/VB a/DT better/JJR common/JJ understanding/NN of/IN how/WRB to/TO manage/VB risks/NNS and/CC to/TO dispel/VB fears/NNS that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN might/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN an/DT arbitrary/JJ way/NN or/CC as/IN a/DT disguised/VBN form/NN of/IN trade/NN protectionism/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ starting/VBG point/NN in/IN applying/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO ensure/VB a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN protection/NN in/IN the/DT fields/NNS of/IN environmental/JJ ,/, human/JJ ,/, animal/NN and/CC plant/NN health/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, this/DT objective/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO justify/VB irrational/JJ or/CC arbitrary/JJ measures/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ mean/VB that/IN action/NN can/MD still/RB be/VB taken/VBN even/RB in/IN situations/NNS where/WRB the/DT science/NN is/VBZ unclear/JJ ./.

As/IN such/JJ ,/, while/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN does/VBZ not/RB involve/VB the/DT politicisation/NN of/IN science/NN ,/, as/IN some/DT have/VBP alleged/VBN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ take/VB us/PRP to/TO the/DT crossroads/NNS between/IN science/NN and/CC politics/NNS ./.

The/DT initial/JJ decision/NN to/TO apply/VB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN depends/VBZ largely/RB on/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN protection/NN sought/VBN and/CC the/DT level/NN of/IN risk/NN that/IN decision-makers/NNS are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO accept/VB for/IN society/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB political/JJ by/IN nature/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT measures/NNS that/WDT may/MD subsequently/RB be/VB taken/VBN must/MD obviously/RB comply/VB with/IN the/DT general/JJ principles/NNS applicable/JJ to/TO risk/NN management/NN and/CC the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN applying/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN are/VBP therefore/RB the/DT key/JJ element/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN ./.

Measures/NNS taken/VBN must/MD be/VB proportional/JJ to/TO the/DT chosen/VBN level/NN of/IN protection/NN -/: that/DT is/VBZ ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB use/VB the/DT sledgehammer/NN to/TO crack/VB a/DT nut/NN ./.

They/PRP must/MD be/VB non-discriminatory/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ application/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ measures/NNS should/MD not/RB differentiate/VB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN geographical/JJ origin/NN ./.

And/CC they/PRP must/MD be/VB consistent/JJ with/IN similar/JJ measures/NNS already/RB taken/VBN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, if/IN one/CD product/NN has/VBZ been/VBN approved/VBN ,/, similar/JJ products/NNS should/MD also/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

All/PDT these/DT elements/NNS have/VBP to/TO apply/VB cumulatively/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN measures/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB taken/VBN in/IN applying/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT research/NN programme/NN ,/, public/JJ information/NN campaigns/NNS ,/, recommendations/VBZ and/CC so/RB on/IN ./.

Applying/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN does/VBZ not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, automatically/RB imply/VBP a/DT ban/NN ./.

This/DT communication/NN does/VBZ not/RB pretend/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT final/JJ word/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ;/: however/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ presented/VBN a/DT structured/JJ presentation/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN and/CC its/PRP$ operational/JJ use/NN ./.

By/IN setting/VBG out/RP in/IN some/DT detail/NN how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP applies/VBZ ,/, and/CC intends/VBZ to/TO apply/VB ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ,/, we/PRP hope/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO clarify/VB the/DT situation/NN at/IN Community/NNP level/NN and/CC to/TO contribute/VB to/TO the/DT ongoing/JJ debate/NN at/IN European/JJ and/CC international/JJ level/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, thank/VBP you/PRP very/RB much/JJ for/IN your/PRP$ statement/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP three/CD short/JJ questions/NNS ,/, the/DT first/JJ being/NN as/IN follows/VBZ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN awaiting/VBG a/DT common/JJ communication/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN for/IN a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN now/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD anything/NN but/CC clear/JJ in/IN the/DT past/NN as/IN to/TO whether/IN the/DT Commission/NNP speaks/VBZ with/IN one/CD voice/NN ./.

Does/NNP the/DT document/NN you/NN have/VB presented/VBN here/RB today/NN also/RB accord/VBN with/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN your/PRP$ colleagues/NNS the/DT Commissioners/NNPS for/IN Industry/NNP ,/, Foreign/NNP Trade/NNP ,/, Competition/NN and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ?/.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN your/PRP$ answer/NN to/TO this/DT will/MD be/VB ``/`` yes/JJ ''/'' but/CC I/PRP would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ if/IN you/PRP could/MD tell/VB me/PRP if/IN these/DT gentlemen/NNS are/VBP also/RB aware/JJ as/RB to/TO what/WP the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB ?/.

My/PRP$ next/JJ question/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP ,/, is/VBZ when/WRB will/MD you/PRP begin/VB to/TO apply/VB this/DT principle/NN to/TO legislation/NN ;/: to/TO legislation/NN pertaining/VBG to/TO chemicals/NNS or/CC other/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ?/.

In/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, water/NN protection/NN is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT social/JJ question/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT decisive/JJ social/JJ question/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT polluter/NN pays/VBZ principle/NN must/MD be/VB applied/VBN more/RBR rigorously/JJ as/IN otherwise/RB we/PRP all/RB bear/VB the/DT consequences/NNS ./.

Given/VBN the/DT advanced/JJ state/NN of/IN pollution/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ not/RB just/RB to/TO maintain/VB the/DT status/NN quo/NN but/CC to/TO ensure/VB during/IN the/DT vote/NN tomorrow/NN that/IN we/PRP achieve/VB genuine/JJ quality/NN improvements/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB some/DT six/CD years/NNS ago/RB now/RB that/IN Mr/NNP Karl-Heinz/NNP Florenz/NNP ,/, assisted/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Ursula/NNP Schleicher/NNP ,/, put/VBD in/IN a/DT request/NN and/CC managed/VBD to/TO overhaul/VB the/DT water/NN policy/NN in/IN its/PRP$ entirety/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT easy/JJ topic/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT efforts/NNS made/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP are/VBP very/RB laudable/JJ indeed/RB ./.

The/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN concerning/VBG this/DT framework/NN directive/NN on/IN water/NN has/VBZ reached/VBN a/DT crucial/JJ stage/NN ./.

The/DT topic/NN has/VBZ been/VBN brought/VBN under/IN the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN and/CC as/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO draft/VB important/JJ ,/, more/RBR stringent/JJ legislation/NN as/RB early/RB on/IN as/RB at/IN first/JJ reading/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT common/JJ position/NN which/WDT was/VBD issued/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN was/VBD already/RB a/DT major/JJ improvement/NN on/IN the/DT original/JJ proposal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB very/RB hard/JJ to/TO adopt/VB policy/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN because/IN the/DT discrepancies/NNS are/VBP so/RB huge/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO enter/VB into/IN the/DT two/CD elements/NNS of/IN this/DT topic/NN in/IN more/JJR detail/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD first/RB of/IN all/DT like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN quality/NN ./.

The/DT Netherlands/NNPS is/VBZ significantly/RB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT European/JJ water/NN policy/NN ./.

A/DT very/RB important/JJ component/NN ,/, to/TO wit/NN ,/, one/CD third/NN of/IN our/PRP$ drinking/NN water/NN ,/, is/VBZ extracted/VBN from/IN surface/NN water/NN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ./.

The/DT Netherlands/NNPS is/VBZ located/VBN downstream/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT delta/NN ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT surface/NN water/NN which/WDT heads/VBZ our/PRP$ way/NN is/VBZ of/IN key/JJ importance/NN ./.

Another/DT important/JJ point/NN of/IN discussion/NN is/VBZ the/DT standardisation/NN of/IN water/NN quality/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN standards/NNS and/CC especially/RB the/DT OSPAR/JJ standard/NN for/IN 2020/CD are/VBP called/VBN into/IN question/NN ./.

Although/IN I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN ,/, according/VBG to/TO some/DT ,/, this/DT standard/NN is/VBZ unclear/JJ or/CC that/IN it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB defended/VBN judicially/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO support/VB it/PRP because/IN we/PRP could/MD then/RB provide/VB more/JJR precise/JJ standards/NNS in/IN a/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD now/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS on/IN quantity/NN management/NN ./.

In/IN his/PRP$ poem/CD ``/`` Herinneringen/NNP aan/NNP Holland/NNP ''/'' -LSB-/NNP ``/`` Reminiscing/VBG about/IN Holland/NNP ''/'' -RSB-/NN ,/, a/DT famous/JJ Dutch/JJ poet/NN mentioned/VBD water/NN too/RB ,/, which/WDT ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ never-ending/JJ trail/NN of/IN destruction/NN ,/, was/VBD feared/VBN and/CC respected/VBN ./.

In/IN 1953/CD ,/, we/PRP suffered/VBD an/DT enormous/JJ flood/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO play/VB a/DT pioneering/JJ role/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN dam/NN technology/NN ./.

When/WRB our/PRP$ rivers/NNS flooded/VBD in/IN 1990/CD ,/, we/PRP established/VBD that/IN installing/VBG artificial/JJ works/NNS upstream/RB affects/VBZ the/DT water-storage/JJ capacity/NN downstream/NN and/CC can/MD cause/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN damage/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN quantity/NN management/NN too/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO put/VB in/IN considerable/JJ effort/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/DT life/NN upstream/RB and/CC downstream/NNP is/VBZ not/RB affected/VBN by/IN it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN congratulating/NNP Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN her/PRP$ excellent/JJ work/NN ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ necessity/NN of/IN life/NN and/CC a/DT fundamental/JJ right/NN ./.

Everyone/NN should/MD have/VB clean/JJ water/NN at/IN their/PRP$ disposal/NN but/CC the/DT availability/NN and/CC good/JJ quality/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ not/RB so/RB self-evident/JJ ,/, as/IN many/DT have/VBP experienced/VBN in/IN Southern/NNP Europe/NNP and/CC are/VBP experiencing/VBG now/RB in/IN the/DT Danube/NNP countries/NNS too/RB ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ often/RB a/DT source/NN of/IN conflict/NN between/IN countries/NNS and/CC peoples/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN water/NN becomes/VBZ subject/JJ to/TO international/JJ coordination/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO recognise/VB that/IN water/NN is/VBZ a/DT joint/JJ liability/NN ./.

Cooperation/NNP within/IN a/DT catchment/JJ basin/NN must/MD be/VB self-evident/JJ ./.

Too/RB little/RB operational/JJ capacity/NN upstream/NNS or/CC ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, excessive/JJ use/NN ,/, can/MD cause/VB problems/NNS downstream/RB ./.

Coordination/NNP is/VBZ the/DT key/JJ word/NN here/RB ./.

The/DT problem/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ becoming/VBG increasingly/RB topical/JJ ./.

Changes/NNS in/IN the/DT climate/NN and/CC minor/JJ rises/NNS in/IN temperature/NN have/VBP a/DT direct/JJ impact/NN on/IN precipitation/NN ./.

Some/DT areas/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG drier/NN ,/, whilst/IN many/DT are/VBP becoming/VBG wetter/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ time/NN for/IN action/NN ./.

In/IN March/NNP ,/, the/DT Second/NNP World/NNP Water/NNP Forum/NNP will/MD be/VB held/VBN in/IN The/DT Hague/NNP ./.

This/DT Forum/NNP stands/VBZ for/IN a/DT worldwide/JJ vision/NN ./.

This/DT vision/NN must/MD translate/VB into/IN regional/JJ action/NN plans/NNS for/IN sustainable/JJ water/NN management/NN and/CC water/NN control/NN ./.

The/DT time/NN for/IN action/NN is/VBZ upon/IN us/PRP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP must/MD now/RB opt/VB for/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ water/NN policy/NN as/IN a/DT starting/JJ point/NN and/CC remain/VB realistic/JJ at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP should/MD not/RB lower/VB our/PRP$ standards/NNS too/RB much/RB either/RB ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ not/RB ambitious/JJ enough/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO refer/VB to/TO previous/JJ international/JJ agreements/NNS ,/, or/CC the/DT OSPAR/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO aim/VB for/IN dangerous/JJ substances/NNS to/TO be/VB phased/VBN out/RP by/IN 2020/CD ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN agreed/VBN for/IN the/DT marine/JJ environment/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN this/DT agreement/NN will/MD also/RB apply/VB to/TO other/JJ waters/NNS too/RB ./.

The/DT OSPAR/JJ objectives/NNS are/VBP now/RB being/VBG drawn/VBN up/RP ./.

A/DT list/NN has/VBZ been/VBN compiled/VBN ,/, containing/VBG 400/CD substances/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP clear/JJ risks/NNS for/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ both/DT technically/JJ and/CC economically/RB possible/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT emission/NN of/IN these/DT substances/NNS to/TO virtually/RB zero/CD and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO opt/VB for/IN this/DT once/RB again/RB ./.

Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, the/DT directive/NN also/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB binding/JJ ./.

Countries/NNP downstream/NNP must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO count/VB on/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN countries/NNS upstream/MD meet/VB the/DT quality/NN objectives/NNS ./.

Quality/NNP has/VBZ a/DT price/NN ,/, but/CC pollution/NN could/MD well/RB have/VB a/DT much/RB higher/JJR price/NN tag/NN in/IN future/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ compliments/NNS to/TO Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN her/PRP$ excellent/JJ work/NN on/IN the/DT Water/NNP Directive/NNP ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT very/RB serious/JJ environmental/JJ problems/NNS facing/VBG us/PRP today/NN in/IN the/DT shape/NN of/IN climate/NN change/NN ,/, the/DT depletion/NN of/IN primeval/JJ forests/NNS and/CC overfishing/VBG ,/, constantly/RB affect/VBP our/PRP$ common/JJ and/CC vital/JJ but/CC ,/, in/IN some/DT ways/NNS ,/, unowned/VBD resources/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD also/RB recognise/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ fresh/JJ water/NN sources/NNS may/MD be/VB said/VBN to/TO be/VB on/IN the/DT borderline/NN between/IN being/VBG owned/VBN by/IN everyone/NN and/CC by/IN no-one/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB strategically/RB important/JJ that/IN responsibility/NN for/IN water/NN is/VBZ established/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ for/IN the/DT different/JJ watercourses/NNS to/TO be/VB kept/VBN together/RB and/CC managed/VBD as/RB the/DT totality/NN they/PRP in/IN fact/NN are/VBP ,/, irrespective/RB of/IN who/WP owns/VBZ one/CD section/NN or/CC another/DT of/IN a/DT common/JJ watercourse/NN ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT directive/NN does/VBZ indeed/RB ,/, as/IN many/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP already/RB said/VBN ,/, represent/VBP an/DT historic/JJ chance/NN to/TO simplify/VB and/CC improve/VB the/DT jumble/NN of/IN piecemeal/NNP EU/NNP regulations/NNS and/CC directives/NNS and/CC achieve/VB a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT policy/NN in/IN the/DT water/NN framework/NN directive/NN is/VBZ geared/VBN towards/IN deregulation/NN and/CC renationalisation/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT vote/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT washout/NN and/CC that/WDT will/MD depend/VB on/IN what/WP I/PRP see/VBP as/IN two/CD quite/RB fundamental/JJ points/NNS ./.

First/NNP OSPAR/NNP ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN does/VBZ not/RB go/VB far/RB enough/RB ;/: unfortunately/RB this/DT also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT proposal/NN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP ./.

Merely/JJ pulling/VBG proposals/NNS out/RB of/IN the/DT air/NN is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ a/DT completely/RB legally/RB binding/JJ objective/NN for/IN OSPAR/NNP ./.

Only/RB then/RB will/MD we/PRP manage/VBP to/TO achieve/VB legal/JJ clarity/NN and/CC ,/, more/RBR importantly/RB ,/, objectives/NNS which/WDT are/VBP enforceable/JJ under/IN the/DT law/NN ./.

Anything/NN else/RB will/MD fall/VB short/JJ of/IN the/DT mark/NN and/CC will/MD not/RB help/VB to/TO prevent/VB ecological/JJ disasters/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN those/DT which/WDT have/VBP just/RB come/VBN to/TO light/VB in/IN Romania/NNP and/CC Hungary/NNP ,/, from/IN happening/VBG to/TO us/PRP ./.

I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP unfortunate/JJ that/IN national/JJ governments/NNS are/VBP not/RB prepared/VBN to/TO stand/VB up/RP for/IN legally/RB binding/JJ protection/NN ,/, despite/IN having/VBG agreed/VBN internationally/RB on/IN OSPAR/NNP ./.

But/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP we/PRP have/VBP to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN we/PRP will/MD not/RB allow/VB the/DT credibility/NN of/IN our/PRP$ policy/NN to/TO be/VB lost/VBN or/CC compromised/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ to/TO reinforce/VB the/DT polluter/NN pays/VBZ principle/NN because/IN prices/NNS must/MD speak/VB the/DT ecological/JJ truth/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB bow/VB down/RP before/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ or/CC chemical/JJ industry/NN lobbyists/NNS ;/: on/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD use/VB our/PRP$ vote/NN to/TO promote/VB and/CC express/VB that/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP want/VBP the/DT polluter/NN pays/VBZ principle/NN and/CC ,/, hence/RB ,/, cost-covering/JJ prices/NNS ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ our/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ resource/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD use/VB our/PRP$ vote/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT incentives/NNS and/CC pressure/NN are/VBP there/RB to/TO really/RB comply/VB with/IN the/DT OSPAR/JJ convention/NN ./.

With/IN closed/JJ production/NN circuits/NNS this/DT is/VBZ possible/JJ ;/: anything/NN else/RB would/MD water/VB down/RP the/DT directive/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP grab/VB our/PRP$ chance/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN this/DT directive/NN may/MD have/VB problems/NNS ,/, given/VBN the/DT differing/VBG situations/NNS of/IN the/DT various/JJ countries/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, as/IN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN ./.

The/DT situation/NN in/IN the/DT north/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN that/DT in/IN the/DT south/NN ,/, and/CC different/JJ from/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN those/DT countries/NNS which/WDT have/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN desert/NN areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP this/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP some/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT attempt/VBP to/TO help/VB the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT south/NN ,/, specifically/RB Amendment/NNP No/RB 43/CD which/WDT ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT recuperation/NN of/IN costs/NNS ,/, also/RB indicates/VBZ that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT social/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN the/DT countries/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO decision/NN making/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB difficulties/NNS with/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN transfers/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ country/NN -/: I/PRP live/VBP in/IN the/DT north/NN of/IN Spain/NNP -/: ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT considerable/JJ difference/NN between/IN the/DT north/NN and/CC the/DT south/NN ,/, and/CC difficulties/NNS arise/VBP when/WRB we/PRP have/VBP to/TO transfer/VB water/NN from/IN one/CD place/NN to/TO another/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN also/RB says/VBZ that/IN the/DT river/NN basins/VBZ receiving/VBG the/DT transferred/JJ water/NN must/MD save/VB and/CC protect/VB their/PRP$ water/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT difficult/JJ report/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT differing/VBG situations/NNS of/IN countries/NNS cause/VBP difficulties/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD move/VB forward/RB with/IN a/DT framework/NN directive/NN which/WDT will/MD prevent/VB a/DT repetition/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG on/IN the/DT Danube/NNP and/CC what/WP happened/VBD in/IN Do脙/NNP 卤/NNP ana/NNP ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB allow/VB our/PRP$ European/JJ water/NN to/TO be/VB polluted/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP must/MD produce/VB a/DT directive/NN which/WDT will/MD strengthen/VB the/DT political/JJ will/NN of/IN governments/NNS to/TO preserve/VB the/DT resource/NN of/IN water/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ so/RB precious/JJ to/TO all/DT of/IN us/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ compliments/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN a/DT splendid/JJ report/NN ./.

As/IN an/DT Irish/JJ Member/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, coming/VBG from/IN a/DT country/NN which/WDT has/VBZ large/JJ reserves/NNS of/IN rich/JJ water/NN ,/, I/PRP support/VBP the/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS included/VBN in/IN this/DT directive/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD now/RB like/VB to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT areas/NNS of/IN difference/NN between/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ./.

The/DT latter/NN has/VBZ already/RB brought/VBN forward/RP its/PRP$ common/JJ position/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT Council/NNP the/DT objective/NN of/IN achieving/VBG good/JJ surface/NN water/NN status/NN should/MD be/VB secured/VBN no/RB later/RB than/IN 16/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT directive/NN enters/VBZ into/IN force/NN ,/, whereas/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB this/DT deadline/NN shortened/VBN to/TO ten/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP see/VBP no/DT reason/NN why/WRB European/NNP Union/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS can/MD not/RB work/VB to/TO implement/VB the/DT key/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN this/DT directive/NN in/IN as/RB short/JJ a/DT time/NN as/RB possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP now/RB turn/VBP to/TO the/DT amendments/NNS to/TO be/VB tabled/VBN before/IN Parliament/NNP tomorrow/NN concerning/VBG the/DT principle/NN of/IN the/DT recovery/NN of/IN cost/NN of/IN water/NN usage/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP in/IN its/PRP$ common/JJ position/NN states/VBZ that/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP governments/NNS must/MD take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN recovery/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN water/NN usage/NN ./.

No/DT specific/JJ target/NN date/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN this/DT principle/NN was/VBD included/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 43/CD seeks/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN by/IN the/DT year/NN 2010/CD water/NN pricing/NN policies/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP must/MD provide/VB adequate/JJ incentives/NNS to/TO use/VB water/NN efficiently/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, an/DT adequate/JJ contribution/NN from/IN different/JJ economic/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, broken/VBN down/RP into/IN industrial/JJ ,/, household/JJ and/CC agricultural/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, must/MD ensure/VB that/IN this/DT policy/NN is/VBZ implemented/VBN ./.

Unless/IN these/DT amendments/NNS are/VBP supported/VBN tomorrow/NN a/DT strong/JJ message/NN will/MD be/VB sent/VBN out/RP that/IN metering/NN and/CC water/NN rates/NNS should/MD be/VB implemented/VBN for/IN households/NNS right/RB across/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP states/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ politically/RB impractical/JJ from/IN an/DT Irish/JJ perspective/NN ,/, as/IN indeed/RB it/PRP would/MD be/VB from/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN other/JJ EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS such/JJ as/IN Portugal/NNP ,/, Greece/NNP and/CC Spain/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP first/JJ of/IN all/DT to/TO say/VB thank/VB you/PRP to/TO Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP for/IN her/PRP$ report/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ here/RB and/CC now/RB that/IN we/PRP decide/VBP to/TO what/WDT extent/NN the/DT EU/NNP countries/NNS are/VBP to/TO work/VB effectively/RB for/IN a/DT cleaner/JJR aquatic/JJ environment/NN in/IN the/DT years/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

We/PRP can/MD do/VB this/DT by/IN ,/, as/IN a/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, amending/VBG the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ position/NN and/CC showing/VBG the/DT way/NN forward/RB in/IN working/VBG for/IN a/DT cleaner/JJR environment/NN ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ unaltered/JJ form/NN ,/, the/DT present/JJ directive/NN could/MD ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, have/VB very/RB unfortunate/JJ and/CC long-term/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC for/IN our/PRP$ drinking/NN water/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB to/TO send/VB out/RP the/DT wrong/JJ signals/NNS both/DT to/TO European/JJ industry/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT European/JJ people/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ to/TO adhere/VB to/TO a/DT limit/NN upon/IN total/JJ discharges/NNS of/IN chemicals/NNS into/IN our/PRP$ waters/NNS ./.

The/DT directive/NN quite/RB obviously/RB provides/VBZ too/RB extended/VBN a/DT time/NN frame/NN within/IN which/WDT time/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB spent/VBN measuring/VBG every/DT single/JJ one/NN of/IN the/DT approximately/RB 100,000/CD chemicals/NNS in/IN circulation/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB afford/VB to/TO wait/VB ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO support/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 108/NNP ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT words/NNS ``/`` water/NN pollution/NN caused/VBN by/IN individual/JJ pollutants/NNS ''/'' are/VBP replaced/VBN by/IN ``/`` prevention/NN of/IN water/NN pollution/NN through/IN the/DT continuous/JJ reduction/NN in/IN discharges/NNS ''/'' ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB delay/VB environmental/JJ work/NN by/IN going/VBG into/IN inordinate/JJ detail/NN rather/RB than/IN working/VBG on/IN reducing/VBG total/JJ discharges/NNS of/IN hazardous/JJ substances/NNS into/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/NNP Ministers/NNP for/IN the/DT Environment/NNP must/MD therefore/RB stand/VB by/IN their/PRP$ affiliation/NN to/TO the/DT OSPAR/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, which/WDT now/RB already/RB defines/VBZ what/WP is/VBZ hazardous/JJ to/TO the/DT environment/NN ./.

This/DT Convention/NN should/MD be/VB our/PRP$ guide/NN in/IN working/VBG for/IN the/DT clean/JJ environment/NN which/WDT we/PRP owe/VBP to/TO ourselves/PRP and/CC ,/, not/RB least/JJS ,/, to/TO our/PRP$ descendants/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO summarise/VB the/DT areas/NNS covered/VBN by/IN such/PDT a/DT large/JJ and/CC complex/JJ directive/NN ./.

The/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP reiterates/VBZ the/DT priority/NN criteria/NNS for/IN prevention/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT `/`` polluter/NN pays/VBZ '/'' principle/NN and/CC for/IN sustainable/VBG development/NN through/IN an/DT environmental/JJ impact/NN assessment/NN ./.

This/DT situation/NN is/VBZ loudly/RB echoed/VBN in/IN many/JJ sectors/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, and/CC especially/RB in/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ./.

The/DT obligation/NN to/TO develop/VB and/CC consolidate/VB a/DT strategy/NN for/IN integration/NN derives/VBZ from/IN this/DT notion/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN keeping/VBG the/DT management/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT sustainable/JJ economic/JJ production/NN model/NN in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN current/JJ conditions/NNS ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ eliminating/VBG the/DT pollution/NN generated/VBN by/IN dangerous/JJ substances/NNS in/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN ,/, an/DT optimum/JJ approach/NN should/MD provide/VB a/DT regulation/NN at/IN both/DT national/JJ and/CC Community/NNP levels/NNS ,/, which/WDT enables/VBZ clearer/JJR identification/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ classes/NNS of/IN bodies/NNS of/IN water/NN polluted/JJ as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN human/JJ production/NN activities/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD achieve/VB this/DT long-term/JJ objective/NN by/IN developing/VBG measures/NNS with/IN demanding/VBG standards/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, I/PRP fully/RB support/VBP the/DT amendments/NNS proposed/VBD by/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP to/TO develop/VB a/DT reasonable/JJ approach/NN using/VBG quality/NN standards/NNS so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD eventually/RB say/VB that/IN ,/, when/WRB people/NNS use/VBP water/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP not/RB consuming/VBG it/PRP but/CC maintaining/VBG present/JJ stocks/NNS ./.

This/DT directive/NN contains/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN very/RB positive/JJ elements/NNS which/WDT are/VBP worth/JJ highlighting/VBG ./.

First/RB there/EX is/VBZ wide/JJ information/NN for/IN and/CC involvement/NN by/IN the/DT public/NN ,/, a/DT rarity/NN in/IN a/DT European/JJ directive/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ compulsory/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ a/DT holistic/JJ approach/NN to/TO water/NN is/VBZ being/VBG taken/VBN here/RB and/CC that/IN authorities/NNS in/IN the/DT individual/JJ national/JJ states/NNS and/CC beyond/IN the/DT borders/NNS of/IN the/DT national/JJ states/NNS are/VBP at/IN last/RB obliged/VBN to/TO work/VB together/RB and/CC ensure/VB that/IN water/NN is/VBZ of/IN a/DT high/JJ quality/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO address/VB the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT timetable/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP firmly/RB convinced/JJ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT strict/JJ ,/, tight/JJ timetable/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO work/VB towards/IN our/PRP$ long-term/JJ objective/NN ./.

Compare/VB it/PRP with/IN what/WP happens/VBZ in/IN December/NNP ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP in/IN December/NNP that/IN Christmas/NNP Eve/NNP falls/VBZ on/IN 24th/JJ December/NNP and/CC we/PRP start/VBP buying/VBG presents/NNS ./.

But/CC what/WP would/MD we/PRP do/VB if/IN we/PRP knew/VBD in/IN December/NNP that/IN Christmas/NNP was/VBD in/IN thirty/CD years/NNS '/POS time/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP what/WP we/PRP would/MD do/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP need/VBP a/DT tight/JJ timetable/NN for/IN our/PRP$ water/NN policy/NN ./.

I/PRP emphatically/RB support/VBP the/DT rapporteur/NN '/POS s/JJ proposals/NNS and/CC think/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT tight/JJ timetable/NN for/IN all/DT areas/NNS of/IN the/DT directive/NN ,/, from/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN measures/NNS to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN employment/NN measures/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ objective/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS work/VBP together/RB to/TO protect/VB groundwater/NN ,/, drinking/NN water/NN and/CC surface/NN water/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN protection/NN corresponds/VBZ to/TO existing/JJ EU/NNP environmental/JJ legislation/NN ./.

May/NNP I/PRP take/VBP this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN previous/JJ resolutions/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT Nitrates/NNP Directive/NNP have/VBP still/RB not/RB been/VBN implemented/VBN in/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ EU/NNP resolution/NN ./.

The/DT present/JJ proposal/NN tightens/VBZ up/RP the/DT protection/NN of/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN ways/NNS which/WDT exceed/VBP our/PRP$ current/JJ environmental/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ proposed/VBN that/IN a/DT target/NN should/MD be/VB achieved/VBN for/IN concentrations/NNS in/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN which/WDT is/VBZ close/JJ to/TO the/DT background/NN values/NNS for/IN naturally/RB occurring/VBG substances/NNS and/CC close/VB to/TO zero/VB for/IN humanly/RB produced/VBN synthetic/JJ substances/NNS ./.

This/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB done/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PRP also/RB ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, goes/VBZ against/IN nature/NN ./.

Adopting/VBG this/DT report/NN would/MD have/VB serious/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN agriculture/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP if/IN concentrations/NNS of/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, phosphorus/NN and/CC nitrogen/NN could/MD not/RB exceed/VB the/DT background/NN values/NNS for/IN these/DT substances/NNS in/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN and/CC if/IN a/DT limit/NN of/IN zero/CD were/VBD to/TO be/VB established/VBN for/IN pesticides/NNS in/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN ./.

European/JJ agriculture/NN would/MD not/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, be/VB able/JJ to/TO grow/VB bread/NN grain/NN with/IN a/DT high/JJ enough/JJ protein/NN content/NN for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB used/VBN for/IN making/VBG bread/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, agricultural/JJ production/NN would/MD move/VB to/TO other/JJ countries/NNS outside/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, with/IN consequent/JJ high/JJ socio-economic/NN and/CC employment/NN costs/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT sections/NNS in/IN the/DT Water/NNP Framework/NNP Directive/NNP which/WDT deal/VBP with/IN these/DT states/NNS of/IN affairs/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, water/NN is/VBZ a/DT precious/JJ raw/JJ material/NN ./.

Millions/NNS of/IN people/NNS do/VBP not/RB even/RB have/VB clean/JJ water/NN -/: a/DT absolute/JJ necessity/NN for/IN survival/NN -/: at/IN their/PRP$ disposal/NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, not/RB surprise/VB us/PRP that/IN water/NN is/VBZ the/DT cause/NN of/IN wars/NNS ./.

The/DT capitalist/JJ world/NN too/RB sends/VBZ out/RP its/PRP$ pawns/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO gain/VB maximum/JJ control/NN over/IN water/NN reservoirs/NNS ./.

General/NNP interest/NN or/CC solidarity/NN often/RB do/VBP not/RB come/VB into/IN the/DT equation/NN ./.

Europe/NNP is/VBZ therefore/RB facing/VBG an/DT arduous/JJ task/NN ;/: that/DT of/IN combining/VBG a/DT Community/NNP water/NN policy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ fragmented/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN objectives/NNS and/CC means/NNS into/IN more/JJR coherent/NN framework/NN legislation/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB that/IN in/IN Flanders/NNP ,/, where/WRB I/PRP come/VBP from/IN ,/, we/PRP still/RB have/VBP a/DT long/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB too/RB ./.

We/PRP were/VBD recently/RB rapped/VBN on/IN the/DT knuckles/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP regarding/VBG this/DT matter/NN ./.

Anyone/NN with/IN any/DT sense/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB this/DT framework/NN directive/NN used/VBN as/IN a/DT big/JJ stick/NN for/IN those/DT pursuing/VBG policies/NNS who/WP are/VBP now/RB failing/VBG in/IN some/DT way/NN ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ in/IN this/DT respect/NN a/DT farce/NN ,/, a/DT document/NN with/IN no/DT strings/NNS attached/VBN and/CC a/DT true/JJ affront/NN in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT OSPAR/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

Please/UH let/VB this/DT not/RB be/VB yet/RB another/DT sector/NN where/WRB we/PRP subsequently/RB have/VBP to/TO lament/VB the/DT lack/NN of/IN enforcement/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO address/VB one/CD final/JJ point/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB content/VB ourselves/PRP with/IN sealing/VBG another/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT safety/NN net/NN and/CC shutting/VBG our/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, where/WRB transport/NN safety/NN in/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB much/RB more/JJR to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Koch/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN which/WDT has/VBZ ,/, at/IN its/PRP$ heart/NN ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN transport/NN safety/NN ./.

The/DT report/NN looks/VBZ at/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN harmonising/VBG the/DT examination/NN requirements/NNS for/IN safety/NN advisors/NNS working/VBG in/IN the/DT areas/NNS of/IN transportation/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN road/NN ,/, rail/NN and/CC inland/NN waterway/RB ./.

I/PRP congratulate/VB him/PRP on/IN his/PRP$ excellent/JJ report/NN ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ pointed/VBN out/RP to/TO the/DT House/NNP that/IN in/IN its/PRP$ common/JJ position/NN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ accepted/VBN six/CD of/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS ten/CD amendments/NNS put/VBN forward/RB at/IN first/JJ reading/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT substance/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP 's/POS other/JJ amendments/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN retained/VBN ./.

My/NNP Group/NNP will/MD therefore/RB support/VB the/DT common/JJ position/NN and/CC looks/VBZ forward/RB to/TO the/DT enactment/NN of/IN the/DT legislation/NN which/WDT will/MD provide/VB us/PRP with/IN yet/RB another/DT tool/NN in/IN our/PRP$ fight/NN to/TO make/VB transport/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP as/RB safe/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO safety/VB my/PRP$ Group/NNP will/MD always/RB support/VB any/DT initiatives/NNS to/TO improve/VB transport/NN safety/NN ./.

We/PRP still/RB have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN work/NN to/TO do/VB in/IN this/DT area/NN as/IN recent/JJ events/NNS have/VBP proved/VBN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT few/JJ comments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN his/PRP$ exceptionally/RB accurate/JJ and/CC technical/JJ work/NN on/IN the/DT report/NN and/CC ,/, secondly/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT proposal/NN it/PRP has/VBZ submitted/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN here/RB with/IN the/DT harmonisation/NN of/IN examination/NN requirements/NNS but/CC also/RB ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, with/IN minimum/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT pity/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT sense/NN ./.

Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, safety/NN on/IN roads/NNS ,/, railways/NNS and/CC inland/NN waterways/NNS is/VBZ of/IN key/JJ importance/NN and/CC ,/, given/VBN the/DT international/JJ nature/NN of/IN these/DT types/NNS of/IN transport/NN ,/, training/NN for/IN safety/NN advisors/NNS should/MD also/RB be/VB harmonised/VBN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ ADR/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ under/IN way/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, but/CC so/RB is/VBZ enforcement/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN reasons/NNS why/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO pay/VB particular/JJ attention/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

Just/RB think/VBP of/IN the/DT road/NN accidents/NNS which/WDT have/VBP occurred/VBN over/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN in/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, the/DT Netherlands/NNPS and/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ countries/NNS where/WRB lorries/NNS carrying/VBG dangerous/JJ goods/NNS continued/VBD to/TO drive/VB in/IN foggy/JJ conditions/NNS when/WRB really/RB they/PRP should/MD have/VB pulled/VBN off/RP the/DT road/NN instead/RB ./.

Or/CC ships/NNS from/IN Eastern/NNP Europe/NNP which/WDT moor/VBP adjacent/JJ to/TO ships/NNS over/IN here/RB ,/, with/IN all/PDT the/DT obvious/JJ risks/NNS that/IN this/DT entails/VBZ ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ transpired/VBN that/IN research/NN in/IN the/DT ports/NNS in/IN Belgium/NNP ,/, Finland/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN Japan/NNP has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN 50/CD %/NN of/IN containers/NNS with/IN partially/RB dangerous/JJ cargo/NN are/VBP not/RB delivered/VBN correctly/RB for/IN shipment/NN ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, the/DT issue/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ one/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT situation/NN where/WRB safety/NN advisers/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN countries/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ compulsory/JJ to/TO employ/VB such/JJ safety/NN advisers/NNS in/IN companies/NNS as/RB from/IN 1/CD January/NNP of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

There/EX will/MD be/VB major/JJ problems/NNS with/IN enforcing/VBG this/DT rule/NN at/IN present/JJ ,/, especially/RB with/IN smaller/JJR companies/NNS ,/, as/IN these/DT can/MD not/RB afford/VB safety/NN advisors/NNS ./.

These/DT smaller/JJR companies/NNS either/RB dispose/VB of/IN their/PRP$ cargo/NN or/CC mix/VB it/PRP with/IN other/JJ cargo/NN ,/, which/WDT causes/VBZ problems/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB also/RB being/VBG requested/VBN that/IN ISO/NNP 9002/CD certificates/NNS possibly/RB include/VBP the/DT finer/NN details/NNS of/IN these/DT activities/NNS in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN annual/JJ reports/NNS and/CC company/NN analyses/NNS ./.

The/DT work/NN is/VBZ done/VBN ./.

All/DT that/WDT remains/VBZ is/VBZ the/DT business/NN of/IN enforcement/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB one/CD final/JJ point/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO enforcement/NN ,/, proper/JJ agreements/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB concluded/VBN with/IN the/DT Eastern/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS because/IN they/PRP will/MD not/RB enter/VB into/IN treaties/NNS which/WDT deal/VBP with/IN this/DT matter/NN until/IN 1/CD July/NNP 2001/CD ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB in/IN eighteen/NN months/NNS '/POS time/NN ./.

This/DT gives/VBZ them/PRP a/DT competitive/JJ edge/NN for/IN the/DT interim/JJ period/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN itself/PRP anything/NN dreadful/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP should/MD prioritise/VB particularly/RB the/DT safety/NN aspects/NNS for/IN goods/NNS transported/VBN by/IN road/NN ,/, rail/NN and/CC inland/NN waterways/NNS and/CC incorporate/VB these/DT ,/, as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT acquis/JJ communautaire/NN ,/, as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ and/CC present/VB them/PRP to/TO the/DT acceding/VBG states/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN transport/NN safety/NN is/VBZ highlighted/VBN on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC rightly/RB so/RB ./.

The/DT ever/RB increasing/JJ volume/NN of/IN goods/NNS passing/VBG through/IN Europe/NNP entails/VBZ all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN risks/NNS ,/, known/VBN and/CC unknown/JJ ,/, for/IN employees/NNS and/CC the/DT social/JJ environment/NN ./.

Those/DT having/VBG to/TO deal/VB with/IN these/DT risks/NNS should/MD therefore/RB meet/VB stringent/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

The/DT relevant/JJ standards/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN another/DT Directive/NN ,/, 95/35/EC/CD ,/, seem/VBP sufficiently/RB adequate/JJ to/TO advise/VB people/NNS in/IN a/DT responsible/JJ manner/NN on/IN the/DT organisation/NN of/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ that/IN agreement/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN reached/VBN with/IN the/DT Council/NNP on/IN minimum/JJ standards/NNS regarding/VBG examinations/NNS ,/, although/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN it/PRP if/IN uniform/JJ ,/, set/NN standards/NNS and/CC modules/NNS had/VBD been/VBN established/VBN ,/, so/CC that/IN certificates/NNS would/MD be/VB of/IN equal/JJ value/NN internationally/RB ./.

This/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, does/VBZ not/RB seem/VB feasible/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT amendment/NN tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN is/VBZ perfectly/RB logical/JJ and/CC I/PRP can/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, give/VB it/PRP my/PRP$ wholehearted/JJ support/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD first/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Koch/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ reports/NNS which/WDT ,/, though/IN technical/JJ ,/, are/VBP nonetheless/RB of/IN very/RB great/JJ significance/NN for/IN safety/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB just/RB a/DT few/JJ comments/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP -/: and/CC I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN my/PRP$ request/NN will/MD fall/VB on/IN fertile/JJ ground/NN -/: to/TO ensure/VB that/IN more/JJR attention/NN is/VBZ paid/VBN to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN safety/NN ,/, be/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT roads/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT waterways/NNS or/CC at/IN sea/NN ./.

Considering/VBG that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ only/JJ today/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN a/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN first/RB made/VBN on/IN 19/CD March/NNP 1998/CD ,/, even/RB though/IN Parliament/NNP responded/VBD relatively/RB quickly/RB ,/, this/DT time/NN lag/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/RB too/RB long/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB just/RB the/DT fault/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB action/NN more/RBR quickly/RB so/RB as/RB to/TO achieve/VB harmonisation/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN :/: it/PRP concerns/VBZ the/DT minimum/JJ standards/NNS ./.

In/IN principle/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS where/WRB transport/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ we/PRP should/MD be/VB working/VBG towards/IN increased/VBN flexibility/NN and/CC country-specific/JJ rules/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO safety/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP rather/RB sceptical/JJ because/IN safety/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, is/VBZ in/IN principle/NN no/DT different/JJ from/IN safety/NN in/IN Germany/NNP ,/, Italy/NNP or/CC Austria/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD live/VB with/IN these/DT minimum/JJ standards/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO monitor/VB the/DT situation/NN very/RB carefully/RB ./.

Should/MD flexibility/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN result/VB in/IN there/EX being/VBG inadequate/JJ rules/NNS in/IN some/DT countries/NNS then/RB we/PRP should/MD work/VB towards/IN greater/JJR harmonisation/NN ./.

My/PRP$ third/JJ point/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN already/RB ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, like/IN Mr/NNP Rack/NNP ,/, I/PRP come/VBP from/IN a/DT transit/NN country/NN ,/, where/WRB this/DT issue/NN plays/VBZ a/DT particularly/RB important/JJ role/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT conditions/NNS of/IN competition/NN worse/RBR for/IN some/DT countries/NNS unilaterally/RB and/CC improve/VB them/PRP for/IN countries/NNS such/JJ as/IN Austria/NNP or/CC other/JJ transit/NN countries/NNS ./.

But/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD do/VB all/DT we/PRP can/MD to/TO keep/VB the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS to/TO a/DT minimum/NN ,/, in/IN all/DT countries/NNS ,/, whether/IN they/PRP are/VBP transit/NN countries/NNS or/CC not/RB ./.

We/PRP understand/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN the/DT two/CD institutions/NNS -/: Parliament/NNP and/CC Commission/NNP -/: cooperate/VB and/CC work/VB together/RB and/CC that/IN the/DT current/JJ cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ the/DT transport/NN group/NN ,/, is/VBZ magnificent/JJ ./.

Very/RB briefly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT various/JJ Members/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ interventions/NNS and/CC to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/IN safety/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ priorities/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN transport/NN ./.

As/IN Mr/NNP Simpson/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN very/RB correctly/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT process/NN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD never/RB take/VB for/IN granted/JJ or/CC regard/VB as/IN having/VBG come/VBN to/TO an/DT end/NN ./.

The/DT process/NN of/IN increasing/VBG safety/NN margins/NNS and/CC safety/NN guarantees/NNS in/IN transport/NN is/VBZ a/DT process/NN which/WDT must/MD be/VB improved/VBN day/NN by/IN day/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO refer/VB very/JJ briefly/NN to/TO the/DT problems/NNS of/IN the/DT tunnels/NNS ,/, which/WDT Messrs/NNPS Rack/NNP and/CC Swoboda/NNP have/VBP referred/VBN to/TO ,/, which/WDT ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Austria/NNP ,/, is/VBZ doubtless/RB a/DT very/RB sensitive/JJ issue/NN ,/, and/CC great/JJ effort/NN should/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO improve/VB their/PRP$ safety/NN ./.

In/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/JJS accidents/NNS to/TO have/VB occurred/VBN recently/RB ,/, the/DT goods/NNS being/VBG transported/VBN were/VBD not/RB dangerous/JJ in/IN themselves/PRP ./.

Margarine/NNP and/CC a/DT few/JJ kilos/NNS of/IN paint/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, do/VBP not/RB present/VB risks/NNS ,/, led/VBD to/TO a/DT genuine/JJ disaster/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO see/VB how/WRB the/DT requirements/NNS guaranteeing/VBG the/DT maximum/JJ degree/NN of/IN safety/NN can/MD be/VB further/RBR improved/VBN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO consider/VB safety/NN in/IN all/DT types/NNS of/IN transport/NN ./.

This/DT week/NN we/PRP will/MD be/VB holding/VBG a/DT debate/NN here/RB on/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN sea/NN transport/NN ,/, in/IN light/NN of/IN the/DT Erika/NNP disaster/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO discuss/VB our/PRP$ objectives/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN air/NN transport/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN safety/NN is/VBZ a/DT priority/NN objective/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO repeat/VB my/PRP$ appreciation/NN to/TO all/PDT the/DT speakers/NNS and/CC especially/RB to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Koch/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12/CD p.m./RB Transport/NNP of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN road/NN ./.

Delays/NNS in/IN the/DT CEN/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN are/VBP now/RB making/VBG it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO apply/VB this/DT very/JJ directive/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, annexes/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB adapted/VBN to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN technical/JJ and/CC industrial/JJ developments/NNS ./.

I/PRP regret/VBP this/DT since/IN we/PRP are/VBP having/VBG to/TO take/VB action/NN because/IN others/NNS have/VBP not/RB done/VBN their/PRP$ job/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, I/PRP accept/VBP this/DT proposal/NN to/TO amend/VB Directive/NNP 94/55/EC/CD which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN tabled/VBN for/IN discussion/NN today/NN ./.

Should/MD the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP fail/VB to/TO take/VB action/NN ,/, then/RB Member/NNP States/NNPS would/MD be/VB obliged/VBN to/TO amend/VB their/PRP$ national/JJ legislation/NN for/IN a/DT very/RB brief/JJ period/NN ,/, until/IN the/DT CEN/NNP completes/VBZ its/PRP$ work/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD cause/VB unnecessary/JJ cost/NN and/CC uncertainty/NN ./.

The/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT directive/NN on/IN today/NN 's/POS agenda/NN does/VBZ not/RB therefore/RB affect/VB the/DT existing/VBG harmonisation/NN of/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS in/IN the/DT Community/NNP ./.

The/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT directive/NN is/VBZ consequently/RB in/IN full/JJ accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ;/: the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS obtain/VBP more/JJR powers/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP decides/VBZ whether/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS may/MD impose/VB certain/JJ rules/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

In/IN so/RB doing/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ supported/VBN by/IN a/DT committee/NN of/IN experts/NNS on/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS under/IN the/DT regulatory/JJ procedure/NN ./.

The/DT procedures/NNS for/IN the/DT exercise/NN of/IN these/DT implementing/JJ powers/NNS conferred/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP were/VBD laid/VBN down/RP afresh/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP Decision/NNP of/IN June/NNP 1999/CD ./.

The/DT proposal/NN to/TO be/VB discussed/VBN today/NN ,/, to/TO amend/VB the/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN road/NN ,/, dates/VBZ from/IN May/NNP 1999/CD ,/, however/RB ,/, and/CC could/MD not/RB therefore/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT latest/JJS comitology/JJ procedure/NN ./.

Two/CD of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/VBN and/CC adopted/VBN unanimously/RB by/IN the/DT committee/NN relate/VBP precisely/RB to/TO this/DT amended/VBN comitology/NN procedure/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT reference/NN to/TO this/DT as/RB early/RB as/IN the/DT recitals/NNS and/CC that/IN the/DT period/NN within/IN which/WDT the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ to/TO make/VB a/DT decision/NN -/: which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB clearly/RB worded/VBN -/: is/VBZ set/VBN at/IN a/DT maximum/NN of/IN three/CD months/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT need/NN for/IN greater/JJR transparency/NN has/VBZ been/VBN pointed/VBN out/RP ./.

A/DT further/JJ amendment/NN allows/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO impose/VB more/RBR stringent/JJ requirements/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ for/IN vacuum/NN tanks/NNS ,/, if/IN work/NN is/VBZ done/VBN or/CC goods/NNS are/VBP transported/VBN as/IN a/DT priority/NN in/IN temperatures/NNS well/RB below/IN -20/CD 脗潞C/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ in/IN the/DT special/JJ interest/NN of/IN northern/JJ European/JJ regions/NNS ./.

A/DT final/JJ amendment/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN tanks/NNS and/CC tankers/NNS put/VBD into/IN service/NN between/IN 1/CD January/NNP 1997/CD and/CC the/DT entry/NN into/IN force/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN may/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB used/VBN provided/VBN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN constructed/VBN and/CC maintained/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP realise/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ only/RB a/DT small/JJ step/NN towards/IN increased/VBN transport/NN safety/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO endorse/VB this/DT report/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, colleagues/NNS ,/, a/DT happy/JJ new/JJ year/NN and/CC millennium/NNP to/TO you/PRP all/DT ./.

I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN this/DT plenary/JJ part-session/NN ,/, so/IN this/DT is/VBZ quite/RB exciting/JJ for/IN me/PRP ,/, a/DT little/JJ like/IN first/JJ love/NN ,/, although/IN that/DT did/VBD last/RB longer/RB than/IN two/CD minutes/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO briefly/RB comment/VB on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN to/TO amend/VB the/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN road/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN this/DT directive/NN should/MD be/VB established/VBN now/RB ,/, as/IN ,/, otherwise/RB ,/, Member/NNP States/NNPS would/MD have/VB to/TO amend/VB their/PRP$ national/JJ acts/NNS for/IN a/DT very/RB short/JJ time/NN ,/, a/DT period/NN of/IN transition/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD again/RB mean/VB unnecessary/JJ costs/NNS and/CC which/WDT would/MD once/RB more/RBR increase/VB concern/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO EU/NNP bureaucracy/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, does/VBZ not/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT facts/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT cold/JJ climate/NN that/WDT prevails/VBZ in/IN the/DT northern/JJ regions/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP tabled/VBN some/DT amendments/NNS to/TO Mr/NNP Koch/NNP '/POS s/NNP intrinsically/RB excellent/JJ report/NN ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN adopted/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ committee/NN ./.

My/PRP$ amendments/NNS concern/VB the/DT frost-resistance/JJ ratings/NNS for/IN tankers/NNS carrying/VBG these/DT dangerous/JJ goods/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN -20/NNP 脗潞C/NNP would/MD have/VB been/VBN sufficient/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT shores/NNS of/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO imagine/VB that/IN in/IN Lapland/NNP temperatures/NNS can/MD fall/VB considerably/RB lower/JJR than/IN that/DT ./.

There/EX is/VBZ support/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP in/IN Lapland/NNP also/RB ,/, so/RB let/VB us/PRP remember/VB them/PRP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP thus/RB proposed/VBN that/IN the/DT frost/NN rating/NN be/VB lowered/VBN to/TO -40/CD 脗潞C/NNS ./.

This/DT would/MD be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO keep/VB safety/NN standards/NNS at/IN the/DT level/NN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN northern/JJ regions/NNS previously/RB ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP my/PRP$ proposal/NN will/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN in/IN tomorrow/NN '/POS s/JJ vote/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, with/IN your/PRP$ permission/NN I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN expressing/VBG my/PRP$ admiration/NN for/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT you/PRP executed/VBD the/DT quick/JJ changeover/NN of/IN the/DT chairmanship/NN just/RB now/RB during/IN the/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD quite/RB superb/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT subject/NN at/IN hand/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO be/VB confident/JJ that/IN the/DT goods/NNS -/: however/RB dangerous/JJ they/PRP are/VBP -/: which/WDT are/VBP transported/VBN on/IN Europe/NNP 's/POS roads/NNS ,/, railways/NNS ,/, and/CC so/RB on/RB are/VBP as/RB safe/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.

This/DT directive/NN is/VBZ a/DT contribution/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG today/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT nuisance/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT report/NN we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG here/RB does/VBZ not/RB ,/, in/IN itself/PRP ,/, entail/VB any/DT major/JJ changes/NNS ./.

Most/JJS of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN amendments/NNS are/VBP of/IN a/DT purely/RB technical/JJ nature/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB worth/JJ emphasising/VBG that/DT ,/, each/DT time/NN we/PRP make/VBP this/DT type/NN of/IN decision/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ from/IN a/DT broad/JJ environmental/JJ perspective/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ beneficial/JJ because/IN it/PRP creates/VBZ better/JJR prior/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT possibilities/NNS of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

Very/RB large/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS are/VBP transported/VBN around/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, both/DT on/IN roads/NNS and/CC railways/NNS and/CC by/IN sea/NN ./.

This/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO have/VB proper/JJ rules/NNS governing/VBG transport/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

In/IN area/NN after/IN area/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP now/RB obtaining/VBG common/JJ minimum/JJ regulations/NNS for/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ extraordinarily/RB positive/JJ ,/, and/CC there/EX is/VBZ cause/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Koch/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN in/IN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ where/WRB the/DT prerequisites/NNS for/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO get/VB a/DT common/JJ transport/NN market/NN genuinely/VBG up/RP and/CC running/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD not/RB only/RB have/VB regulations/NNS but/CC that/IN these/DT regulations/NNS should/MD also/RB ,/, as/IN far/RB as/RB possible/JJ ,/, apply/VB to/TO every/DT country/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO conclude/VB by/IN commenting/VBG on/IN a/DT third/JJ matter/NN which/WDT is/VBZ also/RB of/IN significance/NN ,/, namely/RB an/DT amendment/NN tabled/VBN by/IN Member/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Ari/NNP Vatanen/NNP ./.

In/IN many/JJ ways/NNS ,/, the/DT prerequisites/NNS differ/VBP from/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP to/TO another/DT ./.

By/IN approving/VBG this/DT amendment/NN ,/, we/PRP take/VBP account/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB very/RB cold/JJ in/IN the/DT northern/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO also/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT ways/NNS in/IN which/WDT materials/NNS and/CC packaging/NN are/VBP affected/VBN by/IN cold/JJ of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN ,/, in/IN establishing/VBG the/DT present/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD also/RB be/VB flexible/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO accept/VB the/DT present/JJ amendment/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB not/RB only/JJ Mr/NNP Koch/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT Vice-President/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT clear/JJ and/CC unambiguous/JJ way/NN in/IN which/WDT they/PRP have/VBP declared/VBN their/PRP$ support/NN for/IN safety/NN in/IN the/DT transport/NN sector/NN and/CC acknowledged/VBD it/PRP as/IN a/DT priority/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN Mr/NNP Koch/NNP produced/VBD his/PRP$ sound/JJ report/NN was/VBD because/IN the/DT work/NN in/IN the/DT CEN/NNP and/CC within/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS Economic/NNP Commission/NNP was/VBD proceeding/VBG none/NN too/RB expeditiously/RB ./.

For/IN one/CD thing/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ :/: even/RB if/IN we/PRP come/VBP to/TO an/DT excellent/JJ arrangement/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, traffic/NN does/VBZ not/RB stop/VB at/IN our/PRP$ borders/NNS ,/, it/PRP goes/VBZ beyond/IN them/PRP ./.

Hence/RB there/EX is/VBZ certainly/RB every/DT reason/NN to/TO introduce/VB more/RBR far-reaching/JJ regional/JJ provisions/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP is/VBZ unable/JJ to/TO do/VB so/RB today/NN then/RB would/MD she/PRP be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO inform/VB the/DT committee/NN in/IN writing/VBG of/IN how/WRB matters/NNS stand/VBP and/CC what/WP stage/VBP negotiations/NNS between/IN the/DT CEN/NNP and/CC the/DT Economic/NNP Commission/NNP are/VBP at/IN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD once/RB again/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Koch/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ magnificent/JJ work/NN on/IN this/DT other/JJ report/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN a/DT way/NN supplements/VBZ the/DT debate/NN which/WDT we/PRP held/VBD in/IN October/NNP on/IN rail/NN transport/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT regret/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Committee/NNP for/IN Standardisation/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- CEN/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN able/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT required/VBN time/NN ,/, to/TO carry/VB out/RP the/DT amendment/NN of/IN the/DT provisions/NNS necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT required/VBN harmonisation/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT debate/NN and/CC the/DT amendment/NN of/IN the/DT directive/NN currently/RB in/IN force/NN allow/VBP us/PRP to/TO incorporate/VB differentiating/VBG elements/NNS which/WDT demonstrate/VBP the/DT diversity/NN of/IN this/DT Europe/NNP of/IN ours/PRP ./.

A/DT moment/NN ago/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Vatanen/NNP spoke/VBD to/TO us/PRP of/IN lower/JJR temperatures/NNS ,/, not/RB of/IN 20/CD degrees/NNS below/IN zero/CD ,/, but/CC of/IN 40/CD degrees/NNS below/IN zero/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP accepts/VBZ all/DT of/IN the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN the/DT parliamentary/JJ committee/NN and/CC the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Koch/NNP ,/, which/WDT are/VBP contained/VBN in/IN the/DT various/JJ amendments/NNS ,/, specifically/RB four/CD ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB accept/VBP the/DT four/CD amendments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12/CD p.m./RB Structural/JJ Funds/NNS -/: Cohesion/NNP Fund/NNP coordination/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ particularly/RB pleasing/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO make/VB my/PRP$ first/JJ speech/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP on/IN what/WP is/VBZ regarded/VBN as/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ issue/NN within/IN that/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP that/IN I/PRP represent/VBP in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, namely/RB Wales/NNP ./.

A/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN Wales/NNP ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN granted/VBN Objective/NNP 1/CD status/NN under/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS programme/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB clear/JJ that/IN many/JJ people/NNS within/IN Wales/NNP are/VBP looking/VBG to/TO the/DT European/JJ Structural/JJ Funds/NNS programme/NN to/TO alleviate/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT great/JJ difficulties/NNS that/IN we/PRP undoubtedly/RB face/VBP ./.

The/DT Committee/NNP rejected/VBD this/DT discriminatory/JJ proposal/NN and/CC decided/VBD that/IN all/DT refugees/NNS should/MD have/VB a/DT place/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/JJ programme/NN on/IN identical/JJ conditions/NNS ./.

Some/DT members/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, supported/VBD Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN and/CC wordings/VBZ ./.

As/IN I/PRP see/VBP it/PRP ,/, this/DT means/VBZ that/IN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ politics/NNS are/VBP already/RB casting/VBG their/PRP$ shadow/NN over/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB crucially/RB important/JJ that/IN the/DT Chamber/NNP should/MD be/VB as/RB emphatic/JJ as/IN it/PRP possibly/RB can/MD be/VB in/IN establishing/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN all/DT refugees/NNS are/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT place/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP programme/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP ,/, finally/RB ,/, to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP had/VBD certain/JJ misgivings/NNS last/JJ week/NN when/WRB we/PRP discussed/VBD the/DT formation/NN of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ Government/NN but/CC ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO discussing/VBG and/CC criticising/VBG its/PRP$ policy/NN on/IN refugees/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP no/DT misgivings/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Chamber/NNP will/MD be/VB just/RB as/RB committed/JJ this/DT time/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, during/IN the/DT last/JJ EU/NNP Financial/NNP Perspective/NNP from/IN 1994/CD to/TO 1999/CD ,/, when/WRB there/EX were/VBD 13/CD different/JJ initiatives/NNS in/IN operation/NN ,/, the/DT INTERREG/NNP II/NNP cross-border/JJ programme/NN was/VBD an/DT important/JJ initiative/NN ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT next/JJ round/NN of/IN Structural/NNP Funds/NNPS 2000-2006/NNP includes/VBZ the/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN is/VBZ I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, a/DT very/RB clear/JJ indication/NN of/IN the/DT importance/NN which/WDT is/VBZ attached/VBN to/TO it/PRP by/IN national/JJ EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNP ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP I/NN programme/NN between/IN 1989/CD and/CC 1993/CD and/CC the/DT INTERREG/NNP II/NNP programme/NN between/IN 1994/CD and/CC 1999/CD have/VBP proved/VBN an/DT absolute/JJ success/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN bridging/VBG closer/RBR social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ development/NN between/IN bordering/VBG Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Coming/VBG from/IN the/DT border/NN counties/NNS in/IN the/DT north-west/NN of/IN Ireland/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN over/IN the/DT years/NNS the/DT important/JJ role/NN which/WDT INTERREG/VBG I/PRP and/CC II/NNP have/VBP played/VBN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ to/TO welcome/VB INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ allocating/VBG 67/CD million/CD pounds/NNS towards/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP III/NNP programme/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB spent/VBN on/IN continuing/VBG the/DT development/NN of/IN cross-border/JJ economic/JJ projects/NNS between/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Ireland/NNP and/CC Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ played/VBN a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN developing/VBG the/DT border/NN county/NN region/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP over/IN the/DT years/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ the/DT single/JJ largest/JJS contributor/NN ,/, with/IN 80/CD million/CD pounds/NNS to/TO the/DT International/NNP Fund/NNP for/IN Ireland/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP contributes/VBZ 75/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT Peace/NN and/CC Reconciliation/NN programme/NN ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, INTERREG/NNP ,/, the/DT International/NNP Fund/NNP for/IN Ireland/NNP and/CC the/DT Peace/NN and/CC Reconciliation/NNP programme/NN have/VBP all/RB played/VBN an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT developing/VBG peace/NN process/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP taking/VBG the/DT floor/NN to/TO speak/VB about/IN INTERREG/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP shall/MD confine/VB myself/PRP to/TO a/DT few/JJ criticisms/NNS ,/, which/WDT will/MD clearly/RB also/RB enable/VB me/PRP to/TO keep/VB to/TO my/PRP$ speaking/NN time/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP all/RB spoken/VBN favourably/RB of/IN this/DT programme/NN '/POS s/JJ confirmation/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT sectors/NNS it/PRP covers/VBZ to/TO include/VB the/DT field/NN of/IN transnational/JJ and/CC interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD want/VB to/TO look/VB into/IN this/DT and/CC acknowledge/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN in/IN practical/JJ terms/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB just/RB with/IN a/DT formal/JJ tribute/NN ./.

Cross-border/NN cooperation/NN continues/VBZ almost/RB exclusively/RB to/TO be/VB an/DT issue/NN concerning/VBG landlocked/JJ areas/NNS and/CC ,/, where/WRB exceptions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN for/IN maritime/JJ areas/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ selection/NN is/VBZ not/RB transparent/JJ and/CC they/PRP often/RB suffer/VBP from/IN compensation/NN from/IN other/JJ Community/NNP policies/NNS ./.

This/DT discrimination/NN is/VBZ much/RB more/RBR serious/JJ for/IN islands/NNS that/WDT have/VBP a/DT regional/JJ status/NN that/WDT can/MD only/RB be/VB linked/VBN to/TO areas/NNS of/IN an/DT exclusively/JJ maritime/NN nature/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN ongoing/JJ discrimination/NN ,/, which/WDT ignores/VBZ Article/NNP 158/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN island/NN regions/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO cohesion/NN policies/NNS ./.

More/RBR serious/JJ still/RB is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ occurring/VBG while/IN ignoring/VBG the/DT new/JJ situation/NN associated/VBN with/IN the/DT approach/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN adopted/VBN towards/IN the/DT enlargement/JJ process/NN for/IN the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN regions/NNS such/JJ as/IN Malta/NNP ./.

This/DT has/VBZ given/VBN rise/NN to/TO the/DT proposals/NNS we/PRP are/VBP making/VBG to/TO at/IN least/JJS extend/VB the/DT regions/NNS eligible/JJ to/TO include/VB the/DT NUTS/NNP III/NNP Sicilian/NNP provinces/NNS which/WDT have/VBP a/DT frontier/NN with/IN Malta/NNP and/CC to/TO include/VB all/PDT the/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT Adriatic/NNP which/WDT share/VBP a/DT frontier/NN with/IN Balkan/JJ regions/NNS ./.

For/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ,/, probably/RB a/DT survival/NN of/IN our/PRP$ colonial/JJ heritage/NN ,/, our/PRP$ regions/NNS have/VBP fixed/VBN their/PRP$ attention/NN on/IN the/DT European/JJ mainland/NN ,/, ignoring/VBG and/CC even/RB scorning/VBG their/PRP$ closest/JJS neighbours/NNS ./.

That/DT time/NN is/VBZ now/RB past/JJ ./.

Our/PRP$ regions/NNS have/VBP become/VBN aware/JJ of/IN belonging/VBG to/TO an/DT environment/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP connected/VBN to/TO ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN geographical/JJ terms/NNS but/CC also/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ culture/NN and/CC the/DT history/NN of/IN their/PRP$ peoples/NNS ,/, hence/RB the/DT intensely/RB expressed/VBD aspiration/NN to/TO become/VB more/RBR deeply/RB rooted/VBN in/IN this/DT environment/NN ./.

This/DT increased/VBN awareness/NN does/VBZ not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, affect/VB identity/NN alone/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ fostered/VBN by/IN a/DT fair/JJ appraisal/NN of/IN our/PRP$ assets/NNS ./.

So/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT island/NN of/IN R脙/NNP 漏/NNP union/NN is/VBZ located/VBN on/IN a/DT trade/NN axis/NNS between/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN southern/JJ Africa/NNP and/CC those/DT of/IN south-east/JJ Asia/NNP ./.

It/PRP can/MD not/RB afford/VB to/TO remain/VB outside/IN the/DT regional/JJ alliances/NNS being/VBG forged/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, lest/IN it/PRP miss/VBP out/RP on/IN a/DT historic/JJ opportunity/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT same/JJ applies/VBZ to/TO our/PRP$ regions/NNS in/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP ./.

At/IN last/JJ we/PRP are/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN our/PRP$ young/JJ people/NNS may/MD start/VB to/TO see/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT tragic/JJ unemployment/NN ,/, the/DT source/NN of/IN so/RB much/JJ despair/NN ,/, if/IN we/PRP can/MD export/VB to/TO neighbouring/JJ countries/NNS the/DT know-how/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP gained/VBN thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ structural/JJ funds/NNS ./.

INTERREG/NNP appropriations/NNS may/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO make/VB our/PRP$ regions/NNS into/IN veritable/JJ European/JJ Union/NNP bridgeheads/NNS into/IN these/DT geographical/JJ areas/NNS ,/, giving/VBG it/PRP worldwide/JJ scope/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP counting/VBG on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC specifically/RB on/IN you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, to/TO allocate/VB adequate/JJ resources/NNS for/IN effective/JJ action/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNP ,/, I/PRP greatly/RB welcome/VBP the/DT possibilities/NNS for/IN increased/VBN trans-European/JJ cooperation/NN under/IN INTERREG/NNP ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ concern/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT proposal/NN offers/VBZ fewer/JJR opportunities/NNS in/IN this/DT respect/NN for/IN maritime/NN than/IN for/IN other/JJ areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ own/JJ concern/NN that/IN distance/NN may/MD prove/VB detrimental/JJ to/TO effective/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP many/JJ maritime/NN areas/NNS between/IN which/WDT links/NNS are/VBP already/RB established/VBN ./.

Various/JJ local/JJ authorities/NNS around/IN the/DT North/NNP Sea/NNP provide/VBP a/DT prime/JJ example/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

INTERREG/NNP could/MD well/RB allow/VB enhancement/NN of/IN such/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Such/JJ measures/NNS will/MD put/VB maritime/NN and/CC insular/NN areas/NNS on/IN an/DT equal/JJ footing/NN with/IN other/JJ areas/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ adoption/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN expertise/NN within/IN the/DT relevant/JJ organisations/NNS which/WDT deserves/VBZ to/TO be/VB shared/VBN ./.

We/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP the/DT recognition/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN evaluation/NN and/CC the/DT dissemination/NN of/IN best/JJS practice/NN for/IN the/DT tightening/VBG up/RP of/IN the/DT transnational/JJ level/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, as/IN others/NNS have/VBP said/VBN ,/, at/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS which/WDT seek/VBP to/TO exclude/VB even/RB further/RB some/DT of/IN society/NN '/POS s/CD most/JJS excluded/NNS ,/, by/IN aiming/VBG for/IN a/DT very/RB narrow/JJ definition/NN of/IN ``/`` refugee/NN ''/'' ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB supporting/VBG those/DT amendments/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB concerned/VBN at/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS which/WDT ,/, in/IN seeking/VBG to/TO introduce/VB greater/JJR flexibility/NN ,/, run/VBP the/DT risk/NN perhaps/RB of/IN obscuring/VBG responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT management/NN of/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB URBAN/NNP orientated/VBN towards/IN a/DT more/JJR integrated/VBN approach/NN which/WDT attempts/VBZ to/TO solve/VB interrelated/JJ problems/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP pursue/VB too/RB many/JJ objectives/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ overall/JJ effectiveness/NN suffers/VBZ ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, every/DT instance/NN of/IN a/DT deprived/VBN urban/JJ area/NN is/VBZ a/DT separate/JJ case/NN ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ factor/NN ,/, a/DT hard/JJ core/NN ,/, comprising/JJ unemployment/NN ,/, the/DT resignation/NN or/CC withdrawal/NN of/IN public/JJ services/NNS and/CC the/DT disappearance/NN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS ,/, both/DT commercial/NN and/CC other/JJ kinds/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD wish/VB URBAN/NNP to/TO be/VB orientated/VBN mainly/RB towards/IN providing/VBG answers/NNS to/TO those/DT causes/NNS of/IN urban/JJ deprivation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP shall/MD confine/VB my/PRP$ observations/NNS to/TO Mr/NNP Decourri脙拧re/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ./.

The/DT INTERREG/NNP Community/NNP Initiative/NNP Programme/NNP is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ tool/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT development/NN and/CC regional/JJ planning/NN of/IN European/JJ territory/NN ,/, most/RBS particularly/RB with/IN reference/NN to/TO effectively/RB taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ outlying/JJ regions/NNS ./.

INTERREG/NNP must/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB an/DT instrument/NN promoting/VBG territorial/JJ cohesion/NN throughout/IN the/DT Union/NNP if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT two/CD -/: or/CC even/RB three-speed/JJ European/JJ territory/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ representative/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN the/DT Regions/NNPS and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP should/MD have/VB been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT clearest/JJ way/NN possible/JJ and/CC at/IN the/DT earliest/JJS possible/JJ opportunity/NN framing/VBG this/DT programme/NN ./.

Even/RB though/IN I/PRP approve/VBP of/IN the/DT general/JJ guidelines/NNS of/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ to/TO ensure/VB better/JJR coordination/NN between/IN this/DT programme/NN ,/, financed/VBN by/IN the/DT ERDF/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT other/JJ external/JJ cooperation/NN funds/NNS ,/, including/VBG in/IN particular/JJ the/DT European/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, intended/JJ for/IN ACP/NNP countries/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP for/IN adopting/VBG one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ amendments/NNS adding/VBG the/DT EDF/NNP to/TO the/DT list/NN of/IN these/DT funds/NNS ./.

The/DT most/RBS remote/JJ regions/NNS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT four/CD French/JJ overseas/JJ departments/NNS ,/, must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO coordinate/VB INTERREG/NNP III/NNP and/CC the/DT EDF/NNP in/IN order/NN to/TO fund/VB ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, cooperation/NN projects/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ ACP/NNP neighbours/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ respective/JJ geographical/JJ areas/NNS ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO please/VB reconsider/VB the/DT limited/JJ opportunities/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN offered/VBN to/TO the/DT most/RBS remote/JJ and/CC island/NN regions/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT guidelines/NNS put/VBN forward/RB in/IN the/DT communication/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN these/DT regions/NNS to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO benefit/VB fully/RB from/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ,/, just/RB like/JJ all/PDT the/DT other/JJ regions/NNS in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, especially/RB now/RB that/IN the/DT REGIS/NNP programme/NN dedicated/VBN to/TO such/JJ isolated/VBN regions/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN dropped/VBN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN conclusion/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ regret/NN at/IN the/DT low/JJ level/NN of/IN funding/NN allocated/VBN to/TO strand/JJ C/NNP ,/, for/IN interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT added/VBN value/NN this/DT offers/VBZ the/DT Community/NNP is/VBZ undeniable/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ starting/JJ point/NN is/VBZ the/DT EQUAL/JJ report/NN and/CC equality/NN between/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, although/IN I/PRP must/MD admit/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ sometimes/RB hard/JJ to/TO talk/VB about/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT feeling/NN of/IN d脙/NN 漏/CD j脙/NN vu/NN about/IN it/PRP when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP my/PRP$ age/NN ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO point/VB out/RP again/RB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB equality/NN ./.

A/DT breakthrough/NN in/IN this/DT regard/NN may/MD perhaps/RB lead/VB to/TO changes/NNS in/IN other/JJ areas/NNS ,/, however/RB ./.

For/IN me/PRP ,/, equality/NN certainly/RB does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN both/DT parties/NNS to/TO a/DT marriage/NN work/VBP the/DT whole/JJ time/NN and/CC hand/NN the/DT children/NNS over/IN to/TO a/DT nanny/NN ,/, alias/VBZ an/DT immigrant/NN who/WP has/VBZ not/RB had/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO obtain/VB another/DT job/NN ./.

If/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP not/RB progressed/VBN one/CD little/JJ bit/NN since/IN pagan/NN times/NNS ./.

No/UH ,/, equality/NN means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP all/RB participate/VB in/IN both/DT working/JJ life/NN and/CC family/NN life/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, developments/NNS are/VBP not/RB moving/VBG in/IN that/DT direction/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, that/IN paragraph/NN 7/CD contains/VBZ something/NN very/RB central/JJ ,/, i.e./VBG that/IN EQUAL/NNP will/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN a/DT testing/NN ground/NN for/IN developing/VBG and/CC promoting/VBG new/JJ ways/NNS of/IN delivering/VBG employment/NN policies/NNS ./.

One/PRP can/MD only/RB hope/VB that/IN it/PRP succeeds/VBZ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, those/DT who/WP work/VBP on/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS know/VBP that/IN ,/, of/IN the/DT programmes/NNS which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ managed/VBN ,/, the/DT LEADER/JJ programme/NN ,/, both/DT LEADER/JJ I/NN and/CC LEADER/NNP II/NNP ,/, is/VBZ one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ success/NN stories/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT same/JJ will/MD be/VB true/JJ of/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN so/RB successful/JJ is/VBZ that/IN the/DT basic/JJ concept/NN of/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ programmes/NNS aroused/VBD substantial/JJ interest/NN in/IN activities/NNS amongst/IN the/DT population/NN concerned/VBN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ that/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP is/VBZ to/TO remain/VB true/JJ to/TO this/DT underlying/VBG concept/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, which/WDT we/PRP need/VBP to/TO address/VB together/RB ./.

Because/IN LEADER/NNP is/VBZ a/DT kind/NN of/IN workshop/NN with/IN a/DT bottom-up/JJ approach/NN ,/, a/DT huge/JJ number/NN of/IN ideas/NNS have/VBP come/VBN to/TO fruition/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS through/IN LEADER/NNP I/NNP and/CC II/NNP which/WDT of/IN course/NN at/IN some/DT point/NN will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB brand/NN new/JJ or/CC as/RB successful/JJ as/IN they/PRP once/RB were/VBD ./.

And/CC because/RB of/IN the/DT programme/NN '/POS s/JJ success/NN and/CC its/PRP$ basic/JJ approach/NN they/PRP will/MD of/IN course/NN at/IN some/DT point/NN then/RB be/VB dropped/VBN from/IN LEADER/NNP ./.

Of/IN course/NN this/DT is/VBZ also/RB the/DT basic/JJ idea/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ to/TO take/VB new/JJ ideas/NNS and/CC try/VB them/PRP out/RP in/IN LEADER/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT participants/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT local/JJ organisations/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN ,/, with/IN many/JJ non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT churches/NNS ,/, with/IN all/PDT those/DT who/WP have/VBP helped/VBN actually/RB to/TO get/VB new/JJ ideas/NNS up/RP and/CC running/VBG in/IN rural/JJ communities/NNS ./.

Here/RB we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT good/JJ schemes/NNS ,/, those/DT which/WDT are/VBP really/RB excellent/JJ ,/, are/VBP then/RB somehow/RB transferred/VBN into/IN rural/JJ development/NN policy/NN to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT future/NN of/IN this/DT laudable/JJ work/NN ./.

My/PRP$ request/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP should/MD make/VB sure/JJ that/IN the/DT organisations/NNS and/CC sections/NNS of/IN the/DT population/NN which/WDT get/VBP involved/VBN really/RB are/VBP accepted/VBN ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT attempt/NN to/TO have/VB one/CD or/CC other/JJ organisation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ just/RB being/VBG formed/VBN with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO contributing/VBG a/DT new/JJ idea/NN and/CC is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB so/RB well/RB known/VBN ,/, pushed/VBD a/DT little/JJ on/IN to/TO the/DT sidelines/NNS ,/, say/VBP because/RB of/IN official/NN local/JJ or/CC regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

Have/JJ faith/NN in/IN the/DT successful/JJ results/NNS which/WDT LEADER/NNP has/VBZ had/VBD so/RB far/RB ./.

At/IN the/DT beginning/NN it/PRP is/VBZ sometimes/RB a/DT little/JJ like/IN chasing/VBG a/DT rainbow/NN if/IN we/PRP say/VBP that/IN a/DT plan/NN is/VBZ too/RB idealistic/JJ ./.

And/CC then/RB when/WRB the/DT work/NN and/CC the/DT action/NN start/NN something/NN emerges/VBZ which/WDT the/DT official/JJ policy/NN ,/, including/VBG ourselves/PRP at/IN this/DT level/NN ,/, could/MD never/RB have/VB imagined/VBN would/MD suddenly/RB have/VB developed/VBN so/RB well/RB ./.

That/DT was/VBD the/DT charm/NN of/IN LEADER/NNP ,/, and/CC that/DT should/MD please/VB not/RB be/VB lost/VBN !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT EQUAL/JJ initiative/NN and/CC the/DT report/NN which/WDT highlights/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN actions/NNS to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN against/IN women/NNS and/CC actions/NNS to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN against/IN minority/NN groups/NNS ./.

Women/NNP are/VBP not/RB a/DT minority/NN and/CC often/RB suffer/VBP double/JJ discrimination/NN as/IN members/NNS of/IN minority/NN groups/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN because/RB of/IN their/PRP$ gender/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB specific/JJ action/NN for/IN women/NNS is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN mainstreaming/VBN ./.

The/DT report/NN addresses/VBZ this/DT and/CC proposes/VBZ integrating/VBG action/NN to/TO achieve/VB equality/NN between/IN women/NNS and/CC men/NNS in/IN all/DT aspects/NNS of/IN work/NN ;/: it/PRP also/RB recognises/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN working/VBG with/IN local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ bodies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP those/DT closest/JJS to/TO the/DT people/NNS to/TO help/VB ensure/VB that/IN all/DT project/NN results/NNS are/VBP mainstreamed/VBN ./.

The/DT involvement/NN of/IN voluntary/JJ and/CC community/NN groups/NNS will/MD also/RB be/VB an/DT essential/JJ ingredient/NN of/IN the/DT EQUAL/JJ initiative/NN and/CC the/DT projects/NNS ./.

The/DT development/NN partnerships/NNS within/IN the/DT thematic/JJ fields/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP referred/VBN to/TO in/IN Amendment/NNP No./NNP 22/CD ,/, would/MD enable/VB even/RB the/DT smaller/JJR organisations/NNS to/TO play/VB a/DT part/NN in/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN will/MD be/VB supporting/VBG Amendment/NNP No./NNP 22/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT report/NN under/IN discussion/NN in/IN the/DT House/NNP today/NN is/VBZ doubtless/RB of/IN great/JJ importance/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ working/VBG towards/IN ,/, the/DT strong/JJ point/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN INTERREG/NN for/IN the/DT 2000-2006/CD programming/NN period/NN lies/VBZ in/IN its/PRP$ added/VBN value/NN from/IN the/DT viewpoint/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ now/RB the/DT imminent/JJ enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO include/VB new/JJ Eastern/NNP European/NNP and/CC Mediterranean/NNP countries/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB in/IN anticipation/NN of/IN this/DT deadline/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD strive/VB to/TO reduce/VB disparities/NNS between/IN regions/NNS and/CC put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT isolation/NN of/IN border/NN areas/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, these/DT areas/NNS -/: and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ to/TO stress/VB this/DT -/: have/VBP an/DT important/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB as/IN an/DT interface/NN with/IN the/DT applicant/NN countries/NNS that/WDT are/VBP going/VBG to/TO join/VB the/DT Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB with/IN this/DT in/IN mind/NN that/IN I/PRP tabled/VBD some/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT I/PRP consider/VBP to/TO be/VB of/IN the/DT utmost/JJ importance/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, Transport/NNP and/CC Tourism/NNP has/VBZ subsequently/RB taken/VBN up/RP ./.

They/PRP call/VBP for/IN the/DT areas/NNS eligible/JJ for/IN cross-border/JJ cooperation/NN to/TO be/VB extended/VBN to/TO all/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT Adriatic/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN to/TO the/DT Sicilian/NNP provinces/NNS which/WDT have/VBP a/DT frontier/NN with/IN Malta/NNP -/: an/DT applicant/NN country/NN -/: which/WDT ,/, inexplicably/RB ,/, are/VBP not/RB currently/RB included/VBN in/IN strand/JJ A/NN ,/, Annex/NNP 1/CD ./.

I/PRP am/VBP confident/JJ that/IN Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP and/CC the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP will/MD duly/RB consider/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT matter/NN ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT Code/NNP of/IN Conduct/NNP ./.

There/EX are/VBP fundamental/JJ advantages/NNS for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN Europe/NNP for/IN it/PRP to/TO promote/VB cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT applicant/NN countries/NNS and/CC to/TO support/VB border/NN regions/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB hoped/VBN that/IN greater/JJR coordination/NN will/MD be/VB sought/VBN between/IN the/DT INTERREG/NNP initiative/NN and/CC the/DT existing/VBG Community/NNP programmes/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP significant/JJ for/IN external/JJ policy/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT vector/NN for/IN greater/JJR integration/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT joint/JJ drafting/NN of/IN programmes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNS ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, LEADER/VBD I/PRP was/VBD an/DT outright/JJ success/NN due/JJ ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, to/TO the/DT great/JJ flexibility/NN of/IN the/DT administrative/JJ management/NN between/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT local/JJ operators/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, regrettable/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP could/MD not/RB make/VB a/DT similar/JJ assessment/NN of/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP ,/, regarding/VBG the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT projects/NNS ,/, the/DT quantity/NN of/IN appropriations/NNS spent/VBN and/CC ,/, most/RBS especially/RB ,/, the/DT demotivation/NN of/IN some/DT local/JJ operators/NNS in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN the/DT administrative/JJ and/CC financial/JJ unwieldiness/NNS they/PRP encountered/VBD ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN under/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP ,/, new/JJ resources/NNS have/VBP been/VBN allocated/VBN to/TO helping/VBG rural/JJ territories/NNS to/TO develop/VB their/PRP$ potential/NN and/CC to/TO implement/VB the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN local/JJ and/CC sustainable/JJ development/NN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO put/VB special/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN trying/VBG out/RP new/JJ ways/NNS to/TO raise/VB the/DT profile/NN of/IN the/DT natural/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ heritage/NN and/CC to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT economic/JJ environment/NN ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO promote/VB employment/NN ./.

The/DT time/NN is/VBZ now/RB right/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, to/TO consider/VB including/VBG the/DT exchange/NN of/IN positive/JJ development/NN experience/NN in/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN transnational/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ interesting/JJ to/TO note/VB that/IN all/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS may/MD be/VB eligible/JJ for/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT opportunity/NN for/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO determine/VB the/DT areas/NNS ,/, within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN this/DT initiative/NN ,/, remains/VBZ available/JJ ,/, then/RB the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO ensure/VB a/DT certain/JJ focusing/NN of/IN resources/NNS and/CC prioritise/NN projects/NNS in/IN the/DT less/RBR prosperous/JJ areas/NNS ./.

There/EX must/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB transparency/RB regarding/VBG the/DT selection/NN criteria/NNS for/IN projects/NNS and/CC local/JJ action/NN groups/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB feel/VBP there/EX are/VBP grounds/NNS for/IN ensuring/VBG ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, that/IN the/DT financial/JJ channels/NNS of/IN States/NNPS or/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS are/VBP not/RB behind/IN the/DT delays/NNS in/IN payment/NN which/WDT may/MD have/VB caused/VBN some/DT LAGs/NNPS to/TO become/VB bankrupt/JJ under/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT Member/NNP from/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS ,/, I/PRP must/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB special/JJ afternoon/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN regional/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN two/CD Community/NNP initiatives/NNS ,/, URBAN/NNP and/CC INTERREG/NNP ./.

Like/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, we/PRP deplore/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN excluded/VBN from/IN strand/JJ IIIA/NNP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO INTERREG/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP very/RB happy/JJ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT reference/NN to/TO the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ monitoring/NN centre/NN concerned/VBN with/IN cooperation/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteurs/NNS ,/, particularly/RB Mr/NNP Decourri脙拧re/NNP ,/, for/IN his/PRP$ sensitivity/NN towards/IN the/DT regions/NNS and/CC for/IN accepting/VBG our/PRP$ amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP will/MD accept/VB the/DT proposal/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP making/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT various/JJ initiatives/NNS which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP analysing/VBG this/DT afternoon/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO concentrate/VB strictly/RB on/IN one/CD of/IN them/PRP ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG this/DT programme/NN today/NN because/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP insisted/VBD that/IN this/DT initiative/NN should/MD be/VB maintained/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP proposed/VBD removing/VBG it/PRP and/CC other/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, but/CC Parliament/NNP '/POS s/VBZ proposal/NN and/CC the/DT sensitivity/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP at/IN the/DT time/NN led/VBN to/TO the/DT URBAN/NNP initiative/NN being/VBG retained/VBN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD be/VB pleased/VBN about/IN this/DT ./.

But/CC what/WP were/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ arguments/NNS ,/, from/IN Commissioner/NNP Monika/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP and/CC Director-General/NNP Eneko/NNP Landaburu/NNP in/IN particular/NN ,/, for/IN eliminating/VBG the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN ?/.

Its/PRP$ argument/NN was/VBD one/CD of/IN priority/NN ./.

The/DT urban/JJ question/NN is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ that/IN we/PRP can/MD not/RB tighten/VB our/PRP$ belts/NNS and/CC undervalue/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT programme/NN which/WDT has/VBZ such/PDT a/DT small/JJ budget/NN ./.

Today/NN the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ in/IN place/NN and/CC therefore/RB I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP have/VBP achieved/VBN something/NN important/JJ ,/, that/IN distinguishing/JJ mark/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP called/VBD the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO address/VB Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP and/CC support/VB the/DT argument/NN of/IN Commissioner/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP and/CC the/DT Director-General/NN ,/, because/IN I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP were/VBD absolutely/RB right/JJ ./.

The/DT urban/JJ dimension/NN must/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN much/RB more/RBR deeply/RB in/IN all/PDT the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB I/PRP need/VBP to/TO restate/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN factors/NNS which/WDT demand/VBP this/DT investment/NN in/IN urban/JJ areas/NNS ,/, factors/NNS which/WDT are/VBP on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP that/IN we/PRP hope/VBP he/PRP will/MD be/VB sensitive/JJ in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

Organisations/NNS of/IN disabled/JJ people/NNS and/CC disabled/JJ people/NNS '/'' s/VBZ non-disabled/JJ representatives/NNS must/MD have/VB a/DT proper/JJ interest/NN at/IN every/DT stage/NN of/IN decision-making/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB this/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RP paragraphs/NNS 10/CD and/CC 15/CD of/IN the/DT resolution/NN ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS can/MD not/RB ignore/VB any/DT one/CD target/NN group/NN ./.

Disabled/JJ people/NNS have/VBP too/RB often/RB been/VBN left/VBN off/RP the/DT list/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN an/DT extra/JJ incentive/NN to/TO take/VB up/RP Community/NNP initiative/NN funding/NN and/CC an/DT excellent/JJ record/NN in/IN response/NN ./.

Former/NNP ADAPT/NNP projects/NNS range/VBP from/IN the/DT CORE/JJ project/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ developed/VBN new/JJ supply/NN chains/NNS for/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN in/IN Bedfordshire/NNP ,/, to/TO projects/NNS to/TO raise/VB standards/NNS in/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS in/IN Hertfordshire/NNP in/IN Essex/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN the/DT NOW/NNP project/NN helping/VBG 70/CD women/NNS to/TO return/VB to/TO work/VB in/IN Suffolk/NNP ,/, many/DT of/IN whom/WP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO come/VB and/CC share/VB the/DT results/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ experience/NN directly/RB with/IN us/PRP at/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN Brussels/NNP ./.

EQUAL/NNP remains/VBZ important/JJ to/TO us/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB in/IN relatively/RB more/RBR prosperous/JJ regions/NNS that/IN lower-skilled/JJ jobs/NNS are/VBP being/VBG shed/VBN ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB an/DT important/JJ first/JJ destination/NN for/IN those/DT discriminated/VBN against/IN in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, a/DT word/NN on/IN INTERREG/NNP ./.

It/PRP really/RB is/VBZ quite/RB nonsensical/JJ that/IN partnerships/NNS set/VBN up/RP in/IN 1994/CD are/VBP being/VBG rolled/VBN over/RP now/RB to/TO the/DT exclusion/NN of/IN new/JJ inter-regional/JJ links/NNS ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, will/MD each/DT proposal/NN contain/VB an/DT additional/JJ sheet/NN stating/VBG that/IN checks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN as/IN to/TO the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN and/CC the/DT following/JJ conclusion/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reached/VBN ?/. ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Dagmar/NNP Roth-Behrendt/NNP ,/, for/IN these/DT questions/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ shared/VBN by/IN the/DT whole/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ communication/NN which/WDT was/VBD written/VBN by/IN the/DT three/CD of/IN us/PRP ,/, David/NNP Byrne/NNP ,/, Erkki/NNP Liikanen/NNP and/CC myself/PRP ,/, but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN passed/VBN unanimously/RB in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP today/NN ./.

It/PRP received/VBD strong/JJ support/NN from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT Commissioners/NNPS and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN through/IN an/DT interservice/JJ consultation/NN in/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

So/IN we/PRP have/VBP really/RB worked/VBN through/IN this/DT document/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP all/RB able/JJ to/TO describe/VB the/DT guidelines/NNS and/CC the/DT principles/NNS as/IN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN this/DT document/NN ./.

Yes/UH ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB we/PRP already/RB use/VB this/DT way/NN of/IN working/VBG with/IN different/JJ ,/, difficult/JJ issues/NNS like/IN a/DT new/JJ chemical/NN strategy/NN for/IN example/NN ./.

And/CC ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN we/PRP will/MD also/RB mention/VB it/PRP explicitly/RB when/WRB we/PRP work/VBP with/IN this/DT principle/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP just/RB recently/RB had/VBN a/DT case/NN of/IN using/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD to/TO ban/VB phthalates/NNS in/IN soft/JJ PVC/NNP toys/NNS ;/: and/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP it/PRP in/IN several/JJ different/JJ environmental/JJ areas/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN mainly/RB used/VBN in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ field/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN also/RB when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO human/JJ health/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB clear/JJ about/IN how/WRB and/CC when/WRB to/TO use/VB it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, regarding/VBG the/DT relationship/NN between/IN science/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, and/CC applying/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, the/DT communication/NN states/VBZ that/IN invoking/VBG that/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN always/RB requires/VBZ a/DT political/JJ decision/NN if/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lack/NN of/IN scientific/JJ evidence/NN ./.

Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, this/DT accords/NNS science/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN power/NN ./.

We/PRP might/MD ask/VB ourselves/PRP ,/, what/WP kind/NN of/IN scientists/NNS will/MD supply/VB this/DT documentation/NN and/CC what/WP do/VBP they/PRP stand/VB for/IN ?/.

The/DT communication/NN also/RB states/VBZ that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN can/MD be/VB applied/VBN ,/, provided/VBD there/EX is/VBZ a/DT sufficient/JJ recognised/VBN minority/NN of/IN scientists/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB ,/, what/WP is/VBZ ,/, then/RB ,/, the/DT definition/NN of/IN a/DT recognised/VBN minority/NN ?/.

How/WRB would/MD you/PRP describe/VB this/DT ?/.

What/WP establishes/VBZ a/DT recognised/VBN minority/NN ?/.

If/IN a/DT political/JJ decision/NN is/VBZ involved/VBN ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO ask/VB :/: who/WP takes/VBZ this/DT political/JJ decision/NN ?/.

The/DT Commission/NNP ?/.

The/DT Council/NNP ?/.

And/CC to/TO what/WP extent/NN will/MD the/DT European/JJ Parliament/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO play/VB a/DT role/NN in/IN this/DT ?/.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ committees/NNS ?/.

What/WP ,/, also/RB ,/, will/MD be/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN authorities/NNS which/WDT you/PRP are/VBP about/IN to/TO set/VB up/RP ?/.

Finally/UH ,/, will/MD this/DT whole/JJ decision-making/JJ process/NN be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN a/DT transparent/JJ ,/, public/JJ way/NN ?/.

These/DT are/VBP my/PRP$ three/CD questions/NNS ./. ./.

Yes/UH ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, that/DT is/VBZ true/JJ ./.

There/EX were/VBD many/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ issues/NNS and/CC not/RB always/RB crystal/NN clear/VBP ,/, but/CC I/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO answer/VB some/DT questions/NNS ./.

Who/WP will/MD take/VB the/DT decision/NN ,/, who/WP are/VBP the/DT decision-makers/NNS ?/.

Well/UH ,/, that/DT depends/VBZ on/IN who/WP the/DT legislators/NNS are/VBP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN risk/NN management/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP to/TO look/VB at/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT concerns/NNS of/IN people/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO a/DT special/JJ issue/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP have/VBP to/TO judge/VB from/IN what/WP is/VBZ known/VBN about/IN the/DT scientific/JJ evidence/NN in/IN a/DT certain/JJ case/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB need/VB a/DT big/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ community/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO use/VB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

It/PRP can/MD be/VB used/VBN on/IN evidence/NN from/IN a/DT minority/NN or/CC where/WRB science/NN is/VBZ incomplete/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, where/WRB you/PRP strike/VBP a/DT balance/NN between/IN this/DT principle/NN as/IN a/DT political/JJ tool/NN and/CC science/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB always/RB easy/JJ to/TO describe/VB exactly/RB how/WRB this/DT process/NN is/VBZ done/VBN ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN changing/VBG the/DT scientific/JJ base/NN ./.

We/PRP use/VBP the/DT experts/NNS to/TO get/VB as/IN much/RB scientific/JJ information/NN and/CC facts/NNS as/RB possible/JJ before/IN we/PRP take/VBP a/DT decision/NN ;/: and/CC that/WDT should/MD also/RB be/VB done/VBN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO see/VB this/DT as/IN a/DT tool/NN for/IN risk/NN management/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO decide/VB whether/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO put/VB people/NNS in/IN danger/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, or/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO protect/VB the/DT environment/NN ;/: and/CC you/PRP have/VBP to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT science/NN that/WDT is/VBZ available/JJ ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO assess/VB all/PDT that/DT and/CC evaluate/VB the/DT science/NN ./.

Then/RB you/PRP decide/VBP to/TO take/VB a/DT measure/NN or/CC not/RB ,/, to/TO take/VB action/NN or/CC not/RB ./.

So/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT answer/NN to/TO all/PDT your/PRP$ questions/NNS but/CC this/DT does/VBZ not/RB change/VB the/DT system/NN of/IN the/DT scientists/NNS that/IN we/PRP use/VBP today/NN or/CC the/DT system/NN of/IN experts/NNS that/IN we/PRP use/VBP today/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT question/NN concerning/VBG an/DT actual/JJ ,/, concrete/JJ case/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP should/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO apply/VB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN brominated/JJ flame/NN retardants/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN that/IN these/DT substances/NNS are/VBP now/RB being/VBG discovered/VBN ./.

There/EX are/VBP increased/VBN concentrations/NNS of/IN them/PRP in/IN both/DT people/NNS and/CC the/DT environment/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP many/JJ people/NNS who/WP maintain/VBP that/IN they/PRP entail/VB major/JJ risks/NNS ,/, while/IN others/NNS question/VBP how/WRB large/JJ the/DT risks/NNS involved/VBN in/IN these/DT substances/NNS really/RB are/VBP ./.

Recently/RB ,/, both/DT Sweden/NNP and/CC Denmark/NNP urged/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT initiative/NN and/CC ban/VB brominated/JJ flame/NN retardants/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP wondering/VBG ,/, therefore/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP preparing/VBG such/PDT a/DT ban/NN and/CC if/IN it/PRP would/MD not/RB fit/VB in/RP very/RB well/RB with/IN your/PRP$ approach/NN to/TO the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN itself/PRP to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN such/PDT an/DT initiative/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, thank/VBP you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Mr/VBZ Sj脙/NNP 露/NNP stedt/JJ ,/, for/IN this/DT question/NN ./.

The/DT issue/NN of/IN brominated/JJ flame/NN retardants/NNS is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ one/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD raised/VBN quite/RB recently/RB in/IN the/DT Environment/NNP Council/NNP by/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN ministers/NNS who/WP want/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO look/VB at/IN what/WP basis/NN there/RB might/MD be/VB for/IN a/DT ban/NN and/CC at/IN what/WP might/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN looking/VBG into/IN this/DT question/NN and/CC assessing/VBG what/WP knowledge/VBD we/PRP have/VBP today/NN and/CC what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO do/VB ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO remind/VB you/PRP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN use/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN does/VBZ not/RB need/VB to/TO be/VB synonymous/JJ with/IN there/RB being/VBG a/DT total/JJ ban/NN ./.

There/EX may/MD be/VB a/DT series/NN of/IN different/JJ measures/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB taken/VBN ./.

It/PRP ought/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB immediately/RB interpreted/VBN as/IN a/DT ban/NN ./.

Where/WRB brominated/JJ flame/NN retardants/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, there/EX may/MD eventually/RB be/VB a/DT ban/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN permits/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ spectrum/NN of/IN political/JJ measures/NNS and/CC initiatives/NNS to/TO be/VB taken/VBN ./.

This/DT issue/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB topical/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ to/TO do/VB its/PRP$ job/NN and/CC give/VB proper/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT issue/NN before/IN we/PRP come/VBP back/RP with/IN an/DT assessment/NN of/IN what/WP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

You/PRP said/VBD that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN as/IN a/DT disguised/VBN trade/NN barrier/NN ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT understanding/NN of/IN this/DT point/NN the/DT same/JJ on/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT Atlantic/NNP Ocean/NNP ?/.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB problems/NNS particularly/RB with/IN hormone-treated/JJ beef/NN and/CC genetically/RB modified/VBN crops/NNS ./.

Will/MD the/DT Americans/NNPS take/VB the/DT same/JJ view/NN of/IN this/DT point/NN as/IN we/PRP do/VBP ?/. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/IN ,/, in/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP just/RB signed/VBN a/DT protocol/NN concerning/VBG bio-safety/NN ./.

We/PRP succeeded/VBD there/RB in/IN agreeing/VBG ,/, at/IN an/DT international/JJ forum/NN ,/, as/RB to/TO the/DT definition/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT breakthrough/NN that/IN we/PRP succeeded/VBD in/IN concluding/VBG this/DT protocol/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP will/MD set/VB the/DT trend/NN for/IN future/JJ discussions/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO use/VB this/DT as/IN an/DT example/NN of/IN how/WRB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB interpreted/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, moreover/RB ,/, also/RB accepted/VBN as/IN an/DT important/JJ and/CC effective/JJ tool/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP two/CD questions/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD try/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB brief/JJ indeed/RB ./.

The/DT first/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP have/VBP understood/VBN it/PRP ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT certain/JJ lack/NN of/IN clarity/NN in/IN some/DT respects/NNS as/IN to/TO how/WRB this/DT is/VBZ to/TO be/VB understood/VBN ./.

Is/VBZ it/PRP the/DT case/NN that/IN a/DT risk/NN assessment/NN is/VBZ firstly/JJ to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP ,/, including/VBG a/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN ?/.

In/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP rather/RB concerned/JJ ,/, because/IN the/DT idea/NN was/VBD really/RB that/IN a/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN as/IN a/DT tool/NN for/IN deciding/VBG whether/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN should/MD be/VB introduced/VBN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN should/MD come/VB first/RB ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT burden/NN of/IN proof/NN ./.

I/PRP remember/VBP Margot/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP being/VBG introduced/VBN as/IN Commissioner/NNP in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP ./.

At/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, she/PRP was/VBD talking/VBG about/IN the/DT desire/NN for/IN a/DT reversed/JJ burden/NN of/IN proof/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, a/DT product/NN '/POS s/JJ manufacturer/NN is/VBZ to/TO demonstrate/VB whether/IN or/CC not/RB the/DT product/NN is/VBZ hazardous/JJ ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB whether/IN this/DT also/RB applies/VBZ in/IN the/DT document/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ presented/VBN now/RB ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mrs/NNP Sch脙/NNP 露/VBZ rling/VBG ./.

These/DT are/VBP two/CD important/JJ questions/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN I/PRP should/MD be/VB given/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO clarify/VB them/PRP ./.

When/WRB ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN to/TO take/VB a/DT certain/JJ measure/NN ,/, the/DT one/NN chosen/VBN ought/MD to/TO be/VB cost-effective/JJ so/RB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN no/DT resort/NN to/TO measures/NNS which/WDT are/VBP wholly/RB unreasonable/JJ given/VBN their/PRP$ degree/NN of/IN effectiveness/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, the/DT case/NN that/IN one/PRP must/MD begin/VB with/IN a/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT reversed/JJ burden/NN of/IN proof/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ perfectly/RB correct/JJ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO apply/VB this/DT in/IN certain/JJ cases/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP used/VBN chemical/NN strategy/NN as/IN a/DT good/JJ example/NN of/IN an/DT area/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB this/DT ./.

There/EX ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN with/IN that/DT particular/JJ area/NN ,/, whereas/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB said/VBN that/IN the/DT present/JJ communication/NN concerning/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ horizontal/JJ in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN it/PRP concerns/VBZ the/DT full/JJ range/NN of/IN specific/JJ technical/JJ areas/NNS that/WDT are/VBP of/IN political/JJ concern/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT issues/NNS of/IN the/DT reversed/JJ burden/NN of/IN proof/NN and/CC of/IN what/WP the/DT burden/NN of/IN proof/NN is/VBZ to/TO look/VB like/IN are/VBP not/RB especially/RB discussed/VBN in/IN this/DT context/NN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT question/NN of/IN political/JJ decision-making/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT bases/NNS for/IN this/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, perfectly/RB correct/JJ that/IN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, to/TO chemicals/NNS ,/, we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP obtain/VBP a/DT reversed/JJ burden/NN of/IN proof/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB quite/RB radical/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO work/VB ,/, otherwise/RB we/PRP shall/MD always/RB be/VB confused/VBN by/IN all/PDT the/DT different/JJ interpretations/NNS possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB an/DT example/NN :/: a/DT fungicide/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proven/VBN to/TO cause/VB babies/NNS to/TO be/VB born/VBN blind/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB a/DT teratogenic/JJ substance/NN ./.

Very/RB well/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fungicide/NN ,/, it/PRP kills/VBZ off/RB mould/JJ ./.

This/DT teratogenicity/RB has/VBZ been/VBN demonstrated/VBN by/IN just/RB one/CD English/JJ laboratory/NN ,/, perhaps/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ one/NN that/WDT has/VBZ carried/VBN out/IN tests/NNS ./.

Now/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, given/VBN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ such/PDT a/DT serious/JJ risk/NN to/TO health/NN ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN lays/VBZ down/RP that/IN this/DT product/NN should/MD immediately/RB be/VB taken/VBN off/RP the/DT market/NN ,/, which/WDT New/NNP Zealand/NNP has/VBZ done/VBN ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

So/IN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO put/VB this/DT question/NN to/TO you/PRP ./.

When/WRB human/JJ health/NN is/VBZ at/IN stake/NN ,/, or/CC there/EX is/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN that/IN human/JJ health/NN will/MD be/VB seriously/RB affected/VBN ,/, should/MD we/PRP not/RB perhaps/RB carry/VB out/RP a/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN ?/.

The/DT cost/NN of/IN a/DT baby/NN being/VBG born/VBN blind/JJ is/VBZ too/RB high/JJ ;/: there/EX are/VBP no/DT benefits/NNS that/WDT can/MD compensate/VB for/IN this/DT ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO know/VB whether/IN in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN as/IN you/PRP understand/VBP it/PRP ,/, would/MD in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, require/VB the/DT product/NN to/TO be/VB taken/VBN off/RP the/DT market/NN ,/, until/IN such/JJ time/NN as/IN another/DT laboratory/NN provides/VBZ evidence/NN to/TO the/DT contrary/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, no/DT one/NN wants/VBZ more/RBR than/IN I/PRP do/VBP to/TO see/VB a/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO apply/VB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN radically/RB protecting/VBG people/NNS '/POS s/JJ health/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB adopt/VB a/DT stance/NN on/IN this/DT special/JJ case/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT particular/JJ product/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN mentioned/VBN here/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP shall/MD go/VB directly/RB back/RB and/CC see/VB what/WP I/PRP can/MD obtain/VB in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN information/NN about/IN this/DT particular/JJ case/NN ./.

The/DT truth/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN a/DT great/JJ many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC no/DT doubt/NN other/JJ nations/NNS too/RB ,/, have/VBP taken/VBN measures/NNS to/TO protect/VB their/PRP$ populations/NNS '/POS health/NN which/WDT amount/NN to/TO using/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB always/RB been/VBN called/VBN that/DT ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN a/DT question/NN of/IN cost/NN ;/: there/EX can/MD in/IN fact/NN be/VB an/DT enormous/JJ cost/NN to/TO society/NN if/IN the/DT decision/NN to/TO take/VB a/DT particular/JJ measure/NN is/VBZ avoided/VBN ./.

Nor/WP must/MD it/PRP be/VB a/DT case/NN of/IN sitting/VBG and/CC calculating/VBG the/DT value/NN of/IN a/DT human/JJ life/NN over/IN and/CC against/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN taking/VBG a/DT particular/JJ measure/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB obvious/JJ that/IN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ eventually/RB time/NN to/TO decide/VB upon/IN a/DT particular/JJ step/NN to/TO be/VB taken/VBN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB the/DT case/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ different/JJ courses/NNS of/IN action/NN to/TO choose/VB between/IN ./.

In/IN those/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, consideration/NN should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO what/WP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO produce/VB the/DT best/JJS result/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB forbear/VB telling/VBG you/PRP about/IN an/DT occasion/NN when/WRB the/DT expression/NN cost-effective/NN was/VBD used/VBN by/IN people/NNS whom/WP one/PRP can/MD not/RB perhaps/RB imagine/VB using/VBG it/PRP ,/, namely/RB when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD on/IN a/DT visit/NN to/TO Africa/NNP ./.

At/IN a/DT hospice/NN for/IN AIDS/NNP patients/NNS ,/, I/PRP met/VBD two/CD Irish/JJ Catholic/JJ nuns/NNS who/WP were/VBD caring/VBG for/IN dying/VBG AIDS/NNP patients/NNS ./.

They/PRP were/VBD the/DT first/JJ to/TO say/VB that/DT ,/, each/DT day/NN ,/, they/PRP must/MD think/VB about/IN doing/VBG what/WP is/VBZ most/RBS cost-effective/JJ because/IN resources/NNS had/VBD to/TO suffice/VB for/IN their/PRP$ poor/JJ patients/NNS there/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB very/RB careful/JJ about/IN how/WRB we/PRP use/VBP resources/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP can/MD learn/VB something/NN from/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP must/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, always/RB ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP use/VBP our/PRP$ resources/NNS in/IN the/DT most/RBS effective/JJ manner/NN and/CC in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN they/PRP provide/VBP the/DT broadest/JJS possible/JJ help/NN ./.

As/IN is/VBZ also/RB explained/VBN in/IN the/DT present/JJ communication/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB therefore/RB correct/JJ that/IN one/PRP must/MD first/RB begin/VB with/IN some/DT sort/NN of/IN cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN ./.

Consideration/NNP should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO what/WP science/NN is/VBZ offering/VBG in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN knowledge/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT should/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN an/DT important/JJ political/JJ tool/NN for/IN protecting/VBG the/DT environment/NN and/CC people/NNS '/POS s/JJ health/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT rare/JJ honour/NN to/TO be/VB given/VBN a/DT second/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO ask/VB questions/UH !/. ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO come/VB back/RP again/RB to/TO my/PRP$ first/JJ question/NN ,/, when/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD about/IN the/DT other/JJ Commissioners/NNS ,/, for/IN it/PRP may/MD have/VB sounded/VBN as/RB though/IN I/PRP was/VBD in/IN jest/NN ./.

Indeed/RB you/PRP responded/VBD in/IN kind/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP knew/VBD you/PRP would/MD do/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO something/NN Mr/NNP Goodwill/NNP asked/VBN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO the/DT connections/NNS we/PRP make/VBP between/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN and/CC the/DT world/NN beyond/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP good/JJ reason/NN for/IN asking/VBG this/DT ./.

As/IN you/PRP rightly/RB said/VBD ,/, the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN in/IN precisely/RB those/DT areas/NNS where/WRB ,/, as/IN yet/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT scientific/JJ evidence/NN ./.

How/WRB can/MD we/PRP ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB laying/VBG ourselves/PRP open/JJ to/TO attack/VB at/IN any/DT time/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN by/IN our/PRP$ partners/NNS in/IN the/DT USA/NNP ,/, on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT bio/NN safety/NN protocol/NN not/RB being/VBG adequate/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ purposes/NNS ?/.

How/WRB can/MD we/PRP be/VB sure/JJ that/IN those/DT of/IN your/PRP$ colleagues/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN industrial/JJ policy/NN and/CC foreign/JJ trade/NN policy/NN ,/, will/MD not/RB ,/, as/IN they/PRP did/VBD on/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ occasions/NNS with/IN your/PRP$ predecessors/NNS ,/, keep/VBP pulling/VBG the/DT carpet/NN from/IN underneath/IN you/PRP ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ all/RB about/IN ,/, otherwise/RB we/PRP might/MD as/RB well/RB not/RB bother/VB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN here/RB ,/, Commissioner/NNP !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ to/TO point/VB to/TO the/DT present/JJ communication/NN '/POS s/JJ guidelines/NNS for/IN using/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN as/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN repudiating/VBG assertions/NNS to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN we/PRP always/RB want/VBP to/TO use/VB the/DT principle/NN for/IN protectionist/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP certain/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB more/JJR conflicts/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN with/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB so/RB na脙/JJ 炉/CD ve/NN as/RB to/TO think/VB otherwise/RB ./.

Ever/RB since/IN we/PRP signed/VBD this/DT protocol/NN in/IN Montreal/NNP ,/, we/PRP nonetheless/RB have/VBP international/JJ recognition/NN and/CC a/DT common/JJ definition/NN written/VBN into/IN a/DT protocol/NN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, health/NN and/CC trade/NN ./.

This/DT constitutes/VBZ a/DT good/JJ example/NN ,/, therefore/RB ./.

We/PRP should/MD be/VB in/IN no/DT doubt/NN that/IN conflicts/NNS may/MD arise/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN too/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP can/MD now/RB show/VB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB use/VB the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN arbitrarily/RB ./.

We/PRP now/RB have/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN guidelines/NNS for/IN using/VBG the/DT precautionary/JJ principle/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP increased/VBN support/NN among/IN our/PRP$ respective/JJ peoples/NNS for/IN using/VBG it/PRP ,/, something/NN which/WDT is/VBZ clearly/RB established/VBN in/IN the/DT present/JJ communication/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0018/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mr/NNP Dimitrakopoulos/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Leinen/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, on/IN the/DT convening/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP -LSB-/NNP 14094/1999/CD -/: C5-0341/NNP //NNP 1999/CD -/: 1999/0825/CD -LRB-/-LRB- CNS/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- -RSB-/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD begin/VB by/IN thanking/VBG the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN all/PDT our/PRP$ recent/JJ very/RB useful/JJ contacts/NNS ./.

Let/VB me/PRP also/RB once/RB more/RBR thank/VBP my/PRP$ co-rapporteur/JJ Mr/NNP Leinen/NNP for/IN our/PRP$ excellent/JJ collaboration/NN ./.

The/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ about/IN to/TO begin/VB is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, both/DT in/IN a/DT general/JJ sense/NN and/CC more/RBR particularly/RB in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT imminent/JJ enlargement/NN ./.

The/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT Conference/NN will/MD determine/VB the/DT structure/NN and/CC method/NN based/VBN on/IN which/WDT Europe/NNP will/MD be/VB functioning/VBG in/IN the/DT twentieth/JJ century/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP of/IN the/DT future/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO function/NN more/RBR effectively/RB ,/, more/RBR democratically/JJ and/CC with/IN complete/JJ transparency/NN ,/, clearly/RB what/WP we/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ an/DT extensive/JJ and/CC in-depth/JJ reform/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS and/CC the/DT way/NN they/PRP work/VBP ./.

The/DT first/JJ and/CC substantive/JJ prerequisite/NN for/IN achieving/VBG that/DT reform/NN is/VBZ the/DT agenda/NN based/VBN on/IN which/WDT the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP is/VBZ to/TO begin/VB its/PRP$ work/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT decisions/NNS made/VBN at/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP Summit/NNP ,/, it/PRP emerges/VBZ that/IN the/DT agenda/NN agreed/VBD there/EX is/VBZ unsatisfactory/JJ and/CC does/VBZ not/RB guarantee/VB the/DT essential/JJ and/CC substantive/JJ changes/NNS required/VBN for/IN creating/VBG a/DT more/RBR functional/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, one/CD that/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR effective/JJ ,/, more/RBR democratic/JJ and/CC more/RBR transparent/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ because/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP agenda/NN is/VBZ limited/VBN to/TO consideration/NN only/RB of/IN the/DT three/CD issues/NNS that/WDT relate/VBP in/IN a/DT fragmentary/JJ way/NN to/TO the/DT structure/NN and/CC operation/NN of/IN just/RB two/CD of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutional/JJ bodies/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD not/RB repeat/VB which/WDT ones/NNS ,/, because/IN everyone/NN knows/VBZ ./.

My/PRP$ conclusion/NN is/VBZ justified/VBN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN by/IN the/DT constant/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB very/RB insistent/JJ demands/NNS of/IN the/DT peoples/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN by/IN the/DT huge/JJ scale/NN of/IN the/DT great/JJ enterprise/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ already/RB involved/JJ ,/, namely/RB enlargement/JJ ./.

Granted/VBN this/DT ,/, the/DT new/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP must/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO include/VB in/IN its/PRP$ agenda/NN issues/NNS which/WDT ,/, properly/RB addressed/VBN ,/, would/MD ensure/VB the/DT correct/JJ operation/NN of/IN all/DT and/CC not/RB just/RB some/DT of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

Just/RB as/IN it/PRP also/RB must/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO include/VB everyday/JJ issues/NNS which/WDT ,/, for/IN that/DT very/JJ reason/NN ,/, are/VBP highly/RB visible/JJ to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ numerous/JJ debates/NNS and/CC its/PRP$ reports/NNS so/RB far/RB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ openly/RB supported/VBN the/DT convening/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP asking/VBG for/IN it/PRP to/TO include/VB issues/NNS that/WDT improve/VB and/CC complement/VB the/DT reform/NN ,/, I/NN repeat/NN ,/, of/IN all/PDT the/DT institutional/JJ bodies/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN issues/NNS that/WDT are/VBP of/IN direct/JJ concern/NN and/CC interest/NN to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN such/JJ as/IN health/NN ,/, energy/NN ,/, culture/NN ,/, transport/NN and/CC even/RB tourism/NN ./.

Whether/IN or/CC not/RB the/DT agenda/NN will/MD ultimately/RB be/VB widened/VBN is/VBZ still/RB the/DT subject/NN of/IN debate/NN and/CC on/IN this/DT point/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO extol/VB the/DT political/JJ conduct/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ repeatedly/RB made/VBN a/DT commitment/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP to/TO make/VB the/DT necessary/JJ efforts/NNS towards/IN that/DT end/NN ./.

All/PDT the/DT same/JJ ,/, whether/IN or/CC not/RB more/JJR issues/NNS will/MD be/VB considered/VBN must/MD in/IN no/DT way/NN diminish/VB the/DT importance/NN attributed/VBN by/IN every/DT Member/NNP State/NNP to/TO the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ because/IN the/DT institutional/JJ framework/NN within/IN which/WDT Europe/NNP will/MD operate/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN is/VBZ a/DT foundation/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN and/CC is/VBZ therefore/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS national/JJ importance/NN for/IN every/DT one/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

You/PRP have/VBP to/TO admit/VB :/: this/DT is/VBZ a/DT joke/NN ./.

Tomorrow/NN ,/, we/PRP might/MD opt/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT weak/JJ and/CC permissive/JJ framework/NN which/WDT ruins/VBZ the/DT future/NN of/IN our/PRP$ children/NNS ./.

Either/CC we/PRP opt/VBP for/IN the/DT amendments/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN or/CC the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO finish/VB off/RP with/IN this/DT observation/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN months/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP witnessed/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN lobbying/VBG in/IN Belgium/NNP ./.

What/WP was/VBD remarkable/JJ about/IN this/DT dossier/NN was/VBD the/DT enormous/JJ pressure/NN from/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, this/DT pressure/NN was/VBD exerted/VBN by/IN both/DT Flemish/NNP and/CC Wallonian/NNP Environment/NNP administrations/NNS ./.

They/PRP have/VBP opted/VBN for/IN the/DT weak/JJ common/JJ position/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN our/PRP$ Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP more/RBR drastic/JJ positioning/NN ./.

I/PRP really/RB do/VBP wonder/VB whether/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT approach/NN of/IN which/WDT the/DT green/JJ Environment/NNP Ministers/NNPS in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN are/VBP aware/JJ ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, fine/JJ words/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR sufficient/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO change/VB tack/NN completely/RB ./.

During/IN the/DT vote/NN tomorrow/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ drafting/VBG a/DT responsible/JJ and/CC future-orientated/JJ water/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT can/MD only/RB benefit/VB our/PRP$ credibility/NN ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ suspended/VBN and/CC will/MD resume/VB at/IN 9/CD p.m./RB ./.

The/DT dialogue/NN on/IN Europe/NNP -/: institutional/JJ reform/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP communication/NN -/: The/DT dialogue/NN on/IN Europe/NNP -/: institutional/JJ reform/NN :/: the/DT issues/NNS at/IN stake/NN ./.

This/DT morning/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT lengthy/JJ debate/NN which/WDT I/PRP attended/VBD with/IN Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, many/JJ of/IN you/PRP mentioned/VBD the/DT lack/NN of/IN democracy/NN and/CC remoteness/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

Yet/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN who/WP does/VBZ what/WP ,/, as/IN one/CD of/IN you/PRP said/VBD very/RB clearly/RB and/CC forcefully/RB ./.

Ensuring/VBG that/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS understand/VBP who/WP does/VBZ what/WP in/IN our/PRP$ various/JJ institutions/NNS is/VBZ the/DT very/RB least/JJS we/PRP can/MD do/VB ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB now/RB explain/VB what/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG together/RB and/CC what/WP we/PRP want/VBP to/TO do/VB together/RB in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, particularly/RB with/IN the/DT countries/NNS which/WDT will/MD be/VB joining/VBG us/PRP ./.

We/PRP too/RB are/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN this/DT lack/NN of/IN democracy/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ therefore/RB decided/VBN to/TO launch/VB the/DT `/`` Dialogue/NNP on/IN Europe/NNP '/POS in/IN order/NN to/TO play/VB its/PRP$ part/NN in/IN this/DT direct/JJ contact/NN with/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.

This/DT initiative/NN will/MD be/VB launched/VBN on/IN the/DT day/NN after/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP to/TO conduct/VB this/DT initiative/NN in/IN cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

We/PRP will/MD produce/VB a/DT regular/JJ summary/NN of/IN this/DT initiative/NN so/RB that/IN public/JJ opinion/NN can/MD be/VB measured/VBN and/CC we/PRP can/MD adjust/VB or/CC reorient/VB the/DT work/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB hope/VBP to/TO conduct/VB this/DT initiative/NN in/IN consultation/NN with/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, local/JJ elected/JJ representatives/NNS ,/, non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ,/, socio-professional/JJ organisations/NNS and/CC the/DT media/NNS ./.

Opinion/NN multipliers/NNS ,/, political/JJ groups/NNS and/CC parties/NNS ,/, MEPs/NNP and/CC national/JJ MPs/NN ,/, elected/VBN representatives/NNS ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP just/RB said/VBN ,/, local/JJ authorities/NNS or/CC national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN the/DT Regions/NNPS ,/, the/DT Economic/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Committee/NNP ,/, organisations/NNS stemming/VBG from/IN civil/JJ society/NN and/CC university/NN and/CC education/NN circles/NNS will/MD all/RB be/VB involved/VBN ./.

Need/VB I/PRP remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP itself/PRP took/VBD the/DT initiative/NN on/IN 1/CD February/NNP ?/.

I/PRP must/MD again/RB thank/VB Mr/NNP Napolitano/NNP for/IN organising/VBG an/DT initial/JJ working/VBG meeting/NN with/IN the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS who/WP are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD propose/VB that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS become/VBP involved/VBN in/IN this/DT exercise/NN either/CC as/IN part/NN of/IN ad/FW hoc/FW cooperation/NN or/CC a/DT more/RBR structured/JJ partnership/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP setting/VBG up/RP a/DT media/NNS plan/NN and/CC close/JJ contacts/NNS with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP Presidency/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP indicated/VBN the/DT conditions/NNS under/IN which/WDT the/DT Commissioners/NNPS will/MD play/VB their/PRP$ part/NN through/IN public/JJ meetings/NNS and/CC visits/NNS ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO encourage/VB debate/NN among/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB took/VBD a/DT European/NNP Commissioner/NNP ,/, and/CC not/RB just/RB the/DT French/JJ ones/NNS ,/, or/CC ambassadors/NNS posted/VBD in/IN Paris/NNP or/CC MEPs/NNP to/TO engage/VB in/IN this/DT dialogue/NN each/DT week/NN ./.

This/DT made/VBD me/PRP realise/VBP that/IN people/NNS had/VBD many/JJ intelligent/JJ questions/NNS and/CC that/IN they/PRP needed/VBD to/TO be/VB respected/JJ ,/, listened/VBD to/TO and/CC informed/VBD ./.

So/IN this/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO do/VB ./.

We/PRP will/MD have/VB a/DT budget/NN of/IN approximately/RB EUR/$ 4/CD million/CD for/IN 2000/CD which/WDT you/PRP will/MD hopefully/RB approve/VB ./.

Financing/NNP from/IN the/DT 2001/CD budget/NN must/MD also/RB be/VB negotiated/VBN as/IN we/PRP want/VBP this/DT initiative/NN not/RB just/RB to/TO be/VB an/DT experiment/NN but/CC to/TO last/VB throughout/IN both/DT 2000/CD and/CC 2001/CD ./.

It/PRP will/MD therefore/RB be/VB ongoing/VBN throughout/IN the/DT negotiation/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP and/CC the/DT ratification/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD launch/VB this/DT dialogue/NN on/IN 8/CD March/NNP in/IN Brussels/NNP in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN 700/CD young/JJ Commission/NNP stagiaires/NNS ./.

You/PRP are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO ask/VB questions/NNS ,/, not/RB necessarily/RB make/VB lengthy/JJ statements/NNS ./.

You/PRP have/VBP one/CD minute/NN each/DT in/IN which/WDT to/TO ask/VB your/PRP$ question/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP also/RB speak/VB for/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS that/IN I/PRP chair/VBZ ,/, in/IN expressing/VBG my/PRP$ appreciation/NN of/IN this/DT Commission/NNP initiative/NN ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, this/DT initiative/NN is/VBZ consistent/JJ with/IN recommendations/NNS made/VBN by/IN Parliament/VBG itself/PRP in/IN its/PRP$ resolution/NN of/IN 18/CD November/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP also/RB heard/VBN Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP '/POS s/JJ clarification/NN of/IN relations/NNS and/CC links/NNS with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP during/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN this/DT programme/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP may/MD make/VB a/DT suggestion/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP ,/, would/MD it/PRP be/VB possible/JJ for/IN the/DT communication/NN to/TO say/VB something/NN more/JJR on/IN this/DT subject/NN ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT straightforward/JJ and/CC slightly/RB clinical/JJ phrase/NN which/WDT indicates/VBZ that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ?/.

We/PRP therefore/RB hope/VBP to/TO benefit/VB from/IN the/DT capable/JJ and/CC consistent/JJ participation/NN of/IN members/NNS of/IN national/JJ parliaments/NNS at/IN all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ meetings/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT will/MD be/VB a/DT channel/NN which/WDT will/MD ably/RB supplement/VB the/DT ones/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ initiative/NN ./.

You/PRP realise/VBP that/IN making/VBG a/DT success/NN of/IN this/DT dialogue/NN means/VBZ work/NN for/IN everyone/NN concerned/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ music/NN to/TO my/PRP$ ears/NNS to/TO hear/VB you/PRP use/VB the/DT word/NN `/`` citizen/NN '/'' so/RB often/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP increasingly/RB concerned/VBN in/IN this/DT House/NNP about/IN public/JJ opinion/NN ./.

The/DT fear/NN of/IN public/JJ opinion/NN is/VBZ a/DT rather/RB paternalistic/JJ concept/NN but/CC our/PRP$ House/NN is/VBZ what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ and/CC we/PRP must/MD do/VB what/WP we/PRP can/MD with/IN it/PRP ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP issue/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT specific/JJ question/NN for/IN you/PRP ./.

In/IN reply/NN to/TO your/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN on/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB established/VBN our/PRP$ position/NN on/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP because/IN we/PRP were/VBD waiting/VBG for/IN the/DT Dur/NNP report/NN which/WDT was/VBD published/VBN a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP promised/VBN ,/, will/MD complete/VB its/PRP$ proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT IGC/NNP opinion/NN about/IN the/DT legal/JJ system/NN and/CC the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP within/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT day/NN before/IN yesterday/RB ,/, there/EX was/VBD a/DT leading/VBG news/NN item/NN in/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ Danish/JJ news/NN programme/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO comment/VB on/RP ./.

The/DT story/NN went/VBD that/IN an/DT official/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP had/VBD apparently/RB told/VBN an/DT Austrian/JJ businessman/NN that/IN ,/, because/IN he/PRP was/VBD Austrian/JJ ,/, he/PRP would/MD possibly/RB be/VB excluded/VBN from/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO participate/VB in/IN a/DT scientific/JJ development/NN project/NN together/RB with/IN businesses/NNS in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ,/, including/VBG Denmark/NNP ./.

Will/MD you/PRP confirm/VB what/WP is/VBZ the/DT case/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP Haarder/NNP ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ knowledge/NN no/DT official/NN has/VBZ been/VBN authorised/VBN to/TO say/VB such/PDT a/DT thing/NN ./.

My/PRP$ personal/JJ opinion/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB wrong/JJ and/CC unfair/JJ to/TO penalise/VB the/DT Austrian/JJ people/NNS ,/, businesses/NNS and/CC employees/NNS because/RB of/IN concerns/NNS prompted/VBD by/IN the/DT establishment/NN in/IN Austria/NNP of/IN a/DT new/JJ government/NN coalition/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, subject/JJ to/TO verification/NN which/WDT I/PRP or/CC someone/NN else/RB will/MD give/VB immediately/RB after/IN this/DT sitting/VBG ,/, I/PRP can/MD confirm/VB what/WP you/PRP have/VBP just/RB said/VBN ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ never/RB said/VBN or/CC authorised/VBN anything/NN of/IN this/DT sort/NN ./.

Generally/RB speaking/VBG ,/, there/EX are/VBP other/JJ lessons/NNS to/TO be/VB learnt/VBN from/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP myself/PRP suggested/VBN various/JJ possible/JJ responses/NNS to/TO this/DT challenge/NN which/WDT serves/VBZ to/TO remind/VB us/PRP all/DT once/RB more/JJR what/WP we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN doing/VBG together/RB since/IN 1957/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT economic/JJ community/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB ,/, primarily/RB ,/, a/DT community/NN of/IN values/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP personally/RB have/VBP an/DT idea/NN to/TO supplement/VB Article/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT EU/NNP Treaty/NNP with/IN a/DT new/JJ paragraph/NN which/WDT would/MD give/VB the/DT democratic/JJ warning/NN or/CC monitoring/NN procedure/NN a/DT legal/JJ basis/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP have/VBP public/JJ debate/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO eliminate/VB misconceived/JJ ideas/NNS is/VBZ to/TO offer/VB alternatives/NNS ,/, which/WDT brings/VBZ me/PRP back/RP to/TO the/DT subject/NN of/IN our/PRP$ discussion/NN ./.

I/PRP firmly/RB believe/VBP in/IN the/DT democratic/JJ force/NN and/CC value/NN of/IN debate/NN ,/, particularly/RB to/TO fight/VB against/IN demagoguery/NN ./.

Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP ,/, you/PRP laid/VBD great/JJ stress/NN in/IN your/PRP$ statement/NN on/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

With/IN reference/NN to/TO the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, under/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP decisions/NNS the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP was/VBD given/VBN the/DT specific/JJ entitlement/NN to/TO add/VB to/TO the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP during/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

Clearly/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ representatives/NNS present/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP Brok/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Tsatsos/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Beazley/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ answer/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB yes/UH but/CC that/DT is/VBZ no/DT surprise/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Napolitano/NNP ,/, the/DT chairman/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ other/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC even/RB more/JJR MEPs/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP know/VBP that/IN ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD be/VB available/JJ to/TO tell/VB you/PRP how/WRB things/NNS are/VBP going/VBG as/IN they/PRP happen/VBP throughout/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT spirit/NN of/IN transparency/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD perhaps/RB say/VB this/DT differently/RB from/IN Mr/NNP Tsatsos/NNPS and/CC Mr/NNP Brok/NNP who/WP are/VBP your/PRP$ direct/JJ representatives/NNS but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB probable/JJ that/IN ,/, in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD say/VB this/DT together/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ that/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS is/VBZ not/RB secretive/JJ with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP or/CC the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS which/WDT ,/, when/WRB all/DT said/VBD and/CC done/VBN ,/, will/MD have/VB their/PRP$ opinions/NNS to/TO give/VB and/CC their/PRP$ positions/NNS to/TO take/VB in/IN the/DT ratification/NN process/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Napolitano/NNP '/POS s/JJ initiative/NN for/IN regular/JJ joint/JJ consultation/NN between/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS of/IN the/DT Fifteen/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/WDT ,/, the/DT duty/NN of/IN transparency/NN and/CC debate/NN starts/VBZ here/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP will/MD therefore/RB be/VB available/JJ whenever/WRB you/PRP want/VBP in/IN order/NN to/TO inform/VB you/PRP of/IN our/PRP$ positions/NNS and/CC the/DT progress/NN being/VBG made/VBN in/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS throughout/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, firstly/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO compliment/VB the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ approach/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB useful/JJ to/TO open/VB up/RP the/DT communication/NN channels/NNS with/IN the/DT citizen/NN at/IN an/DT early/JJ stage/NN ./.

This/DT did/VBD not/RB really/RB happen/VB for/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP or/CC the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Maastricht/NNP and/CC this/DT has/VBZ only/RB led/VBN to/TO a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN mistrust/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP two/CD questions/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, you/PRP mentioned/VBD that/IN you/PRP will/MD start/VB a/DT two-way/JJ dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT citizens/NNS and/CC I/PRP am/VBP already/RB making/VBG a/DT start/NN with/IN the/DT 700/CD placement/NN students/NNS at/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

Do/VBP you/PRP intend/VB to/TO address/VB the/DT citizens/NNS via/IN the/DT media/NNS as/RB well/RB ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB via/IN the/DT television/NN and/CC Internet/NN ?/.

My/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN is/VBZ of/IN a/DT critical/JJ nature/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ just/RB issued/VBN a/DT proposal/NN on/IN transparency/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP compare/VBP this/DT with/IN the/DT transparency/JJ proposal/NN which/WDT pertains/VBZ to/TO legislation/NN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, then/RB the/DT European/JJ model/NN is/VBZ vastly/RB overshadowed/VBN by/IN the/DT Dutch/JJ model/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT proposal/NN has/VBZ met/VBN with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN criticism/NN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN is/VBZ really/RB :/: how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP intend/VBP to/TO organise/VB transparency/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, because/IN the/DT present/JJ directive/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT good/JJ example/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

Mrs/NNP Maij-Weggen/NNP ,/, given/VBN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ensuring/VBG transparency/RB in/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ how/WRB business/NN will/MD be/VB conducted/VBN and/CC the/DT negotiations/NNS are/VBP starting/VBG right/RB now/RB ./.

The/DT group/NN of/IN representatives/NNS is/VBZ currently/RB meeting/VBG in/IN Brussels/NNP and/CC I/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO join/VB them/PRP as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

The/DT documents/NNS will/MD in/IN the/DT main/JJ be/VB open/JJ working/VBG documents/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD confirm/VB ,/, and/CC thank/VB you/PRP for/IN having/VBG asked/VBN me/PRP about/IN this/DT ,/, that/IN we/PRP will/MD use/VB all/PDT the/DT most/JJS modern/NN means/NNS ,/, television/NN in/IN particular/NN ,/, to/TO broadcast/VB our/PRP$ public/JJ debates/NNS in/IN each/DT country/NN and/CC even/RB across/IN Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP will/MD open/VB an/DT Internet/NN forum/NN and/CC create/VB permanent/JJ discussion/NN forums/NNS ./.

The/DT Commissioners/NNPS will/MD undertake/VB to/TO respond/VB rapidly/RB to/TO any/DT questions/NNS raised/VBN ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT modern/JJ means/NN to/TO be/VB used/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP must/MD also/RB make/VB the/DT effort/NN to/TO get/VB as/IN close/RB as/RB possible/JJ to/TO the/DT people/NNS ./.

Although/IN this/DT may/MD be/VB a/DT rather/RB Utopian/JJ ideal/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP a/DT Commissioner/NNP ,/, when/WRB he/PRP can/MD ,/, an/DT MEP/NNP ,/, a/DT minister/NN to/TO attend/VB public/JJ debates/NNS in/IN all/PDT the/DT regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP evidence/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ possible/JJ ./.

The/DT majority/NN of/IN you/PRP hold/VBP these/DT debates/NNS in/IN your/PRP$ constituencies/NNS and/CC regions/NNS ./.

Although/IN this/DT may/MD seem/VB rather/RB egotistical/JJ ,/, I/PRP want/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT minds/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS ,/, to/TO have/VB a/DT face/NN and/CC for/IN those/DT people/NNS forming/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO meet/VB our/PRP$ citizens/NNS as/RB often/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP '/POS s/JJ commitment/NN to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT regions/NNS ,/, both/DT to/TO explain/VB and/CC to/TO listen/VB to/TO what/WP citizens/NNS have/VBP to/TO say/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO invite/VB him/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ own/JJ region/NN of/IN Yorkshire/NNP ,/, a/DT major/JJ European/JJ region/NN that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT full/JJ participant/NN in/IN the/DT single/JJ European/JJ market/NN and/CC a/DT major/JJ recipient/NN of/IN European/JJ structural/JJ funding/NN ./.

He/PRP can/MD come/VB with/IN both/PDT the/DT hats/NNS that/IN he/PRP wears/VBZ as/IN a/DT Commissioner/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB him/PRP how/WRB vigorous/JJ the/DT Commission/NN will/MD be/VB in/IN this/DT information/NN campaign/NN ?/.

In/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN providing/VBG information/NN to/TO a/DT public/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB as/RB well/RB informed/JJ as/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB important/JJ but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN combating/VBG the/DT misinformation/NN that/WDT is/VBZ put/VBN around/RP by/IN a/DT very/RB active/JJ anti-European/JJ movement/NN and/CC anti-European/JJ organisations/NNS that/WDT exist/VBP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB vigorous/JJ in/IN the/DT responses/NNS that/IN it/PRP puts/VBZ out/RP to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT comments/NNS that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB receiving/VBG as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT campaign/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP ,/, thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ comments/NNS ./.

I/PRP willingly/RB accept/VBP your/PRP$ invitation/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP have/VBP understood/VBN you/PRP correctly/RB ,/, you/PRP want/VBP me/PRP ,/, when/WRB I/PRP come/VBP to/TO Yorkshire/NNP ,/, to/TO talk/VB not/RB only/RB about/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS but/CC also/RB the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD perform/VB this/DT dual/JJ task/NN ./.

I/PRP forgot/VBD to/TO mention/VB my/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO go/VB before/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB done/VBN ,/, not/RB only/JJ by/IN meeting/VBG their/PRP$ representatives/NNS here/RB but/CC by/IN going/VBG to/TO see/VB them/PRP in/IN situ/NN ./.

Ten/CD days/NNS ago/RB I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Westminster/NNP ,/, so/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB ,/, Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP ,/, that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB afraid/JJ of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS ./.

Next/JJ week/NN I/PRP will/MD go/VB to/TO the/DT Bundestag/NN in/IN Berlin/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP already/RB appeared/VBN before/IN the/DT French/NNP Senate/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, throughout/IN this/DT debate/NN ,/, whenever/WRB I/PRP can/MD ,/, I/PRP will/MD go/VB directly/RB to/TO see/VB the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS too/RB ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT dialogue/NN with/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN propaganda/NN or/CC marketing/NN ,/, nor/CC even/RB of/IN communication/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP this/DT dialogue/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT real/JJ dialogue/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, after/IN a/DT short/JJ film/NN objectively/NN explaining/VBG the/DT challenges/NNS of/IN institutional/JJ reform/NN ,/, those/DT in/IN the/DT public/JJ gallery/NN can/MD participate/VB in/IN an/DT open/JJ discussion/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO join/VB Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP '/POS s/JJ study/NN group/NN with/IN the/DT 700/CD trainees/NNS so/RB that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ some/DT people/NNS to/TO discuss/VB matters/NNS with/IN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB much/JJ fun/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, having/VBG to/TO discuss/VB transparency/JJ and/CC intergovernmental/JJ conferences/NNS with/IN yourself/PRP ./.

Is/VBZ not/RB Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP nervous/JJ about/RB penetrating/VBG the/DT inner/JJ workings/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS election/NN processes/NNS ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, these/DT issues/NNS which/WDT people/NNS go/VBP to/TO the/DT polls/NNS about/RB and/CC which/WDT lead/VBP to/TO new/JJ majorities/NNS in/IN the/DT Folketing/NN and/CC other/JJ parliaments/NNS ./.

Can/MD such/JJ matters/NNS be/VB controlled/VBN from/IN Brussels/NNP ?/.

Is/VBZ this/DT an/DT element/NN in/IN the/DT radical/JJ decentralisation/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP talked/VBD about/RB this/DT morning/NN ?/.

I/PRP was/VBD very/RB glad/JJ to/TO learn/VB last/JJ week/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ giving/VBG close/JJ attention/NN over/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN years/NNS to/TO the/DT concept/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN and/CC its/PRP$ reference/NN ,/, not/RB merely/RB to/TO relations/NNS between/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC Member/NNP States/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT Union/NNP ,/, the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, regions/NNS and/CC cities/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN in/IN his/PRP$ pursuit/NN of/IN dialogue/NN around/IN the/DT regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP will/MD expand/VB upon/IN that/DT thought/NN and/CC learn/VB from/IN what/WP he/PRP hears/VBZ ./.

Do/VBP you/PRP believe/VB that/IN these/DT proposals/NNS ,/, or/CC proposals/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN ,/, form/VBP part/NN of/IN the/DT mandate/NN of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP as/IN defined/VBN in/IN Helsinki/NNP ?/.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB so/RB ./.

Are/VBP you/PRP not/RB afraid/JJ that/IN such/JJ penalties/NNS might/MD get/VB out/RP of/IN hand/NN and/CC serve/VB to/TO punish/VB not/RB violations/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS but/CC simple/JJ differences/NNS of/IN opinion/NN ,/, unpopular/JJ opinions/NNS or/CC deviations/NNS from/IN the/DT dominant/JJ European/JJ thinking/NN ?/.

Yes/UH ,/, Mr/NNP Bonde/NNP ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB starting/VBG this/DT debate/NN with/IN 700/CD young/JJ people/NNS in/IN Brussels/NNP who/WP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB working/VBG in/IN the/DT institutions/NNS and/CC with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB good/JJ to/TO start/VB this/DT dialogue/NN with/IN young/JJ people/NNS who/WP are/VBP motivated/VBN ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD confirm/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP made/VBN proposals/NNS about/IN qualified/JJ majority/NN or/CC unanimous/JJ voting/NN but/CC these/DT are/VBP regardless/RB of/IN ideology/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD very/RB briefly/NN like/VB to/TO give/VB an/DT explanation/NN of/IN vote/NN ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT PPE/NNP Group/NNP on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP report/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP followed/VBN a/DT nominal/JJ list/NN which/WDT was/VBD identical/JJ to/TO that/DT which/WDT we/PRP had/VBD agreed/VBN upon/IN beforehand/RB with/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP ./.

The/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ now/RB changed/VBN its/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT report/NN is/VBZ not/RB as/RB clear/JJ as/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP abstaining/VBG ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT EQUAL/JJ report/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ for/IN refugees/NNS ,/, the/DT elderly/JJ ,/, the/DT handicapped/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, simply/RB goes/VBZ ahead/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ regrettable/JJ that/IN ,/, due/JJ to/TO the/DT procedure/NN ,/, the/DT report/NN has/VBZ received/VBN such/JJ unfavourable/NN attention/NN in/IN this/DT plenary/JJ session/NN ./.

These/DT were/VBD our/PRP$ reasons/NNS for/IN abstaining/VBG from/IN the/DT vote/NN on/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP EQUAL/NNP to/TO go/VB ahead/RB ./.

We/PRP assent/VBZ to/TO the/DT main/JJ thrust/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC we/PRP deplore/VBP the/DT procedure/NN and/CC especially/RB the/DT fact/NN that/IN some/DT groups/NNS have/VBP exploited/VBN this/DT procedure/NN to/TO their/PRP$ advantage/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Pensioners/NNPS '/POS Party/NNP in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP abstained/VBD in/IN the/DT vote/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN because/IN ,/, although/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ more/JJR support/NN than/IN in/IN the/DT past/NN for/IN projects/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN combating/VBG age/NN discrimination/NN ,/, its/PRP$ proposals/NNS are/VBP not/RB sufficiently/RB trenchant/JJ or/CC specific/JJ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN for/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS to/TO stop/VB experimenting/VBG and/CC trying/VBG to/TO establish/VB best/JJS practices/NNS for/IN doing/VBG what/WP we/PRP should/MD do/VB and/CC begin/VB to/TO give/VB European/JJ citizens/NNS some/DT firm/NN indication/NN regarding/VBG what/WP Europe/NNP wants/VBZ Europe/NNP to/TO be/VB ./.

The/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN for/IN concrete/JJ measures/NNS and/CC for/IN putting/VBG theory/NN into/IN practice/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- DA/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- We/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT communication/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP concerning/VBG the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN EU/JJ initiative/NN programmes/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- CIP/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Basically/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP opposed/VBN to/TO programmes/NNS and/CC structural/JJ funds/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN but/CC ,/, since/IN the/DT vote/NN is/VBZ only/RB concerned/JJ with/IN how/WRB -/: and/CC not/RB to/TO what/WDT extent/NN -/: these/DT resources/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB used/VBN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP simply/RB adopted/VBN a/DT position/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.

We/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO guarantee/VB equal/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN the/DT groups/NNS discussed/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- We/PRP did/VBD not/RB vote/VB against/IN this/DT report/NN insofar/RB as/IN it/PRP contains/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN correct/JJ general/JJ principles/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO combat/VB racism/NN in/IN the/DT workplace/NN and/CC reduce/VB inequalities/NNS between/IN the/DT sexes/NNS on/IN the/DT job/NN market/NN ./.

Nor/CC did/VBD we/PRP vote/VB for/IN it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ all/RB too/RB vague/JJ ,/, all/DT too/RB pie/NN in/IN the/DT sky/NN ./.

And/CC yet/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT chapter/NN on/IN aid/NN and/CC training/NN for/IN refugees/NNS ,/, the/DT report/NN marks/VBZ a/DT step/NN backwards/RB from/IN the/DT initial/JJ text/NN by/IN stipulating/VBG that/IN they/PRP no/RB longer/RB apply/VBP to/TO refugees/NNS as/IN such/JJ but/CC to/TO ``/`` refugees/NNS within/IN the/DT meaning/NN of/IN the/DT Geneva/NNP Convention/NNP ''/'' ./.

This/DT restriction/NN is/VBZ inadmissible/JJ at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB countless/JJ refugees/NNS throughout/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP in/IN a/DT drastic/JJ situation/NN ,/, with/IN no/DT protection/NN ,/, forced/VBN to/TO work/VB on/IN the/DT black/JJ market/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO hide/VB ,/, while/IN so-called/JJ democratic/JJ governments/NNS and/CC state/NN police/NN forces/NNS hunt/VBZ them/PRP down/RP ./.

I/PRP voted/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN as/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO continue/VB the/DT work/NN begun/VBN under/IN the/DT previous/JJ NOW/NNP ,/, HORIZON/NNP ,/, YOUTHSTART/NNP and/CC INTEGRA/NNP strands/NNS of/IN the/DT ADAPT/NNP and/CC EMPLOYMENT/NNP initiatives/NNS ./.

The/DT lessons/NNS we/PRP have/VBP learned/VBN under/IN these/DT actions/NNS must/MD be/VB built/VBN on/RP ./.

EQUAL/NNP stands/VBZ for/IN ``/`` equality/NN ''/'' ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB seen/VBN to/TO deliver/VB ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN concentration/NN on/IN promoting/VBG new/JJ ways/NNS of/IN combating/VBG discrimination/NN and/CC any/DT form/NN of/IN inequality/NN in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB favour/VBP the/DT desire/NN to/TO move/VB away/RP from/IN an/DT out-dated/JJ format/NN and/CC to/TO bring/VB partners/NNS together/RB in/IN search/NN of/IN innovative/JJ ways/NNS to/TO tackle/VB unemployment/NN ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB flexibility/NN ./.

I/PRP deeply/RB regret/VBP that/IN only/RB limited/VBN funds/NNS are/VBP available/JJ for/IN this/DT initiative/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT last/JJ programming/NN period/NN 9/CD %/NN of/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS were/VBD available/JJ for/IN Community/NNP initiatives/NNS ./.

The/DT figure/NN is/VBZ now/RB 5.35/CD %/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN funds/NNS must/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO achieve/VB maximum/JJ effect/NN and/CC information/NN on/IN successful/JJ partnerships/NNS must/MD be/VB widely/RB and/CC rapidly/RB disseminated/VBN ./.

The/DT Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNP Committee/NNP adopted/VBD several/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS I/PRP put/VBD forward/RB ,/, concerning/VBG for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT emphasis/NN on/IN access/NN to/TO start-up/JJ capital/NN ,/, how/WRB to/TO exploit/VB new/JJ business/NN opportunities/NNS in/IN cities/NNS ,/, towns/NNS and/CC rural/JJ areas/NNS and/CC the/DT criticism/NN that/IN under/IN the/DT previous/JJ initiatives/NNS there/EX was/VBD inadequate/JJ participation/NN by/IN business/NN ./.

This/DT often/RB meant/VBD that/IN good/JJ projects/NNS did/VBD not/RB lead/VB to/TO real/JJ job/NN opportunities/NNS ./.

The/DT positive/JJ experience/NN of/IN innovative/JJ actions/NNS of/IN small/JJ promoters/NNS was/VBD jeopardised/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ distance/NN from/IN the/DT policy/NN process/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB stressed/VBD the/DT need/NN for/IN prevention/NN ./.

The/DT involvement/NN of/IN the/DT social/JJ partners/NNS also/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB highlighted/VBN ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB flexibility/NN and/CC the/DT administrative/JJ burden/NN must/MD be/VB reduced/VBN as/IN a/DT priority/NN ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB flexibility/NN also/RB for/IN countries/NNS with/IN small/JJ budgets/NNS ./.

While/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT report/NN which/WDT I/PRP believe/VBP would/MD be/VB better/RBR dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN a/DT different/JJ way/NN ,/, overall/RB I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT report/NN offers/VBZ a/DT flexible/JJ and/CC sensible/JJ approach/NN and/CC should/MD be/VB supported/VBN ./.

Accordingly/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD use/VB this/DT initiative/NN to/TO develop/VB what/WP it/PRP considers/VBZ to/TO be/VB new/JJ ways/NNS of/IN fighting/VBG discrimination/NN and/CC inequality/NN of/IN all/DT kinds/NNS in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN the/DT four/CD pillars/NNS of/IN the/DT employment/NN policy/NN guidelines/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO build/VB on/IN such/JJ fragile/JJ foundations/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB this/DT new/JJ approach/NN some/DT chance/NN of/IN success/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD have/VB opted/VBN for/IN a/DT less/RBR complicated/JJ proposal/NN ,/, a/DT more/RBR simple/JJ and/CC direct/JJ one/NN ,/, involving/VBG the/DT NGOs/NNPS from/IN the/DT outset/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN partnerships/NNS could/MD develop/VB in/IN a/DT balanced/JJ way/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP did/VBD not/RB do/VB that/DT ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN it/PRP will/MD at/IN least/JJS revisit/VB the/DT aspects/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP mentioned/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, some/DT of/IN us/PRP in/IN Parliament/NNP will/MD remember/VB the/DT successful/JJ film/NN ,/, ``/`` Cocoon/NN ''/'' ,/, in/IN which/WDT some/DT elderly/JJ people/NNS drank/VBD a/DT special/JJ kind/NN of/IN water/NN that/WDT made/VBD them/PRP young/JJ again/RB ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, immensely/RB important/JJ to/TO exercise/VB extreme/JJ vigilance/NN over/IN the/DT water/NN we/PRP all/DT drink/VBP and/CC ,/, consequently/RB ,/, to/TO study/VB and/CC approve/VB the/DT provisions/NNS referred/VBN to/TO here/RB ./.

For/IN that/DT reason/NN ,/, I/PRP approved/VBD these/DT measures/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO express/VB the/DT hope/NN that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB particularly/RB rigorous/JJ monitoring/NN of/IN water/NN purity/NN at/IN the/DT point/NN where/WRB it/PRP enters/VBZ our/PRP$ houses/NNS ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ of/IN the/DT highest/JJS level/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT measures/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN adopted/VBN ,/, I/PRP note/VBP that/IN support/NN for/IN people/NNS who/WP purify/VBP their/PRP$ water/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ homes/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN omitted/VBN ./.

The/DT ``/`` physico-chemical/JJ and/CC ecological/JJ quality/NN of/IN water/NN ''/'' was/VBD highlighted/VBN during/IN the/DT debate/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT proposals/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT adverse/JJ effects/NNS of/IN other/JJ aspects/NNS was/VBD ,/, at/IN best/RBS ,/, touched/VBN upon/IN marginally/RB ./.

Public/JJ health/NN and/CC the/DT supply/NN of/IN drinking/NN water/NN are/VBP at/IN stake/NN ,/, as/IN are/VBP biological/JJ quality/NN and/CC diversity/NN and/CC the/DT conservation/NN of/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS and/CC species/NNS ./.

From/IN this/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, the/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ weak/JJ ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, I/PRP object/VBP to/TO this/DT systematically/JJ applied/JJ strategy/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ messages/NNS to/TO our/PRP$ citizens/NNS and/CC to/TO the/DT Council/NNP are/VBP muddled/VBN and/CC lack/VBP credibility/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD other/JJ specific/JJ point/NN which/WDT is/VBZ dear/RB to/TO me/PRP :/: Member/NNP States/NNPS should/MD be/VB able/JJ ,/, if/IN they/PRP so/RB wish/VBP ,/, to/TO set/VB up/RP trans-national/JJ water/NN transfers/NNS ./.

This/DT type/NN of/IN project/NN complies/NNS with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN regional/JJ cohesion/NN and/CC solidarity/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP always/RB defended/VBN ,/, and/CC ,/, as/IN such/JJ ,/, should/MD enjoy/VB the/DT widespread/JJ support/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT promotion/NN of/IN trans-European/JJ networks/NNS and/CC regional/JJ policy/NN -LRB-/-LRB- through/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB the/DT House/NNP that/IN we/PRP adopted/VBD an/DT own/JJ initiative/NN report/NN on/IN the/DT technical/JJ feasibility/NN of/IN trans-European/JJ water/NN networks/NNS two/CD years/NNS ago/RB and/CC I/PRP would/MD be/VB most/RBS obliged/VBN if/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP could/MD shortly/RB tell/VB Parliament/NNP what/WP action/NN it/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN on/IN that/DT report/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- ES/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- We/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN a/DT report/NN concerned/VBN with/IN water/NN quality/NN in/IN Europe/NNP transformed/VBD into/IN an/DT instrument/NN of/IN commercial/JJ war/NN ./.

Equality/NNP must/MD permeate/VB not/RB only/JJ projects/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS but/CC also/RB all/DT overarching/JJ goals/NNS ,/, action/NN plans/NNS and/CC strategies/NNS ./.

It/PRP would/MD appear/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP in/IN agreement/NN about/IN this/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, responsibility/NN for/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN due/JJ attention/NN is/VBZ given/VBN to/TO equality/NN lies/VBZ with/IN departmental/NN and/CC unit/NN managers/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT latter/NN do/VBP not/RB have/VB the/DT required/JJ professional/JJ competence/NN ,/, then/RB nothing/NN will/MD happen/VB and/CC gender/NN mainstreaming/NN will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB a/DT priority/NN ./.

Extremely/JJ few/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Development/NNP ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB unit/NN managers/NNS and/CC more/JJR senior/JJ managers/NNS ,/, have/VBP taken/VBN part/NN in/IN the/DT gender/NN courses/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN organised/VBN ./.

Only/RB one/CD manager/NN has/VBZ participated/VBN in/IN gender/NN training/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN half/PDT a/DT day/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ naturally/RB unacceptable/JJ ./.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP prepared/VBN to/TO do/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN unit/NN managers/NNS and/CC more/JJR senior/JJ managers/NNS go/VBP through/IN the/DT necessary/JJ gender/NN training/NN ?/.

Gender/NNP has/VBZ in/IN fact/NN been/VBN included/VBN in/IN the/DT compulsory/JJ introductory/JJ course/NN for/IN new/JJ employees/NNS ,/, but/CC then/RB with/IN only/RB one/CD to/TO two/CD hours/NNS devoted/VBN to/TO it/PRP on/IN each/DT course/NN ./.

This/DT limited/JJ training/NN element/NN has/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, been/VBN removed/VBN from/IN all/DT introductory/JJ courses/NNS which/WDT have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN in/IN recent/JJ times/NNS ./.

As/IN I/PRP point/VBP out/RP in/IN my/PRP$ question/NN ,/, one/CD to/TO two/CD days/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB one/CD to/TO two/CD hours/NNS ,/, need/VBP to/TO be/VB devoted/VBN to/TO the/DT subject/NN ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN is/VBZ this/DT :/: is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP really/RB prepared/JJ to/TO comply/VB with/IN the/DT adopted/JJ guidelines/NNS for/IN gender/NN mainstreaming/NN at/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Development/NNP ?/.

Well/UH I/PRP certainly/RB take/VBP gender/NN mainstreaming/VBG seriously/RB and/CC so/RB does/VBZ my/PRP$ colleague/NN Commissioner/NNP Nielson/NNP ./.

That/DT goes/VBZ for/IN everybody/NN at/IN whatever/WDT level/NN of/IN seniority/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB something/NN which/WDT more/RBR senior/JJ officials/NNS can/MD deem/VB appropriate/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ juniors/NNS but/CC think/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP too/RB grown-up/JJ or/CC too/RB senior/JJ to/TO receive/VB themselves/PRP ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS approaches/NNS to/TO this/DT issue/NN is/VBZ to/TO integrate/VB gender/NN as/IN an/DT important/JJ and/CC cross-cutting/JJ issue/NN into/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ courses/NNS for/IN development/NN officials/NNS and/CC above/IN all/DT perhaps/RB for/IN the/DT project/NN cycle/NN management/NN course/NN which/WDT is/VBZ key/JJ to/TO good/JJ management/NN of/IN projects/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN ./.

So/IN I/PRP sympathise/VBP very/RB much/JJ with/IN what/WP the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT approach/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP following/VBG both/DT demonstrates/JJ practicality/NN and/CC the/DT imperative/NN of/IN giving/VBG this/DT the/DT attention/NN which/WDT it/PRP deserves/VBZ ./.

The/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN European/JJ Union/NNP aid/NN has/VBZ been/VBN provided/VBN under/IN the/DT TACIS/NNP programme/NN ./.

Security/NNP considerations/NNS have/VBP prevented/VBN Tajikistan/NNP from/IN benefiting/VBG fully/RB from/IN TACIS/NNP but/CC a/DT rehabilitation/NN programme/NN of/IN EUR/$ 7.2/CD million/CD has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN place/NN in/IN 1998/CD and/CC 1999/CD ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO national/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ supported/VBN important/JJ regional/JJ actions/NNS in/IN the/DT energy/NN ,/, transport/NN and/CC environmental/JJ sectors/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP services/NNS set/VBD up/RP a/DT procedure/NN for/IN joint/JJ meetings/NNS and/CC discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT Danish/JJ Government/NN with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO finding/VBG a/DT common/JJ language/NN and/CC a/DT common/JJ approach/NN ./.

The/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN is/VBZ not/RB restricted/VBN to/TO certain/JJ groups/NNS of/IN people/NNS ./.

Its/PRP$ purpose/NN is/VBZ to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN in/IN the/DT workplace/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ aspect/NN of/IN this/DT initiative/NN ./.

The/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN programme/NN in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP must/MD comply/VB with/IN the/DT regulation/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ as/IN the/DT Social/NNP Fund/NNP regulation/NN ,/, i.e./NNP EQUAL/NNP comes/VBZ under/IN the/DT Social/NNP Fund/NNP regulation/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN submitted/VBN to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC we/PRP expect/VBP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN next/JJ month/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB that/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN satisfies/VBZ national/JJ requirements/NNS and/CC national/JJ plans/NNS defined/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN agreed/JJ European/JJ strategy/NN ./.

The/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, i.e./VBG the/DT national/JJ governments/NNS ,/, have/VBP primary/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN setting/VBG up/RP the/DT joint/JJ agencies/NNS ,/, submitting/VBG proposals/NNS ,/, selecting/VBG the/DT proposals/NNS which/WDT the/DT programmes/NNS will/MD implement/VB and/CC carrying/VBG out/RP primary/JJ control/NN ./.

Within/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Employment/NNP is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN implementation/NN ,/, while/IN financial/JJ control/NN is/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Financial/NNP Control/NNP ,/, the/DT Anti-Fraud/JJ Office/NN and/CC the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Auditors/NNS ./.

The/DT last/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT amount/NN granted/VBN ./.

Greece/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN granted/VBN ECU/VB 98/CD million/CD ./.

The/DT contribution/NN commitment/NN is/VBZ 80/CD %/NN ,/, rising/VBG to/TO an/DT 85/CD %/NN contribution/NN from/IN the/DT initiative/NN for/IN the/DT island/NN regions/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT remote/JJ Greek/JJ islands/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT contribution/NN by/IN Greece/NNP of/IN 15/CD %/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT Community/NNP EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN ,/, especially/RB the/DT four/CD actions/NNS described/VBD in/IN it/PRP ,/, will/MD result/VB both/DT in/IN complicated/JJ bureaucracy/NN and/CC ,/, paradoxically/RB ,/, a/DT non-transparent/JJ structure/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, one/PRP wonders/VBZ how/WRB a/DT development/NN partnership/NN will/MD prove/VB its/PRP$ cooperative/JJ spirit/NN or/CC its/PRP$ representative/JJ capacity/NN ,/, as/IN required/JJ by/IN action/NN 2/CD in/IN paragraph/NN 33/CD of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT obligation/NN to/TO engage/VB in/IN transnational/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, the/DT complicated/JJ demands/NNS of/IN the/DT plan/NN and/CC the/DT implementation/NN of/IN a/DT development/NN partnership/NN inevitably/RB require/VBP large/JJ structures/NNS ,/, as/IN these/DT are/VBP the/DT only/JJ structures/NNS which/WDT can/MD meet/VB such/JJ demands/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP consider/VBP the/DT overall/JJ amount/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ on/IN the/DT small/JJ side/NN ,/, -/: EUR/$ 2.8/CD billion/CD for/IN 15/CD Member/NNPS States/NNPS -/: and/CC how/WRB ambitious/JJ the/DT objectives/NNS are/VBP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP afraid/JJ that/IN all/DT we/PRP shall/MD succeed/VB in/IN doing/VBG is/VBZ to/TO prove/VB that/IN unemployment/NN is/VBZ a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN ./.

First/NNP let/VBD me/PRP say/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT great/JJ help/NN to/TO us/PRP ,/, now/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN the/DT stage/NN where/WRB this/DT is/VBZ being/VBG processed/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, if/IN you/PRP could/MD make/VB specific/JJ proposals/NNS which/WDT we/PRP could/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN the/DT gap/NN between/IN rich/JJ and/CC poor/JJ widen/NNS ./.

What/WP is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, deeply/RB damaging/JJ for/IN us/PRP is/VBZ the/DT belief/NN that/IN in/IN some/DT way/NN the/DT granting/NN of/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS assistance/NN is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN ,/, in/IN a/DT sense/NN ,/, a/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP ask/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ensures/VBZ that/IN Structural/JJ Fund/NNP monies/NNS are/VBP spent/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT is/VBZ transparent/JJ ./.

Too/RB much/RB of/IN what/WP takes/VBZ place/NN within/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ not/RB transparent/JJ ./.

It/PRP could/MD be/VB said/VBN that/IN the/DT omission/NN gives/VBZ the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP too/RB has/VBZ no/DT idea/NN how/WRB to/TO provide/VB maximum/JJ coordination/NN between/IN European/JJ Social/NNP Fund/NNP assistance/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ subject/JJ to/TO review/VB after/IN three/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN years/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS annual/JJ national/JJ plans/NNS for/IN employment/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT proposal/NN presented/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN its/PRP$ mandate/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ starting/VBG point/NN for/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Agriculture/NNP and/CC Rural/NNP Development/NNP ./.

This/DT ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT deficiencies/NNS in/IN the/DT networks/NNS of/IN infrastructures/NNS and/CC services/NNS and/CC a/DT generally/RB very/RB low/JJ level/NN of/IN employment/NN ,/, which/WDT furthermore/RB is/VBZ seasonal/JJ and/CC lacks/VBZ diversity/NN ,/, exacerbates/VBZ the/DT exodus/NN from/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

The/DT consequences/NNS do/VBP not/RB inspire/VB hope/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT young/JJ people/NNS who/WP are/VBP disappearing/VBG ,/, who/WP are/VBP getting/VBG an/DT education/NN and/CC finding/VBG work/NN outside/NN of/IN the/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT has/VBZ an/DT unfavourable/JJ effect/NN on/IN those/DT areas/NNS ./.

This/DT lack/NN of/IN infrastructure/NN is/VBZ also/RB an/DT obstacle/NN to/TO the/DT establishment/NN of/IN companies/NNS and/CC the/DT creation/NN of/IN jobs/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO remember/VB that/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS represent/VBP almost/RB four/CD fifths/NNS of/IN the/DT territory/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Agriculture/NNP only/RB provides/VBZ 5.5/CD %/NN of/IN employment/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, three/CD quarters/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ farm/NN workers/NNS are/VBP part-time/JJ and/CC require/VBP supplements/NNS to/TO their/PRP$ incomes/NNS ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO take/VB these/DT five/CD points/NNS into/IN account/NN when/WRB establishing/VBG the/DT conclusions/NNS on/IN the/DT four/CD pillars/NNS because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, maintaining/VBG the/DT population/NN in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT priority/NN objectives/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN thanking/VBG Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, for/IN her/PRP$ work/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT work/NN has/VBZ been/VBN carried/VBN out/RP extremely/RB well/RB ./.

We/PRP feel/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP takes/VBZ account/NN of/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS adopted/VBD by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, at/IN least/JJS in/IN spirit/NN ,/, because/IN at/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, it/PRP might/MD seem/VB as/RB though/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG here/RB is/VBZ a/DT useless/JJ exercise/NN ,/, and/CC nothing/NN but/CC hot/JJ air/NN ./.

The/DT truth/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN though/RB is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP believe/VBP -/: and/CC this/DT is/VBZ also/RB shown/VBN in/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT conclusions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN drafted/VBN -/: that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD take/VB account/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ adopted/VBN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN an/DT interim/JJ revision/NN of/IN these/DT directives/NNS ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT more/RBR rapid/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ boost/NN for/IN attaining/VBG these/DT objectives/NNS ,/, we/PRP think/VBP that/IN those/DT who/WP generate/VBP employment/NN ,/, the/DT real/JJ entrepreneurs/NNS and/CC those/DT who/WP really/RB guarantee/VBP new/JJ sources/NNS of/IN employment/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, businesspeople/NN ,/, must/MD participate/VB in/IN this/DT initiative/NN ./.

Small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, need/VBP to/TO take/VB part/NN in/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN these/DT funds/NNS ./.

If/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB ,/, if/IN businesspeople/NN feel/VBP marginalised/JJ ,/, if/IN entrepreneurs/NNS can/MD not/RB take/VB part/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN managing/VBG but/CC also/RB in/IN receiving/VBG these/DT funds/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB missed/VBN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO attain/VB our/PRP$ objectives/NNS more/RBR rapidly/RB ./.

Also/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO attain/VB our/PRP$ objectives/NNS ,/, to/TO overcome/VB the/DT disparities/NNS between/IN regions/NNS and/CC to/TO seek/VB out/RP sources/NNS of/IN employment/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ to/TO give/VB our/PRP$ complete/JJ support/NN to/TO new/JJ technologies/NNS ,/, to/TO transport/NN and/CC communications/NNS networks/NNS and/CC to/TO renewable/VB energies/NNS ./.

All/DT of/IN this/DT must/MD be/VB done/VBN -/: I/PRP repeat/VB -/, with/IN the/DT participation/NN of/IN private/JJ business/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, by/IN uniting/VBG its/PRP$ efforts/NNS with/IN those/DT of/IN public/JJ administrations/NNS ,/, but/CC complementing/VBG them/PRP ,/, never/RB obstructing/VBG or/CC excluding/VBG them/PRP ,/, will/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT creation/NN of/IN wealth/NN in/IN society/NN and/CC of/IN jobs/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ incumbent/JJ upon/IN me/PRP to/TO remind/VB my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Evans/NNP ,/, of/IN why/WRB Wales/NNP actually/RB achieved/VBD Objective/NN 1/CD status/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD because/RB of/IN the/DT discredited/JJ policies/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ Conservative/JJ Party/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP also/RB remind/VB him/PRP that/IN when/WRB his/PRP$ party/NN leader/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Hague/NNP ,/, was/VBD Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP for/IN Wales/NNP ,/, he/PRP broke/VBD every/DT rule/NN in/IN the/DT book/NN on/IN additionality/NN which/WDT led/VBD to/TO a/DT stern/JJ letter/NN from/IN Commissioner/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP regarding/VBG regulatory/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT British/JJ Government/NN is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ regulatory/JJ requirements/NNS on/IN Objective/NNP 1/CD additionality/RB ./.

I/PRP suggest/VBP Mr/NNP Evans/NNP goes/VBZ back/RB and/CC reads/VBZ the/DT regulation/NN ./.

My/NNP Group/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN extensive/JJ amendments/NNS to/TO both/DT reports/NNS up/RB for/IN debate/NN today/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO focus/VB our/PRP$ minds/NNS on/IN the/DT essential/JJ role/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO identify/VB the/DT skills/NNS and/CC potential/NN of/IN our/PRP$ regions/NNS in/IN the/DT hi-tech/JJ sector/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN reports/NNS in/IN the/DT media/NNS that/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ rapidly/RB losing/VBG ground/NN to/TO the/DT US/NNP in/IN the/DT hi-tech/JJ growth/NN industries/NNS of/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

The/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ round/NN of/IN programmes/NNS is/VBZ also/RB very/RB instructive/JJ in/IN telling/VBG us/PRP what/WP guidelines/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB about/IN ./.

They/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB about/IN creating/VBG additional/JJ layers/NNS of/IN bureaucracy/NN and/CC red/JJ tape/NN ./.

They/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB about/IN shifting/VBG priorities/NNS and/CC policies/NNS halfway/RB through/IN project/NN development/NN ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN inevitable/JJ delays/NNS and/CC underspends/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ budgetary/JJ requirement/NN ./.

The/DT implementation/NN and/CC operation/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB left/VBN to/TO the/DT personal/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN one/CD or/CC other/JJ desk/NN officer/NN ,/, either/CC in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP or/CC in/IN the/DT civil/JJ service/NN ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB an/DT internal/JJ coherence/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP directorate/NN ,/, while/IN respecting/VBG the/DT specific/JJ local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN Commission/NNP programmes/NNS ./.

The/DT conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD make/VB the/DT case/NN for/IN guidelines/NNS to/TO be/VB broad/JJ ,/, indicative/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ to/TO assist/VB our/PRP$ programme/NN managers/NNS and/CC fund-users/NNS and/CC to/TO get/VB the/DT maximum/JJ potential/NN out/RP of/IN our/PRP$ new/JJ fields/NNS of/IN regeneration/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP can/MD inject/VB a/DT spirit/NN of/IN entrepreneurial/JJ activity/NN into/IN our/PRP$ poor/JJ and/CC structurally/RB weak/JJ regions/NNS we/PRP will/MD eventually/RB get/VB them/PRP back/RB onto/IN the/DT road/NN of/IN attracting/VBG substantial/JJ investor/NN confidence/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB the/DT key/NN to/TO future/JJ success/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP for/IN an/DT excellent/JJ report/NN ./.

She/PRP has/VBZ gone/VBN into/IN the/DT issue/NN in/IN some/DT depth/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT committee/NN debate/NN she/PRP took/VBD account/NN of/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN tabled/VBN regarding/VBG this/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ also/RB quite/RB rightly/RB stated/VBN that/IN Parliament/NNP was/VBD not/RB heard/VBN in/IN time/NN regarding/VBG the/DT guidelines/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP badly/RB behind/RB now/RB in/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

Hopefully/RB ,/, the/DT stands/NNS Parliament/NNP has/VBZ taken/VBN will/MD help/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT mid-term/JJ appraisal/NN of/IN the/DT programmes/NNS and/CC in/IN their/PRP$ practical/JJ implementation/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT report/NN grew/VBD too/RB large/JJ when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD being/VBG debated/VBN ./.

It/PRP contained/VBD details/NNS and/CC issues/NNS that/WDT had/VBD already/RB been/VBN raised/VBN in/IN previous/JJ reports/NNS ./.

At/IN this/DT stage/NN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN assessing/VBG how/WRB we/PRP can/MD use/VB this/DT process/NN to/TO steer/VB Union/NNP regional/JJ policy/NN ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN the/DT aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB regional/JJ inequality/NN ./.

Our/NNP Group/NNP emphasises/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT role/NN of/IN local/JJ players/NNS in/IN drafting/VBG and/CC implementing/VBG programmes/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ especially/RB important/JJ to/TO get/VB SMEs/NNP involved/VBN in/IN the/DT planning/NN and/CC implementation/NN of/IN programmes/NNS ./.

Our/NNP Group/NNP also/RB considers/VBZ it/PRP important/JJ to/TO take/VB greater/JJR account/NN of/IN remote/JJ and/CC peripheral/JJ areas/NNS and/CC wishes/VBZ to/TO increase/VB interaction/NN between/IN towns/NNS and/CC rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

We/PRP oppose/VBP the/DT excessive/JJ control/NN the/DT central/JJ administration/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ Member/NNP States/NNPS exercises/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP calling/VBG for/IN a/DT reduction/NN in/IN the/DT bureaucracy/NN that/WDT has/VBZ taken/VBN root/NN in/IN the/DT drafting/NN and/CC implementation/NN of/IN programmes/NNS ./.

Projects/NNS implemented/VBN with/IN support/NN from/IN the/DT Union/NNP have/VBP had/VBN their/PRP$ effect/NN watered/VBD down/IN all/DT too/RB often/RB by/IN slow/JJ decision/NN making/NN and/CC complicated/JJ administrative/JJ processes/NNS ./.

Funds/NNS have/VBP often/RB been/VBN granted/VBN for/IN projects/NNS which/WDT have/VBP had/VBN no/DT lasting/JJ benefit/NN for/IN the/DT area/NN concerned/VBN ./.

Projects/NNPS have/VBP to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP more/RBR efficiently/RB ,/, more/RBR flexibly/RB and/CC they/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB made/VBN more/RBR productive/JJ ./.

While/IN the/DT report/NN was/VBD being/VBG prepared/VBN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ to/TO discuss/VB the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN in/IN general/NN ./.

For/IN us/PRP new/JJ members/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT was/VBD a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ process/NN ./.

This/DT report/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC our/PRP$ Group/NNP supports/VBZ it/PRP ./.

Bearing/VBG this/DT in/IN mind/NN ,/, this/DT House/NNP should/MD ,/, in/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, demand/VB that/IN ,/, before/IN the/DT Community/NNP support/NN frameworks/VBZ for/IN the/DT period/NN in/IN question/NN are/VBP approved/VBN ,/, they/PRP be/VB studied/VBN and/CC submitted/VBN for/IN debate/NN in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, specifically/RB in/IN light/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS that/IN we/PRP have/VBP presented/VBN today/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ because/IN we/PRP think/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP particularly/RB able/JJ to/TO create/VB employment/NN in/IN the/DT poorest/JJS and/CC least-developed/JJ regions/NNS and/CC we/PRP would/MD thus/RB contribute/VB to/TO reversing/VBG the/DT harmful/JJ trends/NNS towards/IN inequality/NN that/WDT exist/VBP in/IN European/JJ society/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT move/NN towards/IN a/DT fairer/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB forget/VB that/IN the/DT main/JJ ,/, strategic/JJ objective/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ and/CC Cohesion/NNP Funds/NNS and/CC of/IN their/PRP$ coordination/NN is/VBZ to/TO achieve/VB economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP obliged/JJ to/TO participate/VB in/IN drafting/VBG directives/NNS and/CC also/RB in/IN assessing/VBG their/PRP$ results/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP obliged/JJ to/TO do/VB so/RB because/IN we/PRP are/VBP the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS in/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Citizens/NNPS and/CC not/RB just/RB in/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN States/NNPS and/CC of/IN Regions/NNP ./.

We/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT Funds/NNPS are/VBP a/DT necessary/JJ but/CC insufficient/JJ condition/NN for/IN achieving/VBG economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

We/PRP might/MD be/VB mistaken/VBN in/IN using/VBG the/DT gross/JJ domestic/JJ product/NN per/IN inhabitant/NN as/IN the/DT sole/JJ indicator/NN ./.

Some/DT speakers/NNS have/VBP already/RB mentioned/VBN unemployment/NN and/CC the/DT fall/NN in/IN population/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO study/VB several/JJ indicators/NNS ,/, which/WDT will/MD enable/VB us/PRP to/TO see/VB the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN regional/JJ societies/NNS that/WDT are/VBP in/IN a/DT worse/JJR situation/NN than/IN others/NNS ,/, and/CC how/WRB they/PRP are/VBP evolving/VBG ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ from/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT reports/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN to/TO Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ plenary/NN sitting/VBG today/NN that/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/NNP 25/CD most/JJS prosperous/JJ regions/NNS enjoy/VBP a/DT level/NN of/IN unemployment/NN which/WDT is/VBZ five/CD times/NNS lower/JJR than/IN in/IN the/DT 25/CD least/JJS prosperous/JJ regions/NNS ./.

This/DT fact/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Commissioner/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD act/VB decisively/RB and/CC strategically/RB ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP did/VBD not/RB have/VB the/DT opportunity/NN -/: or/CC that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB given/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP had/VBD reached/VBN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT parliamentary/JJ term/NN -/: to/TO discuss/VB the/DT directives/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN this/DT report/NN has/VBZ come/VBN too/RB late/RB ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO consider/VB it/PRP together/RB ,/, so/RB that/IN the/DT new/JJ Objective/NN 1/CD programmes/NNS and/CC the/DT plans/NNS for/IN regional/JJ development/NN ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN drafted/VBN before/IN the/DT directives/NNS come/VBN into/IN force/NN ,/, can/MD be/VB submitted/VBN for/IN revision/NN and/CC proper/JJ assessment/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT agree/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD ask/VB that/IN ,/, halfway/RB through/IN these/DT programmes/NNS ,/, when/WRB the/DT assessment/NN of/IN the/DT directives/NNS is/VBZ made/VBN ,/, Parliament/NNP should/MD be/VB given/VBN an/DT equally/RB influential/JJ role/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP the/DT citizens/NNS '/POS representatives/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ citizens/NNS can/MD not/RB accept/VB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP takes/VBZ decisions/NNS in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, at/IN least/JJS on/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, bureaucratic/JJ ./.

They/PRP need/VBP to/TO see/VB the/DT political/JJ dimension/NN working/NN ,/, to/TO see/VB that/IN officials/NNS accept/VBP their/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS and/CC that/IN there/EX is/VBZ communication/NN with/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP today/NN asking/VBG the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO think/VB that/IN ,/, given/VBN his/PRP$ previous/JJ experience/NN as/IN a/DT regional/JJ President/NN ,/, he/PRP will/MD agree/VB to/TO propose/VB indicators/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT strategy/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD favour/VB economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN and/CC not/RB just/RB productivity/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN there/EX must/MD be/VB a/DT comprehensive/JJ partnership/NN between/IN local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC national/JJ governments/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO how/WRB these/DT funds/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB spent/VBN ./.

This/DT latter/JJ point/NN is/VBZ of/IN particular/JJ importance/NN ./.

While/IN urban/JJ renewal/NN in/IN our/PRP$ cities/NNS is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ we/PRP must/MD always/RB strike/VB a/DT balance/NN in/IN our/PRP$ policies/NNS between/IN promoting/VBG rural/JJ development/NN and/CC improving/VBG the/DT lives/NNS of/IN city/NN dwellers/NNS ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO build/VB a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN cities/NNS alone/RB ./.

The/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS have/VBP played/VBN a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN both/DT of/IN urban/JJ and/CC rural/JJ parts/NNS of/IN peripheral/JJ countries/NNS ,/, mainly/RB through/IN the/DT upgrading/NN of/IN roads/NNS ,/, water/NN treatment/NN and/CC related/VBN transport/NN networks/NNS ./.

This/DT process/NN will/MD continue/VB in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT financial/JJ spending/NN guidelines/NNS laid/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT EU/NNP leaders/NNS at/IN their/PRP$ Berlin/NNP Summit/NNP last/JJ year/NN ,/, which/WDT were/VBD supported/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP at/IN its/PRP$ last/JJ May/NNP plenary/NN part-session/NN ./.

Key/NNP EU/NNP programmes/NNS between/IN 1989/NNP ,/, 1993/CD ,/, 1994/CD and/CC 1999/CD have/VBP certainly/RB helped/VBN to/TO improve/VB the/DT economic/JJ competitiveness/NN of/IN peripheral/JJ countries/NNS and/CC Objective/VB 1/CD regions/NNS within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, while/IN key/JJ infrastructure/NN projects/NNS have/VBP been/VBN supported/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Regional/NNP Development/NNP Fund/NNP and/CC the/DT Cohesion/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD remember/VB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Social/NNP Fund/NNP has/VBZ played/VBN a/DT very/RB important/JJ role/NN in/IN helping/VBG the/DT less/JJR well-off/NN in/IN our/PRP$ society/NN ./.

The/DT Social/NNP Fund/NNP has/VBZ certainly/RB improved/VBN our/PRP$ third-level/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, financed/VBN our/PRP$ post-leaving/JJ certificate/NN programmes/NNS and/CC put/VBN in/IN place/NN comprehensive/JJ schemes/NNS to/TO help/VB combat/NN youth/NN and/CC long-term/JJ unemployment/NN ,/, assist/VB early/JJ school/NN leavers/NNS and/CC promote/VB higher/JJR standards/NNS of/IN adult/JJ literacy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, on/IN numerous/JJ occasions/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN I/PRP have/VBP disagreed/VBN with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN her/PRP$ approach/NN to/TO regional/JJ policy/NN issues/NNS ./.

This/DT time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP actually/RB agree/VBP with/IN her/PRP ./.

Whether/IN or/CC not/RB this/DT will/MD encourage/VB her/PRP to/TO continue/VB along/RP the/DT same/JJ path/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB say/VB ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO commend/VB her/PRP on/IN her/PRP$ work/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ point/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN it/PRP if/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS had/VBD been/VBN added/VBN to/TO the/DT regulation/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN an/DT annex/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP and/CC Mrs/NNP McCarthy/NNP ,/, as/IN rapporteurs/NNS for/IN the/DT general/JJ regulation/NN ,/, had/VBD asked/VBN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, this/DT did/VBD not/RB happen/VB ./.

Mr/NNP Berni脙/NNP 漏/NNP is/VBZ not/RB to/TO blame/VB for/IN this/DT as/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT matter/NN for/IN the/DT previous/JJ committee/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP raising/VBG the/DT issue/NN just/RB to/TO reiterate/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN ./.

As/IN an/DT islander/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ dissatisfaction/NN at/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN recognition/NN of/IN island/NN development/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN this/DT issue/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN given/VBN the/DT consideration/NN it/PRP deserves/VBZ ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT ongoing/JJ concern/NN for/IN the/DT five/CD years/NNS that/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT Member/NNP of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP raised/VBN the/DT issue/NN time/NN and/CC time/NN again/RB ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, we/PRP shall/MD continue/VB to/TO raise/VB the/DT issue/NN ,/, as/IN Article/NNP 158/CD ,/, paragraph/NN 1/CD ,/, of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP provides/VBZ for/IN an/DT integrated/VBN policy/NN for/IN islands/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD address/VB the/DT issue/NN once/RB and/CC for/IN all/DT ./.

The/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN to/TO implement/VB the/DT programmes/NNS ,/, and/CC so/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS should/MD also/RB assume/VB their/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS and/CC do/VB their/PRP$ jobs/NNS properly/RB ./.

As/IN for/IN us/PRP in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN the/DT code/NN of/IN conduct/NN between/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP which/WDT was/VBD signed/VBN in/IN May/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP absolutely/RB certain/JJ that/IN this/DT code/NN will/MD be/VB observed/JJ and/CC that/IN Parliament/NNP will/MD keep/VB abreast/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT developments/NNS and/CC details/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT programmes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, in/IN this/DT minute/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN I/PRP should/MD like/VB ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, to/TO congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP many/DT have/VBP already/RB done/VBN so/RB ,/, but/CC she/PRP has/VBZ indeed/RB earned/VBN our/PRP$ praise/NN for/IN being/VBG particularly/RB open/JJ and/CC attentive/JJ to/TO proposals/NNS from/IN all/DT sides/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ this/DT openness/NN which/WDT has/VBZ given/VBN her/PRP$ report/NN the/DT quality/NN we/PRP see/VBP today/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP we/PRP must/MD look/VB to/TO the/DT future/NN and/CC establish/VB guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT mid-term/JJ review/NN in/IN 2003/CD ,/, and/CC thus/RB have/VB an/DT influence/NN on/IN the/DT second/JJ phase/NN of/IN programming/NN set/VBN to/TO follow/VB 2003/CD ./.

In/IN brief/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP entering/VBG the/DT period/NN when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP called/VBN upon/IN to/TO manage/VB the/DT programming/NN for/IN 2000-2006/CD ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB no/DT routine/JJ period/NN for/IN the/DT good/JJ reason/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP two/CD major/JJ challenges/NNS to/TO face/VB ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT harmonisation/NN of/IN national/JJ development/NN policies/NNS and/CC regional/JJ development/NN policies/NNS ./.

Subsidies/NNS are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ to/TO ensure/VB development/NN when/WRB infrastructure/NN and/CC public/NN services/NNS are/VBP lacking/VBG ./.

We/PRP must/MD ask/VB ourselves/PRP a/DT fundamental/JJ question/NN :/: how/WRB can/MD we/PRP ensure/VB that/IN Union/NNP policy/NN interfaces/VBZ with/IN the/DT subsidiary/NN national/JJ policies/NNS for/IN regional/JJ development/NN ?/.

The/DT second/JJ challenge/NN is/VBZ that/DT of/IN enlargement/NN which/WDT will/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, have/VB a/DT considerable/JJ impact/NN ,/, both/DT in/IN budgetary/JJ and/CC geographical/JJ terms/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP two/CD areas/NNS of/IN action/NN which/WDT I/PRP invite/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP to/TO set/VB up/RP and/CC in/IN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD ask/VB him/PRP to/TO involve/VB us/PRP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT time/NN of/IN natural/JJ disasters/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO mention/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ up/RB to/TO each/DT State/NN to/TO redistribute/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ appropriation/NN ./.

Europe/NNP should/MD not/RB be/VB completely/RB absent/JJ ,/, as/IN the/DT states/NNS tend/VBP to/TO want/VB ./.

Public/JJ opinion/NN and/CC the/DT press/NN nowadays/RB accuse/VBP us/PRP of/IN being/VBG unavailable/JJ to/TO give/VB a/DT response/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB funding/VBG a/DT large/JJ proportion/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ operations/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP was/VBD not/RB satisfied/VBN with/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN Helsinki/NNP ./.

It/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO us/PRP that/IN the/DT agenda/NN lacked/VBD content/JJ ,/, because/IN our/PRP$ group/NN was/VBD thinking/VBG in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP and/CC ,/, specifically/RB ,/, the/DT protocol/NN on/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

In/IN Helsinki/NNP ,/, the/DT governments/NNS approved/VBD the/DT idea/NN that/IN ,/, as/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP consists/VBZ of/IN fewer/JJR than/IN 21/CD States/NNPS ,/, a/DT minimal/JJ reform/NN would/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ ./.

With/IN more/JJR than/IN 21/CD ,/, a/DT deeper/JJR reform/NN would/MD become/VB necessary/JJ ./.

The/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN Helsinki/NNP itself/PRP approved/VBD enlargement/NN involving/VBG 13/CD new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB inconsistent/JJ to/TO open/VB accession/NN negotiations/NNS with/IN 13/CD countries/NNS while/IN contemplating/VBG a/DT minimal/JJ reform/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB thinking/VBG in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP and/CC we/PRP want/VBP the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP to/TO allow/VB for/IN a/DT deeper/JJR reform/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ holding/VBG this/DT debate/NN today/NN because/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO delay/VB the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT Conference/NN ./.

In/IN theory/NN ,/, we/PRP could/MD have/VB done/VBN so/RB ./.

We/PRP could/MD have/VB voted/VBN on/IN the/DT 17th/NN of/IN this/DT month/NN and/CC the/DT Conference/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO start/VB on/IN the/DT 14th/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO do/VB this/DT because/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO send/VB a/DT clear/JJ political/JJ signal/NN to/TO the/DT governments/NNS and/CC the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS that/IN we/PRP want/VBP this/DT reform/NN to/TO take/VB place/NN ,/, precisely/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO facilitate/VB enlargement/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB happy/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO say/VB this/DT to/TO the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ earned/VBN great/JJ respect/NN in/IN this/DT Assembly/NNP ./.

The/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP shares/VBZ many/JJ of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ aspirations/NNS and/CC has/VBZ committed/VBN itself/PRP to/TO doing/VBG everything/NN it/PRP can/MD to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP is/VBZ widened/VBN to/TO include/VB other/JJ essential/JJ issues/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN this/DT aspiration/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT aspiration/NN to/TO gain/VB benefits/NNS for/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP itself/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD be/VB reinforced/VBN politically/RB by/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP resulting/VBG from/IN this/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ for/IN one/CD very/RB simple/JJ reason/NN :/: according/VBG to/TO the/DT agreements/NNS made/VBN in/IN Helsinki/NNP ,/, this/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP will/MD lead/VB to/TO issues/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP currently/RB decided/VBN unanimously/RB ,/, being/VBG decided/VBN by/IN a/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN issues/NNS decided/VBN by/IN a/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN will/MD increase/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ already/RB established/VBN within/IN the/DT Community/NNP acquis/NNS that/IN those/DT legislative/JJ issues/NNS which/WDT are/VBP decided/VBN by/IN a/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN are/VBP also/RB subject/JJ to/TO codecision/VB with/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, since/IN the/DT qualified/JJ majority/NN will/MD be/VB extended/VBN ,/, there/EX will/MD also/RB be/VB more/RBR codecision/JJ with/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT Parliament/NNP would/MD not/RB be/VB fulfilling/VBG its/PRP$ role/NN as/IN a/DT supranational/JJ European/JJ institution/NN if/IN it/PRP did/VBD not/RB consider/VB the/DT political/JJ design/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

That/DT it/PRP is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT political/JJ design/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, other/JJ issues/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN ./.

These/DT include/VBP ,/, amongst/IN others/NNS ,/, the/DT incorporation/NN into/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN security/NN and/CC defence/NN issues/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP made/VBN much/JJ progress/NN recently/RB ,/, but/CC which/WDT must/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN into/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

Of/IN course/NN there/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ,/, and/CC work/NN began/VBD on/IN its/PRP$ wording/NN yesterday/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP believe/VBP has/VBZ started/VBN very/RB positively/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO work/VB seriously/RB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT Europeans/NNPS come/VBP to/TO see/VB being/VBG European/JJ as/IN an/DT advantage/NN and/CC that/IN European/JJ citizens/NNS have/VBP certain/JJ fundamental/JJ rights/NNS which/WDT are/VBP connected/VBN to/TO the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ proposals/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP will/MD specify/VB in/IN another/DT report/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT proposals/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ produced/VBN an/DT excellent/JJ document/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO say/VB this/DT here/RB to/TO Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP -/: are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB used/VBN as/IN conference/NN documents/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD talk/VB about/IN this/DT on/IN another/DT day/NN ./.

Today/NN we/PRP must/MD give/VB the/DT green/JJ light/NN to/TO this/DT conference/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, for/IN its/PRP$ part/NN ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, is/VBZ ready/JJ to/TO give/VB that/DT green/JJ light/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP I/PRP can/MD say/VB we/PRP will/MD be/VB supporting/VBG the/DT draft/NN opinion/NN put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT rapporteurs/NNS on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS Committee/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP giving/VBG a/DT positive/JJ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT convening/NN of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP precisely/RB because/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN impressed/VBN by/IN the/DT attitude/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP which/WDT has/VBZ taken/VBN on/IN board/NN our/PRP$ request/NN that/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP be/VB widened/VBN ./.

The/DT Amsterdam/NNP leftovers/NNS is/VBZ not/RB a/DT very/RB good/JJ term/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP are/VBP very/RB important/JJ subjects/NNS in/IN themselves/PRP ./.

Let/VB us/PRP call/VB them/PRP the/DT first/JJ three/CD subjects/NNS of/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

These/DT first/JJ three/CD subjects/NNS are/VBP very/RB important/JJ but/CC they/PRP are/VBP subjects/NNS which/WDT were/VBD explored/VBN in/IN detail/NN by/IN our/PRP$ Member/JJ States/NNPS during/IN the/DT last/JJ IGC/NN ./.

They/PRP did/VBD not/RB quite/RB reach/VB a/DT conclusion/NN on/IN them/PRP but/CC they/PRP certainly/RB do/VBP not/RB need/VB nine/CD months/NNS of/IN further/JJ study/NN ./.

They/PRP need/VBP a/DT political/JJ deal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR a/DT question/NN of/IN nine/CD minutes/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB nine/CD hours/NNS if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ ,/, locked/VBN away/RP together/RB in/IN a/DT room/NN to/TO reach/VB a/DT solution/NN on/IN these/DT subjects/NNS ,/, not/RB nine/CD months/NNS ./.

In/IN those/DT circumstances/NNS it/PRP would/MD be/VB silly/JJ not/RB to/TO widen/VB the/DT agenda/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP other/JJ issues/NNS that/WDT should/MD fruitfully/RB be/VB looked/VBN at/IN ,/, especially/RB before/IN such/PDT a/DT large/JJ widening/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP to/TO so/RB many/JJ new/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Nobody/NN is/VBZ asking/VBG for/IN a/DT Christmas/NNP tree/NN ./.

Nobody/NN is/VBZ asking/VBG for/IN an/DT IGC/NNP of/IN the/DT Maastricht/NNP style/NN with/IN a/DT hundred/CD or/CC more/JJR subjects/NNS being/VBG debated/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP six/CD ,/, seven/CD ,/, eight/CD ,/, nine/CD perhaps/RB ,/, subjects/NNS which/WDT it/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB appropriate/JJ and/CC useful/JJ to/TO address/VB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ time/NN ./.

Remember/VB the/DT IGC/NNP that/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT Single/NNP European/NNP Act/NNP ./.

It/PRP lasted/VBD only/RB five/CD months/NNS ./.

The/DT IGC/NNP that/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT enormous/JJ Maastricht/NNP Treaty/NNP lasted/VBD a/DT year/NN ./.

Only/RB the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP lasted/VBD a/DT year/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN and/CC that/WDT was/VBD because/IN everyone/NN knew/VBD you/PRP had/VBD to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT British/JJ election/NN if/IN you/PRP were/VBD going/VBG to/TO have/VB any/DT outcome/NN from/IN that/DT IGC/NNP so/IN that/DT was/VBD a/DT different/JJ reason/NN ./.

A/DT year/NN is/VBZ ample/JJ time/NN to/TO address/VB a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN issues/NNS and/CC it/PRP should/MD certainly/RB be/VB enough/JJ to/TO address/VB the/DT few/JJ crucial/JJ points/NNS that/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO be/VB added/VBN to/TO the/DT agenda/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP shares/VBZ our/PRP$ view/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ just/RB published/VBN its/PRP$ opinion/NN and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN exactly/RB what/WP Parliament/NNP asked/VBD of/IN it/PRP -/: to/TO bring/VB forward/RP a/DT comprehensive/JJ proposal/NN complete/JJ with/IN actual/JJ draft/NN treaty/NN articles/NNS ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN doing/VBG that/IN even/RB if/IN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN everything/NN the/DT Commission/NNP said/VBD ./.

I/PRP think/VBP there/EX are/VBP some/DT gaps/NNS in/IN what/WP they/PRP have/VBP put/VBN forward/RB ./.

Nonetheless/RB the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ provided/VBN a/DT service/NN and/CC I/PRP pay/VBP tribute/NN to/TO Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP who/WP is/VBZ here/RB with/IN us/PRP today/NN for/IN doing/VBG that/DT ./.

They/PRP have/VBP laid/VBN out/RP for/IN the/DT public/NN to/TO see/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT crucial/JJ issues/NNS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO address/VB in/IN this/DT IGC/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ all/RB to/TO the/DT good/JJ ./.

The/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP presidency/NN and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP are/VBP pulling/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ direction/NN for/IN a/DT wider/JJR agenda/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB worried/VBN that/IN the/DT agenda/NN for/IN the/DT IGC/NNP will/MD be/VB restricted/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT political/JJ conclusions/NNS that/IN we/PRP must/MD draw/VB from/IN the/DT grave/JJ decision/NN of/IN 14/CD Member/NNP States/NNP yesterday/NN virtually/RB to/TO freeze/VB relations/NNS with/IN a/DT partner/NN ./.

It/PRP makes/VBZ it/PRP impossible/JJ for/IN those/DT same/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, at/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, to/TO fail/VB to/TO give/VB operational/JJ meaning/NN to/TO the/DT protection/NN and/CC advancement/NN of/IN fundamental/JJ rights/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ already/RB strange/JJ within/IN the/DT convention/NN that/WDT is/VBZ drafting/VBG the/DT charter/NN to/TO see/VB representatives/NNS of/IN some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, especially/RB Britain/NNP and/CC France/NNP ,/, seeking/VBG to/TO argue/VB that/IN a/DT mandatory/JJ charter/NN would/MD somehow/RB be/VB an/DT infringement/NN of/IN national/JJ sovereignty/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ that/IN the/DT IGC/NNP prepares/VBZ the/DT way/NN to/TO accept/VB the/DT installation/NN of/IN a/DT fundamental/JJ rights/NNS regime/NN within/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

One/CD part/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ to/TO improve/VB the/DT access/NN of/IN the/DT citizen/NN to/TO the/DT Court/NNP ./.

Another/DT is/VBZ for/IN the/DT Union/NNP itself/PRP to/TO sign/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT European/JJ Convention/NN ./.

Another/DT is/VBZ clearly/RB for/IN national/JJ parliaments/NNS and/CC national/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS to/TO find/VB a/DT reinforced/JJ role/NN that/IN they/PRP can/MD play/VB inside/IN European/JJ Union/NNP affairs/NNS and/CC to/TO share/VB the/DT shouldering/NN of/IN responsibility/NN to/TO build/VB European/JJ parliamentary/JJ democracy/NN ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN strongly/RB welcomes/VBZ the/DT IGC/NNP and/CC will/MD be/VB contributing/VBG to/TO this/DT Treaty/NNP reform/NN process/NN to/TO the/DT maximum/JJ possible/JJ extent/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/European/NNP Free/NNP Alliance/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ decision/NN to/TO rush/VB headlong/RB into/IN giving/VBG its/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP undermines/VBZ the/DT political/JJ significance/NN of/IN the/DT request/NN for/IN talks/NNS with/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, makes/VBZ it/PRP rather/RB irrelevant/JJ ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, given/VBN that/IN this/DT opinion/NN is/VBZ quite/RB important/JJ ,/, we/PRP can/MD still/RB vote/VB for/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC indeed/RB ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN our/PRP$ group/NN will/MD be/VB voting/VBG for/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP nevertheless/RB wish/VBP to/TO stress/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB distressing/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT lack/NN of/IN real/JJ interest/NN in/IN this/DT reform/NN ./.

The/DT events/NNS in/IN Austria/NNP make/VBP it/PRP crystal/RB clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT body/NN or/CC structure/NN for/IN democracy/NN in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO establish/VB principles/NNS which/WDT provide/VBP bases/NNS all/PDT the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

How/WRB ,/, though/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT Union/NNP to/TO be/VB enlarged/JJ if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB do/VB the/DT job/NN properly/RB now/RB ,/, i.e./RB before/IN enlargement/NN takes/VBZ place/NN ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP as/IN a/DT group/NN are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

We/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB indispensable/JJ and/CC urgently/RB needed/VBN and/CC hope/VB that/IN it/PRP actually/RB comes/VBZ up/RP with/IN the/DT goods/NNS that/WDT will/MD enable/VB us/PRP to/TO carry/VB out/RP enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN the/DT not/RB too/RB distant/JJ future/NN ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, noted/VBD with/IN satisfaction/NN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP Presidency/NNP is/VBZ far/RB from/IN happy/JJ with/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD therefore/RB rest/VB assured/VBN that/IN the/DT Confederal/NNP Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP United/NNP Left/Nordic/NNP Green/NNP Left/NNP is/VBZ committed/VBN to/TO seeing/VBG that/IN the/DT Union/NNP gets/VBZ on/RP with/IN the/DT tasks/NNS in/IN hand/NN ./.

The/DT politics/NNS of/IN closed/JJ doors/NNS and/CC private/JJ discussions/NNS ;/: all/DT that/WDT must/MD be/VB consigned/VBN to/TO the/DT past/NN once/RB and/CC for/IN all/DT ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP need/VBP transparency/RB ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP falls/VBZ to/TO you/PRP ,/, as/IN President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, to/TO see/VB to/TO it/PRP that/IN the/DT train/NN does/VBZ not/RB keep/VB rolling/VBG on/RP as/RB before/RB ,/, leaving/VBG the/DT people/NNS behind/RB on/IN the/DT platforms/NNS as/RB if/IN they/PRP were/VBD ignorant/JJ as/IN to/TO the/DT content/NN of/IN the/DT treaties/NNS ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ imperative/JJ not/RB just/RB to/TO make/VB every/DT available/JJ effort/NN to/TO provide/VB the/DT citizens/NNS with/IN comprehensive/JJ information/NN on/IN how/WRB the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ outcome/NN ,/, rather/RB they/PRP must/MD be/VB directly/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT overall/JJ reform/NN process/NN to/TO a/DT far/RB greater/JJR extent/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, Europe/NNP would/MD truly/RB belong/VB to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS and/CC the/DT Union/NNP would/MD acquire/VB an/DT entirely/RB new/JJ quality/NN of/IN democratic/JJ legitimacy/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ another/DT central/JJ issue/NN relating/VBG to/TO democracy/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB clear/JJ reference/NN to/TO ./.

As/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT convention/NN that/WDT has/VBZ now/RB taken/VBN up/RP its/PRP$ work/NN on/IN the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO make/VB the/DT following/JJ point/NN clear/JJ :/: neither/CC my/PRP$ group/NN nor/CC I/PRP are/VBP content/JJ with/IN making/VBG a/DT solemn/NN announcement/NN about/IN the/DT Charter/NNP ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, what/WP will/MD the/DT citizens/NNS say/VB if/IN we/PRP make/VBP a/DT solemn/NN announcement/NN about/IN rights/NNS to/TO them/PRP but/CC they/PRP are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO take/VB legal/JJ action/NN in/IN respect/NN of/IN these/DT rights/NNS as/IN individuals/NNS ?/.

No/NNP ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN this/DT would/MD only/RB serve/VB to/TO deepen/VB the/DT credibility/NN crisis/NN facing/VBG the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT poor/JJ turnout/NN at/IN the/DT European/JJ elections/NNS really/RB should/MD have/VB been/VBN warning/VBG enough/RB for/IN everyone/NN ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP are/VBP visible/JJ rights/NNS for/IN each/DT and/CC every/DT citizen/NN ;/: the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS must/MD be/VB made/VBN legally/RB binding/JJ for/IN all/PDT the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Together/RB we/PRP should/MD work/VB towards/IN this/DT goal/NN in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, and/CC what/WP I/PRP expect/VBP to/TO come/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT relevant/JJ Cologne/NNP decision/NN will/MD be/VB revised/VBN here/RB at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP also/RB talking/VBG about/IN effectiveness/NN of/IN decisions/NNS and/CC functioning/VBG institutions/NNS in/IN a/DT Union/NNP of/IN 27/CD plus/CC Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP will/MD not/RB achieve/VB this/DT just/RB by/IN undertaking/VBG a/DT mini/JJ reform/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ resolved/VBN to/TO do/VB ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB all/DT institutions/NNS must/MD come/VB under/IN scrutiny/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP bold/JJ change/NN and/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD take/VB care/NN to/TO give/VB the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ attention/NN to/TO equal/JJ rights/NNS for/IN the/DT major/JJ and/CC small/JJ States/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP would/MD stress/VB ,/, particularly/RB with/IN my/PRP$ being/VBG an/DT MEP/NNP for/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT proposals/NNS they/PRP have/VBP put/VBN forward/RB and/CC I/PRP am/VBP certain/JJ that/IN comprehensive/JJ discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT citizens/NNS will/MD ensue/VB here/RB in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, on/IN all/PDT the/DT issues/NNS you/PRP have/VBP raised/VBN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD final/JJ issue/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO raise/VB ./.

Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN expressly/RB demands/VBZ amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN economic/JJ policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ indeed/RB the/DT case/NN that/WDT globalisation/VBN of/IN national/JJ economies/NNS ,/, but/CC above/IN all/DT the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN and/CC the/DT associated/JJ stability/NN pact/NN have/VBP led/VBN to/TO a/DT situation/NN where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB more/JJR than/IN analyse/CD decision-making/JJ processes/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP most/JJS of/IN all/DT is/VBZ to/TO have/VB the/DT courage/NN to/TO undertake/VB a/DT critical/JJ examination/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ policies/NNS to/TO date/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ all/DT about/IN creating/VBG a/DT socially/RB just/RB Europe/NNP ./.

A/DT socially/RB just/RB Europe/NNP is/VBZ still/RB highly/RB topical/JJ ,/, for/IN what/WP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN priority/NN is/VBZ place/VB the/DT fight/NN against/IN mass/JJ unemployment/NN and/CC poverty/NN firmly/RB at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ policies/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Union/NNP for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Nations/NNP Group/NNP considers/VBZ that/IN the/DT agenda/NN for/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, as/IN set/VBN by/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP Council/NNP ,/, i.e./RB focussing/VBG strictly/RB on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN decision/NN making/VBG in/IN an/DT enlarged/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, must/MD be/VB adhered/VBN to/TO ./.

It/PRP must/MD be/VB adhered/VBN to/TO in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT fast/JJ ,/, effective/JJ work/NN of/IN the/DT conference/NN ,/, prior/RB to/TO enlargement/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ group/NN has/VBZ therefore/RB tabled/VBN a/DT raft/NN of/IN amendments/NNS which/WDT ,/, when/WRB taken/VBN together/RB ,/, form/VBP a/DT real/JJ alternative/NN resolution/NN ./.

In/IN them/PRP we/PRP say/VBP that/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ IGC/NN must/MD look/VB into/IN a/DT decision-making/JJ system/NN that/WDT pays/VBZ greater/JJR attention/NN to/TO national/JJ sovereignty/NN ./.

We/PRP deplore/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ opinion/NN of/IN 26/CD January/NNP ,/, limits/VBZ itself/PRP to/TO following/VBG the/DT routine/JJ path/NN of/IN a/DT standardised/JJ Europe/NNP enlarging/NN towards/IN the/DT East/NNP ,/, a/DT centralised/JJ superstate/NN operating/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN majority/NN decisions/NNS ./.

The/DT federalists/NNS imagine/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP thereby/RB going/VBG to/TO create/VB unity/NN through/IN constraint/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ a/DT totally/RB superficial/JJ concept/NN ./.

Quite/RB the/DT opposite/NN ,/, in/IN an/DT enlarged/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT standardisation/NN imposed/VBN by/IN the/DT improper/JJ use/NN of/IN majority/NN decisions/NNS can/MD lead/VB only/RB to/TO the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN exploding/VBG ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT centralised/JJ European/JJ system/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP can/MD see/VB it/PRP developing/JJ today/NN and/CC as/IN we/PRP can/MD foresee/VB it/PRP by/IN extrapolation/NN ,/, erodes/VBZ nations/NNS and/CC ,/, in/IN eroding/VBG nations/NNS ,/, erodes/VBZ the/DT national/JJ patriotism/NN which/WDT forms/VBZ the/DT basis/NN of/IN our/PRP$ will/NN to/TO defend/VB ourselves/PRP ./.

The/DT Europe/NNP which/WDT results/VBZ from/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB stronger/JJR but/CC weaker/JJR ,/, as/IN it/PRP no/RB longer/RB knows/VBZ what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ or/CC what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ defending/VBG ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP have/VBP always/RB said/VBN that/IN enlargement/NN was/VBD possible/JJ only/RB if/IN the/DT diversity/NN and/CC freedom/NN of/IN the/DT peoples/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP was/VBD clearly/RB recognised/VBN ,/, i.e./VBG by/IN adopting/VBG flexibility/NN founded/VBN upon/IN the/DT respect/NN of/IN national/JJ sovereignty/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP delighted/JJ today/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT progress/NN this/DT idea/NN has/VBZ enjoyed/VBN in/IN certain/JJ circles/NNS ,/, one/CD which/WDT are/VBP still/RB ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, outside/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

A/DT flexible/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT Europe/NNP which/WDT respects/VBZ its/PRP$ national/JJ democracies/NNS ,/, which/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN its/PRP$ nations/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ national/JJ patriotisms/NNS ,/, instead/RB of/IN continually/RB persecuting/VBG them/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ this/DT that/WDT gives/VBZ us/PRP the/DT determination/NN to/TO defend/VB ourselves/PRP against/IN external/JJ threats/NNS ,/, not/RB the/DT constraining/JJ ,/, convoluted/VBN decision/NN making/VBG procedures/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP thought/VBD it/PRP could/MD propose/VB at/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Italian/JJ Radicals/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB to/TO the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ seen/VBN what/WP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN is/VBZ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT message/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ sending/VBG to/TO the/DT Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP -/: and/CC I/PRP add/VBP my/PRP$ compliments/NNS to/TO those/DT already/RB offered/VBN -/: can/MD convey/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ message/NN and/CC convey/VB the/DT result/NN of/IN our/PRP$ mediation/NN work/NN on/IN Saint/NNP Valentine/NNP '/POS s/JJ day/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, tomorrow/NN we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB against/IN the/DT IGC/NNP agenda/NN ./.

This/DT message/NN must/MD be/VB very/RB clear/JJ ;/: this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB we/PRP explain/VB the/DT way/NN we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB tomorrow/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD give/VB an/DT opinion/NN -/: which/WDT is/VBZ technically/RB and/CC legally/RB necessary/JJ -/: on/IN convening/VBG the/DT IGC/NNP on/IN 14/CD February/NNP ,/, but/CC we/PRP shall/MD give/VB an/DT unfavourable/JJ opinion/NN of/IN its/PRP$ content/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ clearly/RB a/DT more/RBR ambitious/JJ goal/NN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP other/JJ topics/NNS :/: for/IN example/NN ,/, many/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP subscribed/VBN ,/, along/IN with/IN us/PRP ,/, to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT seat/NN of/IN the/DT institutions/NNS ,/, an/DT issue/NN that/IN we/PRP believe/VBP should/MD be/VB considered/VBN at/IN least/JJS at/IN IGC/NNP level/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT message/NN that/IN we/PRP give/VBP tomorrow/NN will/MD be/VB strong/JJ and/CC wide-ranging/JJ for/IN once/RB ,/, so/RB that/IN thanks/NNS also/RB to/TO the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, this/DT agenda/NN will/MD be/VB revised/VBN ./.

Otherwise/RB ,/, the/DT challenge/NN really/RB would/MD be/VB lost/VBN ,/, not/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT present/NN but/CC also/RB for/IN many/JJ years/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD not/RB being/VBG quite/RB honest/JJ when/WRB he/PRP talked/VBD last/JJ week/NN about/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

And/CC ,/, in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO the/DT heart/NN of/IN democracy/NN as/IN it/PRP relates/VBZ to/TO distribution/NN policy/NN and/CC people/NNS '/POS s/VBZ social/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP what/WP voters/NNS wish/VBP to/TO influence/VB when/WRB they/PRP go/VBP to/TO the/DT polls/NNS ./.

Brussels/NNP knows/VBZ best/RBS ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP also/RB announced/VBD greater/JJR transparency/NN ,/, but/CC his/PRP$ draft/NN regulation/NN signals/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ backward/JJ step/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ not/RB only/RB my/PRP$ assessment/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB that/DT of/IN the/DT European/NNP Ombudsman/NNP ./.

Today/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ obliged/VBN ,/, on/IN a/DT case-by-case/JJ basis/NN ,/, to/TO weigh/VB considerations/NNS of/IN confidentiality/NN against/IN people/NNS '/POS s/JJ demands/NNS for/IN ,/, and/CC expectation/NN of/IN ,/, transparency/RB and/CC ,/, if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ regulation/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB entitled/VBN to/TO lock/VB away/RP whole/JJ categories/NNS of/IN documents/NNS without/IN having/VBG to/TO give/VB them/PRP specific/JJ consideration/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT desire/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT legal/JJ entitlement/NN to/TO confidentiality/NN and/CC to/TO lock/VB away/RP documents/NNS of/IN a/DT kind/NN which/WDT are/VBP at/IN present/RB publicly/RB available/JJ in/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, thoroughly/RB Orwellian/VBN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO ask/VB Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP never/RB more/RBR to/TO comment/VB on/IN a/DT proposal/NN here/RB in/IN the/DT House/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, available/JJ for/IN critical/JJ scrutiny/NN by/IN the/DT public/NN ./.

The/DT French/JJ text/NN contains/VBZ the/DT word/NN ``/`` refuse/NN ''/'' and/CC the/DT English/JJ text/NN the/DT word/NN ``/`` shall/MD ''/'' ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ to/TO keep/VB secret/JJ such/JJ information/NN as/IN is/VBZ today/NN available/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB .../. -LRB-/-LRB- The/DT President/NNP cut/VBD the/DT speaker/NN off/RP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

However/RB ,/, efforts/NNS are/VBP increasingly/RB oriented/VBN towards/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT self-sufficient/JJ healthcare/NN system/NN in/IN the/DT province/NN ./.

UNMIK/NNP has/VBZ already/RB taken/VBN a/DT significant/JJ role/NN in/IN this/DT field/NN ./.

Progress/NNP is/VBZ slow/JJ due/JJ to/TO the/DT tense/JJ relations/NNS between/IN the/DT ethnic/JJ groups/NNS of/IN this/DT divided/VBN city/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ maintaining/VBG its/PRP$ efforts/NNS with/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN UNMIK/NNP for/IN this/DT project/NN ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN one/CD day/NN it/PRP may/MD become/VB a/DT symbol/NN promoting/VBG the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN ethnic/JJ reconciliation/NN ./.

Under/IN the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ damage/NN assessment/NN ,/, estimated/VBN costs/NNS of/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN healthcare/NN facilities/NNS and/CC provision/NN of/IN equipment/NN to/TO dispensaries/NNS and/CC health/NN houses/VBZ amount/NN to/TO EUR/$ 4/CD million/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ now/RB turning/VBG to/TO the/DT programming/NN of/IN 2000/CD funds/NNS ./.

We/PRP expect/VBP to/TO dedicate/VB a/DT considerable/JJ sum/NN to/TO improving/VBG the/DT healthcare/NN system/NN ./.

The/DT emphasis/NN will/MD be/VB on/IN long-term/JJ reforms/NNS covering/VBG health/NN financing/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN training/NN and/CC procurement/NN ./.

Work/NNP is/VBZ already/RB under/IN way/NN with/IN UNMIK/NNP to/TO determine/VB an/DT appropriate/JJ contribution/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO this/DT enterprise/NN ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, this/DT morning/NN President/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, among/IN others/NNS ,/, stressed/VBD that/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS are/VBP testing/VBG our/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO act/VB effectively/RB ,/, the/DT very/JJ credibility/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ on/IN trial/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT gap/NN between/IN words/NNS and/CC deeds/NNS must/MD finally/RB be/VB closed/VBN ./.

Besides/IN ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, is/VBZ so-called/JJ humanitarian/JJ military/JJ intervention/NN justified/VBN by/IN the/DT present/JJ picture/NN of/IN human/JJ destruction/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ?/.

Do/VBP you/PRP think/VB that/IN so/RB much/JJ inaction/NN is/VBZ excusable/JJ when/WRB ,/, on/IN the/DT continent/NN of/IN Europe/NNP itself/PRP ,/, the/DT right/NN to/TO life/NN is/VBZ at/IN risk/NN ?/.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN our/PRP$ reconstruction/NN agency/NN or/CC the/DT task/NN force/VBP before/IN it/PRP ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN working/VBG incredibly/RB hard/JJ in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, would/MD regard/VB it/PRP as/IN an/DT adequate/JJ description/NN of/IN their/PRP$ labours/NNS to/TO suggest/VB that/IN they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN standing/VBG idly/RB by/IN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP did/VBD not/RB mean/VB that/DT ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, she/PRP is/VBZ entirely/RB correct/JJ in/IN saying/VBG that/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ credibility/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT line/NN with/IN what/WP happens/VBZ ,/, not/RB just/RB in/IN Kosovo/NNP but/CC in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB concerned/JJ that/IN the/DT assistance/NN we/PRP provide/VBP should/MD arrive/VB expeditiously/RB and/CC in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT can/MD maximise/VB our/PRP$ assistance/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD just/RB make/VB two/CD points/NNS about/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP addressing/VBG as/IN enthusiastically/RB as/IN we/PRP can/MD along/RB WHO/VB lines/NNS ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP recognises/VBZ that/IN over/IN the/DT period/NN of/IN the/DT 1990s/NNS the/DT government/NN in/IN Belgrade/NNP underfunded/VBZ the/DT health/NN service/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, and/CC many/JJ Albanians/NNS found/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD not/RB really/RB receiving/VBG any/DT health/NN care/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN that/DT ,/, a/DT parallel/JJ health/NN care/NN system/NN was/VBD put/VBN in/IN place/NN through/IN the/DT Mother/NNP Teresa/NNP Society/NNP ./.

So/CC what/WP we/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN is/VBZ not/RB just/RB the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN conflict/NN but/CC the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN years/NNS of/IN neglect/NN and/CC chronic/NN under-investment/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP recognises/VBZ this/DT as/RB well/RB ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT tragic/JJ stories/NNS to/TO come/VB out/RP of/IN Kosovo/NNP in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN about/IN child/NN mortalities/NNS during/IN carriage/NN of/IN a/DT baby/NN ,/, but/CC child/NN mortality/NN after/IN a/DT healthy/JJ baby/NN has/VBZ been/VBN born/VBN ./.

Those/DT were/VBD cases/NNS in/IN which/WDT women/NNS who/WP during/IN the/DT hostilities/NNS ,/, or/CC before/IN the/DT hostilities/NNS ,/, tragically/VBZ killed/VBD their/PRP$ own/JJ children/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN a/DT horrific/JJ story/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/VB as/RB well/RB as/IN we/PRP can/MD in/IN the/DT health/NN care/NN field/NN and/CC in/IN others/NNS to/TO restore/VB something/NN approaching/VBG civilised/JJ standards/NNS and/CC civilised/JJ behaviour/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB easy/JJ ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ response/NN to/TO the/DT Member/NNP '/POS s/JJ first/JJ question/NN and/CC the/DT supplementary/JJ question/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP still/RB have/VBP some/DT contacts/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP who/WP have/VBP informed/VBN me/PRP that/IN food/NN packages/NNS which/WDT are/VBP distributed/VBN by/IN ECHO/NNP ,/, among/IN others/NNS ,/, are/VBP often/RB of/IN inferior/JJ quality/NN ./.

In/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN incidents/NNS of/IN food/NN containing/VBG insects/NNS and/CC such/JJ like/IN ./.

Are/VBP you/PRP aware/JJ of/IN this/DT ?/.

Are/VBP you/PRP prepared/JJ to/TO act/VB upon/IN it/PRP ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ first/JJ additional/JJ question/NN ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN pertains/VBZ to/TO the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN the/DT hospital/NN in/IN Mitrovica/NNP ./.

You/PRP are/VBP perhaps/RB aware/JJ that/IN this/DT hospital/NN is/VBZ located/VBN in/IN the/DT Northern/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT city/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, given/VBN the/DT tense/JJ situation/NN ,/, Albanian/NNP Kosovars/NNP do/VBP not/RB have/VB any/DT access/NN to/TO this/DT section/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

What/WP does/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP intend/VB to/TO do/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Albanian/NNP Kosovars/NNP too/RB can/MD get/VB to/TO hospital/NN ?/.

On/IN the/DT first/JJ question/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG myself/PRP to/TO Kosovo/NNP at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN next/JJ month/NN for/IN another/DT visit/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD certainly/RB look/VB into/IN the/DT allegation/NN made/VBN by/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN about/IN the/DT ECHO/NNP food/NN package/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP not/RB heard/VBN that/DT suggestion/NN before/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ point/NN and/CC I/PRP will/MD certainly/RB investigate/VB it/PRP when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP there/RB ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP understand/VB exactly/RB what/WP the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP is/VBZ saying/VBG about/IN Mitrovica/NNP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Mitrovica/NNP a/DT couple/NN of/IN months/NNS ago/IN ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD the/DT situation/NN there/RB for/IN myself/PRP ./.

I/PRP had/VBD discussions/NNS with/IN municipal/JJ leaders/NNS from/IN both/DT communities/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT Albanian/NNP side/NN who/WP had/VBD himself/PRP in/IN the/DT past/NN been/VBN a/DT doctor/NN and/CC was/VBD generally/RB recognised/VBN for/IN the/DT medical/JJ work/NN he/PRP had/VBD done/VBN during/IN the/DT hostilities/NNS and/CC subsequently/RB ./.

So/IN I/PRP know/VBP the/DT very/RB serious/JJ problems/NNS that/WDT exist/VBP in/IN that/DT hospital/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD assure/VB the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD be/VB doing/VBG all/DT that/IN we/PRP can/MD to/TO see/VB that/IN adequate/JJ health/NN facilities/NNS are/VBP available/JJ for/IN everybody/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, whatever/WDT ethnic/JJ group/NN they/PRP come/VBP from/IN ./.

The/DT particular/JJ difficulties/NNS in/IN Mitrovica/NNP -/: for/IN example/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN Albanian/JJ patients/NNS having/VBG difficulty/NN getting/VBG to/TO hospital/NN ,/, Albanian/NNP staff/NN have/VBP had/VBN difficulty/NN working/VBG there/RB -/: are/VBP particularly/RB acute/JJ problems/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO address/VB them/PRP ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ ./.

Subject/NNP :/: Turkish/JJ blockade/NN of/IN Armenia/NNP Given/VBN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ actively/RB promoting/VBG social/JJ ,/, economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ relations/NNS with/IN Armenia/NNP through/IN the/DT Partnership/NNP and/CC Cooperation/NNP Agreement/NNP signed/VBD on/IN 12/CD October/NNP 1999/CD ,/, what/WP steps/NNS is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP taking/VBG to/TO persuade/VB the/DT Turkish/JJ Government/NN to/TO lift/VB the/DT economic/JJ blockade/NN of/IN Armenia/NNP ?/.

The/DT Commission/NNP supports/VBZ any/DT effort/NN aimed/VBN at/IN the/DT settlement/NN of/IN the/DT disputes/NNS between/IN Turkey/NNP and/CC Armenia/NNP and/CC regrets/VBZ that/IN there/EX has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN any/DT normalisation/NN of/IN relations/NNS between/IN these/DT two/CD countries/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT present/JJ political/JJ circumstances/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ however/RB unrealistic/JJ to/TO imagine/VB that/IN the/DT border/NN between/IN Armenia/NNP and/CC Turkey/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT one/NN between/IN Armenia/NNP and/CC Azerbaijan/NNP could/MD be/VB opened/VBN without/IN settlement/NN of/IN the/DT Nagorno-Karabakh/JJ conflict/NN ./.

Will/MD it/PRP make/VB it/PRP a/DT condition/NN that/IN negotiations/NNS can/MD only/RB start/VB if/IN the/DT blockade/NN is/VBZ lifted/VBN because/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP all/DT neighbours/NNS and/CC we/PRP want/VBP to/TO cultivate/VB positive/JJ neighbourly/NN relations/NNS inside/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ?/.

The/DT key/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ to/TO support/VB the/DT efforts/NNS of/IN the/DT OSCE/NNP Minsk/NNP group/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT settlement/NN to/TO the/DT Nagorno-Karabakh/JJ conflict/NN and/CC we/PRP stand/VBP ready/JJ to/TO help/VB in/IN any/DT way/NN we/PRP can/MD ./.

We/PRP have/VBP also/RB been/VBN substantial/JJ contributors/NNS of/IN development/NN assistance/NN under/IN the/DT TACIS/NNP programme/NN to/TO Armenia/NNP ./.

Let/VB me/PRP relate/VB my/PRP$ answer/NN specifically/RB to/TO the/DT question/NN of/IN Turkish/JJ accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT situation/NN of/IN Turkey/NNP 's/POS relations/NNS with/IN its/PRP$ neighbours/NNS will/MD ,/, as/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP asks/VBZ ,/, be/VB closely/RB examined/VBN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT pre-accession/JJ strategy/NN ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS views/NNS on/IN incorporating/VBG the/DT Charter/NNP into/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN European/NNP Union/NNP ?/.

According/VBG to/TO these/DT conclusions/NNS ,/, the/DT Charter/NNP must/MD contain/VB three/CD categories/NNS of/IN rights/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ category/NN is/VBZ rights/NNS of/IN freedom/NN and/CC equality/NN and/CC procedural/JJ rights/NNS ,/, as/IN guaranteed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/JJ Convention/NN for/IN the/DT Protection/NNP of/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP and/CC Fundamental/JJ Freedoms/NNS ./.

The/DT second/NN is/VBZ the/DT rights/NNS reserved/VBN for/IN citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT third/JJ is/VBZ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ rights/NNS ,/, as/IN contained/VBN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Social/NNP Charter/NNP and/CC the/DT Community/NNP Charter/NNP of/IN the/DT Fundamental/JJ Social/NNP Rights/NNPS of/IN Workers/NNPS ,/, insofar/RB as/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB merely/RB establish/VB objectives/NNS for/IN action/NN by/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP considers/VBZ that/IN the/DT Convention/NN responsible/JJ for/IN drawing/VBG up/RP the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS must/MD respect/VB the/DT mandate/NN given/VBN by/IN the/DT Cologne/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/WDT ,/, this/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT Convention/NN should/MD be/VB limited/VBN to/TO a/DT codifying/VBG role/NN of/IN simply/RB compiling/VBG the/DT existing/VBG rights/NNS from/IN various/JJ sources/NNS ./.

As/IN I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD before/RB in/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ convinced/JJ that/IN the/DT Convention/NN must/MD be/VB able/JJ ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, to/TO adapt/VB and/CC develop/VB these/DT rights/NNS in/IN view/NN of/IN current/JJ circumstances/NNS ,/, particularly/RB technological/JJ and/CC social/JJ changes/NNS ./.

I/PRP listened/VBD to/TO your/PRP$ general/JJ guidelines/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB you/PRP what/WP is/VBZ the/DT position/NN of/IN children/NNS ,/, as/IN entities/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ right/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/'' s/PRP plans/VBZ for/IN the/DT new/JJ model/NN of/IN society/NN in/IN the/DT twenty-first/JJ century/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, the/DT criteria/NNS by/IN which/WDT these/DT rights/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB chosen/VBN must/MD be/VB clearly/RB indicated/VBN ./.

The/DT essential/JJ criterion/NN is/VBZ the/DT rights/NNS of/IN citizens/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, as/IN contained/VBN in/IN the/DT European/JJ project/NN enshrined/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP your/PRP$ concern/NN about/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN children/NNS ./.

Many/JJ elements/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ,/, and/CC particularly/RB of/IN my/PRP$ work/NN as/IN Commissioner/NNP for/IN Justice/NNP and/CC Home/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, involve/VBP protecting/VBG the/DT rights/NNS of/IN children/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT area/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN applies/VBZ fully/RB ./.

Each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP is/VBZ principally/RB responsible/JJ for/IN defining/VBG its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS towards/IN children/NNS ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ responsibility/NN ,/, the/DT rights/NNS of/IN children/NNS must/MD be/VB recognised/VBN in/IN the/DT Charter/NNP according/VBG to/TO the/DT areas/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT Union/NNP can/MD give/VB added/JJ value/NN to/TO the/DT promotion/NN of/IN the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ situation/NN and/CC even/RB the/DT citizenship/NN ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ broadest/JJS sense/NN ,/, of/IN children/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP we/PRP can/MD meet/VB the/DT challenge/NN which/WDT the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP has/VBZ posed/VBN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT whole/JJ Convention/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN the/DT privilege/NN of/IN hearing/VBG the/DT Commissioner/NNP a/DT number/NN of/IN times/NNS on/IN this/DT issue/NN and/CC I/PRP very/RB much/JJ agree/VBP with/IN his/PRP$ approach/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB a/DT slightly/RB different/JJ question/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP just/RB heard/VBN Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP say/VBP that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ anxious/JJ to/TO communicate/VB better/RBR with/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC to/TO aim/VB the/DT information/NN policy/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP towards/IN the/DT major/JJ issues/NNS that/IN the/DT Community/NNP is/VBZ dealing/VBG with/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

Would/MD the/DT Commissioner/NNP argue/VB for/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT information/NN budget/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB put/VBN towards/IN informing/VBG and/CC consulting/VBG the/DT citizens/NNS on/IN this/DT issue/NN of/IN a/DT Citizens/NNP Charter/NNP ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ that/IN the/DT people/NNS feel/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN this/DT process/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Convention/NN itself/PRP will/MD do/VB much/RB in/IN this/DT area/NN but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB the/DT resources/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ ./.

Will/MD the/DT Commission/NNP look/VB at/IN using/VBG its/PRP$ information/NN budget/NN to/TO ensure/VB people/NNS are/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN this/DT debate/NN ?/.

If/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN having/VBG a/DT different/JJ debate/NN here/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP today/NN then/RB that/DT only/RB goes/VBZ to/TO show/VB how/WRB important/JJ this/DT is/VBZ ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD also/RB have/VB the/DT power/NN to/TO act/VB in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN a/DT government/NN electing/VBG to/TO impose/VB a/DT total/JJ blockade/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ sign/NN that/IN majority/NN voting/NN is/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ pre-requisite/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/NN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO function/VB come/VB what/WP may/MD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ where/WRB enlargement/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, and/CC legislation/NN and/CC in/IN relation/NN to/TO treaties/NNS ,/, which/WDT entail/VB changes/VBZ being/VBG made/VBN to/TO legislation/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN we/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO extend/VB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ corresponding/JJ powers/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP as/IN a/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO take/VB action/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Union/NNP ,/, for/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lack/NN of/IN supervision/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

The/DT Finance/NNP Ministers/NNP behave/VB as/IN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN an/DT intergovernmental/JJ meeting/NN ,/, when/WRB in/IN the/DT Ecofin/NNP Council/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT Euro/NNP 11/CD Council/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT unacceptable/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB on/RP ./.

Unlike/IN Mrs/NNP Kaufmann/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN extending/VBG supervision/NN over/IN the/DT European/NNP Central/NNP Bank/NNP as/IN I/PRP am/VBP an/DT advocate/NN of/IN independence/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Central/NNP Bank/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX must/MD be/VB an/DT appropriate/JJ level/NN of/IN supervision/NN on/IN the/DT political/JJ side/NN ./.

The/DT overall/JJ plan/NN failed/VBD to/TO do/VB justice/NN to/TO any/DT of/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP must/MD examine/VB whether/IN any/DT changes/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN to/TO this/DT end/NN which/WDT would/MD fall/VB within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

The/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP has/VBZ agreed/VBN to/TO initiate/VB deliberations/NNS on/IN this/DT matter/NN ,/, perhaps/RB to/TO extend/VB the/DT mandate/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ another/DT point/NN I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO draw/VB your/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO ./.

I/PRP would/MD urge/VB those/DT who/WP are/VBP still/RB very/RB hesitant/JJ in/IN this/DT respect/NN to/TO consider/VB whether/IN now/RB is/VBZ not/RB the/DT time/NN to/TO make/VB this/DT connection/NN and/CC perhaps/RB pluck/VB up/RP the/DT courage/NN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB suitable/JJ progress/NN in/IN matters/NNS of/IN fundamental/JJ rights/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP needs/VBZ few/JJ ,/, if/IN any/DT ,/, new/JJ instruments/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB need/VB any/DT new/JJ competences/NNS ./.

What/WP it/PRP does/VBZ need/NN are/VBP instruments/NNS that/WDT will/MD enable/VB it/PRP to/TO put/VB its/PRP$ competences/NNS into/IN practice/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT instruments/NNS have/VBP the/DT effect/NN of/IN enabling/VBG us/PRP to/TO carry/VB out/RP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, the/DT tasks/NNS we/PRP have/VBP already/RB formally/RB been/VBN set/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ issue/NN this/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP has/VBZ to/TO concentrate/VB its/PRP$ energies/NNS on/RP ./.

If/IN we/PRP succeed/VBP in/IN making/VBG progress/NN here/RB ,/, then/RB we/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB ready/JJ for/IN the/DT historic/JJ task/NN of/IN enlarging/VBG the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT crux/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP confident/JJ that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB tackled/VBN in/IN a/DT suitably/RB positive/JJ manner/NN under/IN your/PRP$ tutelage/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB easy/JJ to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ,/, last/JJ week/NN in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP I/NN chair/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP eventually/RB decided/VBD to/TO back/VB the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP and/CC we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO win/VB this/DT wager/NN ./.

You/PRP spoke/VBD to/TO us/PRP about/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN your/PRP$ tour/NN around/IN the/DT various/JJ capital/NN cities/NNS and/CC told/VBD us/PRP about/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS that/IN some/DT governments/NNS have/VBP in/IN reaching/VBG a/DT consensus/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ countries/NNS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB in/IN their/PRP$ parliaments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB you/PRP to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN yesterday/NN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT very/RB worthwhile/JJ day/NN of/IN discussions/NNS and/CC dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT 15/CD national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD represented/VBN by/IN competent/JJ and/CC exacting/JJ delegations/NNS ./.

The/DT aim/NN was/VBD not/RB to/TO draw/VB conclusions/NNS -/: it/PRP was/VBD impossible/JJ to/TO draw/VB any/DT -/: but/CC the/DT debate/NN was/VBD certainly/RB very/RB encouraging/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP shall/MD intensify/VB our/PRP$ collaboration/NN and/CC our/PRP$ dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS for/IN the/DT entire/JJ duration/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

Yesterday/NN ,/, we/PRP also/RB discussed/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, represented/VBN by/IN Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP ,/, who/WP gave/VBD its/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.

This/DT effort/NN was/VBD appreciated/VBN ,/, even/RB if/IN different/JJ views/NNS were/VBD later/RB expressed/VBN as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT proposals/NNS ,/, and/CC moreover/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP ,/, you/PRP also/RB expressed/VBD different/JJ views/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP counting/VBG on/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP counting/VBG on/RP ourselves/PRP and/CC we/PRP are/VBP counting/VBG on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD hold/VB constructive/JJ and/CC decisive/JJ debates/NNS on/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT at/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, only/RB a/DT strengthened/JJ Europe/NNP can/MD cope/VB with/IN enlargement/NN ./.

Only/RB a/DT strengthened/NNP Europe/NNP is/VBZ immune/JJ to/TO political/JJ opportunists/NNS who/WP exploit/VBP dissatisfaction/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB sweeping/JJ reforms/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ and/CC ,/, hence/RB ,/, a/DT widened/NNP IGC/NNP agenda/NN ./.

The/DT Finnish/JJ Presidency/NNP only/RB listened/VBD to/TO minimalist/JJ governments/NNS and/CC ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, turned/VBD a/DT deaf/JJ ear/NN to/TO this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

Portugal/NNP should/MD not/RB take/VB a/DT leaf/NN out/IN its/PRP$ predecessor/NN '/POS s/JJ book/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ of/IN the/DT utmost/JJ importance/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP join/VBP forces/NNS for/IN this/DT IGC/NNP ./.

In/IN many/JJ ways/NNS ,/, they/PRP share/VBP the/DT same/JJ interests/NNS and/CC the/DT same/JJ insights/NNS ./.

An/DT essential/JJ component/NN of/IN this/DT joint/JJ effort/NN should/MD ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, be/VB this/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ right/NN of/IN assent/NN to/TO the/DT forthcoming/JJ changes/NNS to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

Of/IN all/DT priorities/NNS ,/, this/DT one/NN is/VBZ the/DT most/JJS pressing/JJ ./.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ verdict/NN on/IN this/DT ?/.

It/PRP also/RB means/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ Parliament/NNP President/NNP and/CC the/DT two/CD representatives/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO take/VB part/NN on/IN an/DT equal/JJ political/JJ footing/NN and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, not/RB only/RB within/IN the/DT working/VBG party/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ political/JJ level/NN as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN whatsoever/RB why/WRB representatives/NNS directly/RB elected/VBN by/IN citizens/NNS should/MD be/VB involved/VBN in/IN talks/NNS at/IN a/DT lower/JJR level/NN than/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Not/RB only/JJ do/VBP we/PRP owe/VB the/DT sweeping/JJ reforms/NNS to/TO the/DT new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, but/CC we/PRP owe/VBP them/PRP to/TO ourselves/PRP ./.

If/IN we/PRP allow/VBP Europe/NNP to/TO be/VB watered/VBN down/RP as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD drown/VB in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ political/JJ quagmire/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP days/NNS when/WRB I/PRP really/RB can/MD not/RB understand/VB this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO take/VB a/DT masochistic/JJ pleasure/NN in/IN self-mutilation/NN ./.

After/IN having/VBG restricted/VBN ,/, on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ initiative/NN ,/, its/PRP$ participation/NN in/IN the/DT IGC/NNP to/TO two/CD minor/JJ seats/NNS ,/, Parliament/NNP is/VBZ now/RB giving/VBG up/RP the/DT right/NN to/TO add/VB to/TO the/DT agenda/NN for/IN this/DT IGC/NNP ./.

Why/WRB do/VBP we/PRP have/VB to/TO vote/VB on/IN this/DT opinion/NN tomorrow/NN ,/, 3/CD February/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ,/, when/WRB we/PRP could/MD wait/VB ,/, in/IN a/DT position/NN of/IN strength/NN ,/, until/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN the/DT Strasbourg/NNP part-session/NN on/IN 14/CD February/NNP ,/, and/CC thus/RB force/VB an/DT agenda/NN that/WDT is/VBZ complete/JJ ,/, and/CC therefore/RB consistent/JJ ,/, on/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

A/DT good/JJ dose/NN of/IN hypocrisy/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO overlook/VB our/PRP$ weakness/NN today/NN ./.

Hypocrisy/RB to/TO be/VB regretted/VBN bitterly/RB ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ resolution/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT agenda/NN for/IN the/DT IGC/NNP is/VBZ not/RB equal/JJ to/TO the/DT issues/NNS ,/, since/IN in/IN our/PRP$ haste/NN ,/, with/IN blameworthy/JJ naivety/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP stopping/VBG ourselves/PRP forcing/VBG through/IN this/DT more/RBR ambitious/JJ agenda/NN ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT democratic/JJ deficit/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT IGC/NNP ,/, then/RB I/PRP say/VBP that/IN the/DT political/JJ groups/NNS which/WDT so/RB wanted/VBD this/DT haste/NN will/MD be/VB accountable/JJ for/IN this/DT ./.

Whether/IN we/PRP want/VB it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, since/IN Parliament/NNP itself/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO extinguish/VB the/DT only/JJ spotlight/NN capable/JJ of/IN shedding/VBG a/DT little/JJ light/NN on/IN the/DT debates/NNS ,/, the/DT venue/NN for/IN decisions/NNS is/VBZ now/RB going/VBG to/TO move/VB to/TO the/DT 15/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Because/IN of/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT dark/JJ day/NN for/IN Europe/NNP ./.

It/PRP makes/VBZ us/PRP realise/VBP that/IN the/DT victory/NN of/IN democracy/NN is/VBZ never/RB definitive/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/VB to/TO convince/VB and/CC keep/VB on/IN convincing/JJ ./.

Paragraph/NNP D/NNP of/IN the/DT draft/NN resolution/NN requires/VBZ a/DT more/RBR coordinated/JJ and/CC more/RBR open/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN at/IN EU/NNP level/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, possible/JJ to/TO talk/VB about/RB this/DT without/IN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN talking/VBG about/IN monetary/JJ union/NN ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT desire/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT EU/NNP more/RBR democratic/JJ ,/, the/DT whole/JJ construction/NN of/IN EMU/NNP must/MD be/VB reconsidered/VBN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ done/VBN well/RB to/TO lay/VB open/RP this/DT subject/NN to/TO Europe/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT world/NN and/CC if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB set/VB down/RP these/DT values/NNS in/IN a/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT European/NNP Constitution/NNP ,/, then/RB we/PRP shall/MD construct/VB a/DT Europe/NNP without/IN a/DT solid/JJ ,/, lasting/JJ base/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP in/IN the/DT happy/JJ position/NN of/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO refer/VB to/TO a/DT couple/NN of/IN striking/JJ contributions/NNS from/IN a/DT small/JJ group/NN of/IN Nordic/JJ sceptics/NNS and/CC opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT drastic/JJ and/CC growing/VBG integration/NN process/NN which/WDT ,/, looked/VBD long/RB and/CC hard/RB at/IN ,/, threatens/VBZ the/DT whole/NN of/IN democratic/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN the/DT contributions/NNS from/IN Mr/NNP Bonde/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Sj脙/NNP 露/NNP stedt/NNP who/WP point/VBP out/RP that/IN the/DT present/JJ contribution/NN contains/VBZ a/DT string/NN of/IN relatively/RB unconscious/JJ but/CC undoubtedly/RB rational/JJ initiatives/NNS dictated/VBN by/IN the/DT desire/NN for/IN power/NN and/CC pointing/VBG in/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN a/DT centralist/NN and/CC federalist/NN EU/NN ./.

They/PRP rightly/RB included/VBD the/DT problem/NN with/IN monetary/JJ union/NN and/CC centralist/NN government/NN and/CC presented/VBD a/DT number/NN of/IN alternative/JJ democratic/JJ principles/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, that/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG ./.

You/PRP can/MD think/VB what/WP you/PRP like/VBP about/IN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP personally/RB consider/VBP him/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT very/RB dangerous/JJ politician/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP can/MD not/RB just/RB intervene/VB in/IN an/DT independent/JJ and/CC friendly/JJ country/NN '/POS s/NNP democratic/JJ process/NN ./.

When/WRB we/PRP hold/VB intergovernmental/JJ conferences/NNS and/CC consider/VB changes/NNS to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, we/PRP must/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ developing/VBG all/PDT the/DT time/NN ,/, sometimes/RB in/IN contravention/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP just/RB seen/VBN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP Commissioner/NNP Barnier/NNP and/CC the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP here/RB this/DT afternoon/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ task/NN but/CC it/PRP can/MD be/VB done/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ generally/RB agreed/VBN here/RB this/DT afternoon/NN across/IN all/DT groups/NNS that/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP agenda/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO cover/VB the/DT necessary/JJ reform/NN to/TO prepare/VB Europe/NNP for/IN enlargement/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS we/PRP need/VBP to/TO go/VB further/RBR than/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN referred/VBN to/TO as/RB the/DT important/JJ ``/`` Amsterdam/NN leftovers/NNS ''/'' ./.

These/DT include/VBP the/DT extension/NN of/IN qualified/JJ voting/NN -/: in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN we/PRP accept/VBP that/DT but/CC not/RB to/TO areas/NNS of/IN taxation/NN -/: the/DT re-weighting/NN of/IN voting/VBG in/IN Council/NNP to/TO favour/VB larger/JJR states/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN Commissioners/NNP in/IN an/DT enlarged/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT latter/JJ point/NN ,/, Ireland/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO maintain/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO nominate/VB a/DT full/JJ and/CC equal/JJ Member/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP irrespective/NNP of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS joining/VBG ./.

We/PRP are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO consider/VB re-weighting/VBG the/DT votes/NNS in/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ,/, provided/VBN that/IN the/DT larger/JJR Member/JJ States/NNPS are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO agree/VB to/TO every/DT Member/NNP State/NNP having/VBG a/DT full/JJ and/CC equal/JJ Member/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP I/PRP speak/VBP for/IN many/JJ smaller/JJR countries/NNS when/WRB I/PRP make/VBP that/DT particular/JJ point/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, we/PRP would/MD also/RB need/VB a/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT possible/JJ divisions/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS into/IN two/CD -/: into/IN a/DT policy/NN area/NN and/CC an/DT area/NN on/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.

We/PRP would/MD accept/VB the/DT division/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS providing/VBG it/PRP would/MD not/RB limit/VB the/DT control/NN the/DT smaller/JJR Member/JJ States/NNPS had/VBD in/IN the/DT re-negotiation/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ policy/NN area/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB represented/VBN fully/RB in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP we/PRP will/MD not/RB have/VB an/DT input/NN into/IN policy/NN discussions/NNS ./.

So/IN we/PRP are/VBP watching/VBG that/DT entire/JJ point/NN extremely/RB carefully/RB ./.

We/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS and/CC to/TO seeing/VBG its/PRP$ contents/NNS ./.

The/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, has/VBZ set/VBN the/DT number/NN of/IN European/JJ Parliament/NNP Members/NNS at/IN 700/CD and/CC a/DT debate/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP on/IN how/WRB that/DT number/NN will/MD be/VB distributed/VBN among/IN the/DT enlarged/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP warmly/RB recommend/VBP a/DT vote/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen/JJ resolution/NN ,/, which/WDT clearly/RB expresses/VBZ both/PDT our/PRP$ disappointment/NN at/IN the/DT inadequacy/NN of/IN the/DT agenda/NN and/CC our/PRP$ wish/NN that/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP should/MD take/VB place/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, this/DT emerges/VBZ from/IN the/DT favourable/JJ schedule/NN we/PRP decided/VBD upon/RB ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/, under/IN the/DT present/JJ rules/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP would/MD have/VB little/JJ to/TO gain/VB from/IN a/DT policy/NN of/IN confrontation/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD concentrate/VB on/IN working/VBG out/RP persuasive/JJ proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT necessary/JJ reforms/NNS ,/, in/IN collaboration/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP whose/WP$ own/JJ proposals/NNS are/VBP worthy/JJ of/IN note/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD use/VB dialogue/NN at/IN every/DT political/JJ level/NN ,/, including/VBG of/IN course/NN dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS ./.

That/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD create/VB a/DT climate/NN of/IN cooperation/NN which/WDT will/MD be/VB positive/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT reforms/NNS ./.

Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ representatives/NNS at/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP must/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ to/TO those/DT with/IN whom/WP they/PRP will/MD be/VB negotiating/VBG that/IN ,/, with/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ institutional/JJ changes/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP faced/VBN with/IN responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT constitutional/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

They/PRP must/MD therefore/RB realise/VB that/IN such/JJ issues/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB decided/VBN on/IN the/DT rationale/NN of/IN bargaining/NN alone/RB ./.

The/DT issues/NNS to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN at/IN this/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP are/VBP exceptionally/RB sensitive/JJ ./.

It/PRP may/MD be/VB easy/JJ to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN solutions/NNS ,/, but/CC what/WP matters/NNS is/VBZ how/WRB well/RB those/DT solutions/NNS will/MD stand/VB up/RP in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD mention/VB two/CD point/NN that/WDT may/MD create/VB tension/NN ./.

One/PRP is/VBZ the/DT balance/NN which/WDT has/VBZ so/RB far/RB been/VBN maintained/VBN between/IN large/JJ and/CC small/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Europe/NNP is/VBZ not/RB ,/, nor/CC can/MD it/PRP become/VB a/DT classic/JJ federal/JJ state/NN ./.

The/DT solutions/NNS we/PRP opt/VBP for/IN must/MD be/VB consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ rationale/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT union/NN of/IN states/NNS and/CC peoples/NNS ./.

The/DT other/JJ area/NN of/IN conflict/NN is/VBZ more/RBR difficult/JJ ./.

Owing/VBG to/TO the/DT imminent/JJ increase/NN in/IN membership/NN ,/, the/DT bodies/NNS of/IN the/DT future/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP must/MD become/VB more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN they/PRP must/MD function/VB more/RBR simply/RB and/CC more/RBR rapidly/RB ./.

By/IN its/PRP$ very/JJ nature/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ ,/, and/CC will/MD remain/VB ,/, a/DT complex/JJ and/CC convoluted/JJ multi-governmental/JJ institution/NN ./.

Possibilities/NNS for/IN faster/JJR and/CC more/RBR simple/JJ operation/NN do/VBP exist/VB ./.

Of/IN course/NN they/PRP do/VBP ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP not/RB unlimited/JJ ./.

If/IN the/DT limits/NNS are/VBP exceeded/VBN because/RB of/IN a/DT one-sided/JJ quest/NN for/IN effectiveness/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT legitimising/JJ basis/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD suffer/VB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, optimistic/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP mandate/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB widened/VBN ./.

The/DT most/RBS important/JJ issue/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT is/VBZ internal/JJ differentiation/NN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ that/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN no/DT serious/JJ consideration/NN thus/RB far/RB here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP of/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN internal/JJ differentiation/NN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, be/VB necessary/JJ if/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ to/TO enlarge/VB as/RB planned/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ former/JJ president/NN ,/, Jacques/NNP Delors/NNP ,/, has/VBZ once/RB again/RB publicly/RB raised/VBN the/DT issue/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Confederation/NNP ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ also/RB said/VBN that/IN the/DT countries/NNS in/IN the/DT vanguard/NN of/IN integration/NN should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO proceed/VB faster/RBR and/CC that/IN they/PRP should/MD have/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN clarity/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ current/JJ President/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT High/NNP Representative/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Solana/NNP ,/, have/VBP put/VBN forward/RP ideas/NNS along/IN the/DT same/JJ lines/NNS ./.

Last/JJ November/NNP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP adopted/VBD a/DT position/NN on/IN internal/JJ differentiation/NN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP when/WRB it/PRP proposed/VBD a/DT system/NN of/IN concentric/JJ rings/NNS for/IN Europe/NNP :/: the/DT onion/JJ skin/NN model/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT next/JJ resolution/NN on/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, Parliament/NNP must/MD take/VB a/DT long/JJ and/CC hard/JJ look/NN at/IN the/DT questions/NNS of/IN differentiation/NN and/CC flexibility/NN ./.

Both/DT enlargement/NN and/CC the/DT achievements/NNS of/IN integration/NN will/MD come/VB under/IN threat/NN unless/IN we/PRP can/MD create/VB a/DT system/NN of/IN concentric/JJ rings/NNS ,/, as/IN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ colleagues/NNS ,/, Mrs/NNP Frassoni/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Onesta/NNP have/VBP already/RB spoken/VBN ,/, somewhat/RB sceptically/JJ ,/, about/IN some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT matter/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO add/VB a/DT voice/NN of/IN concern/NN on/IN the/DT topic/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB between/IN Union/NNP and/CC Member/NNP States/NNPS but/CC between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC their/PRP$ own/JJ internally/JJ self-governing/NN regions/NNS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN given/VBN inadequate/JJ attention/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP many/JJ things/NNS to/TO be/VB concerned/JJ about/IN ./.

May/NNP I/PRP particularly/RB draw/VBP attention/NN to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT implications/NNS of/IN enlargement/NN in/IN respect/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

A/DT ceiling/NN of/IN 700/CD has/VBZ been/VBN prescribed/VBN as/IN the/DT maximum/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP can/MD safely/RB become/VB and/CC remain/VB a/DT deliberative/JJ assembly/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB think/VBP we/PRP should/MD ensure/VB ,/, or/CC ask/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO ensure/VB ,/, that/IN there/EX is/VBZ some/DT publicity/NN given/VBN to/TO European/JJ aid/NN whenever/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO repair/VB damage/NN caused/VBN by/IN natural/JJ disasters/NNS or/CC accidents/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT priority/NN given/VBN to/TO financial/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ criteria/NNS reinforces/VBZ the/DT increase/NN in/IN inequalities/NNS of/IN every/DT shape/NN and/CC form/NN ./.

As/IN far/RB as/IN French/JJ planning/NN experts/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS probable/JJ scenario/NN today/NN is/VBZ that/DT of/IN the/DT entrenchment/NN of/IN regional/JJ disparities/NNS within/IN each/DT country/NN ./.

Well/UH ,/, the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS have/VBP helped/VBN to/TO apply/VB a/DT brake/NN to/TO this/DT process/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ project/NN of/IN a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT aims/VBZ to/TO satisfy/VB social/JJ needs/NNS envisages/VBZ the/DT convergence/NN of/IN living/VBG conditions/NNS towards/IN the/DT highest/JJS common/JJ denominator/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ implementation/NN would/MD certainly/RB require/VB extending/VBG the/DT scope/NN of/IN redistribution/NN instruments/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG specifically/RB is/VBZ a/DT unified/JJ capital/NN tax/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO boost/VB the/DT funds/NNS used/VBN to/TO support/VB the/DT harmonisation/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN systems/NNS and/CC the/DT reduction/NN of/IN working/JJ hours/NNS at/IN European/JJ level/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, though/RB bound/VBN to/TO issue/NN guidelines/NNS ,/, does/VBZ so/RB only/RB reluctantly/RB and/CC in/IN a/DT vague/JJ manner/NN ./.

The/DT report/NN put/VBN forward/RB today/NN re-establishes/VBZ its/PRP$ place/NN in/IN the/DT political/JJ sphere/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT steps/NNS towards/IN a/DT policy/NN of/IN employment/NN and/CC sustainable/NN development/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP persuades/VBZ us/PRP to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN her/PRP$ excellent/JJ work/NN ./.

Over/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS ,/, faced/VBN with/IN the/DT challenges/NNS of/IN globalisation/NN and/CC eastward/NN enlargement/NN ,/, Europe/NNP will/MD ,/, more/RBR than/IN ever/RB before/RB ,/, require/VB appropriate/JJ detailed/JJ guidance/NN on/IN how/WRB to/TO plan/VB and/CC revitalise/VB its/PRP$ economy/NN ./.

To/TO this/DT end/NN ,/, Europe/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ,/, and/CC each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP individually/NNP ,/, will/MD have/VB to/TO make/VB optimum/JJ use/NN of/IN all/RB available/JJ resources/NNS and/CC capacities/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

For/IN this/DT to/TO be/VB possible/JJ ,/, what/WP we/PRP need/VBP from/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP are/VBP not/RB just/RB good/JJ intentions/NNS ,/, but/CC clearer/JJR guidelines/NNS and/CC a/DT firm/NN commitment/NN to/TO monitoring/VBG the/DT way/NN these/DT resources/NNS are/VBP used/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS Italy/NNP has/VBZ had/VBN problems/NNS in/IN utilising/VBG the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, mainly/RB because/RB of/IN excessive/JJ bureaucracy/NN ,/, insufficient/JJ information/NN and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN involvement/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ operators/NNS at/IN local/JJ level/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, a/DT genuine/JJ effort/NN is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO make/VB administrative/JJ procedures/NNS simpler/JJR and/CC more/RBR transparent/JJ ,/, since/IN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP all/RB too/RB often/RB unnecessarily/RB lengthy/JJ and/CC complicated/JJ ,/, to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN hindering/VBG access/NN to/TO the/DT Funds/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN about/IN which/WDT European/JJ small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, tend/VBP to/TO complain/VB ./.

I/PRP will/MD conclude/VB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, by/IN saying/VBG that/IN the/DT failure/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ communication/JJ to/TO focus/VB on/RP territorial/JJ pacts/NNS and/CC ,/, especially/RB ,/, methods/NNS of/IN combating/VBG unemployment/NN among/IN women/NNS and/CC young/JJ people/NNS ,/, is/VBZ cause/NN for/IN serious/JJ concern/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, like/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NNP Mr/NNP Evans/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT particular/JJ pleasure/NN to/TO rise/VB and/CC make/VB my/PRP$ first/JJ speech/NN to/TO this/DT House/NNP on/IN this/DT very/RB important/JJ issue/NN ,/, especially/RB since/IN I/PRP represent/VBP a/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ,/, the/DT West/NNP Midlands/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ hitherto/NN benefited/VBN from/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD funding/VBG in/IN particular/JJ ./.

But/CC the/DT report/NN before/IN the/DT House/NNP tonight/NN is/VBZ a/DT prime/JJ example/NN of/IN how/WRB ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB very/RB careful/JJ ,/, we/PRP can/MD produce/VB very/RB grandiose-sounding/JJ ideas/NNS that/WDT lack/VBP the/DT substance/NN to/TO make/VB them/PRP relevant/JJ to/TO the/DT people/NNS who/WP benefit/VBP directly/RB from/IN them/PRP ./.

The/DT report/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ well-intentioned/RB but/RB ,/, as/RB so/RB often/RB when/WRB we/PRP deal/VBP with/IN these/DT issues/NNS ,/, lacks/VBZ clarity/NN of/IN purpose/NN and/CC a/DT sound/JJ basis/NN for/IN operability/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ Group/NNP are/VBP proposing/VBG three/CD key/JJ amendments/NNS and/CC additions/NNS to/TO the/DT text/NN ,/, not/RB to/TO take/VB anything/NN away/RP from/IN the/DT proposal/NN ,/, but/CC to/TO make/VB it/PRP more/RBR relevant/JJ to/TO those/DT whom/WP it/PRP is/VBZ there/EX to/TO guide/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO explain/VB our/PRP$ thinking/NN here/RB ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT proper/JJ use/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ and/CC Cohesion/NNP Funds/NNS ./.

Past/JJ experience/NN dictates/VBZ that/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT elected/VBN representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ taxpayer/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD ,/, and/CC indeed/RB must/MD ,/, demand/VBP financial/JJ probity/NN and/CC transparency/NN in/IN the/DT disbursement/NN and/CC auditing/NN of/IN this/DT money/NN ,/, hence/RB our/PRP$ amendments/NNS and/CC additions/NNS relate/VBP to/TO achieving/VBG what/WP are/VBP known/VBN as/IN ``/`` value/NN for/IN money/NN ''/'' indicators/NNS in/IN the/DT grant-giving/JJ process/NN ./.

Next/RB ,/, we/PRP all/DT too/RB often/RB see/VBP vast/JJ sums/NNS of/IN money/NN being/VBG spent/VBN on/IN projects/NNS whose/WP$ outcomes/NNS will/MD necessarily/RB be/VB unclear/JJ at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN period/NN ./.

But/CC at/IN the/DT mid-way/JJ point/NN or/CC end/NN of/IN that/DT period/NN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT effective/JJ way/NN of/IN terminating/VBG the/DT project/NN if/IN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB proved/VBN successful/JJ ./.

Our/PRP$ additions/NNS therefore/RB call/VBP for/IN the/DT provision/NN of/IN practical/JJ enforceable/NN exit/NN strategies/NNS so/RB that/IN not/RB only/JJ can/MD we/PRP have/VB the/DT requisite/JJ insurance/NN against/IN ongoing/JJ costs/NNS which/WDT are/VBP often/RB loaded/VBN onto/IN the/DT taxpayer/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP also/RB avoid/VB the/DT well-rehearsed/JJ syndrome/NN of/IN throwing/VBG good/JJ money/NN after/IN bad/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP call/VBP for/IN a/DT change/NN to/TO the/DT balance/NN and/CC method/NN by/IN which/WDT the/DT funds/NNS are/VBP disbursed/VBN ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB greater/JJR involvement/NN of/IN the/DT private/JJ sector/NN which/WDT will/MD introduce/VB financial/JJ reality/NN as/IN a/DT perspective/NN within/IN the/DT funding/NN equation/NN ./.

Also/RB the/DT type/NN of/IN project/NN funded/VBN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB shifted/VBN away/RP from/IN small-scale/JJ revenue-based/JJ projects/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP hard/JJ to/TO monitor/VB ,/, towards/IN capital/NN schemes/NNS where/WRB ,/, in/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN cases/NNS ,/, the/DT benefits/NNS are/VBP there/RB for/IN all/DT to/TO see/VB ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT House/NNP to/TO support/VB these/DT changes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO commend/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN her/PRP$ report/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT meticulous/JJ and/CC substantive/JJ piece/NN of/IN work/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/NNP structural/JJ and/CC cohesion/JJ policies/NNS are/VBP ,/, without/IN doubt/NN ,/, essential/JJ tools/NNS for/IN creating/VBG the/DT right/JJ conditions/NNS with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO tackling/VBG and/CC reducing/VBG the/DT levels/NNS of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ disparity/NN between/IN the/DT regions/NNS ./.

Despite/IN the/DT steps/NNS taken/VBN thus/RB far/RB ,/, these/DT levels/NNS are/VBP still/RB very/RB high/JJ ,/, and/CC are/VBP unacceptably/RB high/JJ as/IN regards/JJ unemployment/NN ./.

These/DT policy/NN objectives/NNS can/MD only/RB be/VB achieved/VBN through/IN their/PRP$ careful/JJ coordination/NN and/CC organisation/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN well/RB thought-out/JJ and/CC sensible/JJ guidelines/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/IN when/WRB these/DT policies/NNS are/VBP effective/JJ ,/, they/PRP also/RB benefit/VBP European/JJ citizens/NNS by/IN directly/RB improving/VBG their/PRP$ quality/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

In/IN closing/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT structural/JJ policies/NNS as/IN a/DT whole/NN require/VBP greater/JJR flexibility/NN so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD adapt/VB to/TO changing/VBG circumstances/NNS and/CC thereby/RB respond/VB to/TO the/DT new/JJ challenges/NNS and/CC opportunities/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ millennium/NN ,/, for/IN which/WDT we/PRP all/DT hope/VBP for/IN the/DT best/JJS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN undoubtedly/RB contains/VBZ several/JJ important/JJ observations/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB her/PRP on/IN that/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD be/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT actual/JJ direction/NN and/CC outcome/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

Quite/JJ briefly/NN ,/, structural/JJ policy/NN does/VBZ not/RB ease/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN mass/JJ unemployment/NN in/IN any/DT way/NN ,/, rather/RB it/PRP aggravates/VBZ it/PRP ./.

The/DT agricultural/JJ economy/NN and/CC agricultural/JJ regions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN irreparably/RB damaged/VBN by/IN the/DT existing/VBG regional/JJ policy/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ had/VBN dramatic/JJ consequences/NNS on/IN employment/NN levels/NNS in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS and/CC on/IN the/DT living/VBG conditions/NNS of/IN farmers/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT South/NNP ./.

Regional/NNP disparities/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG much/RB more/RBR marked/JJ within/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

If/IN we/PRP examine/VBP the/DT data/NNS presented/VBD in/IN the/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD see/VB that/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN has/VBZ witnessed/VBN a/DT proliferation/NN of/IN regional/JJ disparities/NNS ./.

Little/JJ consideration/NN ,/, if/IN any/DT at/IN all/DT ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN given/VBN to/TO the/DT great/JJ problems/NNS facing/VBG the/DT island/NN regions/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP whose/WP$ shortcomings/NNS as/IN regards/JJ infrastrucutres/NN structure/NN ,/, transport/NN ,/, communication/NN and/CC energy/NN has/VBZ resulted/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ gradual/JJ depopulation/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/CD economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/RB much/JJ to/TO blame/VB for/IN that/DT as/IN its/PRP$ regional/JJ policy/NN ./.

A/DT large/JJ section/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ population/NN has/VBZ strongly/RB condemned/VBN this/DT policy/NN for/IN being/VBG dangerous/JJ and/CC anti/NN grass-roots/CD ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ guidelines/NNS seem/VBP to/TO be/VB heading/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ direction/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP no/DT signs/NNS that/IN things/NNS will/MD change/VB once/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN implemented/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO highlight/VB two/CD points/NNS made/VBN in/IN these/DT reports/NNS which/WDT are/VBP of/IN fundamental/JJ strategic/JJ importance/NN to/TO the/DT way/NN we/PRP see/VBP the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT fundamental/JJ ,/, central/JJ importance/NN that/IN we/PRP continue/VBP to/TO give/VB to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ to/TO hear/VB news/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG this/DT objective/NN less/RBR seriously/RB ./.

We/PRP still/RB feel/VBP that/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ fundamental/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN what/WP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN said/VBN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT islands/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO bring/VB the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS to/TO your/PRP$ attention/NN ./.

In/IN future/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB greater/JJR ambition/NN applied/VBN to/TO the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS such/JJ as/IN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN ,/, the/DT islands/NNS of/IN the/DT Azores/NNP and/CC Madeira/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO enlighten/VB us/PRP on/IN the/DT reasons/NNS for/IN the/DT delay/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN long/RB awaited/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, not/RB least/JJS for/IN being/VBG willing/JJ to/TO include/VB in/IN the/DT report/NN the/DT suggestions/NNS we/PRP made/VBD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO help/VB steer/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS towards/IN achieving/VBG the/DT reform/NN objectives/NNS contained/VBN in/IN the/DT programmes/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, contrary/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ claim/NN to/TO provide/VB guidance/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposals/NNS in/IN this/DT respect/NN are/VBP reminiscent/JJ to/TO a/DT far/RB greater/JJR extent/NN of/IN a/DT catalogue/NN of/IN possible/JJ measures/NNS within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ policy/NN areas/NNS ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, their/PRP$ true/JJ purpose/NN is/VBZ to/TO give/VB direction/NN and/CC to/TO set/VB priorities/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP particularly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT proposed/VBN amendment/NN tabled/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ Group/NNP to/TO paragraph/CD 10/CD ,/, to/TO ensure/VB an/DT appropriate/JJ level/NN of/IN private/JJ sector/NN involvement/NN in/IN the/DT planning/NN and/CC implementation/NN of/IN the/DT projects/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD be/VB very/RB grateful/JJ ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, if/IN you/PRP would/MD actually/RB include/VB this/DT proposed/VBN amendment/NN in/IN the/DT part/NN relating/VBG to/TO subsidiarity/VB in/IN your/PRP$ positive/JJ deliberations/NNS ./.

They/PRP are/VBP growing/VBG ,/, but/CC only/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN GDP/NNP ./.

They/PRP are/VBP increasing/VBG in/IN competitiveness/NN but/CC they/PRP are/VBP not/RB all/DT experiencing/VBG an/DT increase/NN in/IN wealth/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT increase/NN in/IN employment/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP still/RB differences/NNS in/IN employment/NN opportunities/NNS between/IN regions/NNS ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, please/VB read/VB the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC treat/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN priority/NN ,/, because/IN this/DT is/VBZ our/PRP$ citizens/NNS '/POS greatest/JJS problem/NN ./.

Please/VB take/VB account/NN ,/, in/IN strategic/JJ terms/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT revision/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT allocation/NN of/IN reserves/NNS ,/, of/IN employment/NN needs/NNS ,/, because/IN this/DT ,/, fundamentally/RB is/VBZ what/WP the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC the/DT Cohesion/NNP Funds/NNPS require/VBP ./.

Cohesion/NN policy/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB strengthened/VBN further/RBR because/IN a/DT Europe/NNP which/WDT totally/RB disregards/VBZ the/DT standard/NN of/IN living/VBG in/IN its/PRP$ regions/NNS can/MD neither/RB be/VB reliable/JJ or/CC viable/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ great/JJ interest/NN in/IN listening/VBG carefully/RB to/TO the/DT comments/NNS ,/, occasional/JJ criticisms/NNS and/CC suggestions/NNS that/IN some/DT of/IN you/PRP have/VBP just/RB made/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ speeches/NNS with/IN reference/NN to/TO Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ./.

So/CC ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB in/IN a/DT moment/NN to/TO return/VB to/TO the/DT role/NN and/CC structure/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS before/IN mentioning/VBG the/DT principal/JJ comments/NNS and/CC criticisms/NNS that/IN you/PRP ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT various/JJ Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, have/VBP made/VBN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ putting/VBG forward/RP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ priorities/NNS ,/, based/VBN on/IN past/JJ experience/NN in/IN implementing/VBG the/DT programmes/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN current/JJ Community/NNP policies/NNS relating/VBG to/TO structural/JJ operations/NNS ./.

When/WRB I/PRP speak/VBP of/IN optimum/JJ utilisation/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG both/DT to/TO the/DT national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ levels/NNS ./.

And/CC so/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Sepp脙/NNP 鈧?NNP nen/VBP ,/, I/PRP shall/MD also/RB mention/VB at/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, speaking/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ level/NN ,/, the/DT link/NN with/IN the/DT Cohesion/NNP Fund/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT purpose/NN of/IN these/DT guidelines/NNS ./.

Regarding/VBG their/PRP$ content/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, they/PRP are/VBP focused/VBN on/IN three/CD strategic/JJ priorities/NNS that/IN your/PRP$ rapporteur/NN pointed/VBD out/RP very/RB clearly/RB but/RB ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, very/RB passionately/RB ,/, as/IN I/PRP understood/VBD her/PRP$ presentation/NN just/RB now/RB ./.

Perhaps/RB I/PRP may/MD inform/VB Mr/NNP Ribeiro/NNP e/NNP Castro/NNP ,/, who/WP asked/VBD me/PRP about/IN this/DT ,/, that/IN ,/, as/IN I/PRP wrote/VBD to/TO the/DT presidents/NNS of/IN each/DT of/IN these/DT most/JJS remote/JJ regions/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP did/VBD indeed/RB request/NN an/DT extension/NN of/IN several/JJ weeks/NNS before/IN publishing/VBG its/PRP$ anticipated/JJ report/NN ./.

Concerning/VBG the/DT most/JJS remote/JJ regions/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD only/RB quite/RB belatedly/JJ that/IN we/PRP received/VBD the/DT memorandums/NNS from/IN the/DT various/JJ governments/NNS ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB an/DT excuse/NN ,/, just/RB an/DT explanation/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD therefore/RB take/VB these/DT memorandums/NNS into/IN consideration/NN and/CC produce/VB an/DT extremely/RB thorough/JJ piece/NN of/IN work/NN ./.

So/IN that/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ priority/NN ,/, the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN regional/JJ economies/NNS ./.

The/DT third/JJ objective/NN is/VBZ urban/JJ and/CC rural/JJ development/NN ,/, within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN a/DT balanced/VBN territorial/NN policy/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS take/VBP two/CD horizontal/JJ principles/NNS into/IN account/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ rural/JJ development/NN ,/, and/CC let/VBD me/PRP say/VBP ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, that/IN I/PRP am/VBP including/VBG in/IN rural/JJ development/NN the/DT matter/NN of/IN sustainable/JJ transport/NN ,/, an/DT issue/NN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN personally/RB for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./.

I/PRP particularly/RB remember/VBP the/DT time/NN when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD Minister/NNP for/IN the/DT Environment/NN in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ principle/NN is/VBZ that/DT of/IN equal/JJ opportunities/NNS ,/, particularly/RB for/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT European/JJ strategy/NN for/IN employment/NN and/CC the/DT context/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ Union/NNP ./.

These/DT are/VBP the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB the/DT guidelines/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN according/VBG to/TO thematic/JJ priorities/NNS ,/, since/IN they/PRP must/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN ,/, under/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT objectives/NNS ,/, to/TO different/JJ extents/NNS in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT specific/JJ situations/NNS of/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC regions/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD now/RB like/VB to/TO respond/VB briefly/RB to/TO a/DT few/JJ of/IN the/DT comments/NNS you/PRP have/VBP made/VBN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, and/CC firstly/RB on/IN procedure/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN consultation/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ only/RB come/VBN about/IN at/IN a/DT late/JJ date/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP remind/VB you/PRP that/IN when/WRB the/DT guidelines/NNS were/VBD adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT draft/NN in/IN February/NNP 1999/CD ,/, in/IN line/NN with/IN a/DT new/JJ procedure/NN intended/VBN to/TO make/VB it/PRP easier/RBR to/TO present/VB comments/NNS on/IN this/DT text/NN ,/, my/PRP$ predecessor/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP ,/, presented/VBD them/PRP to/TO Parliament/NNP immediately/RB ./.

Due/JJ to/TO the/DT elections/NNS to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP taking/VBG place/NN around/IN this/DT time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP was/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO undertake/VB its/PRP$ examination/NN of/IN these/DT guidelines/NNS until/IN after/IN the/DT text/NN had/VBD been/VBN definitively/RB adopted/VBN ,/, in/IN July/NNP 1999/CD ./.

And/CC let/VB me/PRP assure/VB you/PRP ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, that/IN when/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP adopts/VBZ the/DT guidelines/NNS with/IN what/WP we/PRP call/VBP the/DT mid-term/JJ review/NN in/IN mind/NN ,/, in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT regulations/NNS ,/, then/RB the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP ,/, as/IN expressed/VBD in/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, will/MD also/RB be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN ./.

Now/RB to/TO the/DT form/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, you/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT context/NN in/IN which/WDT guidelines/NNS on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN European/JJ objectives/NNS ,/, often/RB very/RB precise/JJ ones/NNS ,/, should/MD be/VB provided/VBN ./.

Drawing/VBG to/TO a/DT close/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN challenges/NNS which/WDT you/PRP reiterated/VBD ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN these/DT guidelines/NNS are/VBP not/RB specific/JJ enough/RB in/IN their/PRP$ recommendations/NNS ./.

This/DT claim/VBP that/IN your/PRP$ report/NN makes/NNS must/MD be/VB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN last/JJ spring/NN '/POS s/JJ negotiations/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP kept/VBD to/TO the/DT actual/JJ text/NN of/IN Article/NNP 10/CD of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS regulations/NNS ,/, which/WDT stipulates/VBZ that/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN these/DT guidelines/NNS is/VBZ to/TO provide/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS with/IN broad/JJ ,/, indicative/JJ guidelines/NNS on/IN relevant/JJ and/CC agreed/VBD Community/NNP policies/NNS ./.

I/PRP actually/RB quoted/VBD the/DT text/NN itself/PRP ,/, in/IN quotation/NN marks/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS may/MD not/RB substitute/VB for/IN the/DT programming/NN or/CC the/DT ex/FW ante/FW assessments/NNS which/WDT must/MD be/VB the/DT tool/NN used/VBN to/TO specify/VB priorities/NNS and/CC the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN these/DT programmes/NNS ./.

You/PRP then/RB mentioned/VBD ,/, Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP ,/, the/DT section/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS relating/VBG to/TO urban/JJ and/CC rural/JJ development/NN ,/, pointing/VBG out/RP that/IN urban/JJ development/NN was/VBD not/RB sufficiently/RB taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN ./.

I/PRP find/VBP the/DT opposite/NN the/DT case/NN ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO confirm/VB the/DT great/JJ importance/NN the/DT Commission/NNP attaches/VBZ ,/, and/CC shall/MD attach/VB ,/, to/TO the/DT urban/JJ dimension/NN of/IN our/PRP$ cohesion/NN policy/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD occasion/NN recently/RB to/TO say/VB as/RB much/RB to/TO all/PDT the/DT ministers/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN urban/JJ policy/NN at/IN a/DT meeting/NN in/IN Tampere/NNP ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ rural/JJ development/NN ,/, which/WDT a/DT number/NN of/IN you/PRP brought/VBD up/RP ,/, particularly/RB Mrs/NNP Redondo/NNP Jim脙/NNP 漏/NNP nez/NN ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS are/VBP in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT twofold/JJ objective/NN mentioned/VBN by/IN your/PRP$ rapporteur/NN :/: a/DT strong/JJ agricultural/JJ sector/NN linked/VBN with/IN increased/JJ competitiveness/NN in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB protection/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ rural/JJ heritage/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, be/VB stressed/VBN that/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS under/IN discussion/NN are/VBP related/VBN only/RB to/TO the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ Objectives/NNP 1/CD and/CC 2/CD specifically/RB adopt/VBP the/DT diversification/NN of/IN rural/JJ society/NN as/IN a/DT priority/NN ./.

And/CC indeed/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT balance/NN of/IN rural/JJ society/NN ,/, let/VBP us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT new/JJ rural/JJ development/NN policy/NN cofinanced/VBN by/IN the/DT EAGGF/NNP Guarantee/NN Section/NN ,/, aimed/VBN at/IN promoting/VBG reform/NN in/IN European/JJ agriculture/NN and/CC supporting/VBG the/DT multifunctional/JJ aspect/NN of/IN agriculture/NN ./.

At/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD simply/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB it/PRP integrated/VBN into/IN the/DT programming/NN for/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT EAGGF/NNP Guidance/NNP Section/NNP is/VBZ for/IN Objective/NNP 1/CD regions/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP report/NN generally/RB relativises/VBZ this/DT observation/NN ,/, particularly/RB when/WRB it/PRP refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ situation/NN of/IN some/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP in/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP a/DT special/JJ interest/NN ,/, by/IN which/WDT I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT French/JJ overseas/JJ departments/NNS and/CC ,/, more/RBR generally/RB ,/, the/DT most/RBS remote/JJ regions/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, this/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN presents/VBZ interesting/JJ arguments/NNS from/IN the/DT viewpoint/NN of/IN a/DT real/JJ project/NN for/IN the/DT balanced/JJ sustainable/JJ development/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, particularly/RB when/WRB it/PRP outlines/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT central/JJ areas/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ more/JJR remote/JJ regions/NNS ./.

Even/RB if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ still/RB reluctant/JJ to/TO say/VB so/RB in/IN too/RB explicit/JJ a/DT fashion/NN ,/, its/PRP$ periodic/JJ report/NN demonstrates/VBZ the/DT urgent/JJ need/NN to/TO promote/VB polycentric/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP area/NN through/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ structural/JJ policies/NNS and/CC within/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT approach/NN initiated/VBN by/IN the/DT SEC/NNP ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ sixth/JJ report/NN presents/VBZ very/RB valuable/JJ conclusions/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD summarise/VB two/CD of/IN those/DT highlighted/VBN by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, one/PRP positive/JJ and/CC one/PRP negative/JJ ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN important/JJ advances/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN in/IN regional/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN throughout/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC that/IN the/DT Community/NNP Funds/NNPS have/VBP been/VBN a/DT major/JJ ,/, although/IN not/RB decisive/JJ ,/, factor/NN in/IN reducing/VBG regional/JJ inequalities/NNS ./.

The/DT negative/JJ conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT great/JJ effort/NN made/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN more/RBR efficient/JJ in/IN harmonising/VBG the/DT European/JJ regions/NNS '/POS GDP/NN and/CC productivity/NN than/IN in/IN harmonising/VBG its/PRP$ levels/NNS of/IN unemployment/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO link/VB structural/JJ financing/NN more/RBR closely/RB to/TO job/NN creation/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD do/VB its/PRP$ best/JJS to/TO promote/VB the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT future/JJ Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD achieve/VB the/DT best/JJS of/IN both/DT worlds/NNS by/IN having/VBG a/DT clear/JJ text/NN ,/, a/DT text/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB easily/RB read/VBN by/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN a/DT text/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN a/DT legal/JJ instrument/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT contradiction/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD ./.

The/DT challenge/NN we/PRP have/VBP is/VBZ to/TO bring/VB them/PRP together/RB in/IN the/DT final/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT Charter/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB glad/JJ to/TO know/VB that/IN I/PRP can/MD count/VB on/IN your/PRP$ support/NN here/RB ./.

Question/NNP No/VBD 40/CD by/IN -LRB-/-LRB- H-0095/NNP //CD 00/CD -RRB-/-RRB- :/: ./.

Subject/NNP :/: Articles/NNP 6.1/CD ,/, 7.1/CD and/CC 7.2/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN European/NNP Union/NNP Article/NNP 6.1/NNP of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP states/NNS that/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN principles/NNS of/IN liberty/NN ,/, democracy/NN ,/, respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC fundamental/JJ freedoms/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ from/IN statements/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ years/NNS that/IN J脙/NNP 露/NNP rg/NNP Haider/NNP and/CC the/DT Freedom/NNP Party/NNP do/VBP not/RB respect/VB human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC fundamental/JJ freedoms/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/TO third/JJ country/NN nationals/NNS and/CC minority/NN groups/NNS living/VBG in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT statement/NN made/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN 1/CD February/NNP 2000/CD ,/, the/DT basic/JJ elements/NNS of/IN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO restate/VB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP confirmed/VBD then/RB ,/, as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ today/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP shares/VBZ the/DT concerns/NNS underlying/VBG the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP '/POS s/JJ statement/NN of/IN 1/CD February/NNP 2000/CD ./.

These/DT concerns/NNS are/VBP legitimate/JJ and/CC there/EX are/VBP good/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN them/PRP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN J脙/NNP 露/NNP rg/NNP Haider/NNP '/POS s/JJ political/JJ bias/NN and/CC of/IN his/PRP$ many/JJ xenophobic/NN and/CC racist/JJ public/JJ statements/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP also/RB anti-European/JJ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP reiterated/VBD and/CC reiterates/VBZ again/RB its/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO continue/VB fulfilling/VBG its/PRP$ duty/NN as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, specifically/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO Articles/VB 6/CD and/CC 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP thereby/RB gave/VBD a/DT practical/JJ demonstration/NN of/IN its/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT essential/JJ pillars/NNS :/: that/DT of/IN the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

This/DT principle/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD act/VB within/IN the/DT limits/NNS laid/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN this/DT context/NN that/IN the/DT statement/NN of/IN 1/CD February/NNP was/VBD made/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT State/NN ./.

It/PRP can/MD not/RB and/CC must/MD not/RB act/VB as/RB if/IN it/PRP were/VBD one/CD ./.

I/PRP repeat/VB ,/, a/DT ``/`` serious/JJ and/CC persistent/`` breach/NN ''/'' is/VBZ the/DT condition/NN necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO propose/VB to/TO the/DT Council/NNP that/IN measures/NNS be/VB adopted/VBN against/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN conditions/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN met/VBN which/WDT would/MD apply/VB to/TO the/DT current/JJ situation/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

As/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN fact/NN I/PRP think/VBP that/IN I/PRP am/VBP right/JJ in/IN saying/VBG that/IN we/PRP all/DT hope/VBP that/IN these/DT conditions/NNS of/IN a/DT serious/JJ and/CC persistent/JJ breach/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC of/IN democracy/NN are/VBP never/RB fulfilled/VBN ,/, either/CC in/IN Austria/NNP or/CC in/IN any/DT other/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO assure/VB you/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ personal/JJ commitment/NN and/CC of/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, as/IN stated/VBD once/RB again/RB by/IN President/NNP Prodi/NNP this/DT morning/NN ,/, to/TO doing/VBG everything/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO apply/VB the/DT mechanism/NN stated/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 7/CD ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO assure/VB you/PRP though/RB that/IN we/PRP will/MD not/RB hesitate/VB to/TO apply/VB it/PRP should/MD it/PRP prove/VB necessary/JJ ./.

The/DT values/NNS at/IN stake/NN are/VBP too/RB central/JJ ,/, too/RB fundamental/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO accept/VB dithering/VBG or/CC compromises/VBZ ./.

Individuals/NNS and/CC governments/NNS should/MD be/VB judged/VBN by/IN what/WP they/PRP do/VBP rather/RB than/IN by/IN what/WP they/PRP say/VBP ./.

In/IN Austria/NNP '/POS s/JJ case/NN ,/, the/DT statements/NNS are/VBP contradictory/NN to/TO say/VB the/DT least/JJS ./.

On/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, any/DT of/IN us/PRP could/MD pick/VB up/RP on/IN a/DT whole/JJ cluster/NN of/IN inflammatory/JJ remarks/NNS by/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT Freedom/NNP Party/NNP ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ Austrian/JJ Government/NN '/POS s/JJ programme/NN reaffirms/VBZ its/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO defend/VB democracy/NN and/CC human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP will/MD soon/RB have/VB our/PRP$ first/JJ opportunity/NN ,/, and/CC an/DT excellent/JJ opportunity/NN it/PRP will/MD be/VB ,/, to/TO see/VB which/WDT one/CD of/IN these/DT two/CD faces/NNS of/IN the/DT Freedom/NNP Party/NNP is/VBZ the/DT real/JJ one/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO the/DT position/NN the/DT Austrian/JJ Government/NN will/MD adopt/VB at/IN the/DT Council/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN an/DT action/NN programme/NN to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN and/CC for/IN two/CD directives/NNS ./.

One/PRP applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT principle/NN of/IN treating/VBG people/NNS equally/RB ,/, without/IN differentiating/VBG on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN race/NN or/CC ethnic/JJ origin/NN ./.

The/DT other/JJ proposal/NN will/MD provide/VB protection/NN at/IN work/NN against/IN discrimination/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN ethnic/JJ or/CC racial/JJ origin/NN ,/, religion/NN ,/, handicap/NN or/CC sexual/JJ persuasion/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP significant/JJ texts/NNS ,/, adopted/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Article/NNP 13/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, which/WDT gave/VBD the/DT Community/NNP jurisdiction/NN to/TO fight/VB discrimination/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN race/NN ,/, ethnic/JJ origin/NN ,/, sex/NN etc./NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO assure/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP Ford/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD remain/VB vigilant/NN and/CC will/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO act/VB in/IN accordance/NN with/IN its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS ,/, should/MD it/PRP prove/VB necessary/JJ ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ reply/NN to/TO my/PRP$ question/NN ./.

But/CC is/VBZ Commissioner/NNP Vitorino/NNP aware/JJ ,/, not/RB only/RB of/IN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP 's/POS and/CC the/DT Freedom/NNP Party/NNP 's/VBZ words/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB of/IN their/PRP$ deeds/NNS ?/.

Could/MD the/DT Commissioner/NNP answer/VB two/CD questions/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB he/PRP talked/VBD about/IN verification/NN ./.

Can/MD he/PRP tell/VB us/PRP how/WRB that/DT verification/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN and/CC who/WP will/MD do/VB it/PRP ?/.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB talking/VBG about/IN words/NNS here/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN deeds/NNS by/IN the/DT Freedom/NNP Party/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Haider/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB clear/JJ to/TO me/PRP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO closely/RB monitor/VB the/DT evolution/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS according/VBG to/TO the/DT procedures/NNS and/CC standards/NNS that/WDT are/VBP enshrined/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 6/CD and/CC justify/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN Article/NNP 7/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB I/PRP am/VBP fully/RB confident/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO follow/VB very/RB closely/RB the/DT evolution/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Austria/NNP ,/, as/RB in/IN any/DT other/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

If/IN any/DT concrete/JJ case/NN of/IN persistent/JJ violation/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS perpetrated/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN of/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP occurs/VBZ ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB entirely/RB capable/JJ to/TO react/VB and/CC to/TO act/VB accordingly/RB ./.

I/PRP also/RB rely/VBP not/RB only/JJ on/IN the/DT cooperation/NN of/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT cooperation/NN of/IN non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP always/RB made/VBN an/DT important/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT anti-discrimination/JJ policy/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Regarding/VBG the/DT situation/NN in/IN Carinthia/NNP ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO look/VB at/IN this/DT in/IN detail/NN ./.

The/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP raised/VBD the/DT question/NN ./.

The/DT protection/NN of/IN ethnic/JJ minorities/NNS and/CC of/IN minorities/NNS that/WDT speak/VBP a/DT specific/JJ language/NN is/VBZ an/DT element/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT two/CD directives/NNS that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN before/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB only/RB focus/VB this/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ question/NN ./.

That/DT question/NN calls/VBZ for/IN reflection/NN ,/, for/IN debate/NN and/CC ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, for/IN action/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP Vitorino/NNP ,/, for/IN your/PRP$ valuable/JJ contribution/NN to/TO this/DT Question/NNP Time/NNP ./.

Second/JJ part/VB ./.

Questions/NNS to/TO Mrs/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m./VBP Question/NNP No/NNP 41/CD by/IN -LRB-/-LRB- H-0021/NNP //CD 00/CD -RRB-/-RRB- :/: ./.

Subject/NNP :/: Surplus/JJ electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ equipment/NN Each/DT year/NN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ to/TO deal/VB with/IN a/DT growing/VBG volume/NN of/IN surplus/JJ electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ equipment/NN -LRB-/-LRB- 6/CD million/CD tonnes/NNS '/POS worth/NN in/IN 1998/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, mainly/RB on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT speed/NN with/IN which/WDT such/JJ equipment/NN becomes/VBZ obsolescent/JJ ./.

The/DT environmental/JJ problems/NNS stemming/VBG from/IN the/DT incineration/NN and/CC the/DT dumping/NN of/IN such/JJ waste/NN are/VBP mainly/RB attributable/JJ to/TO the/DT presence/NN of/IN hazardous/JJ substances/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- lead/NN ,/, cadmium/NN ,/, mercury/NN ,/, hexavalent/JJ chrome/NN ,/, PVC/NNP and/CC halogenated/JJ flame/NN retarders/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

A/DT preliminary/JJ draft/NN directive/NN intended/VBN to/TO regulate/VB the/DT management/NN of/IN such/JJ waste/NN has/VBZ been/VBN through/IN three/CD successive/JJ versions/NNS ,/, the/DT most/RBS recent/JJ of/IN which/WDT dates/VBZ from/IN July/NNP 1999/CD ./.

Can/MD the/DT Commission/NNP account/VB for/IN the/DT lengthy/JJ gestation/NN of/IN this/DT draft/NN ,/, which/WDT should/MD in/IN theory/NN have/VB emerged/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ final/JJ form/NN in/IN 1998/CD ?/.

The/DT Commission/NNP agrees/VBZ with/IN MEPs/NNP that/IN the/DT current/JJ method/NN of/IN dumping/VBG electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN is/VBZ causing/VBG major/JJ environmental/JJ problems/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP decided/VBD to/TO prepare/VB a/DT proposal/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN and/CC ,/, since/IN 1997/CD ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT parties/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

The/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT discussions/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN of/IN the/DT in-depth/JJ investigations/NNS which/WDT are/VBP being/VBG carried/VBN out/RP in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, are/VBP now/RB being/VBG examined/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Some/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT proposal/NN have/VBP been/VBN criticised/JJ ,/, among/IN them/PRP the/DT phasing/VBG out/RP of/IN some/DT heavy/JJ metals/NNS and/CC brominated/JJ flame/NN retardants/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN making/VBG manufacturers/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT disposal/NN of/IN electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN ./.

The/DT United/NNP States/NNPS '/POS delegation/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ concerned/VBN about/IN certain/JJ points/NNS in/IN the/DT last/JJ consultation/NN paper/NN ,/, inter/NN alia/NN the/DT phasing/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT materials/NNS already/RB mentioned/VBN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN certain/JJ questions/NNS arising/VBG from/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN manufacturers/NNS '/POS responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT disposal/NN of/IN electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ argument/NN put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS in/IN this/DT context/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT present/JJ provisions/NNS are/VBP ,/, they/PRP say/VBP ,/, incompatible/JJ with/IN international/JJ trade/NN law/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB carefully/RB reviewing/VBG the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS '/POS arguments/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO add/VB that/IN my/PRP$ intention/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO present/VB a/DT proposal/NN on/IN the/DT dumping/NN of/IN electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN before/IN Easter/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN specifically/RB concerned/VBD the/DT reaction/NN of/IN the/DT US/NNP Government/NNP to/TO the/DT text/NN of/IN the/DT preliminary/JJ draft/NN ./.

There/EX have/VBP in/IN fact/NN been/VBN three/CD preliminary/JJ draft/NN texts/NNS with/IN the/DT last/JJ one/NN ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, dating/VBG from/IN July/NNP 1999/CD ./.

Is/VBZ this/DT the/DT text/NN which/WDT you/PRP will/MD be/VB submitting/VBG ,/, or/CC an/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT original/JJ version/NN ?/.

Version/NNP 3/CD is/VBZ already/RB much/RB weaker/JJR than/IN Version/NNP 2/CD following/VBG the/DT comments/NNS of/IN US/NNP industry/NN as/IN relayed/VBD by/IN the/DT US/NNP Government/NNP ./.

I/PRP note/VBP in/IN particular/JJ that/IN when/WRB you/PRP talk/VBP about/IN the/DT international/JJ law/NN with/IN which/WDT the/DT text/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB compatible/JJ ,/, you/PRP are/VBP referring/VBG in/IN fact/NN to/TO the/DT rules/NNS of/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP ./.

The/DT arguments/NNS of/IN the/DT US/NNP Government/NNP concern/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT future/JJ ban/NN on/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ substances/NNS in/IN electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN would/MD be/VB contrary/JJ to/TO the/DT WTO/NNP rules/NNS ./.

This/DT worries/VBZ me/PRP because/IN this/DT means/VBZ that/IN ,/, when/WRB adopting/VBG texts/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB continually/RB threatened/VBN by/IN attack/NN from/IN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP ./.

This/DT will/MD fundamentally/RB weaken/VB European/JJ environmental/JJ legislation/NN and/CC particularly/RB this/DT proposal/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN me/PRP to/TO have/VB a/DT chance/NN to/TO answer/VB it/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN in/IN a/DT process/NN such/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG the/DT disposal/NN of/IN a/DT considerable/JJ stream/NN of/IN both/DT electrical/JJ and/CC electronic/JJ waste/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ an/DT on-going/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN the/DT different/JJ parties/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

The/DT dialogue/NN has/VBZ been/VBN fruitful/JJ and/CC has/VBZ led/VBN to/TO our/PRP$ preparing/VBG a/DT proposal/NN ./.

Parts/NNS of/IN it/PRP have/VBP been/VBN strengthened/VBN ,/, but/CC other/JJ parts/NNS may/MD well/RB contain/VB too/RB many/JJ compromises/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP still/RB in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN preparing/VBG a/DT text/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT relevant/JJ parties/NNS will/MD continue/VB up/RP until/IN the/DT last/JJ moment/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN the/DT intervention/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS should/MD push/VB us/PRP in/IN a/DT direction/NN that/WDT would/MD lead/VB to/TO our/PRP$ taking/NN insufficient/JJ account/NN of/IN environmental/JJ considerations/NNS ./.

I/PRP strongly/RB oppose/VBP using/VBG the/DT WTO/NNP and/CC trade/NN rules/NNS as/IN a/DT pretext/NN for/IN preventing/VBG the/DT EU/NN from/IN introducing/VBG radical/JJ environmental/JJ standards/NNS ./.

I/PRP start/VBP from/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD in/IN fact/NN introduce/VB these/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP want/VBP to/TO listen/VB to/TO all/PDT the/DT points/NNS of/IN view/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD be/VB showing/VBG the/DT way/NN ,/, an/DT intention/NN that/WDT will/MD also/RB characterise/VB the/DT final/JJ proposal/NN ./.

More/JJR women/NNS in/IN decision-making/JJ positions/NNS on/IN various/JJ environmental/JJ bodies/NNS would/MD extend/VB the/DT predominantly/RB male/JJ terms/NNS of/IN reference/NN beyond/IN business/NN alone/RB to/TO embrace/VB social/JJ justice/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP prepared/VBN to/TO adopt/VB an/DT action/NN plan/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT active/JJ participation/NN of/IN women/NNS in/IN decision-making/NN in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ field/NN ?/.

In/IN 1988/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP introduced/VBD an/DT action/NN plan/NN to/TO promote/VB equal/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN women/NNS and/CC men/NNS ./.

Through/IN the/DT current/JJ programme/NN ,/, which/WDT covers/VBZ the/DT period/NN 1997/CD to/TO 2000/CD ,/, we/PRP are/VBP endeavouring/VBG to/TO encourage/VB a/DT workplace/NN culture/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT value/NN of/IN both/DT men/NNS and/CC women/NNS is/VBZ integrated/JJ and/CC where/WRB gender-specific/JJ needs/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT programme/NN 's/POS aims/NNS is/VBZ to/TO develop/VB and/CC supervise/VB methods/NNS ,/, strategies/NNS and/CC measures/NNS for/IN promoting/VBG gender/NN equality/NN in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN and/CC in/IN positions/NNS of/IN responsibility/NN ./.

Within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT action/NN plan/NN ,/, each/DT individual/JJ directorate/NN general/NN is/VBZ to/TO prepare/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ programme/NN of/IN measures/NNS ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT goals/NNS of/IN those/DT programmes/NNS is/VBZ to/TO increase/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN women/NNS in/IN managerial/JJ positions/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ Commission/NN 's/POS own/JJ objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO double/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN women/NNS managers/NNS before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN its/PRP$ term/NN of/IN office/NN ./.

The/DT same/JJ line/NN is/VBZ being/VBG pursued/VBN with/IN particular/JJ vigour/NN in/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, where/WRB nearly/RB 60/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN directors/NNS and/CC 20/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN unit/NN heads/NNS are/VBP women/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ policy/NN is/VBZ to/TO encourage/VB the/DT recruitment/NN of/IN women/NNS to/TO administrative/JJ posts/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO create/VB a/DT reserve/NN of/IN suitable/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN future/JJ promotion/NN to/TO managerial/JJ positions/NNS ./.

Currently/RB ,/, women/NNS hold/VBP 24.5/FW per/FW cent/NN of/IN our/PRP$ A-grade/JJ posts/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP hope/VBP the/DT number/NN will/MD increase/VB steadily/RB ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG hard/RB to/TO attract/VB qualified/JJ women/NNS to/TO participate/VB in/IN our/PRP$ consultation/NN groups/NNS ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ our/PRP$ external/JJ partners/NNS ,/, all/RB we/PRP can/MD do/VB is/VBZ set/VBN them/PRP a/DT good/JJ example/NN and/CC encourage/VB their/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO democratise/VB their/PRP$ decision-making/JJ processes/NNS ./.

With/IN respect/NN to/TO the/DT general/JJ principle/NN of/IN incorporating/VBG a/DT perspective/NN of/IN equality/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, this/DT principle/NN is/VBZ included/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP ./.

Article/NNP 3/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP states/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN all/PDT the/DT activities/NNS referred/VBN to/TO in/IN this/DT Article/NNP ,/, the/DT Community/NNP shall/MD aim/VB to/TO eliminate/VB inequalities/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO promote/VB equality/NN ,/, between/IN women/NNS and/CC men/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP gives/VBZ its/PRP$ full/JJ support/NN to/TO the/DT efforts/NNS being/VBG made/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN and/CC is/VBZ continuing/VBG its/PRP$ investigations/NNS into/IN whether/IN specific/JJ measures/NNS can/MD be/VB implemented/VBN in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ field/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, like/VB to/TO take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP appreciate/VBP the/DT role/NN played/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Women/NNP '/POS s/VBZ Rights/NNP and/CC Equal/NNP Opportunities/NNPS ,/, particularly/RB its/PRP$ chair/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO recall/VB that/IN ,/, during/IN the/DT lengthy/JJ process/NN of/IN approving/VBG the/DT present/JJ Commission/NNP ,/, every/DT Commissioner/NNP was/VBD questioned/VBN by/IN the/DT Women/NNP '/POS s/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN how/WRB they/PRP would/MD tackle/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN equality/NN within/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ particular/JJ field/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD be/VB monitoring/VBG each/DT Commissioner/NNP carefully/RB ,/, so/IN the/DT other/JJ Commissioners/NNS have/VBP now/RB been/VBN forewarned/VBN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ reply/NN ./.

I/PRP interpret/VB it/PRP as/IN saying/VBG that/IN you/PRP agree/VBP that/IN what/WP is/VBZ needed/VBN is/VBZ an/DT action/NN plan/NN to/TO enable/VB more/JJR women/NNS to/TO take/VB part/NN in/IN specific/JJ environmental/JJ fields/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT Beijing/NNP Declaration/NNP emphasises/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN having/VBG the/DT institutional/JJ capacity/NN to/TO introduce/VB a/DT perspective/NN of/IN equality/NN into/IN all/DT environmental/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

Environmental/JJ agencies/NNS often/RB do/VBP not/RB have/VB the/DT required/VBN knowledge/NN or/CC procedures/NNS for/IN incorporating/VBG such/PDT a/DT perspective/NN into/IN their/PRP$ daily/JJ work/NN ./.

I/PRP naturally/RB want/VBP to/TO know/VB whether/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO incorporate/VB the/DT idea/NN of/IN equality/NN into/IN environmental/JJ policy/NN and/CC programmes/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ goal/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN for/IN all/DT policies/NNS to/TO be/VB similarly/RB permeated/JJ by/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN equality/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ especially/RB important/JJ that/IN people/NNS in/IN key/JJ posts/NNS should/MD have/VB the/DT basic/JJ knowledge/NN required/VBN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- My/PRP$ understanding/NN of/IN mainstreaming/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, that/IN this/DT should/MD characterise/VB everything/NN we/PRP do/VBP ./.

In/IN the/DT action/NN plan/NN prepared/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ Directorate-General/NN ,/, issues/NNS of/IN equality/NN play/VBP a/DT very/RB important/JJ role/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP prepared/VBN to/TO give/VB seminars/NNS on/IN leadership/NN or/CC other/JJ subjects/NNS myself/PRP to/TO encourage/VB women/NNS to/TO take/VB on/IN further/JJ tasks/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO motivate/VB everybody/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ for/IN this/DT message/NN to/TO be/VB sent/VBN all/PDT the/DT way/NN from/IN the/DT top/NN down/RB or/CC ,/, if/IN you/PRP prefer/VBP ,/, from/IN the/DT bottom/NN up/RB ./.

My/PRP$ impression/NN of/IN environment-related/JJ work/NN ,/, broadly/RB speaking/VBG ,/, is/VBZ that/IN in/IN many/JJ instances/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ dominated/VBN by/IN women/NNS ./.

This/DT state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS must/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN so/RB that/IN women/NNS have/VBP a/DT chance/NN to/TO secure/VB managerial/JJ posts/NNS or/CC reach/VB high-ranking/JJ positions/NNS in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ field/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB it/PRP plain/JJ that/IN our/PRP$ programme/NN reflects/VBZ that/DT intention/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ certainly/RB room/NN for/IN improvement/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP some/DT experience/NN in/IN drawing/VBG up/RP plans/NNS and/CC following/VBG them/PRP up/RP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB of/IN benefit/NN ./.

Question/NNP No/NNP 43/VBZ by/IN -LRB-/-LRB- H-0045/NNP //CD 00/CD -RRB-/-RRB- :/: ./.

Subject/NNP :/: The/DT Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP and/CC the/DT Drogheda/NNP Port/NNP Company/NNP The/DT Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP is/VBZ designated/VBN a/DT Special/JJ Protection/NNP Area/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- SPA/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- under/IN the/DT Wild/NNP Birds/NNP Directive/NNP and/CC is/VBZ under/IN consideration/NN for/IN designation/NN as/IN a/DT Special/JJ Area/NN of/IN Conservation/NNP under/IN the/DT Habitats/NNP Directive/NNP ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT area/NN of/IN international/JJ importance/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT Department/NNP of/IN the/DT Marine/NNP ,/, Louth/NNP County/NNP Council/NNP and/CC Drogheda/NNP Corporation/NNP have/VBP allowed/VBN the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ port/NN in/IN the/DT SPA/NNP and/CC even/RB the/DT elimination/NN of/IN a/DT mudflat/NN at/IN Stegrennan/NNP recently/RB added/VBD to/TO the/DT SPA/NNP specifically/RB at/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS insistence/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ more/JJR ,/, a/DT very/RB large/JJ warehouse/NN has/VBZ been/VBN constructed/VBN ,/, in/IN respect/NN of/IN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ proving/VBG difficult/JJ to/TO secure/VB access/NN to/TO the/DT planning/NN permission/NN and/CC other/JJ infrastructures/NNS are/VBP planned/VBN by/IN the/DT Drogheda/NNP Corporation/NNP ./.

How/WRB can/MD the/DT Commission/NNP ensure/VB that/IN this/DT sort/NN of/IN development/NN financed/VBN through/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS does/VBZ not/RB conflict/NN with/IN the/DT nature/NN conservation/NN needs/VBZ of/IN the/DT area/NN ?/.

Is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP ready/JJ to/TO suspend/VB funding/NN completely/RB ,/, pending/VBG a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT development/NN plans/NNS of/IN the/DT area/NN ?/.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN the/DT harbour/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP know/VBP nothing/NN about/IN the/DT warehouse/NN or/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT infrastructure/NN mentioned/VBN by/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN ./.

The/DT harbour/NN construction/NN project/NN is/VBZ receiving/VBG support/NN from/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC chiefly/RB involves/VBZ dredging/VBG the/DT river/NN Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP and/CC depositing/VBG the/DT mud/NN on/IN the/DT mudflats/NNS at/IN Stegrennan/NNP ./.

The/DT Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP is/VBZ designated/VBN a/DT special/JJ protection/NN area/NN under/IN the/DT Wild/NNP Birds/NNP Directive/NNP ./.

That/DT means/VBZ that/IN any/DT development/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN or/CC near/IN the/DT Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO affect/VB the/DT special/JJ protection/NN area/NN must/MD take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT protection/NN criteria/NNS for/IN the/DT area/NN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/NNP Habitats/NNP Directive/NNP ./.

Since/IN 1998/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ received/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN complaints/NNS alleging/VBG that/IN the/DT harbour/NN will/MD damage/VB the/DT mudflats/NNS at/IN Stegrennan/NNP ,/, which/WDT are/VBP now/RB designated/VBN a/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT special/JJ protection/NN area/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT relevant/JJ protection/NN criteria/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN observed/VBN ./.

After/IN investigating/VBG these/DT complaints/NNS between/IN 1998/CD and/CC the/DT beginning/NN of/IN 1999/CD -/: during/IN which/WDT time/NN the/DT project/NN did/VBD not/RB receive/VB support/NN from/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS -/: the/DT Commission/NNP became/VBD convinced/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT summer/NN of/IN 1999/CD ,/, that/IN the/DT relevant/JJ protection/NN criteria/NNS had/VBD been/VBN observed/VBN during/IN the/DT building/NN of/IN the/DT harbour/NN ./.

An/DT in-depth/JJ environmental/JJ impact/NN assessment/NN had/VBD been/VBN carried/VBN out/RP ./.

The/DT most/RBS serious/JJ harm/NN caused/VBN by/IN the/DT project/NN ,/, the/DT damage/NN to/TO the/DT Stegrennan/NNP mudflats/NNS ,/, was/VBD only/JJ to/TO be/VB temporary/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT developers/NNS were/VBD liable/JJ for/IN completely/RB restoring/VBG the/DT mudflats/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS suggestion/NN ,/, the/DT mudflats/NNS at/IN Stegrennan/NNP were/VBD formally/RB included/VBN in/IN the/DT Boyne/NNP Estuary/NNP special/JJ protection/NN area/NN ,/, from/IN which/WDT they/PRP had/VBD previously/RB been/VBN excluded/VBN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, to/TO compensate/VB for/IN the/DT negative/JJ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT bird/NN populations/NNS caused/VBN by/IN the/DT temporary/JJ disappearance/NN of/IN the/DT mudflats/NNS ,/, the/DT intention/NN was/VBD that/IN other/JJ habitats/NNS in/IN the/DT estuary/NN should/MD be/VB improved/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, since/IN last/JJ summer/NN the/DT measure/NN just/RB mentioned/VBN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN dispute/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT Irish/JJ authorities/NNS withdrew/VBD their/PRP$ earlier/JJ commitment/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP improvements/NNS ./.

They/PRP then/RB renewed/VBD their/PRP$ commitment/NN after/IN an/DT Irish/JJ non-governmental/JJ organisation/NN began/VBD a/DT legal/JJ challenge/NN in/IN the/DT Irish/JJ courts/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ commitment/NN included/VBD some/DT minor/JJ changes/NNS which/WDT ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, led/VBD to/TO a/DT further/JJ complaint/NN ./.

Scotland/NNP ,/, with/IN a/DT population/NN of/IN 5/CD million/CD ,/, has/VBZ eight/CD seats/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP at/IN the/DT moment/NN ;/: Denmark/NNP and/CC Finland/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT same/JJ population/NN ,/, have/VBP sixteen/VBN ./.

Now/RB what/WP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO happen/VB if/IN we/PRP retain/VBP a/DT ceiling/NN of/IN 700/CD ,/, bring/VB in/IN 26/CD %/NN more/JJR population/NN over/IN time/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB adopt/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ill-considered/JJ ,/, proposition/NN ,/, that/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT European/JJ list/NN of/IN candidates/NNS ./.

What/WP will/MD happen/VB to/TO a/DT place/NN like/IN Scotland/NNP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP represent/VBP here/RB ?/.

It/PRP will/MD become/VB totally/RB invisible/JJ !/. ./.

Members/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP should/MD not/RB in/IN these/DT circumstances/NNS be/VB in/IN the/DT least/JJS surprised/JJ that/IN in/IN these/DT discussions/NNS ,/, people/NNS in/IN Scotland/NNP and/CC other/JJ such/JJ countries/NNS are/VBP asking/VBG whether/IN enlargement/NN should/MD not/RB also/RB take/VB the/DT form/NN of/IN admitting/VBG new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS from/IN within/IN existing/VBG ones/NNS ./.

A/DT growing/VBG body/NN of/IN opinion/NN in/IN Scotland/NNP holds/VBZ that/DT view/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ at/IN a/DT crossroads/NNS is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN nothing/NN new/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN many/JJ times/NNS ./.

This/DT time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP established/VBN the/DT single/JJ currency/NN -/: which/WDT is/VBZ extremely/RB positive/JJ -/: and/CC we/PRP are/VBP facing/VBG enlargement/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ if/IN we/PRP will/MD undertake/VB enlargement/NN whether/IN we/PRP are/VBP prepared/JJ or/CC not/RB ./.

Will/MD we/PRP enlarge/VB with/IN or/CC without/IN deep/JJ reform/NN ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT debate/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT question/NN must/MD be/VB addressed/VBN in/IN any/DT discussion/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, its/PRP$ agenda/NN or/CC its/PRP$ method/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, has/VBZ not/RB opted/VBN for/IN enlarging/VBG with/IN deep/JJ reforms/NNS in/IN place/NN ./.

That/DT puts/VBZ enlargement/NN in/IN danger/NN ./.

It/PRP jeopardises/VBZ any/DT prospect/NN of/IN political/JJ union/NN and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ for/IN the/DT public/NN to/TO understand/VB ./.

The/DT Council/NNP must/MD realise/VB that/IN ,/, if/IN we/PRP want/VBP the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO involve/VB a/DT form/NN of/IN enlargement/NN built/VBN on/IN firm/NN foundations/NNS ,/, the/DT next/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP must/MD go/VB much/RB further/RBR ./.

The/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ consulting/VBG us/PRP and/CC Parliament/NNP is/VBZ giving/VBG its/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP an/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, but/CC not/RB this/DT one/NN ./.

Must/MD there/EX be/VB an/DT IGC/NNP ?/.

Of/IN course/NN there/EX must/MD ,/, but/CC not/RB this/DT type/NN of/IN Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

The/DT agenda/NN must/MD go/VB much/RB further/RBR ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB much/RB more/RBR daring/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT issues/NNS dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN the/DT IGC/NNP and/CC we/PRP must/MD be/VB much/RB more/RBR transparent/JJ and/CC much/RB more/RBR democratic/JJ ./.

Being/VBG much/RB more/RBR democratic/JJ means/VBZ greater/JJR participation/NN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC allowing/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO exercise/VB even/RB more/JJR -/, yes/UH ,/, more/JJR -/: its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT initiative/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD clearly/RB set/VB firm/NN objectives/NNS ./.

The/DT functionalist/NN approach/NN is/VBZ over/RP ,/, for/IN better/RB or/CC for/IN worse/RBR ./.

The/DT functionalist/NN approach/NN has/VBZ brought/VBN us/PRP to/TO this/DT point/NN ./.

Have/VBP we/PRP achieved/VBN results/NNS ?/.

Yes/UH ,/, but/CC the/DT point/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB a/DT qualitative/JJ leap/NN and/CC ,/, speaking/VBG in/IN political/JJ terms/NNS ,/, this/DT ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, means/VBZ convincing/VBG the/DT other/JJ Community/NNP partners/NNS that/WDT to/TO fall/VB short/JJ would/MD be/VB the/DT worst/JJS thing/NN we/PRP could/MD do/VB at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, after/IN producing/VBG the/DT opinion/NN expected/VBN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO this/DT same/JJ Article/NN 48/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT conference/NN can/MD thus/RB begin/VB earlier/RBR than/IN anticipated/VBN ./.

We/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP know/VBP myself/PRP ,/, that/IN the/DT weeks/NNS we/PRP have/VBP before/IN us/PRP will/MD be/VB useful/JJ to/TO us/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT few/JJ comments/NNS ,/, after/IN reading/VBG the/DT draft/NN opinion/NN and/CC after/IN listening/VBG to/TO the/DT speakers/NNS on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ groups/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP understands/VBZ the/DT anxiety/NN expressed/VBD by/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN you/PRP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT conference/NN agenda/NN ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP this/DT anxiety/NN ,/, this/DT fear/VBP that/IN the/DT agenda/NN may/MD be/VB too/RB limited/JJ ,/, and/CC yet/RB I/PRP feel/VBP ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/VBD to/TO the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS on/IN returning/VBG from/IN Helsinki/NNP ,/, that/IN we/PRP can/MD work/VB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN this/DT Helsinki/NNP mandate/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN this/DT spirit/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN this/DT mandate/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP framed/VBN for/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ opinion/NN ,/, but/CC using/VBG all/PDT the/DT terms/NNS thereof/RB ,/, plus/CC everything/NN between/IN the/DT lines/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP not/RB restricted/VBN ourselves/PRP to/TO the/DT three/CD so-called/JJ leftovers/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, an/DT incorrect/JJ label/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB like/VB the/DT term/NN `/`` leftovers/JJ '/'' any/DT more/RBR than/IN Richard/NNP Corbett/NNP does/VBZ ./.

It/PRP gives/VBZ the/DT impression/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP three/CD minor/JJ or/CC insignificant/JJ subjects/NNS whereas/IN in/IN fact/NN they/PRP are/VBP three/CD extremely/RB serious/JJ and/CC important/JJ subjects/NNS ,/, and/CC difficult/JJ ,/, so/RB difficult/JJ that/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB sufficient/JJ political/JJ courage/NN collectively/RB at/IN Amsterdam/NNP to/TO deal/VB with/IN them/PRP in/IN depth/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ -/: I/PRP am/VBP responding/VBG to/TO Mr/NNP Seguro/NNP who/WP expressed/VBD concerns/NNS about/IN this/DT just/RB now/RB -/: we/PRP have/VBP not/RB restricted/VBN ourselves/PRP to/TO these/DT three/CD subjects/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN I/PRP do/VBP consider/VB them/PRP as/IN priorities/NNS ,/, and/CC consider/VB that/IN they/PRP must/MD be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN now/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP dealt/VBN with/IN other/JJ subjects/NNS and/CC we/PRP have/VBP mentioned/VBN our/PRP$ idea/NN that/IN other/JJ subjects/NNS may/MD be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN this/DT conference/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP firstly/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB the/DT French/JJ Presidency/NN ,/, so/RB wish/VBP ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT serious/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ juncture/NN prior/RB to/TO enlargement/VB ./.

I/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN many/JJ comments/NNS on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN ,/, which/WDT mentioned/VBD all/PDT these/DT subjects/NNS and/CC dealt/VBN with/IN many/JJ of/IN them/PRP in/IN depth/NN ,/, with/IN specific/JJ indications/NNS of/IN new/JJ draft/NN articles/NNS ,/, but/CC no/DT one/NN has/VBZ said/VBN that/IN we/PRP were/VBD going/VBG beyond/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP mandate/NN ./.

This/DT proves/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO go/VB into/IN issues/NNS in/IN depth/NN while/IN respecting/VBG this/DT mandate/NN ,/, by/IN using/VBG the/DT terms/NNS laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT mandate/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT openings/NNS which/WDT it/PRP offers/VBZ ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT final/JJ trade-offs/NNS will/MD be/VB made/VBN ,/, as/RB in/IN any/DT institutional/JJ negotiations/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP this/DT is/VBZ no/DT bad/JJ thing/NN ,/, at/IN Council/NNP level/NN ,/, especially/RB at/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Heads/NNP of/IN State/NNP and/CC Government/NNP ,/, who/WP hold/VBP the/DT key/NN to/TO the/DT success/NN of/IN this/DT conference/NN in/IN their/PRP$ hands/NNS ./.

Let/VB me/PRP point/NN out/IN ,/, in/IN passing/VBG ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, is/VBZ also/RB a/DT Council/NNP member/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP has/VBZ every/DT intention/NN of/IN making/VBG use/NN of/IN this/DT position/NN and/CC this/DT role/NN ,/, alongside/IN the/DT Heads/NNPS of/IN State/NNP and/CC Government/NNP ,/, particularly/RB during/IN the/DT final/JJ period/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, these/DT Council/NNP proceedings/NNS must/MD be/VB carefully/RB prepared/JJ ./.

This/DT preparatory/JJ work/NN ,/, this/DT fine-tuning/NN ,/, must/MD not/RB be/VB omitted/VBN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NNP ./.

I/PRP know/VBP from/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ experience/NN in/IN Amsterdam/NNP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ and/CC useful/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP will/MD not/RB just/RB be/VB limited/VBN to/TO technical/JJ details/NNS ./.

Throughout/IN this/DT conference/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB the/DT status/NN of/IN the/DT negotiators/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT quality/NN of/IN what/WP they/PRP will/MD be/VB saying/VBG ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT situation/NN will/MD be/VB just/RB the/DT same/JJ and/CC ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ current/JJ position/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ two/CD representatives/NNS are/VBP listened/JJ to/TO and/CC respected/VBN throughout/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN in/IN this/DT way/NN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD not/RB be/VB just/RB an/DT observer/NN at/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS any/DT more/RBR than/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB ./.

We/PRP now/RB await/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, with/IN great/JJ interest/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NNP ,/, your/PRP$ next/JJ opinion/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT you/PRP will/MD specify/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ priorities/NNS and/CC practical/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT coming/VBG months/NNS ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD therefore/RB be/VB working/VBG in/IN close/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, on/IN good/JJ terms/NNS ,/, with/IN your/PRP$ two/CD representatives/NNS ,/, Professor/NNP Tsatsos/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Elmar/NNP Brok/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO reconcile/VB our/PRP$ points/NNS of/IN view/NN ,/, if/IN need/MD be/VB ./.

Quite/RB probably/RB ,/, our/PRP$ points/NNS of/IN view/NN and/CC our/PRP$ positions/NNS will/MD not/RB always/RB be/VB the/DT same/JJ ./.

There/EX will/MD probably/RB be/VB differences/NNS of/IN opinion/NN ,/, that/WDT would/MD be/VB only/RB normal/JJ ./.

The/DT important/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP consistent/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN committed/VBN to/TO working/VBG towards/IN this/DT consistency/NN ever/RB since/IN I/PRP accepted/VBD the/DT position/NN of/IN Commissioner/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ concern/NN and/CC our/PRP$ ambition/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, on/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN subjects/NNS ,/, is/VBZ to/TO be/VB on/IN the/DT same/JJ wavelength/NN and/CC to/TO carry/VB these/DT negotiations/NNS forward/RP successfully/RB ./.

This/DT will/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT matter/NN of/IN chance/NN ,/, since/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP repeat/VB ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP we/PRP have/VBP the/DT same/JJ ambitions/NNS for/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS and/CC that/IN together/RB we/PRP see/VBP it/PRP as/IN a/DT moment/NN of/IN truth/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB three/CD additional/JJ comments/NNS ,/, quite/RB briefly/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, to/TO congratulate/VB and/CC thank/VB Mr/NNP Napolitano/NNP ,/, the/DT chairman/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS for/IN the/DT extremely/RB original/JJ major/JJ initiative/NN which/WDT it/PRP took/VBD yesterday/NN in/IN bringing/VBG together/RP the/DT competent/JJ representatives/NNS of/IN national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN an/DT initial/JJ joint/JJ debate/NN ./.

Such/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC ourselves/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ./.

I/PRP have/VBP said/VBN ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, that/IN I/PRP would/MD play/VB my/PRP$ part/NN by/IN visiting/VBG each/DT of/IN the/DT national/JJ parliaments/NNS ./.

Tomorrow/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB in/IN London/NNP ./.

In/IN a/DT fortnight/NN '/POS s/JJ time/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB in/IN Berlin/NNP ./.

In/IN three/CD weeks/NNS '/POS time/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB in/IN Paris/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP shall/MD continue/VB this/DT dialogue/NN in/IN one/CD capital/NN after/IN another/DT ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP this/DT initiative/NN you/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN is/VBZ extremely/RB positive/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP for/IN taking/VBG it/PRP ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ brief/JJ comment/NN is/VBZ to/TO thank/VB the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, particularly/RB Mr/NNP Seixas/NNP da/NNP Costa/NNP ,/, for/IN his/PRP$ proactive/JJ approach/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT comments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP just/RB been/VBN made/VBN express/VBP a/DT proactive/JJ attitude/NN and/CC a/DT concern/NN which/WDT match/VBP his/PRP$ own/JJ :/: the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB just/RB an/DT interim/JJ presidency/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO initiate/VB these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ that/IN they/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB completed/VBN within/IN these/DT six/CD months/NNS and/CC that/IN it/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO hand/VB over/RP to/TO the/DT French/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT hope/NN that/IN a/DT conclusion/NN can/MD be/VB reached/VBN before/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ./.

Not/RB only/RB that/IN a/DT conclusion/NN can/MD be/VB reached/VBN ,/, but/CC that/IN a/DT successful/JJ conclusion/NN can/MD be/VB reached/VBN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN ./.

Concluding/VBG negotiations/NNS is/VBZ not/RB the/DT same/JJ as/IN concluding/VBG them/PRP successfully/RB ./.

The/DT handover/NN will/MD have/VB been/VBN made/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT conditions/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT handover/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB made/VBN ,/, by/IN yourself/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB extremely/RB important/JJ ,/, as/IN is/VBZ the/DT nature/NN of/IN this/DT handover/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ all/PDT the/DT work/NN which/WDT is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP together/RB ,/, under/IN your/PRP$ guidance/NN particularly/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN these/DT few/JJ months/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP great/JJ confidence/NN in/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP '/POS s/JJ ability/NN to/TO bring/VB this/DT task/NN to/TO a/DT successful/JJ conclusion/NN ,/, and/CC indeed/RB great/JJ expectations/NNS thereof/RB ./.

Portugal/NNP is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ country/NN ,/, but/CC being/VBG a/DT small/JJ country/NN is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN why/WRB one/PRP may/MD not/RB have/VB great/JJ ambitions/NNS ./.

After/IN having/VBG heard/VBN Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Guterres/NNP ,/, the/DT Minister/NNP of/IN Foreign/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC yourself/PRP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP confidence/NN in/IN the/DT ambition/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP and/CC the/DT extremely/RB proactive/JJ way/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP will/MD conduct/VB these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

It/PRP can/MD count/VB on/IN the/DT partnership/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP repeat/VB ,/, we/PRP shall/MD have/VB a/DT very/RB great/JJ effort/NN to/TO make/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO popularise/VB the/DT topics/NNS of/IN these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP difficult/JJ subjects/NNS ,/, subjects/NNS relating/VBG to/TO institutional/JJ policy/NN and/CC mechanisms/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB always/RB easy/JJ to/TO explain/VB ./.

All/DT the/DT more/JJR reason/NN for/IN Members/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ Parliament/NNP ,/, Ministers/NNP ,/, Commissioners/VBZ to/TO devote/VB a/DT little/JJ time/NN to/TO explaining/VBG matters/NNS to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS ,/, to/TO public/JJ debate/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, it/PRP will/MD ,/, ladies/NN and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, be/VB taking/VBG initiatives/NNS to/TO inaugurate/VB and/CC orchestrate/VB this/DT public/JJ debate/NN ./.

Cross-border/NN services/NNS ./.

-/: -LRB-/-LRB- DE/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, firstly/VBP I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO apologise/VB for/IN being/VBG a/DT little/RB hoarse/JJ today/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP Austrian/VBD MEPs/NNP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN explaining/VBG and/CC talking/VBG to/TO do/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD first/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB how/WRB indebted/JJ I/PRP am/VBP to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN seizing/VBG the/DT initiative/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT two/CD draft/NN directives/NNS we/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG here/RB today/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ thereby/RB succeeded/VBN in/IN closing/VBG two/CD serious/JJ loopholes/NNS in/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN which/WDT are/VBP of/IN great/JJ significance/NN to/TO the/DT European/JJ economy/NN and/CC to/TO 5/CD million/CD third-country/JJ nationals/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP who/WP are/VBP here/RB as/IN workers/NNS or/CC on/IN a/DT self-employed/JJ basis/NN ./.

These/DT have/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, clarified/VBN that/IN the/DT freedom/NN to/TO provide/VB services/NNS must/MD allow/VB for/IN third-country/JJ nationals/NNS to/TO be/VB taken/VBN on/RP as/IN employees/NNS of/IN cross-border/JJ services/NNS and/CC this/DT without/IN having/VBG to/TO obtain/VB work/NN permits/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP did/VBD not/RB make/VB specific/JJ reference/NN to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN visa/NN requirements/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS of/IN residence/NN and/CC consequently/RB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO clarify/VB this/DT issue/NN ./.

The/DT situation/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN self-employed/JJ people/NNS are/VBP concerned/VBN is/VBZ that/IN current/JJ Community/NNP invested/VBD legal/JJ rights/NNS do/VBP not/RB afford/VB third-country/JJ nationals/NNS the/DT right/NN to/TO provide/VB cross-border/JJ services/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT legislative/JJ act/NN here/RB ./.

Both/DT draft/NN directives/NNS seek/VBP to/TO facilitate/VB the/DT freedom/NN to/TO provide/VB services/NNS for/IN EU/NNP enterprises/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB about/IN establishing/VBG original/JJ rights/NNS for/IN third-country/JJ nationals/NNS modelled/VBN on/IN freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN ./.

All/DT provisions/NNS ,/, i.e./JJ issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO entry/NN into/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT law/NN pertaining/VBG to/TO residence/NN rights/NNS ,/, should/MD be/VB regarded/VBN as/IN ancillary/NNP to/TO this/DT freedom/NN to/TO provide/VB services/NNS ./.

I/PRP ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, are/VBP therefore/RB of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ chosen/VBN the/DT right/JJ legal/JJ bases/NNS and/CC that/IN the/DT opposite/JJ view/NN ,/, as/IN expressed/VBD in/IN the/DT report/NN produced/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/NNP Legal/NNP Service/NNP ,/, is/VBZ inappropriate/JJ ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB see/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ any/DT real/JJ obstacle/NN to/TO the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/NN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO move/VB matters/NNS on/RP quickly/RB as/RB far/RB as/IN these/DT two/CD draft/NN directives/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

I/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposed/VBN amendments/NNS should/MD make/VB it/PRP easier/JJR for/IN the/DT Council/NN to/TO adopt/VB the/DT directives/NNS as/RB opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN ./.

Many/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ amendments/NNS relate/VBP back/RP to/TO concerns/NNS that/WDT were/VBD also/RB voiced/VBN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP attempting/VBG to/TO reconcile/VB these/DT concerns/NNS with/IN the/DT task/NN that/WDT falls/VBZ to/TO us/PRP by/IN dint/NN of/IN extant/JJ law/NN and/CC economic/JJ good/JJ sense/NN ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO acceptance/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD only/RB urge/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO adopt/VB as/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS adopted/VBD by/IN Parliament/NNP as/IN possible/JJ ,/, even/RB if/IN some/DT of/IN them/PRP deviate/VBP substantially/RB from/IN the/DT original/JJ Commission/NNP proposals/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP absolutely/RB convinced/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB easier/JJR for/IN us/PRP to/TO achieve/VB consensus/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP on/IN this/DT basis/NN ./.

This/DT system/NN appears/VBZ to/TO us/PRP to/TO be/VB unsuitable/JJ in/IN practical/JJ terms/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO compensate/VB for/IN this/DT ,/, all/DT possible/JJ obstacles/NNS must/MD be/VB removed/VBN before/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN is/VBZ issued/VBN ,/, and/CC as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN would/MD have/VB it/PRP ,/, more/RBR stringent/JJ conditions/NNS must/MD be/VB satisfied/JJ before/IN a/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN is/VBZ issued/VBN ./.

An/DT individual/NN is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO be/VB in/IN authorised/JJ employment/NN and/CC to/TO have/VB the/DT right/NN of/IN residence/NN and/CC insurance/NN protection/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN issue/NN of/IN the/DT card/NN but/CC throughout/IN its/PRP$ period/NN of/IN validity/NN and/CC for/IN three/CD months/NNS thereafter/RB ./.

This/DT should/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT guarantee/NN for/IN the/DT receiving/NN state/NN that/IN the/DT employee/NN or/CC self-employed/JJ person/NN will/MD return/VB to/TO the/DT sending/VBG state/NN once/IN the/DT contract/NN is/VBZ completed/VBN and/CC that/IN they/PRP will/MD be/VB covered/VBN under/IN insurance/NN law/NN in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN illness/NN or/CC accident/NN ./.

Likewise/RB ,/, the/DT situation/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO right/NN of/IN entry/NN and/CC residence/NN rights/NNS should/MD be/VB clarified/VBN before/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN is/VBZ issued/VBN ,/, namely/RB under/IN the/DT terms/NNS of/IN an/DT opposition/NN procedure/NN ./.

What/WP we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP should/MD not/RB just/RB be/VB a/DT case/NN of/IN having/VBG to/TO apply/VB for/IN the/DT EU/NNP service/NN provision/NN card/NN for/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, rather/RB one/PRP should/MD also/RB have/VB the/DT option/NN of/IN applying/VBG for/IN it/PRP for/IN individual/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT system/NN is/VBZ also/RB more/RBR suited/VBN to/TO practical/JJ needs/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD hope/VB that/IN the/DT same/JJ holds/VBZ true/JJ for/IN the/DT proposal/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT minimum/JJ period/NN of/IN duration/NN for/IN a/DT first/JJ posting/VBG to/TO three/CD months/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO be/VB flexible/JJ in/IN adapting/VBG the/DT period/NN of/IN validity/NN of/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN to/TO the/DT duration/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ posting/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP stand/VBP by/IN our/PRP$ view/NN that/IN the/DT maximum/JJ period/NN of/IN validity/NN for/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN should/MD be/VB 12/CD months/NNS ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO self-employed/JJ persons/NNS ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT amendments/NNS already/RB described/VBN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP that/IN the/DT domicile/JJ criteria/NNS should/MD be/VB made/VBN more/RBR stringent/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN we/PRP should/MD make/VB provision/NN for/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN countering/VBG any/DT abuse/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN bogus/JJ self-employment/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB just/RB like/VB to/TO go/VB into/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN amendments/NNS that/WDT go/VBP beyond/IN the/DT proposed/VBN amendments/NNS put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ./.

Of/IN course/NN I/PRP would/MD add/VB that/IN I/PRP continue/VBP to/TO support/VB this/DT committee/NN '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS ,/, which/WDT they/PRP adopted/VBD unanimously/RB ./.

I/PRP have/VBP even/RB submitted/VBN four/CD amendments/NNS on/IN behalf/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN that/WDT largely/RB relate/VBP to/TO the/DT correct/JJ way/NN of/IN quoting/VBG Council/NNP decisions/NNS ./.

I/PRP must/MD say/VB I/PRP have/VBP received/VBN extremely/RB contradictory/NN statements/NNS from/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ services/NNS as/IN to/TO exactly/RB how/WRB these/DT Council/NNP decisions/NNS should/MD be/VB quoted/VBN ;/: whether/IN or/CC not/RB one/PRP should/MD use/VB the/DT number/NN or/CC date/NN alone/RB ,/, or/CC both/DT ,/, and/CC how/WRB extensively/JJ to/TO quote/VB from/IN them/PRP ./.

Two/CD amendments/NNS were/VBD cancelled/VBN by/IN the/DT services/NNS because/IN the/DT content/NN has/VBZ supposedly/RB already/RB been/VBN given/VBN consideration/NN to/TO in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

I/PRP withdraw/VB the/DT two/CD other/JJ amendments/NNS -/: that/DT is/VBZ Amendment/NNP No/RB 18/CD to/TO the/DT report/NN on/IN self-employed/JJ persons/NNS and/CC Amendment/NNP No/RB 21/CD on/IN employed/JJ persons/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB he/PRP deserves/VBZ special/JJ mention/NN !/. ./.

May/NNP I/PRP say/VBP how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP welcomes/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT two/CD proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT freedom/NN to/TO provide/VB services/NNS and/CC on/IN third-country/JJ employees/NNS ,/, the/DT topic/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP extremely/RB grateful/JJ for/IN the/DT work/NN that/IN Mrs/NNP Berger/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN into/IN these/DT proposals/NNS which/WDT are/VBP politically/RB sensitive/JJ and/CC which/WDT constitute/VBP a/DT legislative/JJ challenge/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB thank/VB Mrs/NNP Palacio/NNP most/RBS warmly/JJ for/IN her/PRP$ major/JJ contribution/NN as/IN chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP particularly/RB welcomes/VBZ the/DT suggestions/NNS made/VBD by/IN Parliament/NNP for/IN a/DT more/RBR efficient/JJ procedure/NN for/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN service/NN provision/NN cards/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT opportunity/NN is/VBZ created/VBN to/TO apply/VB for/IN service/NN provision/NN cards/NNS for/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR ,/, or/CC all/DT ,/, Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, the/DT procedure/NN would/MD be/VB more/RBR flexible/JJ still/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP also/RB supports/VBZ the/DT proposed/VBN flexible/JJ period/NN of/IN validity/NN of/IN the/DT card/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB a/DT three-month/JJ period/NN of/IN employment/NN to/TO be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO prove/VB that/IN an/DT employee/NN is/VBZ resident/NN in/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP also/RB agrees/VBZ with/IN a/DT provision/NN for/IN cases/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT contract/NN of/IN employment/NN between/IN the/DT service/NN provider/NN and/CC his/PRP$ employer/NN is/VBZ terminated/VBN at/IN short/JJ notice/NN ./.

An/DT efficient/JJ procedure/NN for/IN issuing/VBG cards/NNS implies/VBZ that/IN companies/NNS which/WDT provide/VBP cross-border/JJ services/NNS can/MD also/RB exercise/VB their/PRP$ rights/NNS in/IN concrete/JJ terms/NNS on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ over/IN the/DT top/JJ to/TO us/PRP for/IN other/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO be/VB given/VBN the/DT option/NN of/IN systematically/RB carrying/VBG out/RP inspections/NNS systematically/RB with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO safeguarding/VBG public/JJ order/NN before/IN they/PRP issue/VBP cards/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB possible/JJ for/IN a/DT third-country/JJ subject/NN who/WP has/VBZ legal/JJ status/NN in/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP to/TO be/VB admitted/VBN to/TO other/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS too/RB ./.

That/DT does/VBZ not/RB prevent/VB these/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS from/IN taking/VBG public-order/JJ measures/NNS within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN duty/NN of/IN notification/NN ./.

Neither/DT does/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP accept/VB the/DT proposal/NN that/IN legal/JJ status/NN in/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP should/MD be/VB valid/JJ three/CD months/NNS after/IN the/DT card/NN has/VBZ expired/VBN ./.

Following/VBG completion/NN of/IN the/DT service/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB acceptable/JJ for/IN the/DT third-country/JJ subject/NN in/IN question/NN to/TO remain/VB any/DT longer/RBR in/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP in/IN which/WDT the/DT service/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP supports/VBZ Mrs/NNP Palacio/NNP '/POS s/NNP Amendment/NNP No/RB 22/CD in/IN both/DT respects/NNS ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT second/JJ proposal/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP appreciates/VBZ the/DT wish/NN that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB clear/JJ what/WP is/VBZ meant/VBN by/IN someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ self-employed/JJ and/CC would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO resolve/VB this/DT issue/NN in/IN the/DT amended/VBN proposal/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP a/DT few/JJ introductory/JJ remarks/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT key/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, when/WRB all/PDT the/DT speakers/NNS have/VBP contributed/VBN ,/, I/PRP will/MD once/RB again/RB be/VB given/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO elaborate/VB upon/IN the/DT different/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, tomorrow/NN will/MD see/VB a/DT large/JJ majority/NN within/IN the/DT PPE/NNP Group/NNP vote/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT amended/VBN version/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN this/DT model/NN '/POS s/JJ logic/NN of/IN private/JJ profit/NN has/VBZ been/VBN harmful/JJ ,/, and/CC therefore/RB the/DT `/`` polluter/JJ pays/NN '/'' principle/NN is/VBZ a/DT suitable/JJ way/NN of/IN dealing/VBG with/IN these/DT consequences/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, apart/RB from/IN these/DT principles/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT consideration/NN that/IN water/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT common/JJ resource/NN ,/, can/MD not/RB be/VB subjected/VBN to/TO the/DT rules/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

Surprisingly/RB ,/, I/PRP imagine/VBP with/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN intentions/NNS ,/, this/DT ecological/JJ objective/NN has/VBZ become/VBN an/DT instrument/NN of/IN commercial/JJ war/NN by/IN making/VBG consumers/NNS ,/, and/CC especially/RB the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ,/, responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN installations/NNS and/CC the/DT procedures/NNS for/IN ensuring/VBG water/NN quality/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, water/NN becomes/VBZ simply/RB one/CD more/JJR product/NN subject/NN to/TO the/DT laws/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT neoliberal/JJ model/NN now/RB reigns/VBZ in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

By/IN failing/VBG to/TO distinguish/VB countries/NNS and/CC regions/NNS where/WRB water/NN is/VBZ abundant/JJ ,/, and/CC is/VBZ therefore/RB not/RB a/DT problem/NN ,/, from/IN regions/NNS where/WRB drought/NN and/CC low/NN rainfall/NNS make/VBP it/PRP a/DT scarce/JJ commodity/NN ,/, stifling/VBG the/DT chances/NNS of/IN any/DT economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP perverting/VBG the/DT ecological/JJ principle/NN and/CC turning/VBG it/PRP into/IN a/DT weapon/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN it/PRP is/VBZ somewhat/RB ironic/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP hindering/VBG the/DT possibility/NN of/IN sharing/VBG this/DT commodity/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ scarce/JJ in/IN some/DT areas/NNS ,/, while/IN regions/NNS where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ abundant/JJ water/NN are/VBP giving/VBG advice/NN on/IN austerity/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO its/PRP$ use/NN ,/, to/TO those/DT who/WP live/VBP in/IN drought/NN areas/NNS ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT lack/NN of/IN sensitivity/NN and/CC solidarity/NN ,/, my/PRP$ vote/NN has/VBZ been/VBN consistent/JJ with/IN what/WP I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, as/IN an/DT MEP/NNP from/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT dry/JJ Mediterranean/NNP agricultural/JJ regions/NNS -/: although/IN one/CD with/IN prospects/NNS -/: namely/RB ,/, the/DT Region/NNP of/IN Murcia/NNP ./. ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP Labour/NNP Party/NNP ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO indicate/VB that/IN while/IN we/PRP have/VBP supported/VBN the/DT major/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Lienemann/NNP report/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP certain/JJ reservations/NNS ./.

The/DT timetable/NN set/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN of/IN 2020/CD is/VBZ unrealistic/JJ and/CC impracticable/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT timetable/NN set/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN 2034/CD is/VBZ too/RB far/RB in/IN the/DT distance/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP therefore/RB that/IN conciliation/NN will/MD set/VB a/DT more/RBR realistic/JJ date/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP voted/VBN against/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 25/CD and/CC 72/CD which/WDT would/MD require/VB the/DT achievement/NN of/IN minimal/JJ anthroprogenic/JJ pollution/NN in/IN all/DT groundwater/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP this/DT requirement/NN is/VBZ unrealistic/JJ in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT very/RB high/JJ cost/NN and/CC extremely/RB long/JJ timescales/NNS involved/VBN in/IN restoration/NN to/TO a/DT near/RB pristine/JJ standard/NN ./.

The/DT foregoing/NN is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN for/IN our/PRP$ vote/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Water/NNP is/VBZ a/DT renewable/JJ but/CC limited/JJ natural/JJ resource/NN and/CC needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB properly/RB managed/VBN ./.

The/DT framework/NN directive/NN on/IN water/NN policy/NN will/MD become/VB the/DT cornerstone/NN of/IN Community/NNP policy/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ clear/JJ ,/, ambitious/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

We/PRP share/VBP them/PRP ./.

It/PRP sets/VBZ environmental/JJ parameters/NNS close/RB to/TO zero/CD ./.

But/CC we/PRP feel/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB wiser/JJR not/RB to/TO set/VB unrealistic/JJ deadlines/NNS which/WDT neither/CC our/PRP$ governments/NNS nor/CC our/PRP$ industries/NNS will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO meet/VB ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT timetable/NN ,/, by/IN all/DT means/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT more/JJR gradual/JJ timetable/NN ./.

The/DT legal/JJ obligation/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT zero/CD input/NN situation/NN ,/, i.e./VBN to/TO stop/VB discharges/NNS within/IN 20/CD years/NNS ,/, would/MD in/IN fact/NN mean/VB a/DT ban/NN on/IN all/RB identified/VBN substances/NNS ./.

Such/JJ provisions/NNS may/MD well/RB cause/VB serious/JJ problems/NNS in/IN cross-border/JJ areas/NNS and/CC in/IN candidate/NN countries/NNS ,/, thereby/RB complicating/VBG enlargement/NN ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT amendments/NNS concerning/VBG radioactive/JJ substances/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP of/IN course/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN controls/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT question/NN arises/VBZ of/IN the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN ,/, which/WDT comes/VBZ under/IN the/DT Euratom/NNP Treaty/NNP ./.

The/DT Group/NNP for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Democracies/NNPS and/CC Diversities/NNPS has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Andersson/NNP report/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, contain/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN good/JJ observations/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ acknowledged/VBN on/IN page/NN 15/CD of/IN the/DT explanatory/JJ statement/NN that/IN ``/`` the/DT different/JJ levels/NNS of/IN development/NN and/CC traditions/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS make/VBP it/PRP impossible/JJ to/TO bring/VB about/IN uniform/JJ harmonisation/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS ''/'' ./.

The/DT situation/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN a/DT social/JJ model/NN is/VBZ being/VBG established/VBN whose/WP$ real/JJ purpose/NN is/VBZ harmonisation/JJ ,/, and/CC uniform/JJ harmonisation/NN into/IN the/DT bargain/NN ./.

And/CC ,/, in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, we/PRP approach/VBP the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

This/DT project/NN ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ social/JJ harmonisation/NN ,/, does/VBZ not/RB constitute/VB social/JJ policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN we/PRP can/MD not/RB support/VB a/DT proposal/NN whose/WP$ essential/JJ rationale/NN is/VBZ to/TO extend/VB the/DT EMU/NNP project/NN ./. -RRB-/-RRB-

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP voted/VBD for/IN the/DT Council/NNP 's/POS strategy/NN for/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN because/IN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, it/PRP constitutes/VBZ a/DT step/NN towards/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN European/JJ social/JJ and/CC pensions/JJ legislation/NN ,/, although/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB actually/RB go/VB the/DT whole/JJ way/NN ./.

We/PRP wholeheartedly/RB support/VB ,/, at/IN national/JJ level/NN ,/, many/JJ of/IN the/DT ideas/NNS presented/VBN in/IN Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- IT/PRP -RRB-/-RRB- The/DT report/NN gives/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ impression/NN that/IN the/DT concerted/JJ strategy/NN for/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN in/IN Europe/NNP will/MD be/VB accompanied/VBN by/IN an/DT analogous/JJ process/NN of/IN cohesion/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB view/VB it/PRP with/IN interest/NN and/CC hope/NN and/CC commend/VB its/PRP$ intentions/NNS ./.

Numerous/JJ policies/NNS have/VBP already/RB gone/VBN in/IN this/DT direction/NN ,/, albeit/IN laboriously/CD ,/, and/CC many/RB more/RBR still/RB need/VBP to/TO do/VB so/RB before/IN Europe/NNP ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN one/CD house/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ by/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ people/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB by/IN those/DT in/IN the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT European/JJ welfare/NN systems/NNS have/VBP always/RB played/VBN a/DT constructive/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT social/JJ and/CC democratic/JJ development/NN of/IN each/DT nation/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, if/IN such/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP to/TO continue/VB to/TO sustain/VB development/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, in/IN light/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ and/CC employment/NN changes/NNS taking/VBG place/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN society/NN ,/, modernisation/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB essential/JJ ./.

There/EX are/VBP three/CD main/JJ aspects/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB highlighted/VBN ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, employment/NN and/CC social/JJ protection/NN should/MD be/VB strictly/RB interdependent/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT is/VBZ directly/RB proportional/JJ ./.

The/DT second/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT management/NN of/IN welfare/NN systems/NNS and/CC those/DT who/WP operate/VBP them/PRP ./.

Nowadays/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ becoming/VBG more/RBR commonplace/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN efficient/JJ ,/, to/TO operate/VB complementary/JJ and/CC integrated/JJ protection/NN schemes/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ view/NN ,/, that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ authority/NN should/MD be/VB reduced/VBN ,/, either/CC as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT universality/NN or/CC ,/, we/PRP hope/VBP ,/, the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT basic/JJ social/JJ protection/NN provided/VBD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, to/TO a/DT large/JJ extent/NN ,/, a/DT principle/NN of/IN justice/NN that/WDT imbues/VBZ both/DT health/NN and/CC pension/NN schemes/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN social/JJ assistance/NN ,/, where/WRB ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, strategic/JJ coordination/NN by/IN the/DT public/JJ authority/NN is/VBZ essential/JJ ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN modernised/VBN ./.

The/DT third/JJ aspect/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN that/WDT underpins/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Today/NN ,/, a/DT common/JJ strategy/NN for/IN social/JJ protection/NN is/VBZ sadly/RB lacking/VBG ,/, and/CC the/DT current/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP ,/, in/IN the/DT main/JJ ,/, run/VBN according/VBG to/TO the/DT actions/NNS and/CC unity/NN of/IN purpose/NN of/IN individual/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, any/DT modernisation/NN process/NN has/VBZ to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN economic/JJ ,/, employment/NN and/CC social/JJ protection/NN differences/NNS between/IN the/DT various/JJ countries/NNS ,/, whether/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS or/CC candidate/NN countries/NNS ./.

What/WP is/VBZ required/VBN is/VBZ that/IN those/DT responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT modernisation/NN process/NN ,/, which/WDT continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB closely/RB linked/VBN to/TO the/DT promotion/NN of/IN social/JJ cohesion/NN despite/IN the/DT underlying/VBG differences/NNS ,/, should/MD have/VB the/DT will/NN and/CC the/DT know-how/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN changes/NNS are/VBP for/IN the/DT better/JJR and/CC not/RB for/IN the/DT worse/JJR ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT matter/NN of/IN civilisation/NN ,/, progress/NN and/CC common/JJ dignity/NN for/IN the/DT present/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC a/DT future/JJ enlarged/JJ community/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- The/DT basic/NN values/VBZ common/JJ to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP are/VBP based/VBN upon/IN democracy/NN ,/, human/JJ freedoms/NNS and/CC rights/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN ./.

These/DT values/NNS must/MD be/VB given/VBN expression/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN solidarity/NN with/IN the/DT weaker/JJR groups/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ society/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT world/NN around/IN us/PRP ./.

In/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS themselves/PRP which/WDT devise/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS ./.

Inhabitants/NNS of/IN countries/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ought/MD ,/, nonetheless/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO benefit/VB from/IN a/DT minimum/JJ network/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, irrespective/RB of/IN which/WDT country/NN they/PRP live/VBP in/RP ./.

The/DT report/NN seeks/VBZ ``/`` effective/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ fiscal/JJ coordination/NN ''/'' ,/, without/IN going/VBG on/RP to/TO define/VB more/RBR specifically/RB what/WP this/DT means/VBZ ./.

As/IN we/PRP see/VBP it/PRP ,/, such/PDT a/DT position/NN constitutes/VBZ unduly/RB large/JJ interference/NN in/IN national/JJ fiscal/JJ policy/NN and/CC can/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB supported/VBN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB voting/VBG against/IN paragraph/NN 7/CD of/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT report/NN emphasises/VBZ the/DT social/JJ dimension/NN of/IN European/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB important/JJ to/TO clarify/VB what/WP role/NN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ to/TO play/VB ,/, and/CC not/RB to/TO play/VB ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO social/JJ security/NN ./.

Clarification/NNP of/IN this/DT kind/NN is/VBZ missing/VBG from/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- EL/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- On/IN reading/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ statement/NN on/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ animated/VBN by/IN so/RB many/JJ good/JJ intentions/NNS ,/, one/PRP wonders/VBZ whether/IN its/PRP$ authors/NNS and/CC the/DT working/VBG people/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP are/VBP living/VBG on/IN the/DT same/JJ continent/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT same/JJ social/JJ reality/NN ./.

One/PRP also/RB wonders/VBZ whether/IN this/DT `/`` coordinated/JJ modernisation/NN strategy/NN '/'' is/VBZ not/RB just/RB another/DT misrepresentation/NN of/IN the/DT coordinated/JJ and/CC headlong/JJ attack/NN on/IN social/JJ protection/NN and/CC security/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT acquired/VBN rights/NNS of/IN working/VBG people/NNS ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP with/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN '/POS s/JJ remarks/NNS but/CC do/VBP not/RB at/IN all/DT share/VB his/PRP$ optimism/NN about/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN and/CC the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/VBZ intentions/NNS and/CC plans/NNS concerning/VBG social/JJ protection/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ sole/JJ purpose/NN is/VBZ to/TO pave/VB the/DT way/NN and/CC create/VB the/DT right/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN cutting/VBG public/JJ expenditure/NN on/IN social/JJ security/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN flexibilising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN itself/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ well/RB known/VBN that/IN the/DT level/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN employment/NN determines/VBZ the/DT quality/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS ./.

So/RB how/WRB is/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO speak/VB about/IN healthy/JJ and/CC economically/RB sustainable/JJ social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP faced/VBN with/IN the/DT millions/NNS of/IN unemployed/JJ ,/, impoverished/JJ and/CC marginalised/JJ people/NNS ,/, the/DT `/`` working/JJ poor/NN '/'' of/IN part-time/JJ employment/NN ,/, and/CC working/VBG conditions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP dissociated/VBN from/IN the/DT policies/NNS implemented/VBN ?/.

Social/NNP security/NN and/CC protection/NN are/VBP among/IN the/DT greatest/JJS acquisitions/NNS of/IN working/VBG people/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC were/VBD achieved/VBN after/IN many/JJ years/NNS of/IN battling/VBG against/IN the/DT aspirations/NNS of/IN big/JJ business/NN ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT constant/JJ expression/NN of/IN the/DT solidarity/NN that/WDT characterises/VBZ working/VBG people/NNS ./.

Today/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT Europe/NNP of/IN unemployment/NN and/CC underemployment/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ urgently/RB necessary/JJ to/TO establish/VB broader/JJR social/JJ protection/NN and/CC to/TO extend/VB the/DT rights/NNS of/IN working/VBG people/NNS ,/, but/CC this/DT demands/VBZ a/DT different/JJ system/NN of/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT EU/NNP can/MD not/RB possibly/RB create/VB ,/, because/RB of/IN its/PRP$ nature/NN and/CC character/NN ./.

That/DT concludes/VBZ the/DT explanations/NNS of/IN vote/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT sitting/NN was/VBD suspended/VBN at/IN 1.55/CD p.m./RB and/CC resumed/VBN at/IN 3/CD p.m./RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT Council/NNP declaration/NN on/IN the/DT establishing/NN of/IN the/DT EU/VBG priorities/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ session/NN of/IN the/DT UN/NNP Commission/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNPS -LRB-/-LRB- 20/CD March/NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, including/VBG the/DT situation/NN in/IN China/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP regret/VBP the/DT absence/NN of/IN the/DT Presidency-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT Council/NNP declaration/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD perhaps/RB have/VB been/VBN useful/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO have/VB been/VBN present/JJ for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ./.

Following/VBG the/DT statement/NN of/IN the/DT Presidency-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP can/MD all/RB agree/VB that/IN the/DT current/JJ situation/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS is/VBZ far/RB removed/VBN from/IN what/WP we/PRP would/MD all/RB like/VB to/TO see/VB ./.

Another/DT clear/JJ drawback/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP itself/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT signatory/NN to/TO the/DT Convention/NN for/IN the/DT Protection/NNP of/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP and/CC Fundamental/JJ Freedoms/NNS ,/, with/IN all/PDT the/DT additional/JJ disadvantages/NNS that/IN this/DT situation/NN entails/VBZ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN these/DT problems/NNS can/MD be/VB tackled/VBN and/CC dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ discussion/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP Charter/NNP on/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT resolution/NN contains/VBZ a/DT series/NN of/IN essential/JJ points/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB one/CD in/IN particular/JJ ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT need/NN for/IN greater/JJR coordination/NN between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT world/NN such/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ increasingly/RB dominated/VBN by/IN the/DT phenomenon/NN of/IN globalisation/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB only/RB in/IN the/DT economic/JJ field/NN ,/, our/PRP$ responses/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB effective/JJ ,/, must/MD be/VB concerted/VBN and/CC coordinated/VBN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB our/PRP$ actions/NNS effective/JJ ,/, we/PRP must/MD implement/VB a/DT type/NN of/IN coordination/NN in/IN practice/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB exist/VB at/IN present/JJ ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP therefore/RB advocates/VBZ the/DT principle/NN that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO participate/VB in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP and/CC other/JJ international/JJ fora/NN which/WDT deal/VBP with/IN these/DT issues/NNS and/CC ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, this/DT Parliament/NNP would/MD like/VB to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO participate/VB in/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN meeting/NN as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

Soon/RB ,/, in/IN May/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO present/VB a/DT communication/NN on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC democratisation/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ external/JJ relations/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT should/MD be/VB applied/VBN to/TO all/DT areas/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/VBG also/RB the/DT budgetary/JJ area/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD recognise/VB the/DT important/JJ contributions/NNS made/VBN by/IN civil/JJ society/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT often/RB underestimated/VBN role/NN of/IN the/DT numerous/JJ non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS who/WP act/VBP on/IN the/DT ground/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP must/MD make/VB every/DT effort/NN to/TO provide/VB all/PDT the/DT necessary/JJ support/NN for/IN them/PRP to/TO carry/VB out/RP their/PRP$ important/JJ work/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioners/NNP ,/, when/WRB this/DT House/NNP is/VBZ called/VBN upon/IN to/TO debate/VB human/JJ rights/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ taking/VBG a/DT chance/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP will/MD ,/, that/DT is/VBZ reinforced/VBN by/IN the/DT conditions/NNS that/WDT prevail/VBP when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP called/VBN upon/RB to/TO discuss/VB such/PDT a/DT crucial/JJ issue/NN ./.

The/DT absence/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN of/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN MEPs/NNP ,/, shows/VBZ just/RB how/WRB great/JJ the/DT divide/NN is/VBZ between/IN our/PRP$ noble/JJ ,/, elevated/JJ and/CC worthy/JJ formal/JJ statements/NNS and/CC the/DT concrete/JJ reality/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ day-to-day/JJ policies/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD get/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT situation/NN where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP only/RB aware/JJ of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS when/WRB they/PRP hit/VBD the/DT headlines/NNS or/CC abuses/NNS are/VBP being/VBG punished/VBN ./.

The/DT role/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ to/TO meet/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS head/NN on/IN ,/, particularly/RB at/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN prevention/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT sense/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO export/VB a/DT culture/NN based/VBN on/IN legality/NN and/CC respect/NN for/IN the/DT law/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP finally/RB reached/VBN the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ period/NN during/IN which/WDT a/DT whole/JJ raft/NN of/IN treaties/NNS appeared/VBD and/CC were/VBD duly/RB signed/VBN ./.

Nowadays/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP many/JJ ,/, perhaps/RB too/RB many/JJ ,/, treaties/NNS on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

If/IN those/DT treaties/NNS remain/VBP mere/JJ expressions/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP no/DT more/JJR than/IN useless/CD depositories/NNS of/IN people/NNS 's/POS thoughts/NNS ./.

The/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN to/TO move/VB on/RP to/TO a/DT new/JJ and/CC crucial/JJ phase/NN ,/, namely/RB a/DT phase/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN the/DT treaties/NNS are/VBP applied/VBN on/IN a/DT daily/JJ and/CC binding/JJ basis/NN ,/, although/IN we/PRP ought/MD not/RB forget/VB that/IN some/DT basic/JJ treaties/NNS are/VBP still/RB to/TO be/VB transposed/VBN ./.

I/PRP refer/VBP to/TO the/DT Rome/NNP Conference/NNP and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN 14/CD of/IN the/DT 15/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP have/VBP still/RB not/RB ratified/VBN the/DT treaty/NN establishing/VBG an/DT International/NNP Criminal/NNP Court/NNP ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB evaluating/VBG and/CC modifying/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT political/JJ instruments/NNS we/PRP use/VBP to/TO measure/VB the/DT status/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS globally/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP often/RB employed/VBN instruments/NNS which/WDT ,/, at/IN the/DT formal/JJ level/NN ,/, make/VBP us/PRP feel/VBP comfortable/JJ ,/, but/CC which/WDT ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN practical/JJ results/NNS ,/, are/VBP totally/RB ineffectual/JJ ./.

Thus/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP ask/VBP my/PRP$ fellow/JJ Members/NNS to/TO approve/VB this/DT report/NN and/CC I/PRP ask/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, as/IN other/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP done/VBN ,/, to/TO take/VB good/JJ note/NN of/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN when/WRB they/PRP address/VBP the/DT programming/NN for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2006/CD ./.

We/PRP now/RB require/VBP an/DT in-depth/JJ analysis/NN of/IN why/WRB regional/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ not/RB producing/VBG the/DT desired/VBN result/NN in/IN all/DT areas/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN bureaucracy/NN or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP because/IN insufficient/JJ notice/NN has/VBZ been/VBN taken/VBN of/IN interregional/JJ differences/NNS ,/, long/JJ distances/NNS ,/, climates/NNS that/WDT are/VBP too/RB cold/JJ or/CC too/RB hot/JJ ,/, sparse/VBP populations/JJ and/CC austere/JJ conditions/NNS ?/.

How/WRB can/MD the/DT Union/NNP respond/VB to/TO the/DT challenges/NNS of/IN global/JJ development/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT less/RBR developed/JJ areas/NNS can/MD remain/VB a/DT part/NN of/IN that/DT development/NN ?/.

Some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP been/VBN in/IN breach/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN and/CC cut/VBN national/JJ regional/JJ funds/NNS when/WRB regional/JJ aid/NN coming/VBG via/IN the/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN increased/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB essential/JJ that/IN companies/NNS in/IN areas/NNS developing/VBG more/RBR slowly/RB adopt/VB the/DT latest/JJS technology/NN and/CC know-how/NN ./.

Our/NNP Group/NNP is/VBZ in/IN favour/NN of/IN adopting/VBG this/DT report/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN has/VBZ ,/, until/IN now/RB ,/, not/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO interpret/VB ,/, in/IN any/DT significant/JJ way/NN ,/, the/DT existing/VBG differences/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ inhabitants/NN '/POS incomes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Berend/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN is/VBZ precisely/RB in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT strategy/NN determined/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP inasmuch/RB as/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN increasing/VBG competitiveness/NN is/VBZ brought/VBN right/RB to/TO the/DT fore/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB crucial/JJ that/IN parallel/JJ temporary/JJ measures/NNS be/VB introduced/VBN in/IN the/DT Objective/JJ 1/CD Regions/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB job/NN creation/NN measures/NNS ,/, special/JJ programmes/NNS for/IN supporting/VBG employment/NN opportunities/NNS for/IN women/NNS and/CC initiatives/NNS to/TO help/VB people/NNS set/VB up/RP their/PRP$ own/JJ business/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP supported/VBN by/IN appropriate/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP structural/JJ fund/NN activities/NNS ./.

Supporting/VBG only/RB the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN companies/NNS will/MD never/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO compensate/VB for/IN the/DT envisaged/JJ cohesion/NN between/IN economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ development/NN ,/, simply/RB because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT basis/NN for/IN a/DT self-supporting/JJ upturn/NN in/IN these/DT Objective/JJ 1/CD Regions/NNS ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT knowledge/NN that/IN economic/JJ development/NN alone/RB does/VBZ not/RB help/VB to/TO combat/VB unemployment/NN substantiates/NNS the/DT fact/NN than/IN an/DT increase/NN of/IN at/IN least/JJS 3/CD %/NN in/IN gross/JJ domestic/JJ product/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO create/VB any/DT additional/JJ jobs/NNS at/IN all/DT ./.

Concentrating/VBG to/TO the/DT exclusion/NN of/IN all/RB else/RB on/IN supply/NN and/CC demand-orientated/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ not/RB the/DT answer/NN ./.

And/CC those/DT that/WDT do/VBP pursue/VB such/PDT a/DT policy/NN must/MD invest/VB in/IN expansion/NN for/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN and/CC ,/, to/TO a/DT lesser/JJR extent/NN ,/, in/IN rationalisation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ imperative/JJ for/IN this/DT to/TO go/VB hand/NN in/IN hand/NN with/IN a/DT demand-orientated/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO have/VB any/DT chance/NN at/IN all/DT of/IN improving/VBG the/DT social/JJ situation/NN in/IN these/DT areas/NNS ./.

The/DT situation/NN varies/VBZ to/TO an/DT enormous/JJ degree/NN throughout/IN the/DT regions/NNS ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, what/WP is/VBZ needed/VBN is/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN accompanying/VBG measures/NNS if/IN anything/NN at/IN all/DT is/VBZ to/TO be/VB accomplished/VBN there/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ compliments/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN his/PRP$ in-depth/JJ report/NN ./.

The/DT key/JJ goal/NN of/IN the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS is/VBZ to/TO strengthen/VB social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ cohesion/NN between/IN the/DT regions/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

By/IN stimulating/VBG a/DT diversity/NN of/IN investments/NNS ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ endeavouring/VBG to/TO increase/VB the/DT GDP/NN per/IN capita/NN and/CC to/TO boost/VB employment/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT regions/NNS ,/, one/PRP can/MD draw/VB the/DT hesitant/JJ conclusion/NN that/IN these/DT incentives/NNS do/VBP not/RB always/RB have/VB the/DT desired/VBN effect/NN ./.

The/DT efforts/NNS made/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO drive/VB up/RP the/DT GDP/NN per/IN capita/NN in/IN Objective/NNP 1/CD regions/NNS do/VBP not/RB always/RB result/VB in/IN such/PDT an/DT increase/NN ,/, not/RB really/RB a/DT satisfying/JJ result/NN over/IN a/DT period/NN during/IN which/WDT ,/, certainly/RB over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN economic/JJ growth/NN ./.

As/IN indicated/VBD by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, the/DT effects/NNS of/IN the/DT structural/JJ measures/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, are/VBP minimal/JJ as/RB far/RB as/IN employment/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

Some/DT reservation/NN about/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN Community/NNP aid/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB called/VBN for/IN ./.

Also/RB ,/, the/DT observation/NN that/IN the/DT disparities/NNS between/IN regions/NNS within/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS sometimes/RB even/RB become/VB more/RBR pronounced/JJ raises/VBZ serious/JJ questions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP therefore/RB seems/VBZ worthwhile/JJ and/CC necessary/JJ to/TO focus/VB attention/NN on/IN both/DT national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN connection/NN with/IN boosting/VBG employment/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, they/PRP who/WP have/VBP most/JJS knowledge/NN about/IN the/DT regions/NNS which/WDT fall/VBP under/IN their/PRP$ remit/NN ./.

By/IN allowing/VBG them/PRP to/TO develop/VB tailor-made/JJ plans/NNS for/IN the/DT relevant/JJ regions/NNS and/CC ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, tying/VB this/DT in/IN with/IN financial/JJ aid/NN ,/, a/DT higher/JJR return/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

Surely/RB this/DT must/MD be/VB the/DT ultimate/JJ goal/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP delegating/VBG the/DT practical/JJ details/NNS and/CC implementation/NN of/IN measures/NNS to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC regions/NNS ./.

Following/VBG on/IN from/IN this/DT ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB also/RB more/RBR meaningful/JJ ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT financial/JJ aid/NN to/TO regions/NNS ,/, to/TO give/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS more/JJR say/VBP anyway/RB ./.

By/IN shifting/VBG the/DT criteria/NNS from/IN the/DT regions/NNS to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, we/PRP can/MD avoid/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN problems/NNS later/RB on/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB attention/NN to/TO the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT Central/NNP and/CC Eastern/NNP European/NNP countries/NNS ./.

The/DT report/NN shows/VBZ that/IN ,/, in/IN general/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP a/DT long/JJ way/NN behind/IN EU/NNP countries/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN GDP/NNP per/IN capita/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, following/VBG close/JJ scrutiny/NN of/IN this/DT report/NN one/NN can/MD not/RB escape/VB the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ to/TO fulfil/VB the/DT stated/JJ objective/NN of/IN the/DT structural/JJ policy/NN only/RB in/IN part/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, whilst/IN the/DT disparities/NNS between/IN the/DT regions/NNS have/VBP increased/VBN rather/RB than/IN decreased/VBN ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN convergence/NN between/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS themselves/PRP in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

Equally/RB ,/, unemployment/NN levels/NNS in/IN the/DT worst/JJS affected/JJ regions/NNS barely/RB fell/VBD at/IN all/DT ,/, indeed/RB they/PRP rose/VBD in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ./.

I/PRP wonder/VBP why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP not/RB employed/VBN more/RBR efficiently/RB ./.

Even/RB the/DT accumulation/NN of/IN money/NN from/IN the/DT cohesion/NN funds/NNS and/CC the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS has/VBZ failed/VBN to/TO have/VB the/DT desired/VBN effect/NN in/IN all/DT regions/NNS and/CC countries/NNS ./.

Genuine/JJ structural/JJ reforms/NNS and/CC a/DT competition-friendly/JJ taxation/NN policy/NN are/VBP the/DT cornerstones/NNS of/IN a/DT successful/JJ economic/JJ base/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO stand/VB accused/VBN of/IN pursuing/VBG a/DT cost-intensive/JJ structural/JJ policy/NN that/WDT does/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT unemployment/NN situation/NN in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT measures/NNS drawn/VBN up/RP so/RB far/RB must/MD be/VB analysed/VBN ./.

We/PRP will/MD only/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT structural/JJ policy/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT success/NN when/WRB we/PRP manage/VBP to/TO create/VB a/DT sufficient/JJ number/NN of/IN jobs/NNS and/CC when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ reduction/NN in/IN the/DT unemployment/NN rate/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, my/PRP$ thanks/NNS go/VBP to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN handling/VBG this/DT very/RB important/JJ report/NN ,/, because/IN developments/NNS in/IN the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ situation/NN will/MD decide/VB to/TO what/WDT extent/NN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP will/MD judge/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN successful/JJ in/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ./.

This/DT issue/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ an/DT impact/NN on/IN their/PRP$ everyday/JJ life/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ issue/NN as/IN regards/NNP EU/NNP credibility/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB conceded/VBN that/IN the/DT EU/NNP has/VBZ already/RB aided/VBN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB quite/RB magnificently/JJ ,/, the/DT development/NN of/IN poor/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP remember/VBP what/WP Portugal/NNP and/CC Greece/NNP used/VBD to/TO be/VB like/IN when/WRB I/PRP drove/VBD through/IN those/DT countries/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN twenty-five/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT connection/NN ,/, French/JJ speakers/NNS would/MD speak/VB of/IN a/DT ``/`` coup/NNP de/IN chapeau/NNP ''/'' :/: in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, I/PRP take/VBP my/PRP$ hat/NN off/RP to/TO the/DT EU/NNP ./.

The/DT EU/NNP really/RB deserves/VBZ such/PDT a/DT gesture/NN ,/, but/CC differences/NNS between/IN rich/JJ and/CC poor/JJ areas/NNS within/IN countries/NNS are/VBP still/RB too/RB great/JJ ./.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT result/NN ?/.

People/NNS react/VBP by/IN voting/VBG with/IN their/PRP$ feet/NNS and/CC go/VBP where/WRB they/PRP can/MD earn/VB a/DT crust/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO build/VB schools/NNS ,/, hospitals/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT whole/JJ infrastructure/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT same/JJ country/NN many/JJ times/NNS over/RP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ very/RB costly/JJ and/CC it/PRP also/RB causes/VBZ very/RB great/JJ social/JJ problems/NNS ./.

Most/JJS people/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, would/MD like/VB to/TO live/VB in/IN the/DT area/NN in/IN which/WDT they/PRP were/VBD born/VBN and/CC raised/VBN ,/, if/IN they/PRP were/VBD given/VBN the/DT chance/NN to/TO ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, if/IN there/EX was/VBD work/NN there/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD give/VB them/PRP this/DT opportunity/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT moral/JJ obligation/NN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC all/DT of/IN us/PRP have/VBP ./.

The/DT solution/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP see/VBP it/PRP ,/, lies/VBZ in/IN clearly/RB encouraging/VBG entrepreneurship/NN ./.

By/IN entrepreneurship/NN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB simply/RB mean/VB the/DT ownership/NN of/IN business/NN ,/, but/CC creating/VBG will/MD ./.

I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT attitude/NN where/WRB a/DT person/NN wants/VBZ to/TO get/VB on/RP in/IN life/NN ,/, whether/IN he/PRP or/CC she/PRP is/VBZ an/DT employee/NN ,/, the/DT owner/NN of/IN a/DT business/NN or/CC an/DT official/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ a/DT fair/JJ society/NN ?/.

One/CD in/IN which/WDT someone/NN from/IN a/DT modest/JJ background/NN can/MD get/VB on/RP in/IN life/NN so/RB as/IN to/TO make/VB life/NN a/DT little/RB easier/JJR for/IN his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ children/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, positive/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT regions/NNS is/VBZ also/RB possible/JJ ,/, because/IN people/NNS will/MD start/VB business/NN and/CC will/MD work/VB if/IN they/PRP are/VBP given/VBN the/DT chance/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN in/IN this/DT matter/NN we/PRP should/MD learn/VB a/DT lesson/NN from/IN America/NNP ,/, where/WRB hard/JJ work/NN is/VBZ still/RB in/IN fashion/NN and/CC success/NN is/VBZ an/DT indication/NN of/IN ability/NN and/CC not/RB the/DT object/NN of/IN envy/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP often/RB is/VBZ here/RB in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, as/IN my/PRP$ time/NN is/VBZ limited/JJ ,/, I/PRP shall/MD get/VB straight/RB to/TO the/DT point/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP make/VB a/DT statement/NN of/IN fact/NN :/: the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN growth/NN are/VBP not/RB distributed/VBN equitably/RB within/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT most/RBS remote/JJ regions/NNS ,/, still/RB hard/RB hit/VBN by/IN catastrophic/JJ unemployment/NN rates/NNS ,/, offer/VBP one/CD example/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

In/IN Reunion/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT rate/NN is/VBZ 37/CD %/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT situation/NN related/VBN to/TO the/DT economic/JJ climate/NN ,/, however/RB ;/: rather/RB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT structural/JJ problem/NN ,/, created/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ remoteness/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ insularity/NN ,/, in/IN short/JJ ,/, our/PRP$ own/JJ specific/JJ personality/NN ./.

The/DT principle/NN of/IN specific/JJ ,/, exceptional/JJ treatment/NN was/VBD envisaged/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 299/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP in/IN order/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN such/JJ cases/NNS ./.

It/PRP only/RB remains/VBZ to/TO put/VB this/DT principle/NN into/IN practice/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP document/NN expected/VBN to/TO be/VB ready/JJ in/IN December/NNP 1999/CD was/VBD delayed/VBN until/IN January/NNP ,/, then/RB February/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT initial/JJ thinking/NN does/VBZ not/RB fill/VB me/PRP with/IN much/JJ optimism/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB appeal/VBP formally/RB to/TO the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

As/IN regards/VBG taxation/NN ,/, state/NN aid/NN ,/, the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC defending/VBG our/PRP$ traditional/JJ products/NNS ,/, practical/JJ measures/NNS characterised/VBN by/IN daring/NN and/CC ambition/NN must/MD be/VB planned/VBN as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

If/IN these/DT do/VBP not/RB materialise/VB ,/, then/RB ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, convergence/NN and/CC cohesion/NN will/MD remain/VB no/DT more/RBR than/IN words/NNS for/IN us/PRP ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB feared/VBN that/IN the/DT structural/JJ policy/NN undertaken/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ regions/NNS ,/, despite/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT amounts/NNS committed/VBN ,/, will/MD end/VB in/IN failure/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN all/PDT the/DT previous/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP done/VBN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB in/IN turn/NN to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Berend/NNP and/CC congratulate/VB him/PRP on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT few/JJ comments/NNS ,/, firstly/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, regarding/VBG the/DT assessment/NN you/PRP have/VBP made/VBN of/IN this/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN ./.

You/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN and/CC you/PRP even/RB wrote/VBD ,/, if/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB mistaken/VBN ,/, that/IN it/PRP marked/VBD a/DT real/JJ improvement/NN in/IN comparison/NN with/IN previous/JJ reports/NNS ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT officials/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC my/PRP$ predecessor/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP ,/, I/PRP must/MD inform/VB you/PRP that/IN we/PRP were/VBD very/RB alert/JJ to/TO the/DT evaluation/NN made/VBN by/IN this/DT House/NNP and/CC by/IN yourself/PRP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD certainly/RB very/RB anxious/JJ to/TO ensure/VB ,/, Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, that/IN this/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN should/MD show/VB that/IN progress/NN had/VBD been/VBN made/VBN and/CC a/DT threshold/NN crossed/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT analysis/NN submitted/VBN to/TO you/PRP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN technological/JJ research/NN and/CC development/NN ,/, infrastructure/NN provision/NN and/CC quality/NN ,/, human/JJ resources/NNS potential/NN ,/, small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS and/CC direct/JJ investment/NN from/IN abroad/RB ./.

So/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT quality/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO spend/VB time/NN right/RB now/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, going/VBG into/IN details/NNS regarding/VBG my/PRP$ opinion/NN of/IN the/DT general/NN points/VBZ which/WDT your/PRP$ House/NN has/VBZ already/RB endorsed/VBN ./.

Let/VBD me/PRP just/RB itemise/JJ them/PRP :/: the/DT first/JJ point/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT usefulness/NN of/IN the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN this/DT report/NN in/IN drawing/VBG up/RP the/DT priorities/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ regional/JJ policy/NN ,/, particularly/RB for/IN the/DT negotiation/NN of/IN programming/VBG documents/NNS with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, partnership/NN ,/, a/DT subject/JJ which/WDT a/DT number/NN of/IN you/PRP stressed/VBD ,/, the/DT role/NN of/IN local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, the/DT private/JJ sector/NN ,/, both/DT sides/NNS of/IN industry/NN ,/, associations/NNS and/CC local/JJ community/NN action/NN groups/NNS ./.

Regarding/VBG this/DT problem/NN of/IN partnership/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD be/VB extremely/RB attentive/JJ to/TO ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS regulations/NNS are/VBP applied/VBN properly/RB ./.

Mr/NNP Fruteau/NNP stated/VBD just/RB now/RB that/IN the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN growth/NN were/VBD distributed/VBN inequitably/RB ./.

Mr/NNP Fruteau/NNP ,/, we/PRP at/IN least/JJS need/VBP to/TO recognise/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ growth/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB working/VBG in/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN stagnation/NN or/CC recession/NN ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT case/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD tell/VB me/PRP that/IN situations/NNS of/IN growth/NN or/CC shortage/NN do/VBP not/RB affect/VB everyone/NN alike/RB ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN your/PRP$ analysis/NN ./.

When/WRB there/EX is/VBZ growth/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB better/RBR distributed/VBN ,/, but/CC a/DT matter/NN that/WDT is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR difficult/JJ and/CC which/WDT more/RBR seriously/RB affects/VBZ the/DT regions/NNS handicapped/NNS by/IN their/PRP$ remoteness/NNS ,/, be/VB they/PRP the/DT most/RBS remote/JJ or/CC island/NN regions/NNS ,/, is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN growth/NN which/WDT generally/RB characterised/VBD the/DT last/JJ two/CD decades/NNS ./.

Fourthly/NNP ,/, a/DT point/NN which/WDT Mrs/NNP Hedkvist/NNP Petersen/NNP stressed/VBD just/RB now/RB ,/, the/DT promotion/NN of/IN an/DT equal/JJ opportunities/NNS policy/NN for/IN women/NNS and/CC young/JJ people/NNS ./.

Fifthly/RB ,/, the/DT importance/NN and/CC role/NN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Vatanen/NNP expressed/VBD this/DT most/JJS forcefully/RB just/RB now/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT positive/NN effects/VBZ on/IN national/JJ administrations/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN management/NN of/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, the/DT motives/NNS of/IN officials/NNS in/IN managing/VBG these/DT funds/NNS ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ occasionally/RB complicated/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT importance/NN of/IN once/RB again/RB making/VBG improvements/NNS to/TO the/DT procedures/NNS for/IN the/DT evaluation/NN ,/, follow-up/NN and/CC supervision/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT ,/, I/PRP must/MD inform/VB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP of/IN my/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO organise/VB halfway/RB through/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD a/DT seminar/NN with/IN national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS on/IN this/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT evaluation/NN of/IN procedures/NNS for/IN the/DT exchange/NN of/IN good/JJ practice/NN in/IN the/DT management/NN of/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB a/DT few/JJ specific/JJ points/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, you/PRP expressed/VBD a/DT wish/NN that/IN zoning/VBG should/MD be/VB implemented/VBN quickly/RB ./.

Well/UH ,/, we/PRP are/VBP coming/VBG to/TO an/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT zoning/VBG phase/NN ./.

Tomorrow/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ to/TO decide/VB on/IN the/DT matter/NN for/IN four/CD more/JJR countries/NNS and/CC very/RB soon/RB ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB Italy/NNP '/POS s/JJ turn/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD therefore/RB be/VB satisfied/JJ on/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, since/IN zoning/VBG will/MD have/VB been/VBN completed/VBN for/IN all/PDT the/DT countries/NNS affected/VBN by/IN Objective/NNP 2/CD ./.

Regarding/VBG the/DT informal/JJ economy/NN you/PRP mention/VBP in/IN your/PRP$ report/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP well/RB aware/JJ that/IN the/DT analysis/NN and/CC production/NN of/IN statistics/NNS on/IN this/DT subject/NN are/VBP dependent/JJ on/IN the/DT reliability/NN of/IN data/NNS and/CC ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Cocilovo/NNP mentioned/VBD ,/, there/EX is/VBZ clearly/RB a/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT reliability/NN of/IN this/DT data/NNS ./.

To/TO a/DT certain/JJ extent/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP taken/VBN into/IN account/NN in/IN the/DT statistics/NNS on/IN GDP/NN and/CC labour/NN force/NN surveys/NNS and/CC ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO point/VB out/RP the/DT efforts/NNS which/WDT Eurostat/NNP is/VBZ making/VBG and/CC shall/MD continue/VB to/TO make/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT statistics/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, you/PRP also/RB mentioned/VBD ,/, as/IN did/VBD Mr/NNP Aparicio/NNP S脙/NNP 隆/NNP nchez/NNP ,/, the/DT lack/NN of/IN reform/NN in/IN the/DT fisheries/NNS sector/NN ./.

This/DT type/NN of/IN sectoral/JJ analysis/NN pertains/VBZ rather/RB to/TO the/DT practice/NN and/CC competence/NN of/IN the/DT Directorate/NNP General/NNP for/IN Fisheries/NNPS ,/, under/IN Commissioner/NNP Fischler/NNP ./.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD make/VB every/DT effort/NN to/TO include/VB an/DT analysis/NN of/IN this/DT type/NN in/IN the/DT second/JJ report/NN on/IN cohesion/NN which/WDT ,/, no/DT doubt/NN ,/, will/MD respond/VB better/RBR to/TO these/DT concerns/NNS ./.

Several/JJ of/IN you/PRP mentioned/VBD points/NNS which/WDT must/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT second/JJ report/NN on/IN cohesion/NN ,/, and/CC your/PRP$ rapporteur/NN mentioned/VBD some/DT of/IN these/DT ./.

And/CC finally/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP the/DT cross-border/JJ aspects/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD endeavour/VB to/TO comply/VB with/IN your/PRP$ recommendations/NNS on/IN all/PDT these/DT points/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB a/DT few/JJ political/JJ conclusions/NNS which/WDT you/PRP are/VBP ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, familiar/JJ with/IN ,/, but/CC whose/WP$ main/JJ elements/NNS I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO reiterate/VB ./.

Ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, considerable/JJ progress/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN on/IN the/DT road/NN to/TO real/JJ convergence/NN ,/, particularly/RB for/IN the/DT four/CD cohesion/NN countries/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB frankly/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Pohjamo/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT Objective/JJ 2/CD regions/NNS which/WDT had/VBD suffered/VBN some/DT delays/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN development/NN ,/, especially/RB regarding/VBG infrastructure/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ first/JJ point/NN regarding/VBG the/DT policy/NN ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN regarding/VBG the/DT policy/NN is/VBZ as/IN follows/VBZ :/: the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS have/VB made/VBN ,/, and/CC continue/VB to/TO make/VB ,/, a/DT significant/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT convergence/JJ process/NN ./.

All/PDT the/DT macroeconomic/JJ models/NNS we/PRP are/VBP working/VBG on/RP show/VBP that/IN ,/, over/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN ,/, more/JJR than/IN one/CD third/NN of/IN the/DT convergence/NN achieved/VBN in/IN the/DT regions/NNS whose/WP$ development/NN is/VBZ lagging/VBG behind/RP would/MD not/RB have/VB taken/VBN place/NN without/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

Now/RB to/TO my/PRP$ fourth/JJ point/NN regarding/VBG the/DT policy/NN ;/: enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, the/DT great/JJ political/JJ and/CC humanist/JJ project/NN of/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS ,/, the/DT major/JJ challenge/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT European/JJ policy/NN on/IN cohesion/NN ,/, a/DT point/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP van/NNP Dam/NNP highlighted/VBD ./.

I/PRP shall/MD say/VB that/IN something/NN is/VBZ already/RB taking/VBG shape/NN in/IN Berlin/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT financial/JJ instruments/NNS available/JJ to/TO us/PRP which/WDT may/MD be/VB a/DT policy/NN on/IN cohesion/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ countries/NNS who/WP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO join/VB us/PRP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG in/IN particular/JJ of/IN the/DT pre-accession/JJ structural/JJ instrument/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP shall/MD be/VB responsible/JJ for/IN implementing/VBG in/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS ./.

You/PRP see/VBP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP only/RB just/RB initiated/VBN the/DT new/JJ programming/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP already/RB considering/VBG together/RP the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ enlargement/NN on/IN our/PRP$ structural/JJ policy/NN ./.

This/DT sixth/JJ periodic/JJ report/NN which/WDT you/PRP assessed/VBD as/RB positive/JJ on/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Berend/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ basis/NN for/IN our/PRP$ thinking/NN ,/, for/IN us/PRP all/DT and/CC for/IN myself/PRP ./.

I/PRP should/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP most/RBS sincerely/JJ for/IN your/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT thinking/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP already/RB engaged/VBN in/RP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT forthcoming/JJ guidelines/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN the/DT proper/JJ application/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2006/CD ./.

Adoption/NNP of/IN the/DT Minutes/NNPS of/IN the/DT previous/JJ sitting/NN ./.

The/DT Minutes/NNPS of/IN yesterday/NN '/POS s/VBZ sitting/VBG have/VB been/VBN distributed/VBN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT change/NN in/IN refugee/NN policy/NN in/IN Austria/NNP !/. ./.

Rural/JJ areas/NNS make/VBP up/RP over/IN 80/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ territory/NN and/CC 25/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN live/VBP in/IN them/PRP ./.

As/IN a/DT farmer/NN and/CC Member/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP always/RB endeavoured/VBN not/RB to/TO look/VB at/IN agriculture/NN in/IN isolation/NN but/CC to/TO see/VB rural/JJ areas/NNS as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB in/IN particular/JJ the/DT new/JJ LEADER/NNP +/NNP programme/NN because/RB of/IN its/PRP$ comprehensive/JJ nature/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT future/NN it/PRP will/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO have/VB programmes/NNS not/RB only/JJ in/IN the/DT individual/JJ zones/NNS eligible/NN for/IN structural/JJ aid/NN but/CC in/IN all/PDT the/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

This/DT across-the-board/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ sensible/JJ because/IN the/DT programmes/NNS for/IN rural/JJ development/NN are/VBP also/RB structured/VBN in/IN this/DT way/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, funding/NN will/MD no/RB longer/RB come/VB from/IN three/CD funds/NNS but/CC from/IN the/DT EAGGF/NNP Guidance/NNP section/NN alone/RB ./.

It/PRP will/MD therefore/RB be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO increase/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT programmes/NNS because/IN the/DT EAGGF/NNP is/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB an/DT effective/JJ financial/JJ instrument/NN ./.

Greater/NNP precision/NN in/IN the/DT selection/NN process/NN will/MD lead/VB to/TO greater/JJR effectiveness/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT money/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB squandered/VBN recklessly/RB ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD particularly/RB like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB the/DT point/NN which/WDT offers/VBZ an/DT approach/NN towards/IN creating/VBG an/DT integrated/JJ and/CC environmentally/RB friendly/JJ development/NN strategy/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ great/JJ potential/NN for/IN future/JJ job/NN creation/NN in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS here/RB and/CC we/PRP must/MD exploit/VB this/DT if/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO offer/VB fresh/JJ prospects/NNS to/TO people/NNS living/VBG in/IN the/DT countryside/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB policy/NN for/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN a/DT policy/NN just/RB for/IN farmers/NNS ./.

LEADER/NNP +/NNP should/MD supplement/VB already/RB existing/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, avoid/VB overlaps/NNS and/CC duplication/NNS of/IN financing/NN and/CC thus/RB contribute/VB to/TO a/DT process/NN of/IN development/NN which/WDT is/VBZ as/RB comprehensive/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, LEADER/NNP +/NNP can/MD ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT programmes/NNS under/IN Regulation/NN -LRB-/-LRB- EC/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- No/RB 1257/99/CD ,/, consolidate/VB the/DT second/JJ pillar/NN of/IN the/DT CAP/NNP even/RB more/RBR effectively/RB and/CC produce/VB the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ benefits/NNS for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT countryside/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB always/RB proud/JJ of/IN the/DT fuss/NNS that/WDT goes/VBZ on/IN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS examples/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ work/NN :/: it/PRP was/VBD created/VBN following/VBG an/DT initiative/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP would/MD have/VB abolished/VBN URBAN/NNP ,/, but/CC this/DT time/NN Parliament/NNP drew/VBD the/DT longer/JJR straw/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN URBAN/NNP is/VBZ to/TO continue/VB ,/, as/IN it/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN good/JJ results/NNS at/IN local/JJ level/NN ./.

The/DT problems/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ urban/JJ areas/NNS are/VBP getting/VBG worse/JJR ;/: fortunately/RB ,/, we/PRP now/RB have/VBP consensus/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN of/IN Europe/NNP live/VBP in/IN cities/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ problems/NNS are/VBP among/IN the/DT most/RBS pressing/JJ within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN regional/JJ policy/NN and/CC very/RB complex/JJ matters/NNS in/IN themselves/PRP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ an/DT immense/JJ risk/NN of/IN exclusion/NN ./.

In/IN many/JJ cities/NNS in/IN France/NNP and/CC England/NNP there/EX are/VBP now/RB slums/NNS ,/, breeding/VBG grounds/NNS for/IN many/JJ sorts/NNS of/IN problems/NNS ./.

None/NN of/IN us/PRP wants/VBZ South/NNP American/NNP type/NN favelas/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO act/VB now/RB ,/, before/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB late/JJ ./.

Our/PRP$ cities/NNS are/VBP also/RB of/IN decisive/JJ importance/NN for/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ economy/NN ./.

We/PRP always/RB come/VB back/RP to/TO the/DT same/JJ basic/JJ problem/NN in/IN Europe/NNP :/: our/PRP$ economy/NN does/VBZ not/RB support/VB the/DT individual/NN sufficiently/RB ,/, nor/CC is/VBZ it/PRP sufficiently/RB dynamic/JJ ./.

The/DT economy/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB strong/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO attend/VB to/TO the/DT problems/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ fellow-citizens/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ environment/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB policy/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ life/NN '/POS s/JJ simple/JJ logic/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ that/IN spending/NN has/VBZ become/VBN focused/JJ ,/, as/IN otherwise/RB the/DT buckshot/NN gets/VBZ scattered/VBN to/TO the/DT four/CD winds/NNS ./.

Now/RB we/PRP have/VBP to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN solving/VBG problems/NNS in/IN small/JJ and/CC middle-size/JJ towns/NNS and/CC cities/NNS ,/, as/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB enough/JJ resources/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN we/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO speed/VB up/RP matters/NNS in/IN surrounding/VBG rural/JJ areas/NNS ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB forgotten/VBN that/IN urban/JJ and/CC rural/JJ problems/NNS in/IN fact/NN go/VBP hand/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.

The/DT basis/NN for/IN all/PDT this/DT is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP should/MD be/VB encouraging/VBG individual/JJ innovation/NN and/CC entrepreneurship/NN ,/, as/IN group/NN action/NN begun/VBN by/IN the/DT individual/NN will/MD help/VB revitalise/JJ an/DT area/NN internally/RB ./.

Granting/VBG funds/NNS without/IN an/DT economy/NN that/WDT can/MD stand/VB on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ two/CD feet/NNS is/VBZ like/IN carrying/VBG water/NN to/TO fill/VB up/RP a/DT dry/JJ well/NN :/: there/EX will/MD be/VB enough/JJ to/TO drink/VB for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, but/CC tomorrow/NN the/DT well/NN will/MD be/VB dry/JJ again/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP ,/, European/JJ cooperation/NN policy/NN is/VBZ entering/VBG a/DT new/JJ phase/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ attention/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB focused/VBN exclusively/RB on/IN internal/JJ borders/NNS but/CC also/RB on/IN external/JJ ones/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN globalisation/NN and/CC cultural/JJ openness/NN which/WDT characterise/VBP the/DT current/JJ situation/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP needs/VBZ instruments/NNS that/WDT will/MD allow/VB it/PRP to/TO strengthen/VB its/PRP$ links/NN and/CC communication/NN channels/NNS with/IN neighbouring/JJ regions/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN Eastern/NNP and/CC Southern/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ borders/NNS must/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB an/DT obstacle/NN to/TO balanced/JJ development/NN ,/, but/CC -/: on/RB the/DT contrary/NN -/: an/DT opportunity/NN ,/, a/DT bridge/NN to/TO more/RBR fruitful/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

By/IN means/NNS of/IN amendments/NNS adopted/VBN in/IN committee/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ tried/VBN to/TO supplement/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN ,/, by/IN including/VBG new/JJ elements/NNS in/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN areas/NNS targeted/VBN for/IN aid/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ external/JJ border/NN areas/NNS and/CC maritime/NN border/NN areas/NNS in/IN Southern/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

In/IN its/PRP$ draft/NN guidelines/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP acknowledges/VBZ that/IN these/DT borders/NNS require/VBP greater/JJR attention/NN than/IN they/PRP did/VBD in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN enlargement/NN to/TO the/DT east/JJ and/CC that/DT of/IN greater/JJR integration/NN with/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP countries/NNS ./.

As/IN President/NNP Prodi/NNP too/RB mentioned/VBD when/WRB outlining/VBG the/DT strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2005/CD ,/, boosting/VBG the/DT Barcelona/NNP process/NN is/VBZ a/DT priority/NN for/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT INTERREG/NNP III/NNP initiative/NN will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO make/VB its/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT pursuit/NN of/IN this/DT strategic/JJ objective/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, from/IN this/DT year/NN until/IN the/DT year/NN 2006/CD around/IN EUR/$ 200/CD billion/CD is/VBZ available/JJ for/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, but/CC only/RB 5脗鸥/CD %/NN is/VBZ set/VBN aside/RP for/IN the/DT Community/NNP initiatives/NNP ,/, INTERREG/NNP ,/, LEADER/NNP ,/, URBAN/NNP and/CC EQUAL/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT reduction/NN of/IN 3脗鸥/CD %/NN compared/VBN with/IN the/DT previous/JJ CIs/NN ./.

No/DT more/JJR than/IN EUR/$ 2.8/CD billion/CD is/VBZ provided/VBN for/IN EQUAL/NNP ,/, as/IN Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP '/POS s/JJ balanced/JJ report/NN makes/VBZ clear/JJ ./.

This/DT makes/VBZ the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS and/CC far/RB too/RB long/JJ a/DT wish/NN list/NN of/IN possible/JJ tasks/NNS all/DT the/DT more/RBR astonishing/JJ ./.

How/WRB are/VBP priorities/NNS supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB set/VBN here/RB ?/.

There/EX is/VBZ agreement/NN on/IN the/DT principle/NN that/IN marginalisation/NN ,/, discrimination/NN and/CC inequalities/NNS on/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN should/MD be/VB reduced/VBN ./.

Transnational/JJ strategies/NNS are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ for/IN disadvantaged/JJ groups/NNS to/TO have/VB access/NN to/TO jobs/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT sympathy/NN for/IN amendments/NNS once/RB again/RB backing/VBG the/DT TAOs/NNPS ./.

Criticism/NN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NN '/POS s/JJ work/NN was/VBD particularly/RB severe/JJ ,/, legitimately/RB so/RB ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO these/DT Technical/NNP Assistance/NNP Offices/NNS ./.

Our/NNP Committee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS was/VBD ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, in/IN overall/JJ charge/NN of/IN analysing/VBG considerable/JJ shortcomings/NNS and/CC failures/NNS to/TO carry/VB out/RP checks/NNS in/IN cases/NNS related/VBN to/TO LEONARDO/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB therefore/RB be/VB relieved/VBN of/IN direct/JJ responsibility/NN or/CC the/DT task/NN of/IN carrying/VBG out/RP inspections/NNS under/IN EQUAL/NNP either/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD therefore/RB be/VB the/DT guarantor/NN of/IN the/DT strategic/JJ framework/NN for/IN promoting/VBG ability/NN to/TO work/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN work/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT assessment/NN of/IN results/NNS and/CC of/IN the/DT effective/JJ communication/NN of/IN best/JJS practices/NNS ./.

Only/RB then/RB will/MD it/PRP be/VB possible/JJ for/IN the/DT desired/VBN multiplier/NN effect/NN to/TO be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO refer/VB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP proposals/NNS on/IN the/DT budget/NN line/NN to/TO promote/VB the/DT CAP/NNP ./.

On/IN 26/CD October/NNP 1999/CD the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP adopted/VBD a/DT proposal/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN a/DT legal/JJ basis/NN is/VBZ given/VBN to/TO the/DT budget/NN line/NN informing/VBG the/DT public/NN about/IN the/DT CAP/NNP ./.

This/DT proposal/NN will/MD remove/VB the/DT current/JJ budget/NN line/NN B2-5122/NN and/CC create/VB a/DT new/JJ budget/NN heading/VBG B1-382/NN ./.

Actions/NNS which/WDT promote/VB understanding/NN between/IN young/JJ farmers/NNS and/CC the/DT EU/NNP and/CC also/RB create/VB stronger/JJR links/NNS with/IN EU/JJ candidate/NN countries/NNS and/CC the/DT outside/JJ world/NN are/VBP important/JJ ./.

Therefore/RB I/PRP am/VBP putting/VBG forward/RP these/DT amendments/NNS to/TO Parliament/NNP to/TO give/VB its/PRP$ support/NN to/TO the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN programme/NN ./.

Given/VBN the/DT need/NN to/TO encourage/VB young/JJ farmers/NNS to/TO continue/VB in/IN farming/NN it/PRP is/VBZ vitally/RB important/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP well-informed/VBN about/IN developments/NNS in/IN the/DT common/JJ agricultural/JJ policy/NN ./.

Informing/VBG and/CC training/VBG young/JJ farmers/NNS at/IN European/JJ level/NN is/VBZ vitally/RB important/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO support/VB that/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT available/JJ budget/NN should/MD be/VB concentrated/VBN on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN knowledge/NN amongst/IN European/JJ young/JJ farmers/NNS ./.

Regarding/VBG information/NN and/CC training/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT past/NN this/DT budget/NN line/NN has/VBZ been/VBN allocated/VBN for/IN information/NN ,/, communication/NN and/CC training/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ now/RB proposing/VBG that/IN training/NN should/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB included/VBN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN training/NN should/MD be/VB included/VBN where/WRB it/PRP provides/VBZ relevant/JJ information/NN at/IN European/JJ level/NN about/IN the/DT CAP/NNP ./.

Such/JJ European/JJ training/NN is/VBZ one/CD element/NN in/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN young/JJ farmers/NNS have/VBP the/DT necessary/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT CAP/NNP to/TO make/VB sound/JJ business/NN decisions/NNS for/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Therefore/RB I/PRP am/VBP putting/VBG forward/RP three/CD amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD urge/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO support/VB them/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP taking/VBG the/DT floor/NN to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, drawn/VBN from/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN of/IN municipal/JJ administration/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT URBAN/NNP projects/NNS should/MD ,/, or/CC rather/RB must/MD ,/, have/VBP a/DT threefold/JJ purpose/NN :/: firstly/RB ,/, to/TO promote/VB the/DT restoration/NN of/IN infrastructure/NN and/CC historic/JJ ,/, old/JJ and/CC perhaps/RB dilapidated/JJ areas/NNS of/IN cities/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, to/TO promote/VB and/CC stimulate/VB economic/JJ activity/NN and/CC social/JJ life/NN within/IN these/DT historic/JJ centres/NNS ,/, within/IN these/DT old/JJ quarters/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ cities/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ little/JJ point/NN in/IN having/VBG streets/NNS which/WDT are/VBP now/RB wonderfully/RB lit/JJ ,/, with/IN new/JJ pavements/NNS ,/, with/IN newly/RB paved/JJ road/NN surfaces/NNS ,/, all/DT whitewashed/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO fill/VB them/PRP with/IN activity/NN and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, employment/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB -/: and/CC perhaps/RB this/DT should/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ objective/NN -/: the/DT projects/NNS should/MD principally/RB be/VB aimed/VBN at/IN the/DT complete/JJ rehabilitation/NN of/IN people/NNS and/CC families/NNS ,/, because/IN man/NN is/VBZ not/RB made/VBN for/IN the/DT law/NN ,/, but/CC rather/RB law/NN is/VBZ made/VBN for/IN man/NN ./.

These/DT areas/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ cities/NNS are/VBP often/RB home/NN to/TO single-parent/JJ families/NNS ,/, elderly/JJ people/NNS who/WP receive/VBP a/DT pension/NN and/CC no/RB longer/RB carry/VBP out/RP productive/JJ activity/NN ,/, and/CC families/NNS facing/VBG difficulties/NNS ;/: sometimes/RB they/PRP are/VBP families/NNS which/WDT have/VBP broken/VBN down/RP and/CC which/WDT are/VBP excluded/VBN from/IN mainstream/NN society/NN ./.

These/DT people/NNS live/VBP in/IN areas/NNS which/WDT should/MD benefit/VB from/IN these/DT projects/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP have/VBP success/NN in/IN this/DT threefold/JJ sense/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN these/DT families/NNS ,/, these/DT people/NNS ,/, these/DT European/JJ citizens/NNS ,/, will/MD believe/VB more/JJR in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC this/DT seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO be/VB very/RB important/JJ because/IN ,/, ultimately/RB ,/, the/DT cities/NNS will/MD increasingly/RB come/VB to/TO play/VB a/DT leading/VBG role/NN in/IN European/JJ life/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP however/RB that/IN you/PRP will/MD all/RB recognise/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ comments/NNS ./.

Firstly/NNP on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT URBAN/NNP programme/NN and/CC the/DT maximum/JJ threshold/NN of/IN fifty/JJ towns/NNS ,/, which/WDT a/DT number/NN of/IN you/PRP termed/VBD arbitrary/JJ ./.

I/PRP can/MD understand/VB your/PRP$ concern/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ initial/JJ response/NN to/TO the/DT threshold/NN question/NN ./.

Regarding/VBG a/DT second/JJ matter/NN ,/, now/RB ,/, relating/VBZ to/TO the/DT additional/JJ criteria/NNS ,/, which/WDT should/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN in/IN selecting/VBG disadvantaged/JJ areas/NNS ./.

Third/JJ point/NN :/: specific/JJ measures/NNS in/IN favour/NN of/IN some/DT social/JJ groups/NNS -/: some/DT speakers/NNS mentioned/VBN them/PRP -/: women/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB immigrants/NNS and/CC refugees/NNS ,/, must/MD be/VB envisaged/JJ ./.

This/DT concern/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, lies/VBZ at/IN the/DT very/JJ heart/NN of/IN our/PRP$ URBAN/NNP initiative/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP willing/JJ to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT text/NN ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB this/DT message/NN clearer/JJR yet/RB ./.

Regarding/VBG URBAN/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO conclude/VB with/IN the/DT implementation/NN procedure/NN and/CC mention/VB ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT selection/NN procedure/NN ./.

Some/DT speakers/NNS wanted/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB less/RBR bureaucratic/JJ ,/, more/RBR transparent/JJ ,/, and/CC to/TO avoid/VB redundancy/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT projects/NNS and/CC funding/NN ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, on/IN this/DT point/NN we/PRP must/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ :/: in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, the/DT selection/NN of/IN zones/NNS or/CC municipalities/NNS eligible/JJ for/IN URBAN/NNP is/VBZ primarily/RB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO avoid/VB any/DT unjustified/JJ bureaucratic/JJ overload/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB give/VB up/RP the/DT practice/NN of/IN checking/VBG the/DT relevance/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN programmes/NNS ,/, indeed/RB you/PRP would/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ to/TO criticise/VB us/PRP if/IN we/PRP did/VBD ./.

A/DT second/JJ observation/NN ,/, the/DT time/NN limits/NNS for/IN the/DT submission/NN of/IN programmes/NNS and/CC the/DT possibility/NN of/IN submitting/VBG a/DT planning/VBG supplement/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT objection/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN of/IN submitting/VBG a/DT planning/NN supplement/NN jointly/RB with/IN the/DT main/JJ programme/NN ./.

This/DT can/MD not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, be/VB grounds/NNS for/IN an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ time/NN limit/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT time/NN limit/NN for/IN this/DT programme/NN is/VBZ six/CD months/NNS ./.

This/DT time/NN limit/NN ,/, which/WDT indeed/RB is/VBZ identical/JJ to/TO the/DT one/NN we/PRP granted/VBD for/IN INTERREG/NNP and/CC for/IN the/DT Objective/JJ 2/CD DOCUPs/NNS ,/, should/MD normally/RB be/VB adequate/JJ ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP ,/, for/IN drawing/VBG up/RP a/DT programme/NN ,/, which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT projects/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB defined/VBN at/IN a/DT later/JJ stage/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO URBAN/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO conclude/VB with/IN a/DT final/JJ observation/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN you/PRP expressed/VBD a/DT wish/NN that/IN these/DT urban/JJ issues/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB confined/VBN to/TO the/DT URBAN/NNP initiative/NN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP completely/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB forgetting/VBG ,/, and/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB forget/VB ,/, that/IN 80/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP today/NN live/VBP in/IN towns/NNS and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB this/DT URBAN/NNP instrument/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ ./.

Let/VB me/PRP repeat/VB what/WP I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP shall/MD be/VB most/RBS attentive/JJ to/TO the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN urban/JJ issues/NNS in/IN all/DT structural/JJ fund/NN programming/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD now/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, like/VB to/TO bring/VB up/RP the/DT subject/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP and/CC to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Francis/NNP Decourri脙拧re/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN that/IN I/PRP thanked/VBD Arlene/NNP McCarthy/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT quality/NN and/CC relevance/NN of/IN his/PRP$ work/NN ./.

Having/VBG made/VBN these/DT general/JJ observations/NNS ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN your/PRP$ main/JJ comments/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO INTERREG/NNP ./.

The/DT first/JJ relate/VBP to/TO the/DT timetable/NN and/CC the/DT content/NN of/IN this/DT initiative/NN ./.

You/PRP comment/NN that/IN these/DT guidelines/NNS were/VBD adopted/VBN at/IN too/RB late/JJ a/DT date/NN ,/, stressing/VBG ,/, particularly/RB your/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ,/, the/DT risk/NN that/IN the/DT previous/JJ programmes/NNS will/MD be/VB interrupted/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, I/PRP admit/VBP it/PRP ,/, and/CC you/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT delay/NN in/IN adopting/VBG the/DT INTERREG/NNP guidelines/NNS in/IN March/NNP or/CC April/NNP 2000/CD ./.

I/PRP accept/VBP this/DT ;/: I/PRP take/VBP note/NN of/IN it/PRP as/IN you/PRP do/VBP ./.

I/PRP note/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT regions/NNS are/VBP already/RB actively/RB preparing/VBG the/DT programmes/NNS for/IN INTERREG/NNP III/NNP and/CC indeed/RB the/DT guidance/NN project/NN was/VBD distributed/VBN over/RP three/CD months/NNS ago/RB now/RB ./.

I/PRP also/RB note/VBP that/IN eligibility/NN for/IN expenditure/NN shall/MD be/VB accepted/VBN from/IN the/DT date/NN that/IN programmes/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN and/CC I/PRP can/MD confirm/VB the/DT possibility/NN that/IN they/PRP may/MD be/VB available/JJ retroactively/RB back/RB to/TO 1/CD January/NNP ,/, if/IN the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN before/IN 30/CD April/NNP ./.

So/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT first/JJ comment/NN ./.

Third/JJ point/NN :/: interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, the/DT importance/NN of/IN strand/JJ C/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP shares/VBZ the/DT observations/NNS made/VBN by/IN this/DT House/NNP regarding/VBG the/DT importance/NN of/IN strand/JJ C/NNP ,/, interregional/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

As/IN your/PRP$ rapporteur/NN has/VBZ requested/VBN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD send/VB you/PRP the/DT detailed/JJ information/NN regarding/VBG the/DT system/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN this/DT strand/NN ./.

Fourth/JJ observation/NN :/: the/DT European/JJ Observatory/NN and/CC the/DT possible/JJ use/NN of/IN a/DT technical/JJ assistance/NN office/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP requested/VBD ,/, I/PRP have/VBP decided/VBN to/TO remove/VB all/DT references/NNS to/TO the/DT use/NN of/IN a/DT technical/JJ assistance/NN office/NN in/IN the/DT text/NN until/IN the/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN in/IN progress/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN the/DT service/NN outsourcing/VBG systems/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB intend/VBP to/TO amend/VB the/DT guidelines/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO incorporate/VB a/DT specific/JJ priority/NN into/IN the/DT transnational/JJ strand/JJ B/NN :/: `/`` integrated/JJ cooperation/NN of/IN maritime/NN and/CC island/NN regions/NNS '/'' ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO cover/VB ,/, in/IN what/WP I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ an/DT appropriate/JJ fashion/NN the/DT various/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN cooperation/NN between/IN these/DT regions/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP decided/VBN ,/, in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT most/RBS remote/JJ regions/NNS ,/, to/TO which/WDT I/PRP attach/VBP particular/JJ importance/NN ,/, will/MD be/VB given/VBN special/JJ priority/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT transnational/JJ strand/NN of/IN INTERREG/NNP ,/, with/IN a/DT cooperation/NN strategy/NN which/WDT will/MD aim/VB at/IN improving/VBG their/PRP$ links/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ neighbours/NNS and/CC other/JJ Member/NNP State/NN regions/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB wish/VBP to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ concern/NN to/TO ensure/VB good/JJ cooperation/NN between/IN INTERREG/NNP and/CC the/DT EDF/NNP ,/, particularly/RB for/IN the/DT Caribbean/NNP and/CC the/DT Indian/NNP Ocean/NNP ./.

All/PDT this/DT should/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ for/IN us/PRP ,/, apart/RB from/IN the/DT Objective/JJ 1/CD appropriations/NNS and/CC also/RB with/IN them/PRP ,/, to/TO confirm/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN `/`` active/JJ frontier/NN '/'' of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Another/DT point/NN :/: the/DT coordination/NN between/IN INTERREG/NNP ,/, PHARE/NNP ,/, TACIS/NNP and/CC MEDA/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP accept/VBP this/DT objectively/RB ,/, that/IN there/EX are/VBP still/RB real/JJ legal/JJ problems/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO minimise/VB these/DT ,/, but/CC progress/NN is/VBZ being/VBG made/VBN as/RB far/RB as/IN strand/VBD A/DT cooperation/NN with/IN candidate/NN countries/NNS is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, even/RB if/IN the/DT problems/NNS related/VBN to/TO the/DT management/NN procedures/NNS and/CC to/TO the/DT scale/NN of/IN the/DT projects/NNS still/RB remain/VBP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD continue/VB along/RP these/DT lines/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP making/VBG a/DT personal/JJ commitment/NN to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

An/DT initial/JJ joint/JJ PHARE/CIP/NN committee/NN is/VBZ to/TO meet/VB in/IN February/NNP to/TO assess/VB this/DT coordination/NN ,/, and/CC let/VB me/PRP confirm/VB my/PRP$ attentiveness/NNS and/CC availability/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT ,/, together/RB with/IN my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS and/CC fellow/JJ Commissioners/NNPS Verheugen/NNP ,/, Patten/NNP and/CC Poul/NNP Nielson/NNP ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT general/JJ regulations/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, any/DT technical/JJ assistance/NN scheme/NN which/WDT can/MD claim/VB a/DT connection/NN with/IN a/DT Community/NNP initiative/NN must/MD be/VB proposed/VBN under/IN Article/NNP 20/CD ,/, and/CC not/RB Article/NNP 23/CD ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT ceiling/NN of/IN 0.25/CD %/NN mentioned/VBN in/IN Article/NNP 23/CD does/VBZ not/RB apply/VB with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT type/NN of/IN technical/JJ assistance/NN ./.

I/PRP attach/VBP great/JJ importance/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT spirit/NN of/IN discipline/NN and/CC transparency/NN ,/, to/TO our/PRP$ nonetheless/NN retaining/VBG some/DT financial/JJ strands/NNS for/IN matters/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT exchange/NN of/IN experience/NN and/CC information/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB to/TO propaganda/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO the/DT implementation/NN of/IN networks/NNS ensuring/VBG good/JJ communication/NN of/IN best/JJS practice/NN within/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ conclusion/NN regarding/VBG INTERREG/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, is/VBZ that/IN these/DT Community/NNP initiatives/NNS for/IN which/WDT I/PRP am/VBP responsible/JJ fulfil/VBP a/DT real/JJ need/NN and/CC everything/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN is/VBZ proof/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

They/PRP also/RB foreshadow/VBD a/DT real/JJ European/JJ regional/JJ planning/NN policy/NN within/IN our/PRP$ enlarged/JJ Union/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP attaches/VBZ the/DT greatest/JJS importance/NN to/TO this/DT ,/, just/RB as/IN you/PRP yourselves/VBZ do/VB ./.

I/PRP remain/VBP at/IN your/PRP$ service/NN in/IN order/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT time/NN comes/VBZ ,/, to/TO present/VB the/DT report/NN of/IN previous/JJ planning/NN which/WDT you/PRP request/VBP ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO keep/VB you/PRP informed/JJ regularly/RB as/RB to/TO the/DT implementation/NN of/IN these/DT initiatives/NNS in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ planning/NN ./.

So/IN we/PRP are/VBP working/VBG within/IN this/DT framework/NN and/CC not/RB outside/IN it/PRP ./.

On/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN these/DT two/CD initiatives/NNS ,/, then/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT light/NN they/PRP cast/VBD on/IN future/NN strategic/JJ and/CC political/JJ thinking/NN regarding/VBG regional/JJ planning/NN and/CC on/IN future/JJ financial/JJ perspectives/NNS ,/, let/VBD me/PRP express/VBP our/PRP$ great/JJ interest/NN in/IN this/DT constructive/JJ dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ committees/NNS ./.

Everything/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP just/RB said/VBN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, demonstrates/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ resolved/VBN to/TO taken/VBN the/DT views/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP into/IN account/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB firstly/RB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Procacci/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO extend/VB thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT various/JJ committees/NNS involved/JJ and/CC Parliament/JJ as/IN a/DT whole/NN for/IN the/DT broad/JJ support/NN which/WDT they/PRP have/VBP given/VBN the/DT LEADER/JJ +/JJ initiative/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT job/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Strategy/NN for/IN Employment/NNP and/CC the/DT Social/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, which/WDT have/VBP huge/JJ sums/NNS of/IN money/NN and/CC exceptionally/RB large/JJ resources/NNS at/IN their/PRP$ disposal/NN ,/, especially/RB for/IN countries/NNS like/IN Greece/NNP ./.

The/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN has/VBZ a/DT specific/JJ mission/NN ./.

To/TO encourage/VB ,/, to/TO assist/VB promotion/NN ,/, to/TO create/VB statistics/NNS ,/, to/TO create/VB studies/NNS and/CC agencies/NNS to/TO support/VB those/DT sections/NNS of/IN the/DT population/NN which/WDT suffer/VBP discrimination/NN ./.

So/CC what/WP we/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN is/VBZ cooperation/NN between/IN local/JJ groups/NNS ,/, between/IN local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC between/IN countries/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO exchange/NN experiences/NNS ;/: that/WDT is/VBZ mainly/RB what/WP we/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN ,/, and/CC for/IN experience/NN to/TO be/VB transferred/VBN from/IN one/CD country/NN to/TO another/DT so/RB that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB emulated/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT philosophy/NN behind/IN the/DT initiative/NN ;/: the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ commensurate/JJ with/IN it/PRP and/CC our/PRP$ aim/NN is/VBZ for/IN development/NN agencies/NNS ,/, non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO be/VB involved/VBN as/RB much/RB as/IN possible/JJ ,/, so/RB that/IN it/PRP can/MD get/VB as/RB close/RB to/TO the/DT people/NNS as/RB possible/JJ ./.

Question/NNP No/VBD 40/CD by/IN -LRB-/-LRB- H-0808/NNP //CD 99/CD -RRB-/-RRB- :/: ./.

Subject/NNP :/: Article/NNP 13/CD TEU/NNP and/CC Employment/NNP The/DT draft/NN Commission/NNP Directive/NNP establishing/VBG a/DT general/JJ framework/NN for/IN equal/JJ treatment/NN in/IN employment/NN and/CC occupation/NN gives/VBZ exemption/NN to/TO religious/JJ organisations/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- Art./CD 4.2/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Could/MD the/DT Commission/NNP please/NNP tell/VB Parliament/NNP the/DT circumstances/NNS and/CC the/DT groups/NNS within/IN Article/NNP 13/CD -LRB-/-LRB- TEU/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- likely/JJ to/TO be/VB effected/VBN by/IN such/PDT an/DT exemption/NN ?/.

A/DT month/NN ago/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP submitted/VBD a/DT proposal/NN on/IN equal/JJ treatment/NN in/IN employment/NN ,/, as/RB prescribed/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO implement/VB Article/NNP 13/CD ./.

The/DT ban/NN on/IN discrimination/NN is/VBZ the/DT rule/NN in/IN the/DT package/NN of/IN directives/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS which/WDT we/PRP submitted/VBD ./.

At/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ proposal/NN and/CC after/IN approximately/RB two/CD years/NNS of/IN consultation/NN with/IN social/JJ agencies/NNS ,/, Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN exceptions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN ./.

These/DT exceptions/NNS relate/VBP to/TO professions/NNS which/WDT must/MD be/VB exercised/VBN by/IN persons/NNS with/IN a/DT genuine/JJ professional/JJ qualification/NN ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO give/VB you/PRP a/DT specific/JJ example/NN to/TO illustrate/VB this/DT ./.

In/IN a/DT religious/JJ school/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ logical/JJ for/IN an/DT exemption/NN to/TO be/VB requested/VBN and/CC accepted/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT teacher/NN is/VBZ of/IN the/DT faith/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT religious/JJ school/NN in/IN question/NN belongs/VBZ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT sort/NN of/IN exemption/NN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

Clearly/RB this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT general/JJ exemption/NN and/CC the/DT different/JJ approach/NN which/WDT allow/VBP Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO introduce/VB special/JJ provisions/NNS are/VBP only/RB justified/VBN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN this/DT special/JJ professional/JJ qualification/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT perverse/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN ending/VBG discrimination/NN ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, religious/JJ schools/NNS could/MD quite/RB properly/RB say/VB to/TO a/DT Roman/NNP Catholic/NNP for/IN example/NN :/: we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO employ/VB you/PRP because/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT gay/JJ man/NN or/CC because/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT lesbian/NN ./.

Here/RB we/PRP have/VBP from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT reinforcement/NN of/IN a/DT hierarchy/NN of/IN oppression/VBG ./.

Surely/RB what/WP we/PRP should/MD be/VB doing/VBG ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP you/PRP will/MD agree/VB ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, is/VBZ engaging/VBG the/DT person/NN to/TO do/VB the/DT job/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN their/PRP$ capability/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP should/MD not/RB enshrine/VB such/JJ bigotry/NN and/CC prejudice/NN ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB sincerely/RB held/VBN ./.

I/PRP must/MD stress/VB that/IN this/DT exemption/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT refusal/NN of/IN work/NN for/IN any/DT reason/NN ,/, be/VB it/PRP the/DT reason/NN which/WDT you/PRP mentioned/VBD ,/, sexual/JJ orientation/NN ,/, ethnic/JJ discrimination/NN or/CC any/DT other/JJ reason/NN ./.

It/PRP allows/VBZ a/DT choice/NN to/TO be/VB made/VBN only/RB where/WRB special/JJ qualifications/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN which/WDT relate/VBP directly/RB to/TO the/DT activity/NN in/IN question/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ positive/JJ discrimination/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT example/NN which/WDT you/PRP mentioned/VBD ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB logical/JJ that/IN the/DT teacher/NN in/IN a/DT Catholic/JJ school/NN should/MD be/VB Catholic/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ form/NN of/IN exemption/NN which/WDT is/VBZ acceptable/JJ ./.

Question/NNP No/NNP 41/VBZ by/IN -LRB-/-LRB- H-0813/NNP //CD 99/CD -RRB-/-RRB- :/: ./.

Does/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP intend/VB to/TO put/VB forward/RP lowest/JJS common/JJ denominator/JJ policies/NNS which/WDT will/MD properly/RB reflect/VB the/DT admittedly/RB extreme/JJ but/CC nonetheless/RB real-life/JJ situation/NN of/IN these/DT women/NNS ,/, or/CC will/MD their/PRP$ plight/NN once/RB again/RB be/VB overlooked/VBN by/IN the/DT new/JJ employment/NN policies/NNS ?/.

Obviously/RB ,/, the/DT cohesion/NN policy/NN exists/VBZ for/IN less-favoured/JJ regions/NNS and/CC cooperation/NN and/CC joint/JJ action/NN by/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, the/DT Social/NNP Fund/NNP and/CC the/DT Agricultural/NNP Fund/NNP exist/VBP for/IN the/DT cohesion/NN policy/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT funds/NNS available/JJ for/IN regions/NNS with/IN problems/NNS account/VBP for/IN one/CD third/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ budget/NN ./.

The/DT aim/NN of/IN these/DT regional/JJ policies/NNS ,/, which/WDT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, are/VBP implemented/VBN under/IN the/DT jointly/RB agreed/VBN European/JJ guidelines/NNS in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, i.e./VBN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN implementing/VBG this/DT programme/NN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO increase/VB opportunities/NNS for/IN work/NN for/IN both/DT men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN 70/CD %/NN of/IN funding/NN for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2006/CD ,/, i.e./VBG EUR/$ 195/CD billion/CD ,/, will/MD go/VB to/TO the/DT less-favoured/JJ regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT LEADER/JJ initiative/NN currently/RB being/VBG studied/VBN gives/VBZ special/JJ priority/NN to/TO development/NN strategies/NNS which/WDT aim/VBP to/TO give/VB special/JJ support/NN to/TO women/NNS in/IN small/JJ enterprises/NNS in/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN and/CC in/IN rural/JJ tourism/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO increasing/VBG the/DT involvement/NN of/IN women/NNS in/IN agricultural/JJ regions/NNS ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, thank/VB you/PRP for/IN giving/VBG me/PRP a/DT well-intentioned/JJ answer/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN rigorous/JJ and/CC well-argued/JJ ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO complete/VB the/DT programme/NN and/CC be/VB able/JJ to/TO present/VB it/PRP ,/, we/PRP first/RB need/VBP to/TO complete/VB our/PRP$ consultations/NNS with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT social/JJ partners/NNS and/CC non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ./.

These/DT discussions/NNS have/VBP already/RB started/VBN ,/, but/CC we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT results/NNS in/IN Lisbon/NNP ./.

On/IN 26/CD November/NNP 1999/CD ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP approved/VBD a/DT package/NN of/IN measures/NNS to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT package/NN in/IN question/NN and/CC people/NNS with/IN special/JJ needs/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT directive/NN which/WDT concentrates/VBZ on/IN combating/VBG discrimination/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT workplace/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN this/DT initiative/NN to/TO combat/VB discrimination/NN will/MD help/VB to/TO increase/VB the/DT level/NN of/IN employment/NN of/IN people/NNS with/IN special/JJ needs/NNS and/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, to/TO promote/VB the/DT freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN of/IN these/DT persons/NNS ./.

I/PRP referred/VBD to/TO the/DT directive/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN on/IN compulsory/JJ arrangements/NNS for/IN means/NNS of/IN public/JJ transport/NN ,/, so/CC that/IN people/NNS with/IN special/JJ needs/NNS can/MD use/VB them/PRP ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN passed/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ at/IN the/DT consultation/NN stage/NN ./.

The/DT draft/NN legislation/NN before/IN the/DT Folketing/NNP does/VBZ not/RB contain/VB any/DT rules/NNS governing/VBG rights/NNS of/IN employed/JJ persons/NNS under/IN collective/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

Pursuant/VB to/TO Article/NNP 3/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 8/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Directive/NNP ,/, terms/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS of/IN employment/NN must/MD be/VB in/IN keeping/VBG with/IN the/DT `/`` collective/JJ agreements/NN which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN concluded/VBN by/IN the/DT most/JJS representative/NN employers/NNS '/'' and/CC labour/NN organisations/NNS at/IN national/JJ level/NN and/CC which/WDT are/VBP applied/VBN throughout/IN national/JJ territory/NN '/'' ./.

Can/MD the/DT Commission/NNP confirm/VB that/IN the/DT Directive/NN concerning/VBG the/DT posting/NN of/IN workers/NNS is/VBZ inapplicable/JJ in/IN Denmark/NNP as/RB far/RB as/IN `/`` collective/JJ agreements/NNS .../: declared/VBD universally/RB applicable/JJ '/'' -LRB-/-LRB- cf./NNP Article/NNP 3/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- -RRB-/-RRB- are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, given/VBN that/IN such/JJ universally/RB applicable/JJ agreements/NNS do/VBP not/RB exist/VB under/IN Danish/JJ law/NN ?/.

If/IN not/RB ,/, will/MD it/PRP explain/VB how/WRB the/DT Directive/NNP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB complied/VBN with/IN in/IN this/DT area/NN ?/.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP posting/VBG of/IN workers/NNS directive/NN stipulates/VBZ that/IN the/DT compulsory/JJ rules/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT terms/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS of/IN employment/NN applicable/JJ in/IN the/DT host/NN country/NN must/MD also/RB apply/VB to/TO workers/NNS posted/VBN to/TO that/DT country/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, to/TO put/VB it/PRP simply/RB ,/, Denmark/NNP has/VBZ a/DT choice/NN :/: it/PRP can/MD either/RB introduce/VB legislation/NN or/CC it/PRP can/MD use/VB the/DT legislative/JJ process/NN to/TO choose/VB a/DT collective/JJ agreement/NN and/CC legally/RB activate/VBP it/PRP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN a/DT very/RB clear/JJ answer/NN ,/, the/DT gist/NN of/IN which/WDT -/: if/IN the/DT interpretation/NN is/VBZ correct/JJ -/: is/VBZ that/IN the/DT posting/NN of/IN workers/NNS directive/NN entails/VBZ an/DT obligation/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Danish/JJ state/NN to/TO establish/VB a/DT system/NN of/IN universally/RB applicable/JJ agreements/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, no/DT attempt/NN is/VBZ being/VBG made/VBN to/TO change/VB the/DT system/NN in/IN Denmark/NNP or/CC in/IN any/DT other/JJ country/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD earlier/RBR ,/, there/EX are/VBP always/RB problems/NNS interpreting/VBG the/DT directives/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP both/CC because/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB general/JJ framework/NN and/CC because/IN systems/NNS are/VBP very/RB different/JJ from/IN one/CD country/NN to/TO another/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN Mrs/NNP Schreyer/NNP must/MD have/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ reason/NN for/IN not/RB being/VBG here/RB because/IN her/PRP$ absence/NN would/MD be/VB inexcusable/JJ otherwise/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, early/RB last/JJ year/NN ,/, the/DT 1997/CD discharge/NN was/VBD postponed/VBN because/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP could/MD not/RB possibly/RB grant/VB discharge/NN to/TO a/DT resigning/NNP Commission/NNP which/WDT could/MD not/RB enter/VB into/IN any/DT commitments/NNS for/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ opportunity/NN for/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP to/TO introduce/VB far-reaching/JJ reforms/NNS to/TO these/DT plans/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT period/NN leading/VBG up/RP to/TO this/DT ,/, it/PRP already/RB appeared/VBD ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT initial/JJ drafts/NNS ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP had/VBD made/VBN very/RB important/JJ pledges/NNS ./.

We/PRP asked/VBD for/IN a/DT whistle-blower/NN '/POS s/JJ regulation/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ now/RB in/IN place/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP wanted/VBD financial/JJ inspection/NN and/CC audit/NN functions/NNS to/TO be/VB separated/JJ ./.

This/DT has/VBZ now/RB been/VBN done/VBN ./.

Parliament/NNP requires/VBZ a/DT code/NN of/IN conduct/NN for/IN Commissioners/NNPS and/CC Cabinets/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ in/IN place/NN too/RB ./.

Parliament/NNP asked/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO waive/VB its/PRP$ excessive/JJ privileges/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ also/RB entered/VBN into/IN commitments/NNS to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN SEM/NNP 2000/CD ./.

Fundamental/JJ changes/NNS will/MD also/RB be/VB considered/VBN for/IN the/DT technical/JJ assistance/NN offices/NNS ./.

We/PRP want/VBP more/RBR than/IN that/DT ,/, however/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP should/MD now/RB produce/VB an/DT ambitious/JJ and/CC far-reaching/JJ reform/NN programme/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB only/RB necessary/JJ for/IN proper/JJ public/JJ administration/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT conditio/JJ sine/JJ qua/NN non/NN of/IN regaining/VBG the/DT trust/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ citizen/NN ./.

We/PRP now/RB demand/VBP from/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP clear/JJ pledges/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT following/VBG points/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP must/MD have/VB complete/JJ access/NN to/TO all/DT Commission/NNP documents/NNS ./.

This/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, presupposes/VBZ that/IN we/PRP set/VBD up/RP an/DT internal/JJ scheme/NN quickly/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO guarantee/VB the/DT confidentiality/NN of/IN sensitive/JJ documents/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN providing/VBG information/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO draw/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP very/RB concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT present/JJ draft/NN plans/NNS on/IN public/JJ access/NN to/TO documents/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT current/JJ draft/NN is/VBZ correct/JJ ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ step/NN backwards/RB in/IN comparison/NN to/TO today/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT financially/RB powerful/JJ organisations/NNS with/IN representation/NN in/IN Brussels/NNP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO access/NN information/NN whilst/IN the/DT ordinary/JJ citizen/NN is/VBZ not/RB ./.

Neither/DT can/MD we/PRP tolerate/VB a/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT a/DT public/JJ body/NN holds/VBZ the/DT copyright/NN to/TO public/JJ documents/NNS ./.

We/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB a/DT clear/JJ job/NN description/NN for/IN each/DT European/JJ official/NN so/RB that/IN an/DT official/NN with/IN conscientious/JJ objections/NNS can/MD more/RBR easily/RB object/VB to/TO tasks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP unethical/JJ or/CC unlawful/JJ ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB the/DT case/NN that/IN ,/, if/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS detects/VBZ a/DT mistake/NN not/RB just/RB one/CD year/NN but/CC two/CD years/NNS running/VBG ,/, the/DT management/NN should/MD be/VB held/VBN responsible/JJ for/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC this/DT will/MD have/VB an/DT effect/NN on/IN chances/NNS of/IN promotion/NN ./.

Ultimately/RB ,/, we/PRP also/RB need/VBP to/TO achieve/VB better/JJR cooperation/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, between/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Auditors/NNS and/CC its/PRP$ national/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ also/RB asked/VBN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO give/VB an/DT initial/JJ outline/NN of/IN the/DT external/JJ aid/NN policy/NN reforms/NNS on/IN 31/CD March/NNP of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN that/IN ,/, although/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ an/DT economic/JJ power/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP no/DT political/JJ influence/NN because/IN ,/, when/WRB the/DT chips/NNS are/VBP down/RP ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB offer/VB effective/JJ aid/NN to/TO areas/NNS which/WDT desperately/RB need/VBP it/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD quote/VB Gaza/NNP as/IN an/DT example/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP completed/VBD the/DT construction/NN of/IN a/DT hospital/NN in/IN 1996/CD and/CC that/IN ,/, as/IN yet/RB ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN left/VBN unused/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, since/IN 1996/CD ,/, the/DT discharge/NN has/VBZ acquired/VBN a/DT heavy/JJ ,/, political/JJ significance/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS powerful/JJ weapons/NNS Parliament/NNP has/VBZ and/CC must/MD therefore/RB be/VB deployed/VBN with/IN care/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP will/MD most/RBS probably/RB grant/VB the/DT discharge/NN tomorrow/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB surrendering/VBG this/DT weapon/NN without/IN placing/VBG a/DT time/NN bomb/NN in/IN its/PRP$ place/NN ./.

Firstly/RB there/EX is/VBZ the/DT question/NN as/IN to/TO what/WP this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ actually/RB designed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB ,/, that/DT is/VBZ achieve/VB in/IN the/DT real/JJ sense/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO take/VB the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC also/RB of/IN the/DT individual/NN into/IN account/NN ./.

My/PRP$ comments/NNS start/VBP from/IN the/DT premise/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN an/DT upright/JJ individual/NN in/IN gainful/JJ employment/NN ./.

Then/RB there/EX are/VBP the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, which/WDT ,/, being/VBG on/IN the/DT receiving/NN end/NN ,/, may/MD have/VB to/TO start/VB from/IN the/DT premise/NN of/IN a/DT worst/JJS case/NN scenario/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO abide/VB by/IN the/DT one/CD extreme/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, then/RB we/PRP certainly/RB have/VBP every/DT reason/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT hurdles/NNS that/WDT have/VBP to/TO be/VB cleared/VBN in/IN applying/VBG for/IN this/DT card/NN relatively/RB high/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB an/DT argument/NN for/IN introducing/VBG early/JJ notification/NN obligations/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN having/VBG this/DT card/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP were/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT other/JJ extreme/NN ,/, as/IN few/JJ hurdles/NNS as/RB possible/JJ that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, then/RB I/PRP would/MD run/VB the/DT risk/NN of/IN failing/VBG to/TO produce/VB any/DT legislation/NN whatsoever/RB in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN this/DT procedure/NN because/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS would/MD not/RB sign/VB up/RP to/TO this/DT directive/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB end/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB a/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN might/MD well/RB be/VB in/IN place/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN the/DT hurdles/NNS facing/VBG the/DT business/NN world/NN being/VBG so/RB high/JJ ,/, in/IN reality/NN no/DT one/NN would/MD apply/VB for/IN the/DT card/NN ./.

Alternatively/RB ,/, I/PRP might/MD have/VB no/DT directive/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

Neither/DT outcome/NN would/MD be/VB satisfactory/JJ ./.

Perhaps/RB this/DT is/VBZ also/RB why/WRB ,/, as/IN is/VBZ rumoured/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ become/VBN bogged/VBD down/IN in/IN its/PRP$ negotiations/NNS on/IN this/DT as/RB well/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN trying/VBG to/TO reach/VB a/DT happy/JJ compromise/NN between/IN one/CD interest/NN -/: that/DT of/IN public/JJ order/NN -/: and/CC the/DT other/JJ ,/, that/DT of/IN finding/VBG the/DT easiest/JJS possible/JJ solution/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO arrive/VB at/IN a/DT solution/NN where/WRB certain/JJ hurdles/NNS are/VBP created/VBN vis-脙/JJ -/: vis/VBG the/DT business/NN world/NN ,/, but/CC once/IN these/DT have/VBP been/VBN overcome/VBN ,/, implementation/NN is/VBZ as/RB easy/JJ as/IN it/PRP possibly/RB could/MD be/VB ./.

Therefore/RB we/PRP want/VBP applications/NNS for/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN to/TO be/VB for/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR Member/JJ States/NNPS ./.

If/IN a/DT company/NN in/IN France/NNP says/VBZ that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ an/DT employee/NN who/WP has/VBZ to/TO work/VB in/IN Denmark/NNP on/IN a/DT permanent/JJ basis/NN ,/, and/CC only/RB in/IN Denmark/NNP ,/, then/RB it/PRP certainly/RB ought/MD only/RB to/TO be/VB possible/JJ to/TO apply/VB for/IN this/DT card/NN for/IN Denmark/NNP ./.

Accordingly/RB ,/, the/DT bureaucratic/JJ hurdles/NNS that/WDT have/VBP to/TO be/VB overcome/VBN would/MD be/VB lower/JJR in/IN this/DT instance/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, I/PRP too/RB have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ./.

Perhaps/RB there/EX was/VBD a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN residual/JJ misunderstanding/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO achieve/VB a/DT completely/RB flexible/JJ solution/NN ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP just/RB to/TO go/VB very/RB briefly/NN into/IN a/DT second/JJ matter/NN ./.

Most/JJS of/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP been/VBN working/VBG on/IN the/DT directive/NN to/TO date/NN have/VBP been/VBN lawyers/NNS ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP still/RB various/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, some/DT of/IN them/PRP very/RB old/JJ ,/, which/WDT are/VBP still/RB referred/VBN to/TO as/IN EC/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ that/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ founded/VBN on/IN EC/NNP law/NN and/CC not/RB on/IN EU/NNP law/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, before/IN the/DT elections/NNS we/PRP -/: the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT press/NN ,/, unions/NNS and/CC companies/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ -/: worked/VBD towards/IN making/VBG the/DT Europe/NNP we/PRP have/VBP today/NN more/RBR comprehensible/JJ to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP expected/VBN the/DT citizens/NNS to/TO take/VB on/IN board/NN the/DT transition/NN from/IN EEC/NNP to/TO EC/NNP to/TO EU/NNP ./.

They/PRP have/VBP now/RB got/VBN to/TO grips/NNS with/IN ``/`` EU/NNP ''/'' ./.

We/PRP would/MD be/VB doing/VBG neither/CC ourselves/PRP nor/CC the/DT citizens/NNS any/DT favours/NNS if/IN we/PRP were/VBD to/TO christen/VB the/DT product/NN we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG to/TO deliver/VB ``/`` EC/NNP service/NN provision/NN card/NN ''/'' and/CC not/RB ``/`` EU/VB service/NN provision/NN card/NN ''/'' ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT world/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP that/IN the/DT citizens/NNS are/VBP interested/JJ in/IN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT one/NN that/WDT counts/VBZ in/IN their/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD urge/VB the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO move/VB in/IN this/DT direction/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP it/PRP is/VBZ later/RB than/IN any/DT of/IN us/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD planning/VBG for/IN this/DT session/NN so/IN I/PRP shall/MD be/VB very/RB brief/JJ indeed/RB ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP late/JJ is/VBZ because/IN we/PRP spent/VBD time/NN earlier/RB today/NN rightly/RB stating/VBG the/DT rooted/JJ opposition/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP to/TO any/DT form/NN of/IN xenophobia/NN or/CC racism/NN ./.

This/DT directive/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, not/RB in/IN itself/PRP directly/RB about/IN that/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN attending/VBG to/TO the/DT needs/NNS of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, creating/VBG flexibility/NN and/CC behaving/VBG in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ way/NN to/TO enable/VB the/DT employment/NN of/IN third/JJ country/NN persons/NNS both/DT as/IN employees/NNS and/CC self-employed/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ in/IN itself/PRP also/RB about/IN avoiding/VBG being/VBG unduly/RB restrictive/JJ towards/IN the/DT stranger/NN simply/RB because/IN he/PRP or/CC she/PRP is/VBZ a/DT stranger/NN ./.

We/PRP welcome/VBP that/DT ,/, and/CC because/IN we/PRP think/VBP it/PRP makes/VBZ a/DT sensible/JJ and/CC proper/JJ provision/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD support/VB the/DT most/RBS liberal/JJ version/NN which/WDT we/PRP understand/VBP to/TO be/VB consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT law/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO highlight/VB the/DT excellent/JJ work/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN Mrs/NNP Berger/NNP and/CC the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP generally/RB ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ incorporated/VBN innovative/JJ ideas/NNS into/IN this/DT directive/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP hope/VBP will/MD be/VB approved/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP tabled/VBN an/DT amendment/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Berger/NNP ,/, in/IN your/PRP$ Amendment/NN No/RB 2/CD to/TO Recital/NNP 6/CD ,/, you/PRP mention/VBP legal/JJ security/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ point/NN on/IN which/WDT we/PRP disagree/VBP is/VBZ the/DT duration/NN of/IN three/CD months/NNS for/IN the/DT residency/JJ permit/NN ,/, since/IN all/DT that/WDT does/VBZ is/VBZ create/VB legal/JJ insecurity/NN ./.

You/PRP rightly/RB raise/VB the/DT concern/NN ,/, also/RB expressed/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Wieland/NNP ,/, at/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN workers/NNS disappearing/VBG into/IN thin/JJ air/NN when/WRB their/PRP$ work/NN permits/NNS expire/VBP ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP would/MD be/VB making/VBG this/DT even/RB more/RBR likely/JJ by/IN bringing/VBG in/IN a/DT three/CD month/NN permit/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT validity/NN of/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN expires/VBZ on/IN a/DT certain/JJ date/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD end/VB on/IN that/DT date/NN ./.

Legal/JJ security/NN requires/VBZ this/DT ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, with/IN regard/VBP to/TO point/VB d/SYM of/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 10/CD ,/, which/WDT refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT first/JJ directive/NN ,/, you/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN ,/, for/IN reasons/NNS of/IN public/JJ security/NN or/CC public/JJ order/NN regulations/NNS ,/, a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP may/MD reject/VB the/DT validity/NN of/IN the/DT card/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP already/RB some/DT ex/FW ante/FW controls/FW laid/VBN down/RP in/IN article/NN 4/CD of/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

It/PRP makes/VBZ no/DT sense/NN for/IN any/DT worker/NN within/IN the/DT Schengen/NNP area/NN ,/, since/IN he/PRP or/CC she/PRP will/MD already/RB have/VB undergone/VBN a/DT screening/NN process/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO enter/VB the/DT first/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT second/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP would/MD be/VB justified/VBN in/IN rejecting/VBG ex/FW ante/FW the/DT entry/NN of/IN that/DT worker/NN into/IN its/PRP$ territory/NN ./.

It/PRP therefore/RB makes/VBZ no/DT sense/NN to/TO maintain/VB that/DT legal/JJ insecurity/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN a/DT non-Schengen/JJ state/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT last/JJ paragraph/NN of/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 22/CD ,/, that/DT possibility/NN is/VBZ contemplated/VBN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ perfectly/RB expressed/VBN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT provides/VBZ greater/JJR legal/JJ security/NN ./.

The/DT discretional/JJ power/NN of/IN the/DT State/NNP ,/, which/WDT you/PRP propose/VBP in/IN point/NN e/NNS of/IN your/PRP$ Amendment/NN No/RB 10/CD ,/, seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO be/VB inconsistent/JJ with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN your/PRP$ excellent/JJ report/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB ask/VB Members/NNS to/TO examine/VB my/PRP$ amendment/NN carefully/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN tomorrow/NN we/PRP will/MD achieve/VB a/DT result/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN it/PRP these/DT two/CD proposals/NNS appear/VBP to/TO be/VB implementing/VBG certain/JJ procedural/JJ changes/NNS to/TO facilitate/VB freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN across/IN Europe/NNP and/CC to/TO give/VB effect/NN to/TO the/DT recent/JJ court/NN cases/NNS Mrs/NNP Berger/NNP referred/VBN to/TO in/IN her/PRP$ opening/NN remarks/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP they/PRP go/VB further/RBR than/IN that/DT in/IN a/DT manner/NN which/WDT is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ ./.

Partly/RB this/DT is/VBZ substance/NN and/CC partly/RB it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN respect/NN of/IN the/DT legal/JJ base/NN in/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT special/JJ position/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

Under/IN the/DT arrangements/NNS contained/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP retains/VBZ its/PRP$ border/NN controls/NNS ./.

Under/IN the/DT system/NN proposed/VBN in/IN these/DT pieces/NNS of/IN legislation/NN ,/, third/JJ country/NN nationals/NNS wishing/VBG to/TO move/VB to/TO the/DT UK/NNP under/IN the/DT procedures/NNS described/VBN ,/, will/MD do/VB so/RB by/IN virtue/NN of/IN the/DT service/NN provision/NN card/NN issued/VBN by/IN another/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, thereby/RB by-passing/JJ UK/NNP border/NN controls/NNS ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT change/NN to/TO the/DT present/JJ United/NNP Kingdom/NNP border/NN arrangements/NNS ,/, that/DT change/NN should/MD be/VB made/VBN by/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP Government/NNP and/CC the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC not/RB en/IN passant/VBN by/IN the/DT European/JJ legislative/JJ process/NN ./.

For/IN that/DT reason/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB against/IN both/PDT these/DT proposals/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, first/JJ and/CC foremost/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO extend/VB warm/JJ thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN and/CC to/TO Mr/NNP Wieland/NNP for/IN the/DT efforts/NNS they/PRP have/VBP expended/VBN in/IN summing/VBG up/RP the/DT various/JJ proposed/JJ amendments/NNS and/CC interests/NNS in/IN this/DT report/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT balanced/JJ manner/NN ./.

These/DT two/CD proposals/NNS contribute/VBP considerably/RB to/TO the/DT implementation/NN of/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT four/CD key/JJ principles/NNS of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN for/IN the/DT freedom/NN to/TO provide/VB services/NNS ./.

The/DT new/JJ regulation/NN for/IN cross-border/JJ services/NNS will/MD doubtless/RB improve/VB both/PDT the/DT functioning/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC the/DT competitiveness/NN and/CC power/NN to/TO act/VB of/IN enterprises/NNS ./.

The/DT strict/JJ basic/JJ conditions/NNS attached/VBN to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP service/NN provision/NN card/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP am/VBP with/IN Mr/NNP Wieland/NNP on/IN this/DT -/: are/VBP essential/JJ ,/, for/IN they/PRP will/MD serve/VB to/TO prevent/VB abuses/NNS such/JJ as/IN illegal/JJ entry/NN and/CC bogus/JJ contracts/NNS ./.

Why/WRB do/VBP I/PRP think/VB we/PRP need/VB the/DT directive/NN so/RB much/RB ?/.

Three/CD reasons/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP as/RB follows/JJ :/: on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ importance/NN of/IN third-country/JJ workers/NNS in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN enterprises/NNS and/CC the/DT proper/JJ functioning/VBG of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, whilst/IN I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT strict/JJ basic/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB call/VB for/IN the/DT controls/NNS that/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO be/VB made/VBN as/RB effective/JJ and/CC simple/JJ as/RB possible/JJ ./.

My/PRP$ last/JJ question/NN relates/VBZ to/TO something/NN people/NNS constantly/RB approach/VBP me/PRP about/RP and/CC is/VBZ therefore/RB addressed/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Will/MD the/DT directive/NN prejudice/VB the/DT accession/NN negotiations/NNS ?/.

How/WRB is/VBZ Article/NNP 1/CD to/TO be/VB interpreted/VBN and/CC explained/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ view/NN ,/, as/IN this/DT will/MD have/VB important/JJ implications/NNS ,/, notably/RB for/IN the/DT accession/NN negotiations/NNS and/CC for/IN our/PRP$ country/NN ,/, which/WDT shares/VBZ common/JJ borders/NNS with/IN so/RB many/JJ applicant/NN countries/NNS ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, businesspeople/RB have/VBP so/RB far/RB had/VBN to/TO live/VB with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT key/JJ freedoms/NNS ,/, namely/RB the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN people/NNS and/CC services/NNS ,/, did/VBD not/RB apply/VB to/TO them/PRP ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, they/PRP were/VBD still/RB subject/JJ to/TO endless/JJ bureaucratic/JJ immigration/NN procedures/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS where/WRB a/DT service/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB provided/VBN ./.

There/EX are/VBP approximately/RB thirteen/CD million/CD third-country/JJ subjects/NNS who/WP reside/VB within/IN European/JJ territory/NN ./.

I/PRP assume/VBP that/IN ,/, although/IN the/DT exact/JJ number/NN of/IN businesspeople/NN included/VBN in/IN this/DT figure/NN is/VBZ not/RB known/VBN ,/, their/PRP$ number/NN will/MD most/RBS definitely/RB not/RB be/VB low/JJ ./.

So/RB ,/, up/RB to/TO now/RB ,/, their/PRP$ access/NN to/TO the/DT entire/JJ territory/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN regulated/VBN by/IN Community/NNP legislation/NN ./.

The/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD present/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN a/DT directive/NN is/VBZ to/TO promote/VB the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN services/NNS within/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN introducing/VBG the/DT EU/NNP service/NN provision/NN card/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP also/RB paid/VBN close/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT concerns/NNS raised/VBN by/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP ./.

Having/VBG also/RB studied/VBN the/DT amendments/NNS submitted/VBN ,/, I/PRP concluded/VBD that/IN we/PRP can/MD go/VB along/RP with/IN these/DT concerns/NNS to/TO a/DT large/JJ extent/NN and/CC that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB reflected/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ voting/NN behaviour/NN tomorrow/NN ./.

May/NNP I/PRP ,/, to/TO finish/VB off/RP ,/, thank/VBP Mrs/NNP Berger/NNP for/IN the/DT great/JJ care/NN she/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN in/IN studying/VBG the/DT different/JJ amendments/NNS and/CC for/IN having/VBG ,/, in/IN that/DT way/NN ,/, added/VBD an/DT important/JJ degree/NN of/IN meaning/VBG to/TO her/PRP$ report/NN ?/.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/, with/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, one/CD step/NN closer/JJR to/TO the/DT realisation/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT opportunity/NN you/PRP are/VBP giving/VBG me/PRP to/TO go/VB into/IN the/DT different/JJ amendments/NNS in/IN more/JJR detail/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN my/PRP$ speech/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO address/VB Lord/NNP Inglewood/NNP regarding/VBG the/DT remark/NN he/PRP has/VBZ just/RB made/VBN ./.

Regarding/VBG the/DT first/JJ proposal/NN on/IN third-country/JJ employees/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO adopt/VB Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 2/CD ,/, 11/CD ,/, 12/CD ,/, 15/CD ,/, 16/CD and/CC 22/CD ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/JJ 7/CD and/CC 8/CD are/VBP acceptable/JJ too/RB ,/, provided/VBD the/DT situation/NN of/IN posting/VBG is/VBZ established/VBN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP in/IN which/WDT the/DT service/NN provider/NN is/VBZ established/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP also/RB agrees/VBZ with/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 11/CD ,/, except/CD for/IN the/DT proposed/JJ period/NN of/IN previous/JJ employment/NN of/IN only/RB three/CD months/NNS ,/, as/IN I/PRP explained/VBD just/RB now/RB ./.

We/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP Amendment/NNP No/RB 13/CD insofar/NNS as/RB ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, the/DT card/NN '/POS s/JJ area/NN of/IN applicability/NN is/VBZ extended/VBN from/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP to/TO all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

In/IN terms/NNS of/IN comitology/NN ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 14/CD and/CC 21/CD also/RB apply/VBP in/IN part/NN ,/, insofar/RB as/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

I/PRP regret/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ found/VBN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 10/CD to/TO be/VB unacceptable/JJ as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT three-month/JJ period/NN and/CC the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP in/IN which/WDT the/DT service/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP supports/VBZ Amendment/NNP No/DT 22/CD ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB mentioned/VBN ./.

The/DT other/JJ amendments/NNS are/VBP unacceptable/JJ ./.

Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP rather/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN ``/`` EU/NN service/NN provision/NN card/NN ''/'' which/WDT is/VBZ proposed/VBN in/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 1/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP does/VBZ not/RB allow/VB this/DT ./.

As/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 18/CD refers/VBZ to/TO Directive/VB 96/71/CD concerning/VBG the/DT minimum/JJ wage/NN which/WDT is/VBZ already/RB in/IN force/NN ,/, no/DT change/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ ./.

Acceptance/NNP of/IN Amendment/NNP No/RB 17/CD by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP would/MD mean/VB that/IN a/DT simple/JJ duty/NN of/IN notification/NN would/MD apply/VB if/IN no/DT valid/JJ card/NN is/VBZ issued/VBN ./.

Surely/RB this/DT is/VBZ contrary/JJ to/TO interests/NNS of/IN public/JJ order/NN within/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 19/CD is/VBZ also/RB unacceptable/JJ ,/, given/VBN my/PRP$ thoughts/NNS on/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 10/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ the/DT same/JJ opinion/NN of/IN similar/JJ amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT second/JJ proposal/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO add/VB that/IN Amendment/NNP No/RB 10/CD to/TO that/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ wholly/RB acceptable/JJ ./.

As/IN far/RB as/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 15/CD on/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN ``/`` self-employed/JJ ''/'' is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB remarked/VBD ,/, provide/VB an/DT adequate/JJ solution/NN to/TO accommodate/VB the/DT objections/NNS lodged/VBN ./.

I/PRP would/MD now/RB like/VB to/TO move/VB on/RP to/TO Lord/NNP Inglewood/NNP '/POS s/JJ remark/NN ./.

He/PRP referred/VBD to/TO United/NNP Kingdom/NNP border/NN controls/NNS and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB to/TO him/PRP that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC this/DT includes/VBZ the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ,/, are/VBP under/IN no/DT obligation/NN at/IN all/DT to/TO abolish/VB or/CC change/VB controls/NNS at/IN the/DT existing/VBG borders/NNS ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ ,/, as/IN already/RB stated/JJ ,/, to/TO the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP and/CC it/PRP also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO Belgium/NNP ,/, where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD recently/RB of/IN relevance/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT remark/NN made/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Karas/NNPS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP under/IN the/DT impression/NN that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ talking/VBG about/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN people/NNS from/IN Poland/NNP being/VBG used/VBN as/IN employees/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ country/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP would/MD like/VB to/TO propose/VB finding/VBG a/DT solution/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN which/WDT would/MD then/RB apply/VB to/TO all/DT companies/NNS based/VBN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP which/WDT employ/VBP staff/NN from/IN non-EU/JJ countries/NNS ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, one/CD of/IN whether/IN the/DT two/CD cases/NNS should/MD be/VB treated/VBN in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN which/WDT belongs/VBZ to/TO the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC perhaps/RB not/RB to/TO the/DT present/JJ debate/NN ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD be/VB more/RBR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO make/VB myself/PRP available/JJ to/TO Mr/NNP Karas/NNP in/IN case/NN he/PRP would/MD like/VB further/JJ information/NN on/IN this/DT genuinely/RB important/JJ point/NN ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 11.00/CD a.m./RB Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN congratulating/NN the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN a/DT report/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, on/IN reading/VBG it/PRP ,/, gives/VBZ the/DT impression/NN of/IN simply/RB confirming/VBG and/CC accepting/VBG the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ draft/NN decision/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ appreciation/NN for/IN the/DT work/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN Vice-President/NNP Marinho/NNP ./.

Behind/IN these/DT principles/NNS ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, lies/VBZ the/DT justice/NN system/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, justice/NN delayed/VBN is/VBZ justice/NN denied/VBN ,/, and/CC we/PRP must/MD reflect/VB on/IN this/DT notion/NN ./.

The/DT working/VBG document/NN prepared/VBN by/IN the/DT Court/NNP itself/PRP contains/VBZ alarming/JJ information/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, the/DT draft/NN reform/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Vice-President/NNP Marinho/NNP ,/, is/VBZ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT stopgap/JJ solution/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD rely/VB on/IN stopgap/JJ solutions/NNS because/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT moment/NN -/, as/IN he/PRP himself/PRP has/VBZ pointed/VBN out/RP -/: we/PRP can/MD not/RB expect/VB a/DT broad/JJ reform/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN from/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO offer/VB solutions/NNS which/WDT ,/, while/IN provisional/JJ ,/, help/VBP to/TO provide/VB a/DT faster/JJR and/CC more/RBR effective/JJ system/NN of/IN justice/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB two/CD observations/NNS during/IN this/DT intervention/NN ,/, which/WDT stem/VBP from/IN the/DT report/NN itself/PRP ,/, given/VBN this/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ obligation/NN ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, to/TO produce/VB a/DT very/RB succinct/JJ report/NN ,/, which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB go/VB into/IN depth/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP two/CD of/IN Vice-President/NNP Marinho/NNP '/POS s/JJ ideas/NNS and/CC ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, they/PRP are/VBP seconded/VBN by/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN greater/JJR resources/NNS should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO judges/NNS of/IN first/JJ instance/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB given/VBN one/CD more/JJR r脙/NN 漏/JJ f脙/NN 漏/RB rendaire/JJ ./.

The/DT second/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT translation/NN services/NNS of/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP and/CC the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP should/MD be/VB separated/JJ ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP has/VBZ to/TO wait/VB a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN for/IN its/PRP$ judgements/NNS to/TO be/VB translated/VBN ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT founding/JJ principles/NNS of/IN this/DT Community/NNP is/VBZ linguistic/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ plurality/NN and/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN our/PRP$ overlooking/VBG the/DT possibility/NN of/IN something/NN as/RB important/JJ as/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO read/VB a/DT judgement/NN in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ language/NN ./.

Since/IN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, let/VB us/PRP consider/VB just/RB two/CD points/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ concerns/NNS this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ well/RB worth/JJ insisting/VBG that/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO participate/VB more/RBR with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, even/RB in/IN the/DT appointment/NN of/IN judges/NNS ./.

Above/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO see/VB an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT competences/NNS of/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, hand/NN in/IN hand/NN with/IN its/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO fulfil/VB its/PRP$ obligations/NNS ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ resources/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP refer/VBP once/RB again/RB to/TO the/DT declarations/NNS which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN in/IN recent/JJ days/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN and/CC welcome/VB the/DT contents/NNS of/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ caused/VBN me/PRP to/TO reflect/VB on/IN two/CD problems/NNS which/WDT have/VBP come/VBN to/TO me/PRP recently/RB in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN ./.

Both/DT concern/NN cases/NNS with/IN decisions/NNS pending/VBG before/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ./.

The/DT first/JJ relates/VBZ to/TO a/DT large/JJ suspension/NN bridge/NN and/CC whether/IN or/CC not/RB tolls/NNS on/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB subject/JJ to/TO VAT/NNP ./.

The/DT decision/NN could/MD have/VB huge/JJ implications/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ local/JJ economy/NN ./.

Secondly/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lady/NN within/IN thirteen/NN weeks/NNS of/IN retirement/NN who/WP is/VBZ desperate/JJ for/IN news/NN of/IN a/DT decision/NN that/WDT will/MD affect/VB seriously/RB her/PRP$ financial/JJ circumstances/NNS in/IN old/JJ age/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP just/RB two/CD examples/NNS of/IN real/JJ life/NN problems/NNS behind/IN delays/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ system/NN of/IN justice/NN ./.

Delays/NNS in/IN justice/NN can/MD mean/VB personal/JJ difficulties/NNS and/CC even/RB tragedy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ national/JJ systems/NNS of/IN justice/NN are/VBP perfect/JJ ,/, but/CC all/DT too/RB often/RB they/PRP may/MD be/VB waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT preliminary/JJ ruling/NN from/IN the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP ./.

Amongst/VB the/DT statistics/NNS there/EX is/VBZ a/DT worrying/JJ upward/JJ trend/NN in/IN the/DT time/NN taken/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN preliminary/JJ references/NNS ./.

This/DT should/MD not/RB be/VB taken/VBN as/IN a/DT criticism/NN of/IN the/DT Court/NNP or/CC of/IN its/PRP$ staff/NN ,/, rather/RB of/IN the/DT Court/NNP '/POS s/JJ structure/NN and/CC its/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN resources/NNS in/IN a/DT growing/VBG European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT proposals/NNS in/IN this/DT report/NN are/VBP very/RB welcome/JJ as/IN an/DT interim/JJ palliative/NN ,/, but/CC Europe/NNP is/VBZ a/DT legal/JJ construction/NN ,/, its/PRP$ courts/NNS are/VBP central/JJ to/TO its/PRP$ proper/JJ functioning/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN coming/JJ enlargement/NN the/DT IGC/NNP must/MD deal/VB with/IN fundamental/JJ reform/NN and/CC restructuring/NN of/IN the/DT court/NN system/NN ./.

Otherwise/RB we/PRP will/MD all/RB ,/, as/IN elected/VBN representatives/NNS ,/, be/VB faced/VBN with/IN more/JJR and/CC more/JJR clamour/NN from/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS who/WP are/VBP not/RB getting/VBG access/NN to/TO quick/JJ and/CC effective/JJ justice/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN this/DT excellent/JJ report/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB fully/RB endorse/VBP his/PRP$ findings/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, he/PRP suggests/VBZ increasing/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN consultants/NNS for/IN judges/NNS at/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP and/CC providing/VBG the/DT latter/NN with/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ translation/NN service/NN ./.

However/RB I/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN the/DT reforms/NNS must/MD go/VB further/RBR than/IN those/DT we/PRP are/VBP to/TO adopt/VB here/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP wishes/VBZ to/TO discuss/VB the/DT question/NN of/IN compensatory/JJ measures/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/TO improved/VBN habitats/NNS with/IN the/DT Irish/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT continuing/VBG legal/JJ challenge/NN in/IN the/DT Irish/JJ courts/NNS ./.

-/: I/PRP do/VBP not/RB quite/RB understand/VB what/WP the/DT Commissioner/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT mudflat/NN at/IN Stregrennan/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD made/VBN a/DT special/JJ protection/NN area/NN at/IN the/DT request/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN completely/RB destroyed/VBN at/IN this/DT stage/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN the/DT activities/NNS that/WDT have/VBP taken/VBN place/VBP there/EX are/VBP in/IN clear/JJ breach/NN of/IN EU/NNP directives/NNS ./.

You/PRP say/VBP there/EX will/MD be/VB no/DT further/JJ funding/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB whether/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO stop/VB completely/RB the/DT funding/NN at/IN this/DT stage/NN until/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT proper/JJ investigation/NN ./.

If/IN not/RB ,/, why/WRB not/RB ?/.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP ,/, when/WRB exactly/RB are/VBP you/PRP going/VBG to/TO do/VB it/PRP ?/.

Is/VBZ it/PRP correct/JJ and/CC proper/JJ that/IN the/DT department/NN which/WDT owns/VBZ the/DT company/NN is/VBZ also/RB the/DT authority/NN which/WDT issues/VBZ the/DT licence/NN ,/, and/CC also/RB the/DT authority/NN which/WDT basically/RB takes/VBZ the/DT money/NN from/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC gives/VBZ it/PRP to/TO a/DT company/NN that/IN it/PRP owns/VBZ 100/CD %/NN ?/.

Is/VBZ this/DT right/JJ and/CC proper/JJ ?/.

What/WP is/VBZ your/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN that/DT ?/.

Any/DT EU/JJ funding/NN for/IN the/DT project/NN must/MD be/VB stopped/VBN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN clear/JJ breach/NN of/IN EU/NNP directives/NNS ./.

Even/RB the/DT area/NN designated/VBN by/IN the/DT Commissioners/NNPS as/IN a/DT special/JJ protection/NN area/NN has/VBZ been/VBN destroyed/VBN ./.

Compensation/NNP afterwards/RB is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN the/DT damage/NN that/WDT was/VBD done/VBN ./.

The/DT first/JJ legal/JJ challenge/NN followed/VBD the/DT start/NN of/IN work/NN on/IN the/DT port/NN of/IN development/NN in/IN early/JJ autumn/NN 1999/CD without/IN the/DT compensatory/JJ habitat/NN improvements/NNS being/VBG in/IN place/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT Irish/JJ authorities/NNS agreed/VBD to/TO reinstate/VB the/DT cord/NN grass/NN removal/NN but/CC this/DT time/NN by/IN direct/JJ mechanical/JJ means/NNS ./.

The/DT use/NN of/IN mechanical/JJ means/NNS led/VBD to/TO a/DT further/JJ legal/JJ challenge/NN -/: that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP referred/VBD to/TO also/RB in/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ answer/NN -/: based/VBN on/IN the/DT argument/NN that/IN mechanical/JJ removal/NN would/MD damage/VB the/DT underlying/VBG mudflats/NNS and/CC would/MD cause/VB the/DT ecologically-harmful/JJ spread/NN of/IN cord/NN grass/NN in/IN the/DT estuary/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ to/TO date/NN no/DT conclusive/JJ outcome/NN to/TO this/DT legal/JJ challenge/NN ./.

The/DT adoption/NN of/IN the/DT necessary/JJ compensatory/JJ measures/NNS is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN for/IN the/DT national/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, and/CC does/VBZ not/RB require/VB prior/JJ Commission/NNP approval/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB sure/JJ that/IN the/DT standards/NNS required/VBN by/IN the/DT Birds/NNP Directive/NNP are/VBP fully/RB met/VBN ,/, and/CC clearly/RB there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT problem/NN with/IN compensatory/JJ measures/NNS which/WDT were/VBD themselves/PRP damaging/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP proposes/VBZ to/TO seek/VB further/JJ clarification/NN from/IN the/DT Irish/JJ authorities/NNS on/IN the/DT up-to-date/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT compensatory/JJ measures/NNS and/CC possible/JJ problems/NNS with/IN the/DT mechanical/JJ removal/NN of/IN cord/NN grass/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB at/IN the/DT moment/NN ready/JJ to/TO propose/VB to/TO stop/VB the/DT financing/NN from/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, sadly/RB ,/, the/DT specific/JJ case/NN raised/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP McKenna/NNP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT isolated/JJ one/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP other/JJ examples/NNS of/IN conservation/NN in/IN special/JJ scientific/JJ areas/NNS being/VBG damaged/VBN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN EU/NNP funding/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB such/JJ action/NN which/WDT will/MD discourage/VB this/DT practice/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ question/NN ./.

As/IN MEPs/NNP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN a/DT joint/JJ text/NN was/VBD issued/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ predecessors/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Ritt/NNP Bjerregaard/NNP and/CC Monika/NNP Wulf-Mathies/NNP concerning/VBG the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, money/NN from/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC protection/NN under/IN the/DT Habitats/NNPS and/CC Birds/NNP Directives/NNP ./.

The/DT message/NN contained/VBN in/IN the/DT joint/JJ text/NN is/VBZ still/RB valid/JJ ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB hand/VB out/RP money/NN with/IN one/CD hand/NN and/CC ,/, with/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, take/VB countries/NNS to/TO court/NN ,/, where/WRB they/PRP may/MD well/RB be/VB fined/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB important/JJ that/IN there/EX be/VB a/DT coordination/NN strategy/NN ./.

The/DT result/NN may/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB some/DT difficult/JJ questions/NNS of/IN priorities/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS important/JJ consequence/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN countries/NNS should/MD do/VB some/DT careful/JJ thinking/NN and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, make/VB sure/JJ they/PRP send/VBP in/IN their/PRP$ lists/NNS of/IN Natura/NNP 2000/CD sites/NNS ./.

Then/RB we/PRP will/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP methodical/JJ monitoring/NN and/CC follow-up/NN procedures/NNS ./.

In/IN that/DT respect/NN ,/, Ireland/NNP falls/VBZ short/JJ ,/, like/IN other/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, but/CC we/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT pressure/NN we/PRP are/VBP exerting/VBG will/MD produce/VB results/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP once/RB again/RB that/IN the/DT joint/JJ text/NN still/RB holds/VBZ good/JJ ./.

The/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP do/VBP not/RB allow/VB this/DT ./.

In/IN the/DT current/JJ negotiations/NNS on/IN this/DT third/JJ Community/NNP support/NN framework/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN for/IN the/DT provisions/NNS on/IN the/DT partnership/NN principle/NN to/TO be/VB fully/RB respected/VBN ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO both/DT regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC to/TO non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS and/CC associations/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ both/DT propaganda/NN by/IN the/DT party/NN and/CC propaganda/NN by/IN the/DT candidates/NNS ,/, financed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, the/DT CSF/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP is/VBZ this/DT :/: what/WP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN ?/.

Will/MD the/DT Commission/NNP remain/VB silent/JJ ?/.

Will/MD it/PRP bring/VB it/PRP up/RP with/IN the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN or/CC will/NN we/PRP persist/VBP with/IN the/DT pathological/JJ situation/NN we/PRP had/VBD with/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP ?/.

Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP ,/, I/PRP see/VBP that/IN you/PRP have/VBP thrown/VBN to/TO your/PRP$ left/NN all/PDT the/DT documents/NNS which/WDT you/PRP have/VBP just/RB cited/VBN ./.

I/PRP can/MD then/RB determine/VB what/WP they/PRP contain/VBP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN information/NN and/CC communication/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP can/MD only/RB welcome/VB as/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP for/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, and/CC what/WP is/VBZ propaganda/NN ./.

Then/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB necessary/JJ for/IN me/PRP to/TO do/VB this/DT ,/, I/PRP will/MD make/VB comments/NNS or/CC recommendations/NNS to/TO the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB be/VB very/RB pleased/JJ if/IN you/PRP could/MD pass/VB me/PRP these/DT documents/NNS or/CC I/PRP will/MD come/VB and/CC get/VB them/PRP from/IN you/PRP later/RB on/RB ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/WDT ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD your/PRP$ question/NN related/VBN more/RBR to/TO the/DT partnership/NN issue/NN ./.

Further/RB to/TO your/PRP$ questions/NNS on/IN the/DT pre-electoral/JJ period/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD only/RB repeat/VB my/PRP$ intention/NN that/IN local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS should/MD be/VB involved/VBN together/RB with/IN non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB quote/VB what/WP is/VBZ contained/VBN in/IN the/DT general/JJ Structural/JJ Funds/NNS Regulation/NN which/WDT specifies/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD work/VB with/IN the/DT governments/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN which/WDT is/VBZ my/PRP$ primary/JJ partner/NN ./.

Subsequently/RB ,/, if/IN I/PRP need/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN this/DT partnership/NN is/VBZ disseminated/VBN and/CC decentralised/VBN ,/, then/RB I/PRP will/MD do/VB this/DT ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB do/VB other/JJ than/IN work/NN with/IN the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP will/MD be/VB giving/VBG all/PDT these/DT particulars/NNS to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP so/RB that/IN he/PRP may/MD be/VB aware/JJ of/IN them/PRP ,/, because/IN this/DT really/RB is/VBZ propaganda/NN and/CC not/RB just/RB some/DT way/NN of/IN promoting/VBG Community/NNP programmes/NNS ./.

What/WP can/MD the/DT Commission/NNP do/VB about/IN that/DT ?/.

Mr/NNP Theonas/NNP ,/, I/PRP can/MD only/RB repeat/VB what/WP I/PRP said/VBD to/TO Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNPS ./.

If/IN necessary/JJ ,/, within/IN and/CC pursuant/JJ to/TO the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS Regulation/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD make/VB comments/NNS on/IN the/DT use/NN made/VBN ,/, not/RB of/IN Structural/JJ Funds/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB yet/RB committed/VBN ,/, but/CC of/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS prior/RB to/TO the/DT allocation/NN of/IN these/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP obliged/JJ to/TO respect/VB the/DT national/JJ authority/NN with/IN which/WDT I/PRP must/MD conduct/VB these/DT negotiations/NNS ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, I/PRP will/MD look/VB at/IN the/DT situation/NN objectively/RB ./.

Why/WRB would/MD I/PRP not/RB say/VB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP noticed/VBN in/IN previous/JJ years/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN ,/, some/DT shortcomings/NNS in/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ Regulation/NN and/CC the/DT previous/JJ regulation/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN involving/VBG representatives/NNS of/IN civil/JJ society/NN ?/.

I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG this/DT objectively/RB and/CC when/WRB a/DT problem/NN or/CC shortcoming/NN is/VBZ noted/VBN ,/, this/DT must/MD be/VB remedied/VBN ./.

I/PRP will/MD therefore/RB monitor/VB this/DT in/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ Community/NNP support/NN framework/NN ./.

On/IN Mrs/NNP Isler/NNP B脙/NNP 漏/NNP guin/NN '/POS s/JJ first/JJ point/NN I/PRP must/MD remind/VB her/PRP that/IN the/DT improvement/NN of/IN the/DT scientific/JJ basis/NN and/CC technical/JJ capacities/NNS of/IN the/DT regions/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO increase/VB their/PRP$ competitiveness/NN was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ priorities/NNS during/IN the/DT previous/JJ programming/NN period/NN ./.

The/DT support/NN allocated/VBN by/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS for/IN technological/JJ cohesion/NN ,/, or/CC research/NN and/CC technical/JJ developments/NNS ,/, within/IN the/DT Community/NNP support/NN frameworks/VBZ for/IN that/DT period/NN is/VBZ estimated/VBN at/IN approximately/RB EUR/$ 7.5/CD billion/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ about/RB 6/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ Community/NNP contribution/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO your/PRP$ specific/JJ concern/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB that/IN ,/, as/IN in/IN the/DT previous/JJ period/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB intend/VB to/TO directly/RB finance/VB through/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS research/NN and/CC technical/JJ development/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ fusion/NN or/CC fission/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS management/NN authorities/NNS to/TO select/VB the/DT projects/NNS to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN within/IN these/DT CSFs/NNPS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT Community/NNP priority/NN ,/, a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP can/MD decide/VB to/TO finance/VB research/NN and/CC development/NN projects/NNS in/IN the/DT civil/JJ nuclear/JJ technology/NN area/NN ,/, provided/VBN that/IN these/DT projects/NNS contribute/VBP to/TO regional/JJ development/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB systematically/RB informed/VBN of/IN these/DT ./.

On/IN your/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN which/WDT ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, is/VBZ of/IN great/JJ interest/NN to/TO me/PRP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ given/VBN in/IN the/DT document/NN on/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ coordination/NN with/IN the/DT Cohesion/NNP Funds/NNPS ./.

These/DT Funds/NNPS specify/VB that/IN investments/NNS in/IN the/DT renewable/JJ energy/NN sector/NN must/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN where/WRB they/PRP favour/VBP the/DT development/NN of/IN local/JJ resources/NNS ,/, where/WRB they/PRP contribute/VBP to/TO reducing/VBG dependency/NNS on/IN energy/NN imports/NNS and/CC where/WRB they/PRP create/VBP jobs/NNS at/IN local/JJ level/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO verify/VB this/DT ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, during/IN a/DT visit/NN I/PRP made/VBD to/TO the/DT Azores/NNPS in/IN Portugal/NNP a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO a/DT natural/JJ source/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN ./.

The/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS contribution/NN which/WDT has/VBZ enabled/VBN greater/JJR penetration/NN of/IN the/DT renewable/JJ energy/NN market/NN was/VBD also/RB underlined/VBN in/IN the/DT campaign/NN to/TO promote/VB renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS launched/VBN by/IN the/DT Transport/NNP and/CC Energy/NNP Department/NNP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, on/IN large-scale/JJ energy/NN transmission/NN networks/NNS ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS also/RB provide/VBP for/IN financial/JJ participation/NN from/IN the/DT Funds/NNPS to/TO develop/VB these/DT networks/NNS where/WRB this/DT helps/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB dependency/NNS on/IN an/DT external/JJ supplier/NN or/CC to/TO combat/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN isolation/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ particularly/RB valid/JJ for/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN the/DT Azores/NNPS which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP just/RB mentioned/VBN and/CC also/RB for/IN all/DT most/JJS remote/JJ regions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB valid/JJ for/IN certain/JJ regions/NNS handicapped/NNS by/IN their/PRP$ isolation/NN due/JJ to/TO mountains/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ answer/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP asked/VBD this/DT question/NN because/IN we/PRP are/VBP rightly/RB concerned/VBN that/IN the/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT third/JJ framework/NN programme/NN for/IN research/NN contains/VBZ a/DT project/NN entitled/VBN `/`` International/NNP Thermonuclear/NNP Experimental/NNP Reactor/NNP '/'' ./.

You/PRP did/VBD not/RB fully/RB answer/VB the/DT last/JJ part/NN of/IN my/PRP$ question/NN on/IN large-scale/JJ energy/NN transmission/NN networks/NNS ./.

Could/MD you/PRP please/VB give/VB an/DT answer/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ?/.

You/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN whether/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS will/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO finance/VB the/DT installation/NN of/IN nuclear/JJ plants/NNS anywhere/RB ./.

Quite/RB simply/RB there/RB is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP said/VBD that/IN the/DT selection/NN of/IN projects/NNS remains/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS pursuant/JJ to/TO the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS Regulation/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP services/NNS are/VBP not/RB systematically/RB informed/VBN of/IN all/DT projects/NNS selected/VBN ./.

I/PRP will/MD therefore/RB step/VB beyond/IN the/DT confidence/NN usually/RB shared/VBN between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC I/PRP will/MD find/VB out/RP exactly/RB what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG on/IN this/DT specific/JJ point/NN ./.

In/IN particular/NN ,/, would/MD the/DT Commission/NNP look/VB favourably/RB on/IN a/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT rules/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN additionality/NN operates/VBZ not/RB only/JJ at/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS but/CC also/RB within/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO budgetary/JJ provisions/NNS between/IN central/JJ government/NN and/CC internally/RB autonomous/JJ regions/NNS or/CC countries/NNS ?/.

Mr/NNP MacCormick/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ no/DT plans/NNS to/TO amend/VB the/DT rules/NNS concerning/VBG additionality/NN which/WDT were/VBD stipulated/VBN ,/, for/IN the/DT 2000-2006/CD period/NN ,/, in/IN Article/NNP 11/CD of/IN the/DT general/JJ Regulation/NN on/IN the/DT Funds/NNPS ./.

As/IN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, these/DT rules/NNS state/VBP that/IN the/DT additionality/JJ principle/NN applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS and/CC all/DT development/NN expenditure/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB stressed/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT expenditure/NN financed/VBN by/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS which/WDT must/MD be/VB additional/JJ ./.

The/DT cofinancing/NN provided/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP does/VBZ not/RB need/VB to/TO be/VB additional/JJ to/TO its/PRP$ existing/VBG expenditure/NN ./.

Provided/VBG that/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP does/VBZ not/RB reduce/VB all/PDT its/PRP$ own/JJ expenditure/NNS ,/, the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS are/VBP added/VBN to/TO the/DT national/JJ expenditure/NN and/CC the/DT principle/NN of/IN additionality/NN is/VBZ therefore/RB respected/JJ ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT budgetary/JJ provisions/NNS within/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, between/IN central/JJ government/NN and/CC internal/JJ autonomous/NN regions/NNS or/CC countries/NNS ,/, these/DT are/VBP determined/VBN according/VBG to/TO exclusively/JJ national/JJ considerations/NNS and/CC are/VBP therefore/RB not/RB affected/VBN by/IN additionality/NN within/IN the/DT meaning/NN defined/VBN in/IN the/DT rules/NNS ./.

When/WRB there/EX are/VBP major/JJ set-piece/JJ debates/NNS scheduled/VBN between/IN this/DT House/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD clear/VB all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ lines/NNS on/IN what/WP are/VBP our/PRP$ mutual/JJ expectations/NNS at/IN least/JJS one/CD full/JJ working/JJ month/NN in/IN advance/NN ./.

Looking/VBG at/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT press/NN reports/NNS of/IN last/JJ Friday/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ President/NN exercised/VBD commendable/JJ self-restraint/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN they/PRP commented/VBD publicly/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/VBG ,/, today/NN we/PRP are/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN an/DT important/JJ debate/NN about/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG a/DT highly/RB controversial/JJ modernisation/NN proposal/NN for/IN European/JJ monopolies/NNS law/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ far/RB more/RBR controversial/JJ than/IN the/DT vote/NN in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS may/MD have/VB given/VBN us/PRP reason/NN to/TO believe/VB ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP also/RB discussing/VBG the/DT aid/NN report/NN today/NN and/CC the/DT general/JJ competition/NN report/NN for/IN 1998/CD ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO this/DT joint/JJ debate/NN relates/VBZ to/TO the/DT latter/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, both/CC the/DT competition/NN report/NN and/CC the/DT aid/NN report/NN share/VBP common/JJ ground/NN in/IN this/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ all/DT about/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN modernisation/NN and/CC the/DT future/JJ viability/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ./.

On/IN reading/VBG both/DT Commission/NNP documents/NNS ,/, one/PRP learns/VBZ that/IN 1998/CD was/VBD the/DT year/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT modernisation/NN proposals/NNS introduced/VBN in/IN 1997/CD were/VBD pursued/JJ and/CC even/RB partially/RB completed/VBN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN our/PRP$ own/JJ ongoing/JJ parliamentary/JJ work/NN has/VBZ taught/VBN us/PRP ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO make/VB two/CD fundamental/JJ comments/NNS at/IN this/DT juncture/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT competent/JJ authority/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ logically/RB consistent/JJ approach/NN ,/, has/VBZ again/RB and/CC again/RB served/VBN the/DT cause/NN of/IN freedom/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, not/RB always/RB to/TO the/DT delight/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS or/CC enterprises/NNS concerned/VBN ./.

It/PRP should/MD continue/VB along/RP this/DT path/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, none/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ to/TO become/VB less/RBR complicated/JJ in/IN future/NN -/: one/CD only/RB has/VBZ to/TO think/VB of/IN the/DT challenges/NNS posed/VBN by/IN the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, the/DT deepening/VBG of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, technological/JJ progress/NN ,/, globalisation/NN ./.

Only/RB ,/, without/IN transparency/NN there/EX will/MD be/VB no/DT acceptance/NN ,/, indeed/RB there/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT modernisation/NN without/IN transparency/NN ./.

The/DT competition/NN report/VBP 1998/CD is/VBZ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ foundation/NN for/IN this/DT but/CC ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN that/WDT could/MD not/RB be/VB further/RBR improved/VBN upon/RB ./.

Our/PRP$ motion/NN will/MD give/VB you/PRP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN food/NN for/IN thought/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ one/CD point/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO go/VB into/IN now/RB ./.

Transparency/NN and/CC accountability/NN belong/VBP together/RB ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO call/VB the/DT distribution/NN of/IN competences/NNS between/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP into/IN question/NN ./.

Here/RB too/RB we/PRP should/MD continue/VB along/RP the/DT path/NN we/PRP have/VBP chosen/VBN ,/, strengthening/VBG and/CC intensifying/VBG it/PRP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB quite/RB clear/JJ though/RB ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ a/DT legislative/JJ body/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP no/DT more/RBR than/IN the/DT right/NN of/IN consultation/NN in/IN matters/NNS of/IN competition/NN law/NN ,/, of/IN all/DT things/NNS ,/, is/VBZ truly/RB scandalous/JJ ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD urge/VB the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP to/TO introduce/VB the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN into/IN legislation/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

I/PRP expect/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO exploit/VB every/DT available/JJ opportunity/NN for/IN parliamentary/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC to/TO involve/VB Parliament/NNP in/IN doubtful/JJ cases/NNS ,/, even/RB given/VBN the/DT Treaty/NNP status/NN quo/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB expect/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB pro-active/VBN in/IN supporting/VBG us/PRP in/IN our/PRP$ call/NN for/IN codecision/NN in/IN legislative/JJ procedures/NNS ./.

This/DT will/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ test/NN as/IN to/TO whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ reasonable/JJ cooperation/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD institutions/NNS ./.

With/IN all/DT due/JJ respect/NN for/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, competition/NN is/VBZ not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, an/DT end/NN in/IN itself/PRP ./.

Competition/NN is/VBZ an/DT instrument/NN and/CC does/VBZ not/RB always/RB produce/VB ideal/JJ solutions/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ tenets/NNS of/IN economic/JJ theory/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT market/NN is/VBZ failing/VBG in/IN many/JJ respects/NNS and/CC anyone/NN who/WP takes/VBZ issue/NN with/IN this/DT is/VBZ nothing/NN more/JJR than/IN an/DT ideologue/NN ./.

Competition/NN should/MD bring/VB about/IN balance/NN in/IN supply/NN and/CC demand/NN and/CC should/MD provide/VB for/IN the/DT optimum/JJ distribution/NN of/IN economic/JJ resources/NNS and/CC facts/NNS ./.

But/CC optimum/JJ efficiency/NN does/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB come/VB about/RP of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ accord/NN ./.

Framework/NNP conditions/NNS are/VBP indispensable/JJ when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO preventing/VBG abuses/NNS ,/, monopolies/NNS law/NN being/VBG one/CD example/NN ./.

But/CC on/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, this/DT only/RB serves/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB abuses/NNS ;/: framework/NN conditions/NNS alone/RB can/MD not/RB achieve/VB socially/RB legitimate/JJ goals/NNS in/IN isolation/NN ./.

Competition/UH yes/UH ,/, restrictions/NNS in/RB state/VBP aid/NN where/WRB necessary/JJ and/CC where/WRB possible/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, since/IN state/NN aid/NN forms/VBZ the/DT lion/NN '/POS s/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT competition/NN report/VB 1998/CD I/PRP would/MD still/RB like/VB ,/, regardless/RB of/IN Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ,/, to/TO say/VB one/CD more/JJR thing/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB possible/JJ ,/, indeed/RB it/PRP must/MD be/VB feasible/JJ for/IN state/NN aid/NN to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS involved/VBN in/IN research/NN and/CC development/NN for/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN educating/VBG them/PRP in/IN regional/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ policy/NN ./.

Indeed/RB it/PRP must/MD be/VB permissible/JJ for/IN state/NN aid/NN to/TO be/VB provided/VBN for/IN such/JJ purposes/NNS ,/, provided/VBD it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB lead/VB to/TO unacceptable/JJ distortion/NN of/IN competition/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT area/NN where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR important/JJ than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN monopolies/NNS and/CC mergers/NNS law/NN for/IN decisions/NNS to/TO be/VB comprehensible/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB that/IN we/PRP should/MD pillory/VB state/NN aid/NN ;/: rather/RB our/PRP$ approach/NN must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN drawing/VBG distinctions/NNS and/CC we/PRP must/MD assess/VB the/DT different/JJ types/NNS of/IN state/NN aid/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT they/PRP help/VBP to/TO achieve/VB the/DT above-mentioned/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

My/PRP$ last/JJ comment/NN was/VBD intended/VBN not/RB so/RB much/RB for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP as/IN for/IN the/DT Members/NNS of/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP report/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT descriptive/JJ report/NN detailing/VBG the/DT development/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN in/IN the/DT manufacturing/VBG sector/NN and/CC certain/JJ other/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO various/JJ typologies/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT method/NN of/IN financing/NN and/CC the/DT objectives/NNS pursued/VBN ./.

To/TO put/VB it/PRP plainly/RB ,/, the/DT level/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN declared/VBD ,/, roughly/RB speaking/VBG ,/, is/VBZ generally/RB stable/JJ during/IN the/DT period/NN under/IN discussion/NN and/CC comes/VBZ to/TO approximately/RB 1.2/CD %/NN of/IN Community/NNP GDP/NNP or/CC more/JJR or/CC less/JJR the/DT equivalent/NN ,/, coincidentally/RB ,/, of/IN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN for/IN one/CD year/NN ./.

This/DT being/VBG the/DT case/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP considerable/JJ disparities/NNS between/IN states/NNS ,/, which/WDT may/MD be/VB measured/VBN in/IN various/JJ ways/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT percentage/NN of/IN added/VBN value/NN and/CC per/IN wage/NN earner/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB interesting/JJ to/TO add/VB state/NN aid/NN and/CC Community/NN aid/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD be/VB assimilated/VBN in/IN some/DT way/NN into/IN state/NN aid/NN ./.

This/DT clearly/RB shows/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT four/CD countries/NNS which/WDT benefit/VBP from/IN the/DT Cohesion/NNP Fund/NNP ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, which/WDT come/VBN at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT list/NN ./.

This/DT being/VBG the/DT case/NN ,/, let/VB me/PRP now/RB come/VB to/TO the/DT proposals/NNS made/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD only/RB collate/VB and/CC analyse/VB the/DT data/NNS provided/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB down/IN to/TO the/DT states/NNS and/CC regions/NNS to/TO ensure/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS provided/VBN ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ committee/NN considers/VBZ that/IN additional/JJ efforts/NNS must/MD be/VB made/VBN in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN this/DT spirit/NN that/IN our/PRP$ parliamentary/JJ committee/NN for/IN example/NN ,/, has/VBZ championed/VBN the/DT longstanding/JJ idea/NN of/IN a/DT public/JJ register/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN ,/, accessible/JJ via/IN the/DT Internet/NN ./.

Having/VBG better/JJR ,/, more/RBR detailed/JJ information/NN available/JJ ,/, particularly/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS pursued/VBN and/CC the/DT results/NNS recorded/VBD ,/, must/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ for/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP to/TO itself/PRP proceed/VB or/CC to/TO commission/VB in/IN a/DT regular/JJ manner/NN studies/NNS of/IN the/DT social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ state/NN aid/NN policies/NNS ./.

And/CC insofar/RB as/IN such/JJ studies/NNS already/RB exist/VBP ,/, to/TO publish/VB more/JJR openly/RB its/PRP$ own/JJ comments/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP not/RB only/RB to/TO ensure/VB the/DT competitivity/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ economy/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB sustainable/JJ development/NN and/CC economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

This/DT being/VBG the/DT case/NN ,/, various/JJ amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN '/POS s/JJ initial/JJ draft/NN report/NN were/VBD adopted/VBN in/IN committee/NN ,/, particularly/RB highlighting/VBG the/DT need/NN for/IN effective/JJ reimbursement/NN of/IN aid/NN found/VBN to/TO be/VB illegal/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT league/NN table/NN of/IN results/NNS ./.

Seven/CD amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN retabled/VBN for/IN this/DT plenary/NN sitting/VBG ./.

Most/JJS of/IN them/PRP are/VBP an/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT political/JJ differences/NNS among/IN ourselves/PRP regarding/VBG the/DT appropriateness/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT inadequacies/NNS ,/, acknowledged/VBD or/CC not/RB ,/, of/IN private/JJ investment/NN alone/RB ,/, the/DT market/NN failures/NNS or/CC inadequacies/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ report/NN argues/VBZ that/IN the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN should/MD apply/VB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN basic/JJ legislation/NN on/IN state/NN aid/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, my/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO today/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT steel/NN aid/NN code/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT state/NN aid/NN in/IN Europe/NNP granted/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN this/DT code/NN and/CC which/WDT was/VBD assessed/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT ECSC/NNP Treaty/NNP is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO expire/VB shortly/RB ./.

Hence/RB ,/, what/WP we/PRP must/MD focus/VB on/IN today/NN is/VBZ the/DT question/NN as/IN to/TO how/WRB state/NN aid/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB managed/VBN in/IN future/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, which/WDT feature/VBP in/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, are/VBP welcomed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN is/VBZ the/DT decision/NN to/TO ask/VB for/IN the/DT money/NN back/RB in/IN specific/JJ cases/NNS ,/, thus/RB applying/VBG Article/NNP 88/CD of/IN the/DT ECSC/NNP Treaty/NNP ./.

The/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ steel/NN industry/NN also/RB forms/VBZ the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP most/RBS recent/JJ communication/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB debated/VBN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

As/IN in/IN other/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, the/DT general/JJ ban/NN on/IN state/NN aid/NN according/VBG to/TO Article/NNP 87/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT EC/NNP Treaty/NNP also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT iron/NN and/CC steel/NN industry/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD give/VB the/DT Commission/NNP advance/NN warning/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO their/PRP$ intentions/NNS concerning/VBG state/NN aid/NN ./.

The/DT rules/NNS pertaining/VBG to/TO the/DT steel/NN industry/NN were/VBD drawn/VBN up/RP on/IN 18/CD December/NNP 1996/CD ./.

These/DT stipulate/VBZ that/IN state/NN aid/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB awarded/VBN to/TO the/DT steel/NN industry/NN in/IN particular/JJ ,/, precisely-defined/JJ cases/NNS i.e./VBG those/DT involving/VBG aid/NN for/IN research/NN and/CC development/NN ,/, aid/VB for/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN ,/, social/JJ security/NN to/TO ease/VB the/DT closure/NN of/IN steelworks/NNS and/CC aid/VB to/TO help/VB non-competitive/JJ enterprises/NNS cease/VB trading/NN altogether/RB ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT special/JJ provision/NN of/IN up/IN to/TO EUR/$ 50/CD million/CD for/IN Greece/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, there/EX were/VBD obviously/RB problems/NNS with/IN the/DT practical/JJ administration/NN of/IN the/DT steel/NN aid/NN code/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS that/WDT were/VBD not/RB brought/VBN fully/RB to/TO bear/VB in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO waste/VB no/DT time/NN in/IN getting/VBG down/RP to/TO a/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT regulations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP to/TO succeed/VB this/DT state/NN aid/NN code/NN once/IN it/PRP has/VBZ expired/VBN ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB no/DT watering-down/NN of/IN the/DT existing/VBG principles/NNS underlying/VBG the/DT steel/NN aid/NN code/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN wants/VBZ an/DT unimpeded/JJ subsidy/NN competition/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT would/MD be/VB to/TO the/DT considerable/JJ disadvantage/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT steel/NN industry/NN has/VBZ undergone/VBN consolidation/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, Parliament/NNP believes/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT steel/NN aid/NN code/NN to/TO be/VB amended/VBN in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT industry/NN '/POS s/JJ claims/NNS about/IN unequal/JJ treatment/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO provide/VB the/DT Council/NN with/IN follow-up/NN regulations/NNS ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN so/RB far/RB the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ dragged/VBN its/PRP$ feet/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO follow-up/NN regulations/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ that/IN people/NNS are/VBP under/IN the/DT impression/NN that/IN once/IN the/DT steel/NN aid/NN code/NN expires/VBZ ,/, they/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO do/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ thing/NN again/RB without/IN the/DT inconvenience/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ supervision/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB demand/VBP that/IN once/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP expires/VBZ ,/, steel/NN aid/NN must/MD be/VB regulated/VBN by/IN a/DT Council/NNP regulation/NN according/VBG to/TO Article/NNP 94/CD ,/, for/IN that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO create/VB the/DT necessary/JJ legal/JJ validity/NN and/CC clarity/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO enforce/VB the/DT strict/JJ ban/NN on/IN all/DT aid/NN not/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT code/NN ./.

A/DT Council/NNP regulation/NN that/WDT is/VBZ directly/RB applicable/JJ law/NN must/MD also/RB be/VB observed/VBN by/IN the/DT regional/JJ governments/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO avoid/VB doing/VBG in/IN the/DT future/NN is/VBZ compromising/VBG competition/NN conditions/NNS and/CC disturbing/VBG the/DT balance/NN in/IN the/DT markets/NNS ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP to/TO criticise/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ practice/NN of/IN approving/VBG multiple/JJ aid/NN packages/NNS for/IN steel/NN enterprises/NNS which/WDT in/IN their/PRP$ view/NN ,/, do/VBP not/RB fall/VB within/IN the/DT categories/NNS of/IN the/DT code/NN ,/, even/RB given/VBN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP approved/VBD this/DT unequal/JJ treatment/NN where/WRB certain/JJ individual/JJ decisions/NNS were/VBD concerned/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB called/VBN upon/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT report/NN that/WDT has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO be/VB compiled/VBN for/IN the/DT year/NN 1999/CD ,/, to/TO give/VB a/DT detailed/JJ explanation/NN of/IN its/PRP$ active/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT elaboration/NN of/IN restructuring/VBG plans/NNS and/CC approved/VBN exemptions/NNS ,/, thus/RB enabling/VBG a/DT proper/JJ assessment/NN of/IN the/DT overall/JJ situation/NN to/TO be/VB made/VBN ./.

Once/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS has/VBZ adopted/VBN the/DT draft/NN report/NN unanimously/RB with/IN two/CD abstentions/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB that/IN we/PRP make/VBP full/JJ use/NN of/IN this/DT opportunity/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP ourselves/PRP created/VBN ,/, in/IN plenary/RB sitting/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT internal/JJ market/NN is/VBZ not/RB complete/JJ ./.

Subsidies/NNS ,/, monopolies/NNS and/CC barriers/NNS to/TO competition/NN are/VBP still/RB impeding/VBG markets/NNS and/CC development/NN alike/RB ./.

National/NNP governments/NNS provide/VBP subsidies/NNS and/CC promise/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT last/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC then/RB it/PRP happens/VBZ again/RB ./.

Subsidies/NNS distort/VBP allocations/NNS ,/, both/DT within/IN and/CC between/IN countries/NNS ./.

A/DT successive/JJ phasing/NN out/RB of/IN State/NNP aid/NN is/VBZ required/VBN ,/, and/CC more/JJR and/CC more/JJR markets/NNS must/MD be/VB opened/VBN up/RP to/TO competition/NN ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ to/TO those/DT which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN turned/VBN into/IN monopolies/NNS ,/, both/DT private/JJ and/CC public/JJ ./.

Public/NNP monopolies/NNS are/VBP ,/, more/RBR often/RB than/IN not/RB ,/, phased/VBD out/RP reluctantly/RB ./.

Increased/JJ competition/NN and/CC newly/RB established/VBN organisations/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO provide/VB significant/JJ benefits/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN welfare/NN ,/, including/VBG within/IN the/DT spheres/NNS of/IN education/NN ,/, health/NN care/NN and/CC social/JJ services/NNS ./.

Public/NNP monopolies/NNS must/MD be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN competitive/JJ structures/NNS ./.

Europe/NNP must/MD be/VB modernised/VBN ,/, made/VBN more/RBR entrepreneurial/JJ in/IN spirit/NN and/CC adapted/VBN in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT more/RBR competitive/JJ environment/NN for/IN consumers/NNS and/CC companies/NNS ./.

Effective/JJ competition/NN pushes/VBZ prices/NNS down/RP and/CC raises/VBZ standards/NNS of/IN living/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB upon/IN price/NN levels/NNS that/IN consumer/NN policy/NN has/VBZ failed/VBN to/TO focus/VB sufficiently/NNS ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, competition/NN policy/NN and/CC consumer/NN policy/NN belong/VBP together/RB ./.

The/DT internal/JJ market/NN is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN for/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ legislation/NN is/VBZ to/TO apply/VB equally/RB to/TO all/DT ,/, to/TO large/JJ and/CC small/JJ countries/NNS alike/RB ./.

A/DT systematic/JJ survey/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ national/JJ regulations/NNS is/VBZ needed/VBN if/IN barriers/NNS to/TO competition/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB dismantled/VBN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ regulations/NNS too/RB may/MD therefore/RB need/VB to/TO be/VB analysed/VBN ./.

The/DT new/JJ model/NN now/RB being/VBG tested/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ought/MD not/RB to/TO lead/VB to/TO a/DT process/NN of/IN nationalisation/NN pure/JJ and/CC simple/JJ which/WDT would/MD undermine/VB the/DT established/VBN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB effective/JJ ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB well/RB anchored/VBN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS national/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

In/IN six/CD months/NNS '/POS time/NN ,/, it/PRP may/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ to/TO carry/VB out/RP an/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT outcome/NN and/CC also/RB to/TO look/VB more/RBR closely/RB at/IN the/DT new/JJ situation/NN '/POS s/JJ effects/NNS upon/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB best/JJS to/TO make/VB further/JJ progress/NN has/VBZ so/RB far/RB been/VBN solved/VBN through/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN holding/VBG an/DT inter-institutional/JJ congress/NN which/WDT will/MD open/VB up/RP an/DT unbiased/JJ debate/NN adopting/VBG a/DT broad/JJ perspective/NN and/CC involving/VBG representatives/NNS of/IN different/JJ interests/NNS ./.

This/DT will/MD provide/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO establish/VB new/JJ principles/NNS or/CC to/TO return/VB to/TO the/DT more/RBR radical/JJ changes/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN discussed/VBN ./.

There/EX will/MD also/RB be/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO find/VB new/JJ common/JJ solutions/NNS and/CC to/TO analyse/VB amendments/NNS from/IN the/DT committee/NN debate/NN ./.

The/DT law/NN must/MD be/VB correctly/RB applied/VBN in/IN matters/NNS of/IN competition/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB updating/VBG the/DT areas/NNS where/WRB human/JJ rights/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB safeguarded/VBN ./.

Globalisation/NNP could/MD easily/RB come/VB to/TO be/VB regarded/VBN as/IN a/DT harmful/JJ process/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD therefore/RB do/VB what/WP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO update/VB the/DT areas/NNS in/IN which/WDT we/PRP can/MD intervene/VB ,/, with/IN renewed/JJ strength/NN ,/, to/TO safeguard/VB human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

All/PDT those/DT aspects/NNS should/MD be/VB part/NN of/IN a/DT rationale/NN ,/, a/DT discourse/NN and/CC a/DT contribution/NN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD bring/VB to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP hope/VBP for/IN and/CC is/VBZ the/DT cordial/JJ message/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP sending/VBG our/PRP$ governments/NNS ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP goes/VBZ against/IN their/PRP$ interests/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT saving/NN features/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ that/IN here/RB we/PRP practise/VB a/DT consistent/JJ and/CC active/JJ human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN :/: the/DT flag/NN flies/VBZ high/JJ ,/, as/IN Mrs/NNP Malmstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP put/VBD it/PRP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP shut/VBD our/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ own/JJ problems/NNS :/: to/TO the/DT violence/NN ,/, inequality/NN ,/, and/CC fourth/JJ world/NN reality/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN everyday/JJ life/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB right/JJ that/IN we/PRP pay/VBP serious/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT violations/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS that/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB the/DT subject/NN of/IN talks/NNS in/IN Geneva/NNP ./.

The/DT rhetoric/NN that/IN we/PRP use/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, often/RB smacks/VBZ of/IN smugness/NNS ,/, verging/VBG on/IN the/DT sort/NN of/IN narcissism/NN we/PRP associate/VBP with/IN human/JJ rights/NNS attitudes/NNS in/IN North/NNP America/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN less/JJR than/IN hypocritical/NN to/TO condemn/VB the/DT flagrant/JJ violation/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS that/WDT occurs/VBZ in/IN non-EU/JJ countries/NNS if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB prepared/JJ to/TO extend/VB a/DT helping/VBG hand/NN to/TO those/DT genuine/JJ refugees/NNS and/CC asylum-seekers/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ position/NN is/VBZ now/RB becoming/VBG more/RBR difficult/JJ in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

Let/VB us/PRP ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, focus/VB attention/NN on/IN the/DT re-admission/JJ clauses/NNS ,/, which/WDT present/VBP a/DT threat/NN to/TO the/DT Geneva/NNP Convention/NNP and/CC which/WDT should/MD be/VB blocked/VBN ./.

Unless/IN we/PRP can/MD maintain/VB high/JJ standards/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/TO refugees/NNS and/CC asylum-seekers/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB worthy/JJ of/IN those/DT European/JJ values/NNS which/WDT make/VBP up/RP the/DT European/JJ identity/NN ,/, as/IN Vaclav/NNP Havel/NNP said/VBD here/RB today/NN ,/, and/CC among/IN which/WDT he/PRP particularly/RB mentioned/VBD respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC solidarity/NN ./.

I/PRP worked/VBD for/IN many/JJ years/NNS on/IN the/DT South/NNP African/NNP Truth/NNP and/CC Reconciliation/NNP Commission/NNP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB moving/VBG to/TO see/VB how/WRB a/DT nation/NN in/IN such/JJ difficult/JJ circumstances/NNS was/VBD reaching/VBG out/RP for/IN a/DT more/RBR open/JJ ,/, European-style/JJ ,/, pluralistic/JJ democratic/JJ society/NN ./.

I/PRP fear/VBP that/IN we/PRP are/VBP now/RB moving/VBG in/IN the/DT opposite/JJ direction/NN ,/, towards/IN European/JJ exclusiveness/NNS and/CC apartheid/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN which/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB raised/VBN in/IN Geneva/NNP this/DT year/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP already/RB had/VBN three/CD resolutions/NNS on/IN the/DT death/NN penalty/NN approved/VBN in/IN Geneva/NNP ./.

As/IN Mr/NNP Patten/NNP said/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB him/PRP for/IN the/DT positions/NNS which/WDT he/PRP defended/VBD ,/, the/DT crucial/JJ point/NN is/VBZ China/NNP ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT positions/NNS taken/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, or/CC at/IN least/JJS the/DT presidency/NN ,/, are/VBP more/RBR than/IN just/RB a/DT hair/NN '/POS s/JJ breadth/NN apart/RP ;/: this/DT is/VBZ serious/JJ ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ macho/NN position/NN on/IN Austria/NNP ./.

Human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, which/WDT the/DT EU/NNP embraces/VBZ ,/, are/VBP thus/RB under/IN threat/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT reactions/NNS to/TO these/DT events/NNS have/VBP brought/VBN to/TO light/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT coherent/JJ framework/NN in/IN which/WDT an/DT appropriate/JJ reaction/NN can/MD be/VB formulated/VBN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB a/DT need/NN for/IN a/DT fully-fledged/JJ human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN for/IN and/CC by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, a/DT policy/NN which/WDT promotes/VBZ and/CC enforces/VBZ human/JJ rights/NNS within/IN the/DT EU/NNP itself/PRP ./.

Such/JJ policy/NN should/MD comprise/VB various/JJ components/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB :/: a/DT regulatory/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, which/WDT spells/VBZ out/RP very/RB clearly/RB the/DT rights/NNS which/WDT the/DT EU/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO secure/VB for/IN its/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

A/DT start/NN is/VBZ now/RB being/VBG made/VBN on/IN the/DT drafting/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT charter/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP can/MD no/RB longer/RB put/VB off/RP the/DT question/NN of/IN legal/JJ status/NN and/CC the/DT strategic/JJ significance/NN of/IN this/DT document/NN or/CC pass/VB it/PRP on/IN to/TO learned/JJ professional/JJ jurists/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ question/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN ,/, requires/VBZ an/DT answer/NN from/IN the/DT IGC/NNP and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

Secondly/RB :/: a/DT range/NN of/IN instruments/NNS has/VBZ to/TO be/VB developed/VBN which/WDT allow/VBP for/IN a/DT flexible/JJ response/NN and/CC which/WDT do/VBP not/RB force/VB us/PRP into/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO choose/VB between/IN a/DT kill/NN or/CC cure/NN remedy/NN or/CC a/DT complete/JJ stab/NN in/IN the/DT dark/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB :/: it/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB made/VBN clear/JJ for/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT EU/NNP institutions/NNS where/WRB the/DT responsibility/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN lies/VBZ within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC what/WP the/DT tasks/NNS and/CC competences/NNS are/VBP that/IN this/DT entails/VBZ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP will/MD each/DT have/VB to/TO decide/VB for/IN themselves/PRP what/WP these/DT might/MD be/VB ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ excluded/VBN from/IN this/DT ,/, for/IN our/PRP$ Rules/NNS of/IN Procedure/NNP stipulate/NNP that/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Civil/NNP Liberties/NNP and/CC Internal/NNP Affairs/NNPS carries/VBZ this/DT responsibility/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP am/VBP somewhat/RB surprised/JJ that/IN the/DT resolution/NN which/WDT should/MD bring/VB this/DT debate/NN on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS to/TO a/DT conclusion/NN has/VBZ been/VBN prepared/VBN in/IN the/DT foreign/JJ sector/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC that/IN the/DT aforementioned/JJ Committee/NN ,/, of/IN which/WDT I/PRP form/VBP part/NN ,/, has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN this/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT Parliament/NNP is/VBZ fragmented/JJ and/CC divided/VBN ./.

For/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN our/PRP$ credibility/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO speak/VB with/IN one/CD voice/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC not/RB act/VB as/RB if/IN human/JJ rights/NNS within/IN the/DT EU/NNP are/VBP different/JJ from/IN human/JJ rights/NNS elsewhere/RB in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT will/MD benefit/VB our/PRP$ credibility/NN in/IN the/DT UN/NNP Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Committee/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, what/WP will/MD it/PRP take/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT debate/NN on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS something/NN other/JJ than/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ today/NN :/: an/DT ideological/JJ instrument/NN which/WDT helps/VBZ to/TO enslave/VB peoples/NNS rather/RB than/IN free/JJ individuals/NNS ?/.

We/PRP must/MD start/VB by/IN going/VBG beyond/IN man/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT master/NN of/IN the/DT universe/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT source/NN of/IN all/DT genuine/JJ rights/NNS and/CC civilised/JJ values/NNS ,/, without/IN which/WDT the/DT eternal/JJ claim/NN to/TO rights/NNS always/RB ends/VBZ in/IN tyranny/NN and/CC bloodshed/VBD ./.

We/PRP need/VBP ,/, in/IN the/DT ancient/JJ and/CC mediaeval/JJ tradition/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, to/TO go/VB back/RP to/TO the/DT natural/JJ order/NN of/IN the/DT universe/NN ,/, i.e./NNP to/TO the/DT Creation/NN ,/, and/CC beyond/IN that/DT still/RB further/RBR ,/, to/TO the/DT Creator/NNP '/POS s/JJ intention/NN ./.

Then/RB we/PRP shall/MD see/VB that/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN the/DT child/NN are/VBP only/RB respected/VBN within/IN a/DT proper/JJ family/NN ,/, the/DT rights/NNS of/IN workers/NNS are/VBP only/RB respected/VBN in/IN the/DT intermediary/JJ bodies/NNS which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP recently/RB destroyed/VBN and/CC that/IN citizens/NNS '/POS rights/NNS are/VBP only/RB respected/VBN within/IN sovereign/JJ states/NNS ./.

`/`` No/DT freedom/NN for/IN the/DT enemies/NNS of/IN freedom/NN '/'' was/VBD what/WP the/DT advocates/NNS of/IN the/DT revolutionary/JJ Terror/NN were/VBD saying/VBG two/CD centuries/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT advocates/NNS of/IN the/DT revolution/NN which/WDT proved/VBD ,/, alas/UH ,/, to/TO be/VB the/DT mother/NN of/IN all/DT modern/JJ totalitarian/NN regimes/NNS ./.

No/DT human/JJ rights/NNS for/IN the/DT enemies/NNS of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS is/VBZ what/WP the/DT acolytes/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ world/NN order/NN are/VBP saying/VBG today/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ world/NN order/NN which/WDT reigns/VBZ almost/RB unchallenged/JJ in/IN financial/JJ circles/NNS ,/, in/IN international/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT media/NNS and/CC cultural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN educational/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, to/TO mention/VB but/CC a/DT few/JJ ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB if/IN he/PRP is/VBZ still/RB present/JJ and/CC can/MD hear/VB me/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT strange/JJ concept/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS when/WRB peaceful/JJ patriotism/NN is/VBZ fraudulently/RB equated/VBN with/IN aggressive/JJ nationalism/NN ,/, when/WRB legitimate/JJ protests/NNS against/IN immigration/NN policies/NNS are/VBP equated/VBN with/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP form/NN of/IN xenophobia/NN and/CC the/DT vital/JJ defence/NN of/IN identities/NNS is/VBZ equated/VBN with/IN racism/NN ./.

In/IN a/DT word/NN ,/, I/PRP shall/MD believe/VB your/PRP$ talk/NN about/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, fellow/JJ Members/NNS ,/, when/WRB you/PRP acknowledge/VBP that/IN your/PRP$ political/JJ opponents/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ rights/NNS as/IN you/PRP allow/VBP yourselves/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD believe/VB your/PRP$ talk/NN about/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN China/NNP when/WRB you/PRP name/VBP the/DT real/JJ cause/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, i.e./NNP Communism/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT principle/NN of/IN universal/JJ human/JJ rights/NNS is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ political/JJ legacies/NNS of/IN the/DT 20th/JJ century/NN ./.

The/DT holocaust/NN ,/, fifty/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ,/, led/VBD to/TO the/DT need/NN to/TO lay/VB down/RP a/DT number/NN of/IN fundamental/JJ rights/NNS and/CC freedoms/NNS ./.

Since/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT cold/JJ war/NN ,/, compliance/NN with/IN human/JJ rights/NNS has/VBZ also/RB become/VBN a/DT condition/NN for/IN international/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Leaders/NNS violating/VBG these/DT principles/NNS now/RB face/VBP international/JJ criticism/NN ,/, sanctions/VBZ and/CC are/VBP even/RB brought/VBN to/TO trial/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN ex-dictators/NNS like/IN Mr/NNP Pinochet/NNP have/VBP experienced/VBN ./.

These/DT developments/NNS are/VBP encouraging/VBG but/CC do/VBP not/RB detract/VB from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT situation/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN remains/VBZ very/RB disquieting/JJ ./.

Especially/RB in/IN situations/NNS of/IN war/NN ,/, civilians/NNS are/VBP given/VBN less/JJR consideration/NN all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ contradictory/NN ./.

Never/RB before/RB in/IN history/NN has/VBZ humanitarian/JJ right/NN been/VBN so/RB well/RB developed/VBN ./.

Never/NNP before/RB have/VBP so/RB many/DT international/JJ treaties/NNS been/VBN ratified/VBN by/IN so/RB many/JJ countries/NNS ./.

Yet/CC the/DT most/RBS basic/JJ rules/NNS of/IN conduct/NN are/VBP being/VBG flouted/VBN on/IN a/DT massive/JJ scale/NN and/CC there/EX are/VBP more/RBR civilian/JJ victims/NNS than/IN there/EX were/VBD a/DT century/NN ago/RB ./.

Women/NNP are/VBP systematically/RB raped/VBN ./.

Children/NNP are/VBP conscripted/VBN by/IN force/NN and/CC deployed/VBN in/IN battle/NN ./.

Excesses/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RB the/DT exception/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP unfortunately/RB become/VBN the/DT rule/NN ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ today/NN to/TO no/DT fewer/JJR than/IN thirty/CD conflicts/NNS worldwide/RB ./.

Too/RB late/JJ ,/, too/RB selective/JJ and/CC too/RB fragmented/JJ :/: this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB one/PRP could/MD describe/VB the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT policy/NN comes/VBZ too/RB late/JJ ./.

Both/DT in/IN Rwanda/NNP and/CC Kosovo/NNP ,/, the/DT UN/NNP ,/, despite/IN the/DT many/JJ warnings/NNS ,/, appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB overtaken/VBN by/IN events/NNS and/CC stood/VBD by/IN as/IN a/DT helpless/JJ observer/NN of/IN the/DT massacres/NNS ,/, as/IN President/NNP Havel/NNP pointed/VBD out/RP this/DT afternoon/NN ./.

Fifty/CD years/NNS later/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP still/RB unable/JJ to/TO prevent/VB genocide/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD therefore/RB direct/VB more/JJR attention/NN to/TO monitoring/NN and/CC conflict/NN prevention/NN as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

Control/NNP of/IN the/DT arms/NNS trade/NN and/CC improved/JJ media/NNS control/NN are/VBP essential/JJ in/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN is/VBZ also/RB too/RB selective/JJ ./.

The/DT months/NNS of/IN NATO/NNP bombardments/NNS of/IN Kosovo/NNP and/CC the/DT mediation/NN attempts/NNS in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP are/VBP in/IN stark/JJ contrast/NN to/TO international/JJ apathy/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT conflicts/NNS in/IN Africa/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB shake/VB off/RP the/DT impression/NN that/IN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, despite/IN all/PDT the/DT rhetoric/NN ,/, Africa/NNP does/VBZ not/RB feature/VB on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT agenda/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT I/PRP very/RB much/RB regret/VBP ./.

The/DT impression/NN that/IN Africans/NNPS get/VBP ,/, namely/RB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP inferior/JJ world/NN citizens/NNS ,/, is/VBZ not/RB unfounded/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO warn/VB against/IN a/DT blurring/NN of/IN standards/NNS in/IN the/DT assessment/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS situations/NNS in/IN Africa/NNP ,/, where/WRB violations/NNS are/VBP viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT necessary/JJ evil/NN ./.

But/CC above/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN is/VBZ too/RB fragmented/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO draft/VB a/DT common/JJ strategy/NN within/IN the/DT international/JJ communities/NNS or/CC Europe/NNP ./.

Take/VB Sudan/NNP ./.

The/DT international/JJ community/NN is/VBZ sending/VBG conflicting/VBG messages/NNS to/TO this/DT country/NN ./.

Britain/NNP has/VBZ re-opened/VBN its/PRP$ embassy/NN in/IN Khartoum/NNP ./.

Canada/NNP has/VBZ invited/VBN the/DT Sudanese/NN for/IN peace/NN talks/NNS ./.

Europe/NNP puts/VBZ the/DT rebels/NNS in/IN the/DT South/NNP under/IN pressure/NN to/TO negotiate/VB and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, Americans/NNPS isolate/VBP the/DT regime/NN and/CC support/VBP the/DT rebels/NNS at/IN military/JJ level/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN more/JJR coordination/NN ,/, more/JJR exchange/NN of/IN information/NN and/CC a/DT more/JJR coherent/JJ approach/NN whereby/WRB any/DT raised/VBN bids/NNS are/VBP avoided/VBN ./.

Only/RB then/RB can/MD we/PRP follow/VB in/IN the/DT footsteps/NNS of/IN the/DT founders/NNS of/IN the/DT Universal/NNP Declaration/NNP of/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN if/IN words/NNS could/MD solve/VB the/DT problems/NNS we/PRP could/MD all/RB pack/VB up/RP and/CC go/VB home/NN ./.

But/CC unfortunately/RB ,/, as/IN we/PRP speak/VBP today/NN in/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP ,/, human/JJ rights/NNS abuses/NNS are/VBP occurring/VBG throughout/IN the/DT free/JJ world/NN ./.

Sometimes/RB the/DT more/JJR we/PRP speak/VBP ,/, the/DT less/JJR we/PRP hear/VBP -/RB motions/NNS :/: words/NNS ;/: conventions/NNS :/: words/NNS ;/: treaties/NNS :/: words/NNS -/: if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB careful/JJ ,/, words/NNS themselves/PRP become/VBP a/DT substitute/NN for/IN real/JJ action/NN ./.

Words/NNS framed/VBN in/IN inclusive/JJ and/CC liberating/JJ documents/NNS become/VBP treaties/NNS and/CC conventions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP often/RB paraded/VBN as/IN a/DT testimony/NN to/TO a/DT country/NN 's/POS respect/NN for/IN and/CC adherence/VBN to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS ./.

Yet/CC words/NNS spoken/VBN ,/, written/VBN or/CC signed/VBN are/VBP not/RB in/IN themselves/PRP enough/JJ ./.

Look/VB at/IN the/DT signatories/NNS to/TO the/DT conventions/NNS on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC minorities/NNS and/CC then/RB compare/VB the/DT treatment/NN received/VBN by/IN such/JJ minorities/NNS ,/, groups/NNS and/CC individuals/NNS -/: the/DT list/NN is/VBZ shameful/JJ and/CC shaming/JJ ./.

Can/MD anyone/NN argue/VB with/IN any/DT persuasiveness/NNS that/IN women/NNS are/VBP treated/VBN equally/RB and/CC fairly/RB ,/, that/IN children/NNS have/VBP human/JJ rights/NNS or/CC that/IN people/NNS are/VBP not/RB discriminated/VBN against/IN because/RB of/IN their/PRP$ religion/NN ,/, belief/NN ,/, gender/NN ,/, disability/NN ,/, age/NN ,/, sexual/JJ orientation/NN ,/, opinion/NN ,/, political/JJ affiliation/NN etc/NNS ?/.

The/DT defamation/NN of/IN minorities/NNS in/IN newspapers/NNS and/CC other/JJ media/NNS fuels/NNS discrimination/NN ./.

Even/RB within/IN the/DT EU/NNP citizens/NNS still/RB suffer/VBP human/JJ rights/NNS violations/NNS and/CC a/DT breach/NN of/IN our/PRP$ conventions/NNS ./.

Every/DT day/NN in/IN the/DT press/NN misinformation/NN and/CC misrepresentation/NN are/VBP used/VBN to/TO deny/VB some/DT minorities/NNS equality/NN before/IN the/DT law/NN and/CC to/TO denigrate/VB ethnic/JJ minorities/NNS ./.

Quite/RB frankly/RB a/DT hierarchy/NN of/IN oppression/NN has/VBZ been/VBN created/VBN ./.

And/CC so/RB long/RB as/IN people/NNS do/VBP not/RB have/VB equality/NN before/IN the/DT law/NN ,/, this/DT inequality/NN will/MD lead/VB to/TO discrimination/NN and/CC human/JJ rights/NNS will/MD be/VB eroded/VBN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO give/VB this/DT some/DT thought/NN ,/, as/IN these/DT cases/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB fall/VB to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP of/IN course/NN but/CC to/TO the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP as/IN draft/NN decisions/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO consider/VB how/WRB we/PRP will/MD deal/VB with/IN situations/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

Where/WRB possible/JJ ,/, one/PRP should/MD also/RB have/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO present/VB draft/NN decisions/NNS in/IN competition/NN cases/NNS to/TO the/DT specialist/NN chamber/NN within/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP ./.

On/IN a/DT final/JJ note/NN ,/, I/PRP too/RB believe/VBP that/IN OLAF/NNP requires/VBZ monitoring/VBG under/IN rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

As/IN things/NNS stand/VBP ,/, OLAF/NNP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT vacuum/NN and/CC can/MD do/VB as/IN it/PRP pleases/VBZ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN OLAF/NNP to/TO be/VB monitored/VBN by/IN a/DT court/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ court/NN that/WDT could/MD reasonably/RB do/VB so/RB would/MD be/VB the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP ./.

That/DT would/MD be/VB another/DT way/NN of/IN spurring/VBG the/DT reform/NN process/NN on/IN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN joining/VBG those/DT who/WP congratulated/VBD the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN this/DT work/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ a/DT system/NN based/VBN on/IN law/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD therefore/RB have/VB a/DT system/NN of/IN courts/NNS to/TO enforce/VB that/DT law/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT courts/NNS can/MD not/RB deal/VB appropriately/RB and/CC expeditiously/RB with/IN the/DT legal/JJ workload/NN placed/VBN on/IN them/PRP ,/, what/WP happens/VBZ ,/, as/IN Madame/NNP Palacio/NNP Vallelersundi/NNP has/VBZ already/RB pointed/VBN out/RP ,/, is/VBZ that/IN justice/NN delayed/VBN becomes/VBZ ,/, as/IN we/PRP know/VBP ,/, justice/NN denied/VBD ./.

The/DT evidence/NN of/IN the/DT court/NN is/VBZ that/IN that/DT is/VBZ happening/VBG now/RB and/CC it/PRP points/VBZ to/TO steps/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB taken/VBN now/RB to/TO alleviate/VB the/DT problem/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Marinho/NNP has/VBZ pointed/VBN out/RP ,/, more/RBR is/VBZ necessary/JJ ,/, but/CC that/DT has/VBZ to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ,/, ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, mythology/NN tells/VBZ of/IN the/DT teeming/VBG hordes/NNS of/IN faceless/JJ Brussels/NNP bureaucrats/NNS but/CC it/PRP never/RB mentions/VBZ the/DT number/NN of/IN European/JJ judges/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP less/JJR than/IN three/CD dozen/NN at/IN the/DT apex/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ judicial/JJ order/NN -/: hardly/RB an/DT overload/NN given/VBN the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN their/PRP$ tasks/NNS at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ legal/JJ system/NN ./.

The/DT extent/NN of/IN their/PRP$ importance/NN can/MD be/VB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT political/JJ implications/NNS of/IN the/DT delay/NN in/IN resolving/VBG the/DT outstanding/JJ Anglo/French/NNP dispute/NN over/IN British/JJ beef/NN which/WDT has/VBZ caused/VBN such/JJ anger/NN in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN and/CC such/JJ frustration/NN with/IN the/DT workings/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ disputes/JJ resolution/NN procedures/NNS ./.

This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN compounded/VBN ,/, so/IN some/DT who/WP advise/VBP me/PRP believe/VB ,/, by/IN the/DT Rules/NNPS of/IN Procedure/NNP in/IN the/DT French/JJ courts/NNS which/WDT make/VBP it/PRP well/RB nigh/VBP impossible/JJ for/IN non-French/JJ nationals/NNS to/TO proceed/VB against/IN the/DT French/JJ Government/NN ./.

Certainly/RB it/PRP is/VBZ perceived/VBN de/FW facto/FW to/TO be/VB impossible/JJ ./.

This/DT contrasts/VBZ most/RBS unfavourably/JJ with/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP courts/NNS where/WRB Spanish/JJ fishermen/NNS successfully/RB brought/VBD an/DT action/NN against/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP Government/NNP in/IN circumstances/NNS which/WDT were/VBD very/RB comparable/JJ ./.

What/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN France/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, appears/VBZ prima/NN facie/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT case/NN of/IN discrimination/NN against/IN other/JJ EU/NNP nationals/NNS on/IN grounds/NNS of/IN nationality/NN and/CC as/RB such/JJ to/TO be/VB in/IN breach/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD kind/JJ enough/RB to/TO make/VB some/DT comments/NNS about/IN my/PRP$ remarks/NNS in/IN the/DT previous/JJ debate/NN ,/, to/TO look/VB into/IN this/DT and/CC to/TO report/VB back/RP to/TO Parliament/NNP and/CC to/TO me/PRP their/PRP$ findings/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ if/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP could/MD confirm/VB in/IN his/PRP$ final/JJ remarks/NNS that/IN he/PRP will/MD do/VB this/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN Commission/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO respond/VB as/IN follows/VBZ ./.

May/NNP I/PRP add/VBP that/IN ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, I/PRP listened/VBD with/IN great/JJ interest/NN to/TO the/DT pleas/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN just/RB now/RB and/CC that/IN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN sympathy/NN for/IN the/DT unease/NN which/WDT underlies/VBZ these/DT pleas/NNS ./.

The/DT unease/NN is/VBZ justified/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN more/RBR than/IN once/RB :/: justice/NN delayed/VBN is/VBZ justice/NN denied/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP sympathises/VBZ with/IN these/DT considerations/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN this/DT sympathy/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO continue/VB my/PRP$ response/NN as/IN follows/VBZ ./.

As/IN your/PRP$ Parliament/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ convinced/JJ that/IN ,/, without/IN fundamental/JJ reform/NN ,/, the/DT Community/NNP judicial/JJ bodies/NNS run/VBP the/DT risk/NN -/: in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN -/: of/IN no/RB longer/RB being/VBG able/JJ to/TO carry/VB out/RP their/PRP$ task/NN within/IN reasonable/JJ deadlines/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ of/IN the/DT request/NN made/VBN by/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN First/NNP Instance/NNP to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ number/NN of/IN judges/NNS ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, the/DT former/JJ is/VBZ of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN transfer/NN of/IN competence/NN should/MD be/VB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT study/NN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP just/RB mentioned/VBN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, once/IN this/DT study/NN is/VBZ complete/JJ ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD issue/VB its/PRP$ opinion/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN 11/CD a.m./RB tomorrow/NN ./.

Exceptional/VB financial/JJ aid/NN to/TO Kosovo/NNP ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0022/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mr/NNP Brok/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Foreign/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, Human/NNP Rights/NNPS ,/, Common/NNP Security/NNP and/CC Defence/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT Council/NNP decision/NN providing/VBG exceptional/JJ Community/NNP financial/JJ assistance/NN to/TO Kosovo/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- COM/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- 99/CD -RRB-/-RRB- 0598/CD -/: C5-0045/NNP //: 00/CD -/: 1999/0240/CD -LRB-/-LRB- CNS/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN informed/VBN that/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ been/VBN delayed/VBN for/IN several/JJ minutes/NNS ./.

I/PRP propose/VBP that/IN we/PRP start/VBP the/DT debate/NN immediately/RB ./.

He/PRP will/MD join/VB us/PRP and/CC speak/VB as/RB soon/RB as/IN he/PRP arrives/VBZ ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB give/VBP the/DT floor/NN immediately/RB to/TO Mr/NNP Bourlanges/NNPS ,/, in/IN his/PRP$ capacity/NN as/IN draftsman/NN of/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP ./.

An/DT urgent/JJ request/NN has/VBZ been/VBN referred/VBN to/TO us/PRP ,/, and/CC we/PRP approve/VBP it/PRP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN asked/VBN for/IN EUR/$ 35/CD million/CD ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP that/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB granted/VBN and/CC we/PRP call/VBP on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO be/VB extremely/RB vigilant/JJ in/IN ensuring/VBG ,/, once/IN the/DT decision/NN has/VBZ been/VBN taken/VBN ,/, that/IN the/DT amounts/NNS are/VBP set/VBN aside/RB and/CC paid/VBN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN macrofinancial/JJ aid/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP reactions/JJ to/TO this/DT in/IN some/DT quarters/NNS since/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB comply/VB with/IN the/DT liberal/JJ canons/NNS of/IN beauty/NN which/WDT stipulate/VB that/IN there/EX must/MD be/VB no/DT financial/JJ intervention/NN in/IN order/NN support/VBP an/DT administration/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB our/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ opinion/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO contribute/VB to/TO setting/VBG up/RP an/DT administration/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP and/CC that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ by/IN no/DT means/NN absurd/JJ to/TO contribute/VB directly/RB to/TO the/DT payment/NN of/IN public/JJ employees/NNS in/IN this/DT region/NN ./.

Indeed/RB that/DT is/VBZ something/NN extremely/RB useful/JJ that/IN we/PRP could/MD have/VB done/VBN in/IN Russia/NNP throughout/IN the/DT 1990s/NNS to/TO prevent/VB the/DT disintegration/NN of/IN that/DT state/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ important/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN asked/VBN for/IN payments/NNS ,/, the/DT donors/NNS have/VBP made/VBN commitments/NNS and/CC ,/, obviously/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP the/DT only/JJ ones/NNS actually/RB paying/VBG ./.

The/DT other/JJ parties/NNS are/VBP not/RB paying/VBG ./.

We/PRP wish/VBP to/TO see/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO this/DT one-sided/JJ situation/NN regarding/VBG requests/NNS for/IN financial/JJ aid/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD like/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO make/VB commitments/NNS on/IN the/DT amendments/NNS we/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG in/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

We/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO link/VB the/DT granting/NN of/IN all/DT aid/NN to/TO the/DT availability/NN of/IN the/DT amounts/NNS due/JJ from/IN the/DT other/JJ donors/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO limit/VB or/CC be/VB stingy/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ financial/JJ contribution/NN to/TO Kosovo/NNP but/CC ,/, quite/RB the/DT contrary/NN ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN our/PRP$ contribution/NN is/VBZ being/VBG matched/VBN by/IN the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN other/JJ donors/NNS ./.

From/IN that/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN facility/NN is/VBZ a/DT two-phase/JJ aid/NN facility/NN and/CC the/DT second/JJ tranche/NN must/MD be/VB released/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT donors/NNS have/VBP made/VBN clear/VB their/PRP$ interest/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP three/CD questions/NNS for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO give/VB us/PRP ,/, on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN ,/, the/DT list/NN and/CC the/DT amounts/NNS that/IN other/JJ donors/NNS contribute/VBP ./.

When/WRB we/PRP come/VBP to/TO pay/VB ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB what/WP the/DT others/NNS are/VBP paying/VBG ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO see/VB an/DT exact/JJ progress/NN report/NN on/IN the/DT invitations/NNS to/TO tender/NN and/CC the/DT schedule/NN for/IN their/PRP$ implementation/NN ./.

During/IN the/DT budgetary/JJ procedure/NN we/PRP were/VBD told/VBN that/IN the/DT funds/NNS for/IN Kosovo/NNP must/MD be/VB voted/VBN on/RP as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN yet/RB ,/, according/VBG to/TO our/PRP$ information/NN ,/, no/DT invitation/NN to/TO tender/NN has/VBZ been/VBN published/VBN or/CC initiated/VBN to/TO date/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ serious/JJ ,/, since/IN it/PRP holds/VBZ up/RP the/DT whole/JJ process/NN of/IN reconstruction/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT follows/VBZ on/RP from/IN what/WP I/PRP have/VBP just/RB said/VBN ,/, we/PRP would/MD like/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO inform/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP on/IN a/DT very/RB regular/JJ basis/NN ,/, monthly/RB ,/, regarding/VBG progress/NN on/IN payments/NNS made/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP Commission/NNP documents/NNS which/WDT speak/VBP of/IN firm/NN commitments/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB firm/NN commitments/NNS that/IN we/PRP need/VBP ,/, just/RB plain/JJ commitments/NNS would/MD suffice/VB ,/, and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB what/WP has/VBZ actually/RB been/VBN paid/VBN and/CC ,/, more/RBR especially/RB ,/, what/WP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN paid/VBN ./.

Kosovo/NNP has/VBZ suffered/VBN far/RB too/RB much/RB from/IN delays/NNS in/IN payment/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO discuss/VB Kosovo/NNP today/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN many/JJ times/NNS before/RB ,/, then/RB we/PRP should/MD also/RB start/VB by/IN taking/VBG stock/NN of/IN what/WP has/VBZ actually/RB already/RB been/VBN done/VBN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, or/CC of/IN whether/IN in/IN fact/NN anything/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN at/IN all/DT ./.

What/WP I/PRP mean/VBP to/TO say/VB is/VBZ that/IN a/DT few/JJ small/JJ steps/NNS have/VBP already/RB been/VBN made/VBN along/IN the/DT path/NN to/TO normality/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB nice/JJ if/IN they/PRP could/MD at/IN least/JJS be/VB listed/VBN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT debate/NN ./.

As/IN of/IN 9/CD February/NNP ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB something/NN known/VBN as/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP Transitional/NNP Council/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD comprise/VB representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT political/JJ parties/NNS ,/, the/DT minorities/NNS and/CC civil/JJ society/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT quasi/JJ interim/JJ parliament/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ move/NN and/CC we/PRP welcome/VBP it/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO equip/VB the/DT individuals/NNS concerned/JJ with/IN an/DT instrument/NN and/CC with/IN strategy/NN planning/NN for/IN what/WP they/PRP are/VBP actually/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO prepare/VB ,/, for/IN elections/NNS are/VBP planned/VBN for/IN the/DT autumn/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN really/RB knows/VBZ what/WP these/DT elections/NNS are/VBP to/TO lead/VB to/TO and/CC what/WP kind/NN of/IN parliament/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB formed/VBN as/IN a/DT result/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN knows/VBZ what/WP kind/NN of/IN authority/NN this/DT parliament/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO have/VB vis-脙/NNP -/: vis/NNP UNMIK/NNP ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, there/EX are/VBP quite/RB a/DT few/JJ imponderables/NNS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB being/VBG informed/VBN about/IN and/CC that/IN others/NNS are/VBP presumably/RB unable/JJ to/TO get/VB to/TO grips/NNS with/IN properly/RB either/RB ./.

Of/IN all/DT people/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Albanians/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP now/RB being/VBG integrated/VBN into/IN the/DT transitional/JJ council/NN ,/, who/WP ought/MD in/IN fact/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT little/RB more/JJR idea/NN as/IN to/TO what/WP is/VBZ in/IN store/NN for/IN them/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO list/VB again/RB the/DT things/NNS that/WDT have/VBP actually/RB already/RB been/VBN accomplished/VBN and/CC that/IN we/PRP can/MD be/VB pleased/JJ about/IN ./.

Administration-wise/NNP there/RB are/VBP now/RB 34/CD tax/NN inspectors/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ excellent/JJ news/NN !/NNS ./.

There/EX too/RB ,/, people/NNS are/VBP being/VBG encouraged/VBN to/TO pay/VB their/PRP$ taxes/NNS ,/, for/IN it/PRP will/MD not/RB do/VB in/IN the/DT long-term/JJ for/IN everyone/NN just/RB to/TO depend/VB on/IN handouts/NNS from/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC from/IN other/JJ donors/NNS ;/: some/DT of/IN the/DT money/NN for/IN these/DT activities/NNS must/MD come/VB from/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ resources/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD also/RB be/VB noted/VBN that/IN of/IN the/DT 19/CD departments/NNS ,/, 4/CD already/RB have/VBP administrative/JJ leadership/NN ,/, which/WDT represents/VBZ an/DT improvement/NN on/IN the/DT situation/NN there/RB hitherto/NN ./.

Another/DT positive/JJ development/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT old/JJ UCK/NN is/VBZ now/RB bound/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ./.

I/PRP wholly/RB endorse/VBP what/WP the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP had/VBD to/TO say/VB on/IN financing/NN and/CC believe/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD remind/VB the/DT Commission/NNP that/IN it/PRP really/RB must/MD press/VB other/JJ donors/NNS to/TO at/IN long/RB last/RB pay/VB their/PRP$ way/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB pay/VB for/IN everything/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN reconstruction/NN down/RB there/RB and/CC for/IN the/DT Fourth/JJ Pillar/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP can/MD not/RB constantly/RB be/VB called/VBN upon/RB to/TO pay/VB Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP '/POS s/JJ outstanding/JJ bills/NNS ./.

One/PRP could/MD do/VB so/RB once/RB or/CC twice/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT UN/NNP donors/NNS should/MD contribute/VB to/TO this/DT as/RB well/RB ,/, for/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT very/RB large/JJ hole/NN ,/, as/IN yet/RB unfilled/JJ ,/, that/IN we/PRP are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO fill/VB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT huge/JJ task/NN in/IN reconstruction/NN and/CC we/PRP will/MD be/VB judged/VBN according/VBG to/TO how/WRB we/PRP fulfil/VBP it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO offer/VB a/DT few/JJ explanations/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT debate/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ always/RB the/DT danger/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD repeat/VB much/RB of/IN what/WP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN said/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN two/CD points/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB it/PRP very/RB clear/JJ that/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ contributor/NN to/TO aid/VB for/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP to/TO Mrs/NNP Albright/NNP that/IN what/WP we/PRP have/VBP read/VBN recently/RB in/IN the/DT press/NN is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN figures/NNS do/VBP not/RB lie/VB ./.

Let/VB us/PRP make/VB this/DT clear/JJ ,/, however/RB much/RB some/DT people/NNS may/MD not/RB wish/VB to/TO believe/VB it/PRP ./.

The/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN to/TO assist/VB with/IN a/DT further/JJ EUR/$ 35/CD million/CD in/IN additional/JJ macrofinancial/JJ aid/NN for/IN the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN an/DT IMF/NNP report/NN which/WDT estimates/VBZ that/IN a/DT further/JJ EUR/$ 115/CD million/CD is/VBZ needed/VBN for/IN that/DT reconstruction/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB to/TO Mrs/NNP Pack/NNP that/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN complete/JJ agreement/NN with/IN her/PRP when/WRB she/PRP says/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD insist/VB that/IN other/JJ contributors/NNS fulfil/VBP their/PRP$ commitments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ concern/NN -/: which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB considerable/JJ -/: at/IN the/DT statement/NN by/IN some/DT Ministers/NNP at/IN the/DT last/JJ Ecofin/NN that/WDT says/VBZ that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB a/DT priority/NN of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP not/RB to/TO alter/VB ,/, in/IN any/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, the/DT financial/JJ perspectives/NNS agreed/VBN in/IN Berlin/NNP ./.

This/DT calls/VBZ into/IN question/NN the/DT agreement/NN which/WDT Parliament/NNP reached/VBD ,/, with/IN great/JJ difficulty/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT Council/NNP in/IN December/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO which/WDT ,/, when/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP presents/VBZ a/DT multiannual/JJ programme/NN for/IN reconstruction/NN ,/, the/DT financial/JJ perspectives/NNS would/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN where/WRB necessary/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO appeal/VB to/TO those/DT Ministers/NNP not/RB to/TO cast/VB doubt/NN upon/IN that/DT agreement/NN which/WDT was/VBD really/RB very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO reach/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, please/VB excuse/VB my/PRP$ late/JJ arrival/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT other/JJ political/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ still/RB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN today/NN ,/, more/JJR is/VBZ the/DT pity/NN ./.

The/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Foreign/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, Human/NNP Rights/NNP ,/, Common/NNP Security/NNP and/CC Defence/NNP Policy/NNP would/MD advise/VB you/PRP to/TO release/VB the/DT EUR/$ 35/CD million/CD ,/, and/CC this/DT piece/NN of/IN advice/NN is/VBZ given/VBN because/IN this/DT money/NN can/MD truly/RB benefit/VB those/DT in/IN need/NN ./.

The/DT things/NNS that/WDT have/VBP given/VBN us/PRP cause/NN for/IN criticism/NN are/VBP not/RB so/RB serious/JJ as/IN to/TO stop/VB us/PRP wanting/VBG to/TO help/VB the/DT people/NNS there/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN we/PRP will/MD forget/VB the/DT criticism/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN we/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT lot/NN further/RBR on/IN in/IN our/PRP$ procedure/NN if/IN the/DT Council/NNP administration/NN had/VBD not/RB forgotten/VBN to/TO inform/VB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP in/IN good/JJ time/NN and/CC to/TO provide/VB it/PRP with/IN official/JJ documents/NNS ./.

Only/RB then/RB would/MD we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO conduct/VB proper/JJ and/CC searching/VBG discussions/NNS ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT administration/NN to/TO see/VB to/TO it/PRP that/IN this/DT does/VBZ not/RB happen/VB in/IN future/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB because/IN there/EX are/VBP people/NNS in/IN need/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO overlook/VB this/DT ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB sure/JJ to/TO introduce/VB certain/JJ conditions/NNS here/RB ./.

One/CD condition/NN is/VBZ that/IN money/NN should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO those/DT who/WP will/MD make/VB sensible/JJ use/NN of/IN it/PRP and/CC not/RB to/TO those/DT who/WP might/MD use/VB it/PRP for/IN pursuing/VBG other/JJ aims/NNS ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT money/NN falls/VBZ to/TO Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP '/POS s/JJ sphere/NN of/IN competence/NN and/CC not/RB to/TO other/JJ spheres/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, even/RB if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP adopt/VBP a/DT different/JJ position/NN on/IN this/DT because/IN they/PRP see/VBP real/JJ problems/NNS there/RB ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT other/JJ donors/NNS must/MD also/RB fulfil/VB the/DT obligations/NNS they/PRP have/VBP entered/VBN into/IN ./.

This/DT mission/NN is/VBZ being/VBG conducted/VBN under/IN the/DT auspices/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB have/VB a/DT situation/NN where/WRB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ one/NN to/TO fulfil/VB its/PRP$ obligations/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ no/DT less/RBR incumbent/JJ on/IN the/DT other/JJ donor/NN countries/NNS to/TO fulfil/VB their/PRP$ obligations/NNS within/IN this/DT timeframe/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT persons/NNS affected/VBN ./.

This/DT brings/VBZ me/PRP onto/IN the/DT point/NN that/IN in/IN future/NN we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO concern/VB ourselves/PRP much/RB more/RBR intensively/RB with/IN this/DT issue/NN in/IN general/JJ terms/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, not/RB just/RB with/IN this/DT specific/JJ project/NN but/CC with/IN overall/JJ developments/NNS in/IN south-east/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC with/IN the/DT aid/NN delivered/VBN there/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ another/DT example/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO help/VB and/CC to/TO give/VB money/NN but/CC the/DT political/JJ leadership/NN lacks/VBZ coherence/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP so/RB many/JJ coordinators/NNS ,/, who/WP ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, are/VBP responsible/JJ to/TO so/RB many/JJ employers/NNS ,/, that/IN we/PRP will/MD soon/RB have/VB to/TO employ/VB a/DT coordinator/NN for/IN the/DT coordinators/NNS ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ thinking/VBG seriously/RB about/IN how/WRB to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ,/, but/CC if/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ doing/VBG the/DT most/JJS work/NN out/IN there/RB ,/, then/RB it/PRP should/MD also/RB be/VB given/VBN the/DT leadership/NN ,/, and/CC bring/VB coherence/NN to/TO the/DT situation/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD be/VB of/IN real/JJ assistance/NN to/TO the/DT people/NNS ./.

It/PRP makes/VBZ no/DT sense/NN at/IN all/DT for/IN the/DT various/JJ international/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC associations/JJ to/TO be/VB engaged/VBN in/IN competition/NN amongst/IN themselves/PRP rather/RB than/IN investing/VBG all/PDT their/PRP$ energies/NNS in/IN helping/VBG the/DT people/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, when/WRB the/DT Alliance/NNP intervened/VBD in/IN Kosovo/NNP its/PRP$ objective/NN was/VBD to/TO re-establish/VB conditions/NNS in/IN this/DT province/NN which/WDT would/MD enable/VB those/DT who/WP wished/VBD to/TO do/VB so/RB to/TO stay/VB there/RB or/CC return/VB ,/, with/IN respect/NN for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ heritage/NN and/CC their/PRP$ own/JJ culture/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT Alliance/NNP is/VBZ still/RB active/JJ in/IN that/DT region/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ with/IN the/DT same/JJ objective/NN ./.

The/DT day/NN before/IN yesterday/NN I/PRP was/VBD pleased/JJ to/TO hear/VB an/DT interview/NN given/VBN by/IN the/DT KFOR/JJ commander/NN showing/VBG how/WRB much/JJ better/JJR matters/NNS in/IN connection/NN with/IN this/DT in/IN Kosovo/NNP were/VBD starting/VBG to/TO be/VB ,/, particularly/RB as/IN regards/VBZ security/NN ,/, crime/NN levels/NNS had/VBD been/VBN restored/VBN to/TO an/DT acceptable/JJ level/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD work/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT province/NN and/CC indeed/RB throughout/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS generally/RB ,/, the/DT rule/NN of/IN shopkeepers/NNS follows/VBZ the/DT rule/NN of/IN the/DT warlords/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN economic/JJ aid/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, certainly/RB an/DT essential/JJ element/NN to/TO the/DT scope/NN of/IN action/NN afforded/VBN those/DT people/NNS active/JJ at/IN the/DT grass/NN roots/NNS level/NN ./.

The/DT West/NNP fought/VBD for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP and/CC what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG there/RB today/NN ?/.

Every/DT single/JJ day/NN there/RB are/VBP attacks/NNS on/IN Serbs/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT Roma/NNP ,/, on/IN Bosnians/NNP ,/, but/CC attacks/NNS are/VBP also/RB still/RB carried/VBN out/RP on/IN Albanians/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP keen/JJ that/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, particularly/RB those/DT in/IN Objective/NNP 1/CD ,/, are/VBP allocated/VBN where/WRB needed/VBD ./.

We/PRP have/VBP criteria/NNS which/WDT are/VBP applied/VBN and/CC we/PRP know/VBP roughly/RB what/WP each/DT of/IN the/DT regions/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP should/MD or/CC could/MD receive/VB ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP must/MD discuss/VB these/DT matters/NNS with/IN the/DT national/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC government/NN of/IN each/DT country/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB avoiding/VBG the/DT issue/NN but/CC I/PRP must/MD abide/VB by/IN the/DT general/JJ Regulation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN these/DT authorities/NNS and/CC governments/NNS to/TO allocate/VB the/DT funds/NNS as/RB objectively/RB and/CC fairly/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB about/IN this/DT allocation/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP said/VBD that/IN I/PRP could/MD not/RB answer/VB today/NN ./.

Lastly/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB the/DT Commissioner/NNP a/DT specific/JJ question/NN :/: Do/VBP you/PRP consider/VB it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO change/VB the/DT implementing/JJ regulations/NNS for/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS or/CC do/VB you/PRP consider/VB the/DT current/JJ distribution/NN criteria/NNS to/TO be/VB acceptable/JJ ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT fascinating/JJ debate/NN which/WDT I/PRP realise/VBP is/VBZ not/RB totally/RB Community-related/JJ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO give/VB an/DT opinion/NN on/IN any/DT amendment/NN to/TO the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS Regulation/NN ./.

In/IN view/NN of/IN this/DT unusual/JJ situation/NN ,/, will/MD the/DT Commission/NNP say/VB why/WRB the/DT OHIM/NNP has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB moved/VBN to/TO its/PRP$ new/JJ premises/NNS ?/.

The/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP asked/VBD a/DT question/NN on/IN this/DT topic/NN in/IN November/NNP 1999/CD and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO refer/VB him/PRP to/TO the/DT answer/NN given/VBN at/IN the/DT time/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN the/DT president/NN of/IN the/DT Office/NNP for/IN Harmonisation/NNP in/IN the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB the/DT Office/NN in/IN Alicante/NNP ,/, to/TO comment/VB further/RBR on/IN this/DT new/JJ question/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, inform/VB the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN as/IN follows/VBZ ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Office/NNP :/: ./.

The/DT Office/NNP is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB ready/JJ to/TO move/VB into/IN the/DT new/JJ building/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN deadlines/NNS have/VBP been/VBN exceeded/VBN ./.

The/DT OHIM/NNP is/VBZ now/RB in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN arranging/VBG this/DT and/CC is/VBZ expecting/VBG to/TO move/VB into/IN the/DT new/JJ premises/NNS by/IN June/NNP ./.

During/IN the/DT previous/JJ question/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD discussing/VBG electoral/JJ issues/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP had/VBD been/VBN there/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN ashamed/JJ ./.

The/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC some/DT secretaries/NNS were/VBD present/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN an/DT election/NN campaign/NN ,/, a/DT series/NN of/IN authorities/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN them/PRP run/VBN by/IN the/DT party/NN in/IN government/NN ,/, made/VBD clearly/RB electioneering/VBG speeches/NNS which/WDT ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, were/VBD broadcast/VBN live/RB on/IN television/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD bizarre/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Region/NNP of/IN Valencia/NNP praising/VBG the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ Government/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ work/NN ,/, although/IN it/PRP was/VBD irrelevant/JJ to/TO that/DT event/NN ./.

The/DT opening/NN of/IN a/DT building/NN which/WDT was/VBD not/RB finished/VBN ,/, in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN an/DT election/NN campaign/NN ,/, which/WDT eight/CD months/NNS after/IN the/DT opening/NN can/MD still/RB not/RB be/VB occupied/VBN ,/, makes/VBZ the/DT Spanish/JJ Government/NN look/VBP ridiculous/JJ ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB worried/VBN that/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ Government/NN should/MD look/VB foolish/JJ ,/, because/IN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN it/PRP was/VBD their/PRP$ responsibility/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ worry/VB me/PRP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD look/VB foolish/JJ by/IN endorsing/VBG ,/, through/IN its/PRP$ presence/NN ,/, this/DT absurd/JJ event/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO ask/VB you/PRP ,/, Mr/NNP Commissioner/NNP :/: does/VBZ it/PRP seem/VBP normal/JJ to/TO you/PRP that/IN an/DT unfinished/JJ building/NN should/MD be/VB opened/VBN during/IN an/DT election/NN campaign/NN ?/.

Does/NNP it/PRP seem/VB normal/JJ to/TO you/PRP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD attend/VB such/PDT an/DT absurd/JJ event/NN organised/VBN by/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ Government/NN ?/.

It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB fall/VB within/IN my/PRP$ remit/NN to/TO make/VB statements/NNS about/IN internal/JJ political/JJ situations/NNS within/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP or/CC another/DT ./.

As/IN such/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB to/TO withhold/VB any/DT comment/NN on/IN the/DT situation/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Berenguer/NNP has/VBZ just/RB described/VBN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO confess/VB that/IN I/PRP fail/VBP to/TO comprehend/VB why/WRB a/DT certain/JJ opening/NN ceremony/NN was/VBD held/VBN in/IN Spain/NNP ./.

What/WP I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT building/NN will/MD now/RB be/VB occupied/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT building/NN will/MD then/RB be/VB occupied/VBN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT electoral/JJ question/NN ./.

As/IN members/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP followed/VBN the/DT creation/NN of/IN that/DT institution/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD established/VBN for/IN electioneering/VBG reasons/NNS ./.

A/DT year/NN later/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB not/RB functioning/VBG ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP spent/VBD money/NN on/IN a/DT false/JJ opening/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD ask/VB ourselves/PRP to/TO what/WP extent/NN this/DT spending/NN of/IN funds/NNS was/VBD justified/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO reiterate/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ unconcerned/JJ with/IN the/DT underlying/VBG motivation/NN of/IN Member/NNP State/NNP actions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, interested/JJ in/IN official/JJ statements/NNS and/CC actions/NNS ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB intend/VB to/TO go/VB in/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ termed/VBN in/IN French/JJ un/NN proc脙拧s/NNS d'intention/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN with/IN public/JJ official/NN actions/NNS and/CC events/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN any/DT possible/JJ underlying/JJ motivation/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP also/RB difficult/JJ to/TO meet/VB Mr/NNP Medina/NNP halfway/RB and/CC respond/VB to/TO his/PRP$ question/NN ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB speculate/VB why/WRB something/NN is/VBZ happening/VBG earlier/RBR or/CC later/RBR than/IN planned/JJ ./.

It/PRP only/RB appreciates/VBZ that/IN a/DT building/NN for/IN this/DT Office/NNP is/VBZ opened/VBN and/CC occupied/VBD as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Also/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB engage/VB itself/PRP in/IN finding/VBG out/RP whether/IN certain/JJ expenditure/NN was/VBD real/JJ or/CC virtual/JJ ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, all/DT expenditure/NN is/VBZ real/JJ ./.

And/CC any/DT remaining/VBG skeletons/NNS ,/, I/PRP intend/VBP to/TO leave/VB them/PRP in/IN the/DT cupboard/NN ./.

This/DT derogation/NN from/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN goods/NNS lapses/NNS on/IN 30/CD June/NNP of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ principle/NN governing/VBG the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC derogations/NNS from/IN this/DT principle/NN must/MD be/VB exceptions/NNS and/CC must/MD be/VB limited/VBN in/IN time/NN ./.

This/DT certainly/RB does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB share/VB the/DT concern/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP surrounding/VBG the/DT possible/JJ health/NN problems/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB caused/VBN by/IN alcohol/NN abuse/NN ./.

A/DT recent/JJ study/NN ,/, carried/VBN out/RP by/IN Professor/NNP Lindgren/NNP of/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN Lund/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN abolishing/VBG the/DT restrictions/NNS would/MD not/RB lead/VB to/TO a/DT higher/JJR alcohol/NN consumption/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP already/RB had/VBN a/DT chance/NN to/TO discuss/VB my/PRP$ position/NN with/IN Mr/NNP Ringholm/NNP ,/, the/DT Swedish/NNP Finance/NNP Minister/NNP on/IN two/CD occasions/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB discussed/VBD this/DT matter/NN with/IN the/DT Swedish/JJ parliamentary/JJ Finance/NNP committee/NN last/JJ week/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ now/RB up/RB to/TO the/DT Swedish/JJ government/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT necessary/JJ measures/NNS ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP for/IN your/PRP$ reply/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO apologise/VB for/IN the/DT error/NN in/IN my/PRP$ question/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Instead/RB of/IN 2004/CD ,/, it/PRP should/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB 1/CD July/NNP 2000/CD ./.

I/PRP have/VBP some/DT sympathy/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS standpoint/NN that/IN derogations/NNS should/MD only/RB be/VB granted/VBN occasionally/RB ./.

Such/PDT a/DT rule/NN is/VBZ only/RB normal/JJ ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB two/CD questions/NNS :/: Are/VBP you/PRP thinking/VBG of/IN embarking/VBG upon/IN continued/JJ discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT Swedish/JJ Government/NN about/IN extending/VBG the/DT derogations/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN for/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN Denmark/CD and/CC Finland/NNP have/VBP derogations/VBZ ?/.

My/PRP$ second/JJ question/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ policy/NN on/IN alcohol/NN ./.

This/DT may/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB seen/VBN as/IN an/DT issue/NN concerning/VBG the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB as/IN a/DT public/JJ health/NN matter/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ EU/NN ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT respective/JJ roles/NNS of/IN alcohol/NN policy/NN and/CC public/JJ health/NN considerations/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS work/NN ?/.

A/DT Europe-wide/JJ policy/NN on/IN alcohol/NN is/VBZ not/RB just/RB an/DT issue/NN concerning/VBG the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB has/VBZ important/JJ implications/NNS for/IN public/JJ health/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP had/VBD considered/VBN these/DT aspects/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ overall/JJ context/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN easier/JJR to/TO carry/VB on/IN a/DT dialogue/NN with/IN Sweden/NNP ./.

May/NNP I/PRP thank/VBP Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP for/IN the/DT supplement/NN to/TO his/PRP$ first/JJ question/NN and/CC may/MD I/PRP answer/VBP that/IN question/NN as/RB follows/VBZ ?/.

Firstly/RB ,/, Finland/NNP and/CC Denmark/NNP are/VBP subject/JJ to/TO exemptions/VB to/TO the/DT basic/JJ rule/NN of/IN the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN goods/NNS until/IN 2003/CD ./.

These/DT countries/NNS are/VBP in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN taking/VBG measures/NNS in/IN preparation/NN of/IN free/JJ access/NN of/IN alcoholic/JJ products/NNS in/IN the/DT year/NN 2003/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Sweden/NNP ,/, the/DT situation/NN is/VBZ different/JJ ./.

In/IN 1995/CD ,/, a/DT five-year/JJ derogation/NN period/NN was/VBD decided/VBN upon/RB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ now/RB lapsing/VBG ./.

I/PRP have/VBP as/RB yet/CC not/RB heard/VBN any/DT arguments/NNS on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP would/MD need/VB to/TO extend/VB this/DT period/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT Swedish/JJ Government/NN is/VBZ being/VBG consulted/VBN all/PDT the/DT way/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, I/PRP understand/VBP very/RB well/RB that/IN the/DT health/NN aspect/NN of/IN this/DT matter/NN is/VBZ naturally/RB important/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD repeat/VB at/IN this/DT juncture/NN what/WP Professor/NNP Lindgren/NNP of/IN Lund/NNP University/NNP has/VBZ stated/VBN ,/, namely/RB that/IN whatever/WDT happens/VBZ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN import/NN restrictions/NNS ,/, the/DT consumption/NN of/IN alcohol/NN will/MD remain/VB the/DT same/JJ ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ then/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, where/WRB does/VBZ the/DT volume/NN of/IN alcohol/NN originate/VB from/IN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB imported/VBN by/IN travellers/NNS ?/.

The/DT answer/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ smuggled/VBN into/IN the/DT country/NN or/CC made/VBN by/IN the/DT Swedes/NNS themselves/PRP ,/, and/CC as/IN Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP knows/VBZ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB dangerous/JJ and/CC unhealthy/JJ activity/NN ./.

Well/RB now/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO think/VB that/IN the/DT health/NN situation/NN will/MD improve/VB if/IN we/PRP restrict/VBP the/DT import/NN of/IN alcohol/NN ./.

But/CC in/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ Sweden/NNP ,/, but/CC all/DT EU/NNP countries/NNS ,/, should/MD then/RB be/VB subject/JJ to/TO a/DT total/JJ ban/NN on/IN alcohol/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD cast/VB our/PRP$ minds/NNS back/RP to/TO a/DT similar/JJ situation/NN in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP will/MD be/VB familiar/JJ with/IN what/WP was/VBD termed/VBN then/RB `/`` prohibition/NN '/'' ./.

He/PRP will/MD also/RB be/VB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT effects/NNS the/DT ban/NN had/VBD on/IN Mafia/NNP activity/NN within/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ,/, where/WRB ,/, eventually/RB ,/, prohibition/NN was/VBD withdrawn/VBN ./.

All/PDT this/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO protect/VB health/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB by/IN banning/VBG alcohol/NN ,/, because/IN that/DT does/VBZ not/RB work/VB ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN refers/VBZ to/TO whether/IN you/PRP too/RB know/VBP of/IN studies/NNS which/WDT state/VBP that/IN a/DT moderate/JJ intake/NN of/IN good/JJ quality/NN alcohol/NN such/JJ as/IN Franconian/JJ wine/NN or/CC Bavarian/JJ beer/NN is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN you/PRP and/CC would/MD therefore/RB also/RB be/VB good/JJ for/IN the/DT Swedish/JJ budget/NN ./.

I/PRP gather/VBP that/IN Mr/NNP Posselt/NNP has/VBZ hinted/VBN at/IN the/DT fiscal/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB happen/VBP to/TO know/VB that/IN the/DT high/JJ tax/NN on/IN alcohol/NN products/NNS in/IN Sweden/NNP goes/VBZ back/RP to/TO the/DT year/NN 1638/CD and/CC that/IN since/IN then/RB ,/, the/DT sale/NN of/IN alcohol/NN products/NNS has/VBZ accounted/VBN for/IN a/DT significant/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN '/POS s/JJ tax/NN revenue/NN ./.

As/IN is/VBZ known/VBN ,/, this/DT has/VBZ led/VBN to/TO a/DT state/NN monopoly/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP which/WDT ,/, in/IN itself/PRP ,/, is/VBZ at/IN odds/NNS with/IN Union/NNP legislation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP listened/VBD with/IN interest/NN to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP 's/POS reply/NN about/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO apply/VB the/DT laws/NNS of/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN ./.

Can/MD we/PRP now/RB expect/VB the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP to/TO take/VB action/NN against/IN the/DT French/JJ Republic/NN before/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP ?/.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO reply/VB very/JJ briefly/NN to/TO the/DT question/NN raised/VBN by/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN ,/, since/IN this/DT matter/NN is/VBZ now/RB under/IN active/JJ consideration/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ to/TO take/VB a/DT decision/NN on/IN whether/IN the/DT matter/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ or/CC whether/IN it/PRP should/MD refer/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ reply/NN is/VBZ perhaps/RB not/RB satisfactory/JJ right/RB now/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO assure/VB the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD take/VB that/DT decision/NN within/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN weeks/NNS ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP for/IN the/DT Member/NNP 's/POS understanding/NN for/IN this/DT small/JJ delay/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS decision/NN ./.

Commissioner/WRB ,/, do/VBP you/PRP have/VBP any/DT reason/NN ,/, on/IN public/JJ health/NN grounds/NNS ,/, for/IN a/DT difference/NN in/IN the/DT taxation/NN rates/NNS on/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Scotch/NNP whisky/NN or/CC French/JJ Bordeaux/NNP wine/NN or/CC even/RB my/PRP$ colleague/NN 's/POS Bavarian/JJ beer/NN ?/.

Can/MD you/PRP envisage/VB applying/VBG an/DT alcohol/NN -/: equivalent/JJ basis/NN for/IN taxation/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ?/.

The/DT matter/NN of/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS ,/, to/TO which/WDT the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP is/VBZ referring/VBG ,/, is/VBZ the/DT prerogative/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP concerned/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ no/DT instruments/NNS to/TO enforce/VB any/DT particular/JJ decrease/NN or/CC increase/VB in/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS on/IN alcoholic/JJ products/NNS or/CC on/IN any/DT other/JJ products/NNS ./.

Towards/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD submit/VB a/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT differences/NNS in/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

It/PRP will/MD no/DT doubt/NN engage/VB in/IN a/DT discussion/NN both/DT with/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP on/IN this/DT state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ,/, which/WDT indicates/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP quite/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN differences/NNS in/IN excise/NN rates/NNS between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

For/IN example/NN -/: I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT honourable/JJ Member/NNP referred/VBD to/TO this/DT -/: no/DT excise/NN taxes/NNS are/VBP applied/VBN on/IN wine/NN in/IN France/NNP ,/, whereas/IN they/PRP are/VBP applied/VBN in/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

That/DT leads/VBZ to/TO a/DT distortion/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN because/IN wine/NN is/VBZ smuggled/VBN from/IN France/NNP to/TO the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

The/DT question/NN specifically/RB refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT relation/NN between/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS and/CC the/DT alcohol/NN content/NN of/IN the/DT goods/NNS subject/NN to/TO excise/VB tax/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ no/DT means/NN of/IN influence/NN here/RB ./.

In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Sweden/NNP ,/, the/DT instrument/NN of/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS is/VBZ indeed/RB used/VBN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT consumption/NN of/IN alcohol/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT quite/RB exciting/JJ debate/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.

A/DT conference/NN where/WRB the/DT issues/NNS are/VBP properly/RB debated/VBN will/MD make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO straighten/VB out/RP misunderstandings/NNS ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN perhaps/RB improving/VBG upon/IN certain/JJ points/NNS ./.

Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD together/RB increase/VB their/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO achieve/VB an/DT effective/JJ competition/NN policy/NN and/CC so/RB create/VB new/JJ opportunities/NNS and/CC new/JJ resources/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN of/IN Stockholm/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP many/JJ good/JJ local/JJ examples/NNS of/IN increased/VBN supply/NN and/CC improved/VBN quality/NN which/WDT have/VBP arisen/VBN precisely/RB because/IN of/IN exposure/NN to/TO competition/NN in/IN areas/NNS which/WDT were/VBD previously/RB total/JJ monopolies/NNS ./.

We/PRP would/MD encourage/VB a/DT continuation/NN of/IN the/DT open/JJ debate/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN strengthened/VBN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN consideration/NN of/IN the/DT reports/NNS by/IN Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT legal/JJ points/NNS of/IN view/NN will/MD also/RB be/VB accorded/VBN the/DT importance/NN which/WDT is/VBZ only/RB reasonable/JJ in/IN a/DT state/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT new/JJ Member/NN I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO make/VB my/PRP$ maiden/JJ speech/NN here/RB today/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT delay/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN thanking/VBG the/DT rapporteurs/NNS Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, for/IN their/PRP$ excellent/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Competition/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB fundamental/JJ to/TO the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN and/CC European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ a/DT success/NN story/NN ;/: take/VB the/DT energy/NN and/CC telecommunications/NN sectors/NNS ,/, where/WRB there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT demonstrable/JJ lowering/NN of/IN prices/NNS and/CC improvement/NN in/IN quality/NN of/IN service/NN ./.

All/PDT this/DT is/VBZ to/TO the/DT good/NN of/IN the/DT consumer/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP now/RB arrived/VBN at/IN a/DT point/NN where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO develop/VB competition/NN policy/NN further/RBR ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RP a/DT new/JJ White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN this/DT containing/VBG two/CD key/JJ points/NNS :/: dropping/VBG the/DT obligation/NN to/TO notify/VB and/CC retrodisplacement/VB of/IN law/NN enforcement/NN ./.

Dropping/VBG the/DT obligation/NN to/TO notify/VB will/MD mean/VB less/RBR red/JJ tape/NN and/CC administration/NN costs/NNS ,/, at/IN any/DT rate/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, this/DT change/NN of/IN system/NN will/MD also/RB lead/VB to/TO more/JJR onus/NN being/VBG placed/VBN on/IN the/DT individual/NN in/IN the/DT business/NN world/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD no/RB longer/RB simply/RB be/VB a/DT case/NN of/IN submitting/VBG papers/NNS and/CC having/VBG them/PRP approved/VBN ;/: for/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, each/DT person/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO take/VB responsibility/NN themselves/PRP ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ probably/RB why/WRB there/EX is/VBZ unease/NN about/IN this/DT in/IN other/JJ quarters/NNS ./.

However/RB I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP should/MD use/VB this/DT opportunity/NN for/IN Europe/NNP to/TO set/VB down/RP a/DT marker/NN for/IN less/RBR red/JJ tape/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ point/NN relates/VBZ to/TO the/DT retrodisplacement/NN of/IN law/NN enforcement/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO create/VB a/DT culture/NN of/IN law/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, then/RB there/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT law/NN must/MD be/VB applied/VBN not/RB only/JJ by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, by/IN central/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB by/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, by/IN national/JJ courts/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB discussing/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN although/IN every/DT EU/NNP law/NN is/VBZ only/RB ever/RB decided/VBN on/IN centrally/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT adaptation/NN phase/NN where/WRB we/PRP will/MD experience/VB a/DT lack/NN of/IN legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO develop/VB an/DT instrument/NN for/IN this/DT in/IN the/DT anticipated/JJ legislative/JJ procedure/NN that/WDT will/MD enable/VB enterprises/NNS to/TO enjoy/VB legal/JJ certainty/NN and/CC to/TO have/VB recourse/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

The/DT way/NN to/TO a/DT European/JJ monopolies/NNS commission/NN must/MD be/VB kept/VBN clear/JJ ,/, something/NN that/WDT will/MD certainly/RB form/VB a/DT subject/NN for/IN future/JJ discussion/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP need/VBP there/EX to/TO be/VB more/RBR transparency/JJ in/IN the/DT competition/NN policy/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP must/MD have/VB more/JJR involvement/NN and/CC I/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN if/IN we/PRP were/VBD to/TO introduce/VB a/DT register/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP could/MD ascertain/VB what/WP state/NN aid/NN is/VBZ being/VBG granted/VBN ,/, then/RB this/DT would/MD encourage/VB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO be/VB more/RBR disciplined/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO what/WP the/DT future/NN holds/VBZ for/IN competition/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP two/CD issues/NNS dear/VBN to/TO my/PRP$ heart/NN ./.

One/PRP is/VBZ subsidiarity/JJ ./.

We/PRP all/DT hold/VBP the/DT view/NN that/IN competition/NN is/VBZ vital/JJ to/TO the/DT economy/NN and/CC requires/VBZ there/EX to/TO be/VB efficiency/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP should/MD also/RB permit/VB competition/NN in/IN the/DT regions/NNS ./.

Competition/NN between/IN the/DT regions/NNS will/MD certainly/RB strengthen/VB rather/RB than/IN weaken/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD cite/VB ,/, by/IN way/NN of/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN job/NN creation/NN schemes/NNS ,/, savings/NNS banks/NNS and/CC regional/JJ banks/NNS ,/, and/CC G脙艗tesiegel/NNP ./.

Here/RB ,/, a/DT region/NN has/VBZ ,/, by/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ efforts/NNS ,/, created/VBD a/DT means/NN of/IN marketing/VBG its/PRP$ own/JJ products/NNS ./.

This/DT own/JJ initiative/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB destroyed/VBN by/IN European/JJ intervention/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP there/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT need/NN to/TO raise/VB the/DT de/NNP minimis/NNS regulation/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD do/VB everything/NN within/IN our/PRP$ power/NN to/TO force/VB the/DT regions/NNS into/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB they/PRP have/VBP to/TO compete/VB with/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ point/NN relates/VBZ to/TO discussion/NN about/IN competition/NN and/CC the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN ,/, although/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO talk/VB about/IN market/NN failure/NN just/RB now/RB ./.

I/PRP have/VBP already/RB referred/VBN to/TO the/DT regional/JJ and/CC savings/NN bank/NN sector/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN a/DT matter/NN one/PRP hears/VBZ again/RB and/CC again/RB in/IN certain/JJ quarters/NNS ./.

These/DT days/NNS ,/, someone/NN who/WP lives/VBZ in/IN an/DT old/JJ people/NNS '/POS s/JJ home/NN is/VBZ accommodated/VBN within/IN the/DT social/JJ field/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP could/MD also/RB regard/VB them/PRP as/IN a/DT customer/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP should/MD enter/VB into/IN rather/RB clear/JJ and/CC timely/JJ discussion/NN on/IN the/DT ways/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT social/JJ field/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ evolved/VBN structures/NNS ,/, stifle/VB competition/NN ./.

Apart/RB from/IN that/DT ,/, I/PRP could/MD refer/VB to/TO any/DT customers/NNS ,/, any/DT sector/NN ,/, as/IN customers/NNS ,/, and/CC thereby/RB have/VB a/DT highly/RB destructive/JJ effect/NN on/IN social/JJ fields/NNS ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP Radwan/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB you/PRP on/IN what/WP is/VBZ referred/VBN to/TO in/IN German/JJ parliamentary-speak/NN ,/, inappropriately/RB in/IN your/PRP$ case/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT maiden/JJ speech/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG on/IN behalf/NN of/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ Member/NN ,/, Robert/NNP Goebbels/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ unable/JJ to/TO attend/VB due/JJ to/TO a/DT political/JJ commitment/NN ./.

Within/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, the/DT Jonckheer/NNP report/NN has/VBZ given/VBN rise/NN to/TO bitter/JJ controversy/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

A/DT slim/JJ right-wing/JJ majority/NN succeeded/VBD in/IN removing/VBG any/DT reference/NN to/TO market/NN failures/NNS ./.

Even/RB if/IN the/DT majority/NN in/IN this/DT House/NNP were/VBD to/TO adhere/VB to/TO this/DT ultraliberal/JJ idea/NN of/IN a/DT supposedly/RB perfect/JJ market/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD not/RB make/VB any/DT difference/NN to/TO the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.

Economic/JJ relationships/NNS in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN adequately/RB demonstrate/VBP that/IN eliminating/VBG all/DT public/JJ intervention/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN does/VBZ not/RB in/IN any/DT way/NN bring/VB about/IN perfect/JJ competition/NN and/CC the/DT optimum/JJ distribution/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./.

While/IN ,/, since/IN the/DT dawn/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, the/DT market/NN has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT key/JJ forum/NN for/IN human/JJ interchange/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN perfect/JJ ./.

The/DT market/NN favours/VBZ the/DT short/JJ term/NN and/CC immediate/JJ profits/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, the/DT balance/NN of/IN power/NN between/IN supply/NN and/CC demand/NN are/VBP generally/RB to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN the/DT weakest/JJS parties/NNS ,/, consumers/NNS and/CC workers/NNS ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO function/VB ,/, the/DT market/NN needs/VBZ rules/NNS ./.

The/DT necessary/JJ and/CC valuable/JJ spirit/NN of/IN initiative/NN must/MD be/VB offset/VBN by/IN a/DT sense/NN of/IN responsibility/NN towards/IN society/NN ./.

We/PRP European/NNP Socialists/NNPS are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT market/NN economy/NN with/IN a/DT social/JJ purpose/NN ./.

The/DT market/NN is/VBZ not/RB an/DT end/NN in/IN itself/PRP ;/: it/PRP must/MD help/VB to/TO improve/VB the/DT human/JJ condition/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP or/CC individual/JJ States/NNPS must/MD not/RB take/VB over/RP from/IN economic/JJ operators/NNS ,/, but/CC public/JJ authorities/NNS must/MD define/VB the/DT rules/NNS and/CC objectives/NNS which/WDT enable/VBP the/DT economy/NN to/TO develop/VB in/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ fashion/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ objective/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ competition/NN policy/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB to/TO reduce/VB the/DT overall/JJ level/NN of/IN aid/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD track/VB down/RP the/DT illegal/JJ aid/NN and/CC the/DT aid/NN which/WDT actually/RB hinders/VBZ the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT serious/JJ mistake/NN to/TO eliminate/VB all/DT public/JJ aid/NN ./.

The/DT Internet/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT product/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT result/NN of/IN research/NN financed/VBN by/IN the/DT American/JJ army/NN ./.

The/DT World/NNP Wide/NNP Web/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ enabled/VBN the/DT meteoric/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT information/NN society/NN ,/, was/VBD developed/VBN by/IN CERN/NNP in/IN Geneva/NNP ,/, once/RB again/RB with/IN public/JJ aid/NN ./.

The/DT German/JJ Government/NN '/POS s/JJ intervention/NN to/TO save/VB the/DT Holzmann/NNP group/NN was/VBD criticised/VBN as/IN an/DT unjustifiable/JJ constraint/NN upon/IN the/DT market/NN economy/NN ./.

Wishing/VBG to/TO save/VB 60/CD 000/CD jobs/NNS is/VBZ ,/, apparently/RB ,/, a/DT sin/NN against/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, but/CC saving/NN capital/NN does/VBZ not/RB seem/VB to/TO present/VB any/DT problem/NN for/IN the/DT advocates/NNS of/IN the/DT free/JJ market/NN ./.

The/DT state/NN hand/NN must/MD still/RB be/VB clearly/RB seen/VBN to/TO regulate/VB the/DT market/NN and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD act/VB as/IN judge/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ your/PRP$ job/NN to/TO tidy/VB up/RP the/DT mess/NN left/VBN by/IN national/JJ governments/NNS ./.

These/DT may/MD well/RB have/VB grand/JJ visions/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO competition/NN policy/NN ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO wreak/VB havoc/NN seems/VBZ boundless/NNS ./.

Let/VB me/PRP mention/VB the/DT latest/JJS examples/NNS we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN :/: Holzmann/NNP ,/, a/DT company/NN which/WDT receives/VBZ considerable/JJ aid/NN from/IN the/DT German/JJ Government/NN ;/: sawmills/NNS in/IN former/JJ East/NNP Germany/NNP ;/: and/CC ,/, especially/RB ,/, aid/NN to/TO shipyards/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP three/CD areas/NNS in/IN which/WDT many/JJ Danish/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP experiencing/VBG major/JJ problems/NNS and/CC are/VBP being/VBG squeezed/VBN out/RP of/IN their/PRP$ markets/NNS ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB to/TO Mr/NNP Poos/NNPS that/IN I/PRP very/RB much/RB agree/VBP with/IN Mr/NNP Duisenberg/VBG that/IN these/DT examples/NNS show/VBP that/IN some/DT EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP not/RB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO restructure/VB their/PRP$ economies/NNS and/CC ,/, to/TO that/DT extent/NN ,/, are/VBP helping/VBG to/TO undermine/VB the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP amendments/NNS which/WDT we/PRP believe/VBP will/MD lead/VB to/TO transparency/NN and/CC openness/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO making/VBG the/DT internal/JJ market/NN work/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO thank/VB my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS on/IN the/DT committee/NN for/IN supporting/VBG the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/NNP ,/, Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP ./.

As/IN I/PRP say/VBP ,/, our/PRP$ amendments/NNS concern/NN transparency/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB the/DT amendment/NN which/WDT urges/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO propose/VB uniform/JJ criteria/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS for/IN the/DT type/NN of/IN state/NN aids/NNS we/PRP consider/VBP to/TO be/VB lawful/JJ ,/, specifically/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN companies/NNS can/MD predict/VB what/WP their/PRP$ situation/NN will/MD be/VB ./.

Another/DT issue/NN is/VBZ that/DT of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP to/TO do/VB when/WRB state/NN aid/NN is/VBZ declared/VBN unlawful/JJ ./.

How/WRB do/VBP we/PRP ensure/VB that/IN unlawful/JJ state/NN aid/NN is/VBZ paid/VBN back/RB ?/.

At/IN present/JJ ,/, there/EX are/VBP no/DT common/JJ rules/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP vigorously/RB urge/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO make/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN harmonising/VBG the/DT rules/NNS on/IN repayment/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN forward/RB if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO ensure/VB uniform/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN competition/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP keeping/VBG both/PDT a/DT register/NN ,/, as/IN mentioned/VBN by/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ MEPs/NNS ,/, and/CC also/RB a/DT scoreboard/JJ showing/NN where/WRB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS at/IN present/NN stand/VBP with/IN regard/NN to/TO state/NN aid/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP shown/VBN us/PRP the/DT way/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN scoreboard/VBN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD this/DT which/WDT inspired/VBD us/PRP to/TO propose/VB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO state/NN aid/NN ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB hope/VBP that/IN you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, will/MD support/VB these/DT amendments/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO your/PRP$ comments/NNS and/CC to/TO finding/VBG out/RP where/WRB you/PRP stand/VBP on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

To/TO conclude/VB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO welcome/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP XVIIIth/NNP Report/NNP on/IN Competition/NNP Policy/NNP ,/, on/IN which/WDT ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, a/DT good/JJ deal/NN of/IN work/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN ./.

But/CC ,/, as/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB mentioned/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ overriding/JJ objectives/NNS ought/MD still/RB to/TO be/VB those/DT of/IN transparency/NN and/CC openness/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ still/RB a/DT need/NN to/TO tighten/VB up/RP in/IN the/DT areas/NNS mentioned/VBN ,/, and/CC there/EX is/VBZ therefore/RB good/JJ reason/NN for/IN continuing/VBG to/TO work/VB resolutely/RB towards/IN solving/VBG the/DT problems/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT lack/NN of/IN transparency/NN and/CC openness/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN ./.

As/IN Liberals/NNS and/CC Greens/NNS ,/, we/PRP clearly/RB have/VBP different/JJ opinions/NNS on/IN how/WRB the/DT world/NN should/MD look/VB ,/, but/CC we/PRP are/VBP well/RB on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO agreement/NN as/RB to/TO our/PRP$ objectives/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP shall/MD try/VB to/TO find/VB reasonable/JJ solutions/NNS to/TO our/PRP$ problems/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, there/RB are/VBP just/RB two/CD questions/NNS which/WDT must/MD be/VB answered/VBN ./.

Are/NNP state/VBP aid/NN to/TO business/NN or/CC inter-company/JJ agreements/NNS legitimate/JJ in/IN a/DT market/NN economy/NN ,/, and/CC who/WP must/MD supervise/VB these/DT exceptions/NNS to/TO the/DT absolute/JJ rules/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN economy/NN ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB legitimate/JJ for/IN there/RB to/TO be/VB inter-company/JJ agreements/NNS and/CC voluntary/JJ restraint/NN agreements/NNS ,/, since/IN all/PDT these/DT agreements/NNS make/VBP it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT detrimental/JJ effects/NNS of/IN competition/NN on/IN social/JJ or/CC ecological/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

So/IN our/PRP$ clear/JJ response/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, yes/UH ,/, such/JJ aid/NN and/CC such/JJ agreements/NNS are/VBP legitimate/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP say/VBP that/IN every/DT single/JJ one/NN of/IN these/DT agreements/NNS must/MD be/VB expressly/RB justified/VBN ./.

The/DT von/NNP Wogau/NNP report/NN proposes/VBZ referring/VBG supervision/NN of/IN the/DT legitimacy/NN of/IN individual/JJ cases/NNS to/TO national/JJ level/NN ./.

We/PRP feel/VBP this/DT is/VBZ relatively/RB dangerous/JJ ,/, but/CC all/PDT the/DT same/JJ we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN it/PRP because/IN we/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB do/VB everything/NN ./.

We/PRP demand/VBP that/IN the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ transparency/NN should/MD be/VB in/IN place/NN and/CC that/IN greater/JJR powers/NNS of/IN investigation/NN be/VB granted/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN order/NN to/TO check/VB the/DT legitimacy/NN of/IN such/JJ exceptions/NNS after/IN the/DT fact/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, once/RB again/RB we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ./.

But/CC let/VB us/PRP stop/VB to/TO consider/VB the/DT circumstances/NNS in/IN which/WDT this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG place/NN and/CC the/DT conclusions/NNS to/TO which/WDT it/PRP should/MD bring/VB us/PRP ./.

The/DT overriding/VBG features/NNS of/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ economy/NN are/VBP massive/JJ mergers/NNS and/CC acquisitions/NNS involving/VBG huge/JJ companies/NNS with/IN a/DT market/NN monopoly/NN and/CC the/DT emergence/NN of/IN frighteningly/RB powerful/JJ multinational/JJ groups/NNS ./.

Should/MD we/PRP not/RB be/VB discussing/VBG this/DT issue/NN ?/.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT competition/NN policy/NN which/WDT can/MD and/CC will/MD introduce/VB controls/NNS on/IN the/DT activities/NNS of/IN these/DT private-sector/JJ monopolies/NNS ./.

Certain/JJ sectors/NNS of/IN European/JJ industry/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT shipbuilding/NN industry/NN ,/, air/NN transport/NN and/CC the/DT steel/NN industry/NN ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN hard/RB hit/VBN by/IN existing/VBG competition/NN policy/NN ,/, have/VBP suffered/VBN tremendously/RB ./.

They/PRP have/VBP lost/VBN their/PRP$ status/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT significant/JJ slice/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN market/NN and/CC hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN workers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN redundant/JJ ./.

When/WRB will/MD we/PRP debate/VB that/DT ?/.

The/DT scandalous/JJ concentration/NN of/IN power/NN in/IN sectors/NNS of/IN strategic/JJ importance/NN is/VBZ giving/VBG speculative/JJ multinational/JJ groups/NNS economies/NNS the/DT size/NN of/IN entire/JJ states/NNS ,/, and/CC Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP at/IN that/DT ./.

And/CC yet/RB ,/, we/PRP keep/VBP on/IN weakening/VBG the/DT public/JJ sector/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP ready/JJ and/CC willing/JJ to/TO tighten/VB competition/NN policy/NN yet/CC further/RBR by/IN qualifying/VBG public/JJ procurement/NN contracts/NNS placed/VBN with/IN public-sector/JJ corporations/NNS as/IN state/NN aid/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, unemployment/NN is/VBZ spiralling/VBG as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT loss/NN of/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN jobs/NNS ./.

Workers/NNPS are/VBP facing/VBG a/DT massive/JJ attack/NN on/IN their/PRP$ employment/NN and/CC social/JJ rights/NNS ./.

We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT competition/NN policy/NN to/TO be/VB responsible/JJ for/IN all/PDT this/DT and/CC are/VBP totally/RB opposed/VBN to/TO it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN this/DT pivotal/JJ year/NN ,/, prior/RB to/TO the/DT changeover/NN to/TO the/DT single/JJ currency/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ deployed/VBN every/DT effort/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT birth/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN in/IN a/DT favourable/JJ environment/NN ./.

The/DT competition/NN policy/NN has/VBZ ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN these/DT resources/NNS permitted/VBD ,/, contributed/VBN to/TO this/DT event/NN ./.

For/IN our/PRP$ part/NN ,/, we/PRP remain/VBP staunchly/RB opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT single/JJ currency/NN which/WDT ,/, far/RB from/IN bringing/VBG us/PRP the/DT advantages/NNS and/CC flexibility/NN of/IN a/DT shared/VBN currency/NN ,/, imprisons/VBZ us/PRP in/IN an/DT artificial/JJ straitjacket/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN imposed/VBN on/IN the/DT peoples/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/WDT ,/, governing/VBG means/VBZ planning/NN ./.

It/PRP also/RB means/VBZ being/VBG responsible/JJ and/CC ,/, in/IN this/DT new/JJ context/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN forced/VBN upon/IN us/PRP ,/, competition/NN law/NN naturally/RB has/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB ./.

In/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN priority/NN to/TO a/DT number/NN of/IN routes/NNS of/IN action/NN :/: acting/NN on/IN the/DT structure/NN of/IN markets/NNS by/IN actively/RB combating/VBG anti-competitive/JJ practices/NNS ,/, by/IN refocusing/VBG its/PRP$ departments/NNS '/POS supervisory/JJ activities/NNS only/RB upon/IN matters/NNS with/IN a/DT manifest/NNP Community/NNP interest/NN and/CC by/IN affirming/VBG its/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO modernise/VB competition/NN law/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN modernising/VBG the/DT implementation/NN of/IN Articles/NNP 85/CD and/CC 86/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN decentralised/JJ application/NN would/MD necessarily/RB be/VB going/VBG in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, retaining/VBG not/RB only/RB the/DT power/NN to/TO take/VB matters/NNS out/RP of/IN the/DT jurisdiction/NN of/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS ,/, but/CC clearly/RB obliging/VBG the/DT national/JJ jurisdictions/NNS to/TO avoid/VB disputing/VBG the/DT decisions/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP at/IN all/DT ./.

National/NNP states/NNS would/MD thus/RB become/VB the/DT secular/NN arm/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP regarding/VBG observance/NN of/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN rules/NNS which/WDT they/PRP do/VBP not/RB control/VB ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN while/IN some/DT measures/NNS are/VBP heading/VBG in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD of/IN course/NN remain/VB vigilant/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT snowballing/NN of/IN Federalism/NNP which/WDT ,/, if/IN it/PRP were/VBD realised/VBN ,/, would/MD be/VB to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN Europe/NNP and/CC the/DT sovereignty/NN of/IN the/DT states/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT basically/RB positive/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN competition/NN ,/, particularly/RB as/RB regards/VBZ the/DT abolition/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN notification/NN and/CC authorisation/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP are/VBP also/RB puzzled/VBN by/IN several/JJ things/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD heed/VB the/DT words/NNS of/IN von/NNP Eieck/NNP ,/, and/CC doubtless/VB also/RB those/DT of/IN the/DT great/JJ Italian/JJ liberal/NN Bruno/NNP Leoni/NNP ,/, who/WP warned/VBD precisely/RB against/IN the/DT risks/NNS of/IN an/DT abnormal/JJ increase/NN in/IN anti-competition/JJ policies/NNS ./.

State/NNP interference/NNP in/IN the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ ,/, even/RB today/NN ,/, still/RB to/TO blame/VB for/IN the/DT most/RBS serious/JJ hindrances/NNS placed/VBD in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, competition/NN and/CC freedom/NN of/IN choice/NN for/IN European/JJ users/NNS and/CC consumers/NNS ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT constraints/NNS imposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB emphasised/VBN once/RB again/RB that/IN the/DT European/JJ economy/NN is/VBZ finding/VBG it/PRP hard/JJ to/TO compete/VB with/IN the/DT American/JJ economy/NN ,/, especially/RB because/RB of/IN insufficiently/RB open/JJ markets/NNS and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN genuine/JJ competition/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ being/VBG done/VBN may/MD well/RB be/VB very/RB important/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB not/RB sufficient/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, a/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ,/, by/IN definition/NN ,/, is/VBZ not/RB something/NN you/PRP can/MD take/VB or/CC leave/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ there/EX to/TO generate/VB reactions/NNS and/CC the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP has/VBZ certainly/RB succeeded/VBN in/IN doing/VBG that/DT ./.

It/PRP forms/VBZ a/DT sound/JJ basis/NN for/IN discussion/NN and/CC is/VBZ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN in/IN this/DT sense/NN ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP where/WRB the/DT authors/NNS are/VBP coming/VBG from/IN and/CC I/PRP share/VBP their/PRP$ views/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB assume/VBP that/IN you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, want/VBP to/TO honour/VB the/DT reputation/NN of/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT work/NN put/VBD in/RP by/IN ,/, your/PRP$ predecessors/NNS and/CC that/IN your/PRP$ offices/NNS will/MD pursue/VB the/DT same/JJ objective/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB imagine/VB the/DT Commission/NNP taking/VBG initiatives/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO de-Europeanise/NN or/CC re-nationalise/NN in/IN a/DT thorough/JJ manner/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP my/PRP$ concerns/NNS and/CC questions/NNS nevertheless/RB ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, these/DT relate/VBP to/TO the/DT coherence/NN of/IN the/DT policy/NN '/POS s/JJ application/NN ./.

In/IN general/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP a/DT great/JJ defender/NN of/IN cultural/JJ diversity/NN but/CC not/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN competitiveness/NN within/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

The/DT internal/JJ market/NN needs/VBZ a/DT uniform/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN concept/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN application/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, there/EX are/VBP some/DT European/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC interpretative/NN statements/NNS on/IN the/DT way/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ also/RB said/VBN to/TO have/VB the/DT right/NN of/IN evocation/NN and/CC can/MD give/VB guidelines/NNS to/TO the/DT national/JJ competition/NN authorities/NNS ./.

But/CC I/PRP still/RB wonder/VBP if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB run/VB the/DT risk/NN of/IN ending/VBG up/RP in/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN Echternach/NNP procession/NN where/WRB we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO take/VB one/CD step/NN back/RB before/IN we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO take/VB two/CD steps/NNS forward/RB ./.

So/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO hear/VB more/RBR about/IN how/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD guarantee/VB this/DT uniform/JJ application/NN in/IN practice/NN and/CC whether/IN you/PRP yourself/RB consider/VBP the/DT courses/NNS outlined/VBN from/IN point/NN one/CD hundred/CD onwards/NNS in/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP to/TO be/VB feasible/JJ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, I/PRP understand/VBP the/DT worry/NN of/IN industry/NN regarding/VBG legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

Many/JJ dossiers/NNS are/VBP currently/RB being/VBG filed/VBN with/IN precisely/RB this/DT concern/NN ./.

This/DT instrument/NN will/MD fall/VB by/IN the/DT wayside/NN in/IN future/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ,/, you/PRP state/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD still/RB issue/VB particular/JJ orders/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN guidelines/NNS ,/, but/CC what/WP will/MD your/PRP$ criteria/NNS be/VB for/IN granting/VBG such/JJ orders/NNS one/CD day/NN but/CC not/RB the/DT next/JJ ?/.

Thirdly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB whether/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ looked/VBN into/IN the/DT effects/NNS its/PRP$ new/JJ approach/NN will/MD have/VB on/IN industrial/JJ strategy/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP more/JJR police/NN officers/NNS ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP nowhere/RB near/IN enough/RB ./.

We/PRP need/VBP an/DT independent/JJ judiciary/NN -/: this/DT would/MD certainly/RB be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO establish/VB -/: ,/, we/PRP also/RB need/VBP funds/NNS for/IN the/DT office/NN of/IN High/NNP Commissioner/NNP for/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNPS ./.

All/DT of/IN this/DT needs/VBZ to/TO happen/VB ,/, and/CC quickly/RB too/RB ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB provide/VB rapid/JJ assistance/NN then/RB the/DT situation/NN will/MD deteriorate/VB and/CC new/JJ conflicts/NNS and/CC crisis/NN situations/NNS may/MD arise/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP were/VBD right/JJ to/TO take/VB action/NN quickly/RB ,/, to/TO recognise/VB the/DT urgency/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN and/CC make/VB funds/NNS available/JJ ./.

Only/RB ,/, now/RB we/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB this/DT translate/VB into/IN deeds/NNS and/CC we/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO see/VB success/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD urge/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO see/VB that/IN these/DT funds/NNS are/VBP put/VBN to/TO good/JJ use/NN ,/, notably/RB for/IN building/VBG up/RP the/DT police/NN force/NN and/CC for/IN establishing/VBG the/DT judiciary/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- ES/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB firstly/RB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Members/NNS ,/, and/CC especially/RB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT speed/NN with/IN which/WDT they/PRP have/VBP dealt/VBN with/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD no/DT doubt/NN allow/VB us/PRP to/TO release/VB the/DT funds/NNS for/IN Kosovo/NNP quickly/RB and/CC deal/VB with/IN the/DT concerns/NNS which/WDT both/DT Mr/NNP Swoboda/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Pack/NNP have/VBP mentioned/VBN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN three/CD types/NNS of/IN fundamental/JJ concern/NN in/IN tonight/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, although/IN much/JJ progress/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN ,/, and/CC we/PRP could/MD mention/VB customs/NNS administration/NN ,/, bank/NN administration/NN or/CC tax/NN administration/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN we/PRP must/MD continue/VB to/TO move/VB forward/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN moving/NN forward/RB ,/, what/WP should/MD we/PRP be/VB financing/VBG ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ point/NN on/IN which/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN disagreement/NN ./.

In/IN some/DT of/IN your/PRP$ amendments/NNS you/PRP propose/VBP that/IN we/PRP limit/VBP further/RBR the/DT type/NN of/IN bodies/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB provided/VBN with/IN Union/NNP funds/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 3/NNP and/CC 5/CD ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ view/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, in/IN both/DT respects/NNS ,/, greater/JJR room/NN for/IN manoeuvre/NN should/MD be/VB left/VBN to/TO the/DT administration/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS which/WDT ,/, on/IN the/DT ground/NN ,/, is/VBZ more/RBR aware/JJ of/IN the/DT reality/NN than/IN we/PRP are/VBP ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN to/TO prejudge/VB ,/, at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, where/WRB resources/NNS should/MD be/VB directed/VBN ,/, would/MD create/VB more/RBR practical/JJ difficulties/NNS ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, we/PRP should/MD put/VB our/PRP$ faith/NN in/IN those/DT parties/NNS who/WP ,/, in/IN these/DT areas/NNS ,/, are/VBP better/RBR equipped/VBN than/IN us/PRP to/TO make/VB certain/JJ decisions/NNS ./.

The/DT second/JJ concern/NN which/WDT I/PRP notice/VBP that/IN many/JJ of/IN you/PRP share/VBP -/: it/PRP was/VBD first/RB expressed/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Bourlanges/NNPS ,/, but/CC others/NNS have/VBP repeated/VBN it/PRP -/: refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT situation/NN regarding/VBG the/DT other/JJ donors/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP making/VBG an/DT excessive/JJ effort/NN while/IN others/NNS are/VBP failing/VBG to/TO cooperate/VB ?/.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS in/IN your/PRP$ report/NN pose/VBP this/DT question/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/VBN 1/CD ,/, 2/CD and/CC 4/CD ./.

I/PRP would/MD say/VB to/TO Mr/NNP Bourlanges/NNPS and/CC to/TO those/DT who/WP have/VBP raised/VBN this/DT issue/NN ,/, that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN ,/, although/IN we/PRP recognise/VBP it/PRP totally/RB ./.

The/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, the/DT distribution/NN of/IN the/DT burden/NN amongst/VBD the/DT different/JJ donors/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN established/VBN in/IN the/DT statements/NNS of/IN the/DT High/NNP Level/NNP Steering/NNP Group/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB true/JJ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP no/DT legal/JJ status/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ simply/RB a/DT political/JJ commitment/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/WRB ,/, while/IN accepting/VBG its/PRP$ spirit/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD ask/VB that/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 1/CD be/VB worded/VBN differently/RB -/: and/CC we/PRP have/VBP sent/VBN a/DT note/NN to/TO Mr/NNP Brok/NNP in/IN this/DT respect/NN -/: so/RB that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB imply/VB conditionality/RB in/IN the/DT provision/NN of/IN Community/NNP resources/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD say/VB the/DT same/JJ about/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 2/CD ,/, which/WDT we/PRP would/MD also/RB accept/VB with/IN a/DT slight/JJ modification/NN ,/, since/IN the/DT idea/NN seems/VBZ to/TO us/PRP to/TO be/VB basically/RB correct/JJ ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 4/CD is/VBZ of/IN a/DT similar/JJ nature/NN ./.

On/IN this/DT specific/JJ point/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD perhaps/RB offer/VB Mr/NNP Bourlanges/NNP greater/JJR satisfaction/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP already/RB spoken/VBN to/TO the/DT Council/NNP so/RB that/IN it/PRP might/MD include/VB a/DT Commission/NNP statement/NN in/IN its/PRP$ decision/NN ,/, establishing/VBG this/DT element/NN of/IN conditionality/NN ./.

With/IN regard/VBP to/TO the/DT second/JJ contribution/NN ,/, what/WP we/PRP propose/VBP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT exact/JJ amount/NN and/CC the/DT date/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ stage/NN should/MD be/VB decided/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT external/JJ financial/JJ needs/NNS of/IN Kosovo/NNP and/CC the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN other/JJ bilateral/JJ donors/NNS ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB establish/VB conditionality/RB ,/, or/CC we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR effective/JJ not/RB to/TO establish/VB conditionality/RB from/IN the/DT start/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, nevertheless/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD establish/VB it/PRP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT possible/JJ liberalisation/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ stage/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD have/VB no/DT problem/NN in/IN acting/VBG immediately/RB ./.

We/PRP would/MD not/RB create/VB problems/NNS for/IN the/DT Kosovar/NNP people/NNS ,/, but/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD force/VB the/DT other/JJ donors/NNS to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ financial/JJ contribution/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./.

A/DT third/JJ problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN raised/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP D脙艗hrkop/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT multiannual/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD remind/VB you/PRP that/IN these/DT projects/NNS are/VBP multiannual/JJ ./.

The/DT programmes/NNS clearly/RB have/VBP to/TO take/VB the/DT annual/JJ budgetary/JJ contributions/NNS into/IN account/NN ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB some/DT observations/NNS on/IN the/DT requests/NNS for/IN additional/JJ information/NN which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN addressed/VBN to/TO us/PRP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD commit/VB itself/PRP to/TO regularly/RB informing/VBG Parliament/NNP of/IN the/DT invitations/NNS to/TO tender/NN which/WDT are/VBP published/VBN ./.

We/PRP also/RB wish/VBP to/TO see/VB these/DT publicised/NN on/IN the/DT Internet/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN there/EX may/MD be/VB maximum/JJ transparency/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT specific/JJ point/NN ./.

A/DT second/JJ point/NN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO comment/VB on/RP is/VBZ the/DT remaining/VBG information/NN which/WDT may/MD be/VB of/IN importance/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT provision/NN of/IN macroeconomic/JJ assistance/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO keep/VB the/DT chairmen/NNS of/IN the/DT various/JJ committees/NNS involved/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN regularly/RB informed/VBN ,/, on/IN a/DT confidential/JJ basis/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT information/NN provided/VBN requires/VBZ confidentiality/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT different/JJ schemes/NNS being/VBG implemented/VBN for/IN macroeconomic/JJ assistance/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT convergence/NN of/IN viewpoints/NNS there/EX is/VBZ between/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, particularly/RB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN ,/, for/IN our/PRP$ part/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD always/RB be/VB there/EX to/TO assist/VB the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN its/PRP$ duties/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, have/VB one/CD small/JJ concern/NN ,/, when/WRB I/PRP hear/VBP the/DT Commissioner/NNP on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT commitments/NNS made/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ services/NNS in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP ./.

But/CC ,/, if/IN I/PRP understand/VBP what/WP Mr/NNP Solbes/NNPS Mira/NNP says/VBZ correctly/RB ,/, then/RB this/DT undertaking/NN was/VBD only/RB a/DT tentative/JJ one/NN ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, an/DT agreement/NN is/VBZ an/DT agreement/NN ./.

Can/MD you/PRP confirm/VB the/DT agreement/NN made/VBN by/IN your/PRP$ services/NNS in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP ,/, yes/UH or/CC no/UH ?/.

Or/WP are/VBP you/PRP going/VBG to/TO drop/VB this/DT proviso/NN ,/, thus/RB breaking/VBG the/DT undertaking/NN made/VBN to/TO us/PRP ?/.

No/UH ,/, Mr/NNP Bourlanges/NNPS ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT substantive/JJ problem/NN ./.

The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ how/WRB in/IN practical/JJ terms/NNS to/TO implement/VB the/DT compromise/NN which/WDT we/PRP accepted/VBD ./.

What/WP I/PRP proposed/VBD to/TO you/PRP ,/, and/CC what/WP I/PRP still/RB say/VBP ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD make/VB a/DT statement/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT Council/NNP Decision/NNP ,/, something/NN like/IN this/DT :/: ./.

The/DT exact/JJ amount/NN and/CC timing/NN of/IN implementation/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ tranche/NN will/MD be/VB decided/VBN in/IN due/JJ course/NN taking/VBG into/IN account/NN developments/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP '/POS s/JJ external/JJ financing/NN needs/NNS and/CC contributions/NNS from/IN other/JJ bilateral/JJ donors/NNS ./.

With/IN this/DT ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP are/VBP totally/RB in/IN line/NN with/IN what/WP we/PRP agreed/VBD ./.

I/PRP am/VBP simply/RB asking/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO come/VB and/CC inform/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgets/NNP before/IN implementing/VBG the/DT second/JJ tranche/NN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP ,/, absolutely/RB ./.

We/PRP shall/MD do/VB so/RB ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN 11/CD a.m./RB tomorrow/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0011/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT joint/JJ text/NN approved/VBN by/IN the/DT Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP for/IN a/DT European/JJ Parliament/NNP and/CC Council/NNP decision/NN adopting/VBG a/DT multiannual/JJ programme/NN for/IN the/DT promotion/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS in/IN the/DT Community/NNP -/: Altener/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- C5-0333/NNP //: 1999/CD -/: 1997/0370/CD -LRB-/-LRB- COD/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Langen/NNP -/: although/IN he/PRP is/VBZ not/RB actually/RB here/RB -/: for/IN the/DT work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN to/TO carry/VB through/IN the/DT programme/NN both/DT in/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

The/DT project/NN has/VBZ been/VBN long/JJ and/CC problematic/JJ ./.

In/IN future/NN too/RB ,/, there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT need/NN to/TO invest/VB heavily/RB in/IN research/NN into/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS ./.

Although/IN there/EX is/VBZ much/JJ that/IN is/VBZ good/JJ about/IN the/DT new/JJ directive/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB not/RB without/IN its/PRP$ defects/NNS ./.

One/CD example/NN is/VBZ the/DT use/NN of/IN peat/NN ./.

Peat/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB classified/VBN as/IN belonging/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ group/NN as/IN fossil/JJ fuels/NNS ./.

If/IN peat/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB classified/VBN directly/RB as/IN a/DT renewable/JJ ,/, non-fossil/JJ energy/NN source/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD form/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ class/NN ,/, especially/RB as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN environmental/JJ taxation/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB right/JJ that/IN peat/NN should/MD be/VB judged/VBN according/VBG to/TO the/DT same/JJ criteria/NNS as/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, coal/NN ./.

The/DT development/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS is/VBZ a/DT partial/JJ solution/NN to/TO ending/VBG the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ dependence/NN on/IN imported/VBN energy/NN ./.

Research/NNP is/VBZ particularly/RB essential/JJ with/IN regard/NN also/RB to/TO the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ next/JJ round/NN of/IN enlargement/NN ./.

Dependence/NNP on/IN imported/VBN energy/NN affects/VBZ worst/JJS of/IN all/DT many/JJ Eastern/JJ European/JJ countries/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ economic/JJ structure/NN is/VBZ still/RB suffering/VBG from/IN the/DT dependence/NN created/VBN in/IN the/DT times/NNS of/IN the/DT Soviet/NNP Union/NNP on/IN Russian/JJ energy/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP must/MD adhere/VB to/TO the/DT Kyoto/NNP Protocol/NNP on/IN climate/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB concerned/VBN about/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC our/PRP$ children/NNS '/POS s/JJ future/NN ./.

The/DT share/NN that/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS have/VBP in/IN total/JJ energy/NN production/NN must/MD be/VB increased/VBN ,/, but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN in/IN a/DT rational/JJ manner/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO remember/VB that/IN our/PRP$ basic/JJ energy/NN production/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB based/VBN on/IN renewables/NNS for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN to/TO come/VB ./.

For/IN that/DT we/PRP need/VBP a/DT form/NN of/IN energy/NN production/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB harm/VB the/DT climate/NN :/: nuclear/JJ energy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT PSE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN an/DT end/NN result/NN in/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN for/IN the/DT ALTENER/NNP II/NNP Programme/NNP ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO extend/VB warm/JJ thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT truly/RB excellent/JJ work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN on/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT leader/NN of/IN the/DT delegation/NN in/IN the/DT Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Provan/NNP ./.

For/IN as/IN Mr/NNP Langen/NNP said/VBD just/RB now/RB ,/, we/PRP certainly/RB had/VBD a/DT tough/JJ fight/NN on/IN our/PRP$ hands/NNS in/IN the/DT Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD see/VB today/NN that/IN the/DT conciliation/NN end/NN result/NN quite/RB clearly/RB bears/VBZ the/DT trademark/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP throughout/IN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB satisfactory/JJ -/: I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB that/DT quite/RB clear/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP agreed/VBD to/TO this/DT compromise/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD important/JJ to/TO us/PRP to/TO enable/VB this/DT programme/NN to/TO be/VB launched/VBN very/RB soon/RB indeed/RB ./.

For/IN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT proportion/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS is/VBZ to/TO double/VB ,/, accounting/VBG for/IN at/IN least/JJS 12/CD %/NN of/IN energy/NN consumption/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/'' s/PRP declared/VBD aim/NN ./.

That/DT being/VBG the/DT case/NN ,/, since/IN ALTENER/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ EU/NNP programme/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT exclusive/JJ aim/NN of/IN promoting/VBG renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS ,/, it/PRP will/MD certainly/RB be/VB have/VB a/DT key/JJ role/NN ./.

To/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN though/RB ,/, what/WP is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ about/IN the/DT ALTENER/NNP II/NNP programme/NN are/VBP the/DT new/JJ actions/NNS for/IN relieving/VBG market/NN saturation/NN by/IN renewable/JJ energies/NNS and/CC those/DT for/IN implementing/VBG ,/, supporting/VBG and/CC monitoring/VBG the/DT Community/NNP strategy/NN and/CC the/DT Community/NNP action/NN plan/NN ./.

We/PRP now/RB have/VBP available/JJ to/TO us/PRP a/DT working/JJ paper/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ services/NNS on/IN a/DT breakthrough/NN campaign/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN a/DT crucial/JJ element/NN of/IN this/DT Community/NNP strategy/NN ./.

It/PRP contains/VBZ plans/NNS for/IN financial/JJ support/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT main/JJ renewable/CD energy/NN sources/NNS sectors/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ for/IN this/DT ALTENER/JJ programme/NN to/TO go/VB hand/NN in/IN hand/NN with/IN this/DT campaign/NN and/CC to/TO support/VB it/PRP ./.

The/DT overall/JJ investment/NN costs/NNS for/IN this/DT campaign/NN are/VBP estimated/VBN to/TO be/VB approximately/RB EUR/$ 30/CD billion/CD ./.

75/CD %/NN -80/CD %/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ to/TO come/VB from/IN private/JJ sources/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT will/MD be/VB supplemented/VBN by/IN public/JJ funds/NNS from/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC from/IN the/DT regions/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT ALTENER/NNP programme/NN will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO create/VB new/JJ incentives/NNS and/CC smooth/VB the/DT way/NN for/IN investment/NN ,/, and/CC help/VB us/PRP to/TO realise/VB our/PRP$ ambition/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN ,/, the/DT economy/NN and/CC creating/VBG new/JJ jobs/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Langen/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ excellent/JJ work/NN in/IN this/DT important/JJ matter/NN ./.

The/DT conclusion/NN reached/VBD regarding/VBG conciliation/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT Altener/NNP programme/NN as/IN put/VBN forward/RP by/IN the/DT Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/PDT the/DT difficult/JJ phases/NNS it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN through/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS satisfactory/JJ ./.

Most/JJS of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN taken/VBN into/IN account/NN and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT programme/NN has/VBZ seen/VBN its/PRP$ total/JJ funding/NN rise/NN to/TO EUR/$ 77/CD million/CD must/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/RB positive/JJ ./.

The/DT Union/NNP has/VBZ ambitious/JJ goals/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO increasing/VBG the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ very/RB little/JJ in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN appropriations/NNS to/TO meet/VB these/DT targets/NNS ,/, however/RB ./.

The/DT appropriations/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN for/IN pilot/JJ projects/NNS ,/, research/NN ,/, information/NN exchange/NN and/CC also/RB to/TO cultivate/VB more/RBR positive/JJ attitudes/NNS towards/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN increasing/VBG the/DT use/NN of/IN renewables/NNS is/VBZ to/TO be/VB borne/VBN by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT programme/NN will/MD hopefully/RB encourage/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO act/VB with/IN greater/JJR determination/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, the/DT Union/NNP will/MD also/RB have/VB to/TO increase/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ input/NN in/IN promoting/VBG the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN and/CC ensuring/VBG that/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN is/VBZ launched/VBN without/IN obstacles/NNS on/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

Promoting/VBG the/DT use/NN of/IN renewables/NNS is/VBZ especially/RB important/JJ for/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP can/MD not/RB achieve/VB its/PRP$ environmental/JJ goals/NNS unless/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN renewables/NNS is/VBZ actively/RB stepped/VBN up/RP ./.

Renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS lower/RBR dependency/VBN on/IN imported/VBN energy/NN and/CC their/PRP$ increased/VBN use/NN boosts/VBZ competitiveness/NN ./.

Europe/NNP will/MD also/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB a/DT leading/VBG position/NN in/IN the/DT industry/NN that/WDT supplies/VBZ equipment/NN needed/VBN for/IN the/DT exploitation/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD also/RB remember/VB that/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS has/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ impact/NN on/IN regional/JJ development/NN and/CC employment/NN ./.

May/NNP I/NNP also/RB venture/VB to/TO raise/VB the/DT matter/NN of/IN peat/NN ?/.

Peat/NNP is/VBZ not/RB mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS in/IN Finland/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT sustainably/NN used/VBD ,/, slowly/RB renewable/VBP energy/NN source/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN in/IN the/DT future/NN it/PRP can/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN renewables/NNS ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/European/NNP Free/NNP Alliance/NNP are/VBP pleased/JJ with/IN the/DT agreement/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN found/VBN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ thanks/NNS go/VBP to/TO all/PDT those/DT who/WP negotiated/VBD so/RB well/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN an/DT amendment/NN which/WDT the/DT Greens/NNS were/VBD almost/RB the/DT authors/NNS of/IN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ interesting/JJ for/IN me/PRP ,/, as/IN a/DT new/JJ Member/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT budget/NN provides/VBZ for/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN millions/NNS of/IN euros/NNS annually/RB for/IN tobacco/NN cultivation/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT limited/JJ sector/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN which/WDT creates/VBZ hardly/RB any/DT jobs/NNS and/CC is/VBZ not/RB competitive/JJ on/IN the/DT world/NN scale/NN ./.

In/IN contrast/NN with/IN that/DT ,/, I/PRP see/VBP the/DT amounts/NNS allocated/VBN for/IN renewable/JJ energies/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP not/RB only/RB an/DT ecological/JJ element/NN but/CC which/WDT look/VBP set/VBN to/TO undergo/VB considerable/JJ economic/JJ expansion/NN ./.

One/CD last/JJ word/NN regarding/VBG the/DT programme/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP very/RB important/JJ for/IN renewable/JJ energies/NNS to/TO be/VB firmly/RB established/VBN in/IN the/DT regions/NNS so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD develop/VB in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN and/CC so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD contribute/VB to/TO the/DT economy/NN and/CC to/TO job/NN creation/NN there/RB ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN at/IN least/JJS 50/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT energy/NN mix/NN comes/VBZ from/IN renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ to/TO deal/VB with/IN a/DT few/JJ hot/JJ spots/NNS that/WDT will/MD be/VB more/RBR profitable/JJ in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP commence/JJ by/IN complimenting/VBG Mr/NNP Langen/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ work/NN ./.

The/DT activities/NNS of/IN the/DT ALTENER/JJ programme/NN will/MD promote/VB renewable/JJ energy/NN sources/NNS and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN such/JJ programmes/NNS merit/VBP financial/JJ support/NN at/IN the/DT developmental/JJ stage/NN as/IN they/PRP offer/VBP enormous/JJ commercial/JJ potential/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP particularly/RB pleased/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT monies/NNS focussed/VBN on/IN projects/NNS by/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS ./.

The/DT internationally/RB agreed/VBN objectives/NNS for/IN reducing/VBG emissions/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB achieved/VBN by/IN these/DT programmes/NNS alone/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB remembered/VBN that/IN energy/NN policy/NN remains/VBZ within/IN the/DT national/JJ remit/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ imperative/JJ that/IN national/JJ governments/NNS lend/VBP their/PRP$ full/JJ support/NN to/TO improving/VBG energy/NN efficiency/NN and/CC developing/VBG renewables/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN Ireland/NNP has/VBZ recently/RB announced/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO spend/VB 脗/NNP 拢/NNP 125/CD million/CD on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN an/DT environmentally/RB sustainable/JJ energy/NN sector/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD hope/VB that/IN the/DT contribution/NN of/IN ALTENER/NNP would/MD lead/VB to/TO more/JJR initiatives/NNS ./.

As/IN the/DT final/JJ text/NN rightly/RB states/VBZ ,/, actions/NNS such/JJ as/IN these/DT can/MD play/VB a/DT role/NN in/IN reducing/VBG regional/JJ disparities/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD vouch/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB received/VBN significant/JJ interest/NN in/IN the/DT ALTENER/JJ programme/NN from/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ constituency/NN of/IN Leinster/NNP ,/, a/DT significant/JJ portion/NN of/IN which/WDT falls/VBZ within/IN Ireland/NNP '/POS s/VBZ only/RB Objective/JJ I/NN region/NN ./.

I/PRP support/VBP all/DT efforts/NNS to/TO close/VB the/DT gap/NN in/IN economic/JJ development/NN in/IN infrastructural/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT energy/NN sector/NN ./.

In/IN short/JJ ,/, we/PRP face/VBP a/DT major/JJ challenge/NN in/IN meeting/VBG our/PRP$ commitments/NNS on/IN limiting/VBG greenhouse/NN gas/NN emissions/NNS from/IN the/DT energy/NN sector/NN under/IN the/DT Kyoto/NNP Protocol/NNP ,/, while/IN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN promoting/VBG growth/NN in/IN our/PRP$ economies/NNS ./.

ALTENER/NNP will/MD make/VB a/DT valuable/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT combined/VBN efforts/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, as/IN our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN mentioned/VBN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP coming/VBG to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ process/NN of/IN conciliation/NN with/IN the/DT Council/NNP on/IN the/DT ALTENER/JJ programme/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Langen/NNP mentioned/VBD that/IN the/DT implementation/NN budget/NN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP was/VBD initially/RB FF/VBN 74/CD million/CD ,/, whereas/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposed/VBD 81.1/CD million/CD ,/, a/DT figure/NN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP supported/VBD ./.

An/DT initial/JJ conciliation/NN meeting/NN was/VBD not/RB successful/JJ ,/, because/IN the/DT Council/NNP would/MD not/RB at/IN that/DT time/NN accept/VB an/DT increase/NN of/IN EUR/$ 1.9/CD million/CD ./.

We/PRP could/MD not/RB agree/VB with/IN a/DT proposal/NN like/IN this/DT ,/, which/WDT challenged/VBD the/DT authority/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ./.

A/DT second/JJ round/NN of/IN conciliation/NN achieved/VBD an/DT increase/NN of/IN EUR/$ 1.1/CD million/CD in/IN order/NN to/TO reach/VB this/DT compromise/NN figure/NN of/IN 77/CD million/CD ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, renewable/JJ energies/NNS unquestionably/RB provide/VBP a/DT way/NN of/IN achieving/VBG these/DT objectives/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ practically/RB certain/JJ that/IN ,/, with/IN the/DT raft/NN of/IN proposed/VBN measures/NNS and/CC actions/NNS ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO approach/VB the/DT objective/NN of/IN a/DT 12/CD %/NN renewable/NN energy/NN share/NN by/IN 2010/CD ,/, doubling/VBG the/DT current/JJ rate/NN ,/, as/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS including/VBG state/NN appropriations/NNS are/VBP made/VBN available/JJ ./.

This/DT programme/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT SAVE/NNP II/NNP programme/NN ,/, integrating/VBG the/DT environmental/JJ aspect/NN into/IN energy/NN policy/NN ,/, establishes/VBZ a/DT foundation/NN for/IN a/DT real/JJ Community/NNP strategy/NN to/TO achieve/VB clean/JJ energy/NN while/IN reducing/VBG our/PRP$ dependence/NN ./.

And/CC ,/, in/IN conclusion/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, let/VBD me/PRP also/RB insist/VBP upon/IN the/DT fact/NN that/DT ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT measures/NNS proposed/VBN ,/, there/EX are/VBP also/RB legislative/JJ measures/NNS and/CC ,/, most/RBS especially/RB ,/, adequate/JJ budget/NN allocations/NNS to/TO back/VB up/RP these/DT political/JJ initiatives/NNS ./.

And/CC I/PRP shall/MD end/VB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, by/IN congratulating/NNP Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN ,/, on/IN his/PRP$ work/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN all/PDT the/DT members/NNS of/IN the/DT committee/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP ./.

All/DT of/IN this/DT will/MD provide/VB greater/JJR coordination/NN ,/, transparency/NN and/CC efficiency/NN in/IN our/PRP$ energy/NN programmes/NNS ,/, into/IN which/WDT we/PRP will/MD also/RB have/VB to/TO incorporate/VB the/DT SAVE/JJ programme/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP will/MD be/VB discussing/VBG soon/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT work/NN carried/VBN out/RP during/IN this/DT time/NN by/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN of/IN a/DT high/JJ quality/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP therefore/RB congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Langen/NNP and/CC also/RB all/PDT the/DT various/JJ speakers/NNS who/WP have/VBP spoken/VBN both/DT in/IN committee/NN and/CC here/RB in/IN plenary/NN ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN arguments/NNS ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO go/VB to/TO conciliation/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN and/CC Mr/NNP Caudron/NNP reminded/VBD us/PRP a/DT moment/NN ago/RB ,/, since/IN at/IN the/DT first/JJ meeting/NN no/DT result/NN was/VBD achieved/VBN ,/, and/CC there/EX had/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT second/JJ meeting/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT figures/NNS were/VBD not/RB excessive/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN in/IN the/DT end/NN we/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN a/DT reasonable/JJ agreement/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, like/IN all/DT agreements/NNS ,/, is/VBZ perhaps/RB not/RB perfect/JJ ,/, but/CC which/WDT ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO push/VB ahead/RB with/IN the/DT projects/NNS with/IN which/WDT we/PRP were/VBD dealing/VBG ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB like/VB once/RB again/RB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, on/IN his/PRP$ work/NN ,/, to/TO thank/VB the/DT speakers/NNS and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, to/TO acknowledge/VB the/DT actions/NNS of/IN Vice-President/NNP Provan/NNP throughout/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN ,/, who/WP contributed/VBD efficiently/RB to/TO the/DT achievement/NN of/IN a/DT positive/JJ result/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO recognise/VB the/DT reasonable/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ action/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD not/RB waiver/VB in/IN that/DT commitment/NN ./.

But/CC we/PRP must/MD also/RB hold/VB up/RP the/DT mirror/NN to/TO ourselves/PRP and/CC recognise/VB our/PRP$ own/JJ inadequacies/NNS ./.

Yes/UH ,/, conventions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN signed/VBN ,/, but/CC action/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN ./.

I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB to/TO you/PRP ongoing/JJ audits/NN of/IN human/JJ rights/NNS practices/NNS ,/, eternal/JJ vigilance/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB outside/IN our/PRP$ borders/NNS but/CC within/IN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP would/MD welcome/VB an/DT annual/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP report/NN from/IN each/DT individual/JJ state/NN which/WDT would/MD have/VB to/TO record/VB any/DT charges/NNS against/IN it/PRP and/CC the/DT action/NN taken/VBN ./.

Because/IN what/WDT happens/VBZ in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP happens/VBZ to/TO every/DT single/JJ one/NN of/IN us/PRP ./.

What/WP happens/VBZ in/IN another/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN affects/VBZ us/PRP ./.

Pinochet/NNP in/IN Chile/NNP is/VBZ as/RB relevant/JJ as/IN Haider/NNP in/IN Austria/NNP ./.

Human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC civil/JJ liberties/NNS are/VBP inextricably/RB linked/VBN ./.

Human/NNP rights/NNS do/VBP not/RB exist/VB in/IN isolation/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP connected/VBN to/TO our/PRP$ development/NN policies/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ economic/JJ policies/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ home/NN affairs/NNS policies/NNS ,/, indeed/RB they/PRP are/VBP at/IN the/DT very/JJ heart/NN of/IN our/PRP$ democratic/JJ functions/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD repeat/VB what/WP Mr/NNP Patten/NNP said/VBD :/: we/PRP must/MD engage/VB ,/, we/PRP must/MD inform/VB ,/, educate/VB and/CC thereby/RB effect/VB real/JJ and/CC lasting/JJ change/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ``/`` Europe/NNP stands/VBZ for/IN ideals/NNS ,/, values/NNS and/CC principles/NNS ./.

We/PRP must/MD emphasise/VB Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ spiritual/JJ history/NN ./.

Together/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD re-establish/VB the/DT values/NNS which/WDT unite/VB Europe/NNP ./.

Spiritual/JJ values/NNS have/VBP been/VBN disseminated/VBN from/IN Europe/NNP throughout/IN the/DT globe/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD live/VB with/IN our/PRP$ consciences/NNS ./. ''/'' ./.

These/DT were/VBD the/DT words/NNS spoken/VBN three/CD hours/NNS ago/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP by/IN the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Czech/JJ Republic/NN ,/, Vaclav/NNP Havel/NNP ./.

In/IN an/DT extraordinarily/RB edifying/JJ speech/NN ,/, characterised/VBN by/IN wisdom/NN ,/, historical/JJ knowledge/NN ,/, an/DT understanding/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ heart/NN and/CC insight/NN into/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/VBG spiritual/NN and/CC Christian/JJ heritage/NN ,/, he/PRP pointed/VBD to/TO sources/NNS of/IN inspiration/NN for/IN our/PRP$ work/NN on/IN human/JJ justice/NN and/CC human/JJ dignity/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD be/VB grateful/JJ that/IN there/EX are/VBP Heads/NNP of/IN State/NNP like/IN Vaclav/NNP Havel/NNP in/IN our/PRP$ Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO discuss/VB two/CD matters/NNS ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, civil/JJ society/NN ./.

Vaclav/NNP Havel/NNP stated/VBD that/IN ,/, in/IN Eastern/NNP Europe/NNP ,/, the/DT Communist/JJ regimes/NNS methodically/RB destroyed/VBD civil/JJ society/NN :/: national/JJ movements/NNS ,/, churches/NNS and/CC the/DT independent/JJ trade/NN unions/NNS ./.

The/DT same/JJ is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN China/NNP in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT Falun/NNP Gong/NNP movement/NN and/CC with/IN the/DT Catholic/NNP and/CC Protestant/NNP churches/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ happening/VBG with/IN Buddhism/NNP in/IN Tibet/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD never/RB forget/VB to/TO defend/VB civil/JJ society/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO mention/VB the/DT death/NN penalty/NN ./.

Like/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, Sweden/NNP ,/, the/DT EU/NNP bases/VBZ its/PRP$ view/NN of/IN human/JJ beings/NNS upon/IN the/DT equal/JJ ,/, unique/JJ and/CC inviolable/JJ value/NN of/IN every/DT human/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN this/DT principle/NN ,/, human/JJ beings/NNS should/MD always/RB have/VB the/DT chance/NN to/TO redeem/VB themselves/PRP ./.

Try/VB telling/VBG that/DT to/TO the/DT governments/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNP ,/, Russia/NNP and/CC China/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, President-in-Office/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP the/DT approach/NN of/IN EU/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS at/IN Geneva/NNP should/MD be/VB to/TO prioritise/VB the/DT situations/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, Mexico/NNP ,/, Saudi/JJ Arabia/NNP ,/, Sierra/NNP Leone/NNP and/CC China/NNP ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO China/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB dissuaded/VBN from/IN raising/VBG the/DT issue/NN simply/RB because/IN discussions/NNS on/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB blocked/VBN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ imperative/JJ that/IN the/DT EU/NNP speaks/VBZ and/CC acts/VBZ as/IN one/CD ,/, and/CC threats/NNS of/IN trade/NN sanctions/NNS should/MD strengthen/VB rather/RB than/IN weaken/VB our/PRP$ resolve/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, if/IN full/JJ expression/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO the/DT decisions/NNS which/WDT may/MD eventually/RB be/VB taken/VBN at/IN Geneva/NNP ,/, then/RB the/DT office/NN of/IN the/DT High/NNP Commissioner/NNP for/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNPS must/MD be/VB provided/VBN with/IN the/DT necessary/JJ resources/NNS ./.

The/DT financial/JJ resources/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS are/VBP spread/VBN very/RB thinly/RB and/CC because/RB of/IN this/DT many/JJ crucial/JJ programmes/NNS are/VBP dependent/JJ on/IN voluntary/JJ contributions/NNS to/TO keep/VB them/PRP afloat/RB ./.

Resources/NNP are/VBP also/RB needed/VBN for/IN promoting/VBG practical/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, strategic/JJ planning/NN ,/, the/DT establishment/NN of/IN priorities/NNS and/CC strengthening/VBG communications/NNS between/IN the/DT donor/NN community/NN and/CC member/NN states/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

To/TO this/DT end/NN the/DT High/NNP Commissioner/NNP recently/RB launched/VBD an/DT annual/JJ appeal/NN for/IN USD/NNP 53/CD million/CD to/TO enable/VB her/PRP$ office/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP these/DT tasks/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ Member/JJ States/NNPS should/MD take/VB the/DT lead/NN in/IN providing/VBG a/DT significant/JJ portion/NN of/IN these/DT funds/NNS ./.

In/IN so/RB doing/VBG ,/, we/PRP would/MD not/RB only/RB embarrass/VB the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS into/IN shouldering/VBG its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO UN/NNP funding/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP would/MD also/RB demonstrate/VB that/IN our/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO defending/VBG human/JJ rights/NNS is/VBZ more/RBR than/IN simply/RB empty/JJ rhetoric/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ mainly/RB concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT preparations/NNS for/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ annual/JJ UN/NNP Human/NNP Rights/NNPS Convention/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN and/CC Council/NNP '/POS s/VBZ efforts/NNS in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD first/RB of/IN all/DT like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ with/IN the/DT contributions/NNS made/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Patten/NNP and/CC the/DT Minister/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN both/DT China/NNP and/CC Cuba/NNP are/VBP on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Cuba/NNP is/VBZ the/DT last/JJ stronghold/NN of/IN dictatorship/NN in/IN South/NNP America/NNP and/CC we/PRP must/MD be/VB mindful/JJ of/IN this/DT ,/, with/IN all/DT due/JJ sympathy/NN to/TO Cuba/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT dictatorship/NN and/CC hence/RB not/RB a/DT democracy/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD ,/, during/IN my/PRP$ two/CD minutes/NNS ,/, like/VB to/TO draw/VB attention/NN to/TO two/CD countries/NNS which/WDT are/VBP close/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ heart/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ country/NN is/VBZ Indonesia/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP naturally/RB delighted/JJ that/IN Indonesia/NNP is/VBZ under/IN new/JJ rule/NN and/CC that/IN Mr/NNP Wahid/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Sukarnoputri/NNP are/VBP the/DT new/JJ President/NN and/CC Vice-President/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP also/RB pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Timor/NNP is/VBZ slowly/RB moving/VBG in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP can/MD report/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT Moluccas/NNPS ,/, an/DT area/NN just/RB north/RB of/IN Timor/NNP ,/, the/DT violence/NN is/VBZ still/RB not/RB under/IN control/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ claimed/VBN thousands/NNS of/IN lives/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD years/NNS ./.

Tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN people/NNS are/VBP on/IN the/DT run/NN ./.

The/DT situation/NN is/VBZ badly/RB managed/VBN ./.

My/PRP$ urgent/JJ request/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN echoed/VBN many/JJ times/NNS in/IN resolutions/NNS ,/, is/VBZ the/DT following/NN :/: could/MD you/PRP not/RB confer/VB so/RB that/IN observers/NNS can/MD be/VB sent/VBN to/TO the/DT Moluccas/NNPS ?/.

Surely/RB thousands/NNS of/IN people/NNS killed/VBN ,/, thousands/NNS wounded/VBN and/CC tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS on/IN the/DT run/NN is/VBZ enough/JJ ./.

My/PRP$ second/JJ country/NN -/: I/PRP will/MD be/VB brief/JJ as/IN Mr/NNP Patten/NNP knows/VBZ this/DT country/NN very/RB well/RB -/: is/VBZ Burma/JJ ./.

Surely/RB we/PRP can/MD not/RB just/RB keep/VB silent/JJ about/IN Burma/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP the/DT feeling/NN that/IN that/DT country/NN is/VBZ gradually/RB being/VBG relegated/VBN to/TO oblivion/NN ./.

For/IN ten/CD years/NNS now/RB ,/, the/DT elected/VBN President/NNP of/IN that/DT country/NN has/VBZ been/VBN under/IN house/NN arrest/NN ./.

And/CC for/IN ten/CD years/NNS now/RB ,/, its/PRP$ parliament/NN has/VBZ been/VBN out/RB of/IN action/NN ./.

Numerous/NNP MPs/NNP have/VBP been/VBN killed/VBN or/CC have/VBP fled/VBN the/DT country/NN and/CC only/RB a/DT few/JJ are/VBP left/VBN in/IN Burma/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP hundreds/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN refugees/NNS in/IN Thailand/NNP and/CC India/NNP from/IN Burma/NN and/CC yet/RB it/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN that/DT country/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB given/VBN any/DT attention/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, Burma/NN should/MD be/VB put/VBN back/RB on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, certainly/RB in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN Indonesia/NNP '/POS s/JJ U-turn/NN ./.

Surely/RB we/PRP can/MD not/RB tolerate/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN Mrs/NNP Aung/NNP San/NNP Sui/NNP Kyi/NNP feels/VBZ completely/RB left/VBN in/IN the/DT lurch/NN ,/, even/RB by/IN Europe/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ request/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, to/TO put/VB this/DT country/NN back/RP on/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, economic/JJ clout/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT only/JJ factor/NN that/WDT determines/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ status/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ distinguishing/JJ features/NNS is/VBZ our/PRP$ systematic/JJ approach/NN to/TO human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, as/IN exercised/VBN both/DT within/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC by/IN our/PRP$ partners/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD therefore/RB safely/RB say/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ never/RB allowed/VBN the/DT situation/NN in/IN East/NNP Timor/NNP to/TO be/VB forgotten/VBN ,/, which/WDT could/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT greatest/JJS obstacle/NN to/TO finding/VBG an/DT equitable/JJ solution/NN for/IN its/PRP$ people/NNS ,/, who/WP always/RB opposed/VBD occupation/NN by/IN Indonesia/NNP ./.

By/IN the/DT same/JJ token/NN we/PRP have/VBP recently/RB opposed/VBN arms/NNS sales/NNS to/TO Indonesia/NNP ,/, a/DT stance/NN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP unfortunately/RB did/VBD not/RB take/VB into/IN account/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB a/DT question/NN of/IN preventing/VBG or/CC putting/VBG a/DT stop/NN to/TO sickening/VB instances/NNS of/IN aggression/NN perpetrated/VBN by/IN individuals/NNS or/CC institutions/NNS against/IN those/DT in/IN a/DT weaker/JJR position/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ vital/JJ that/IN when/WRB violations/NNS are/VBP committed/VBN ,/, the/DT perpetrators/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO act/VB with/IN impunity/NN ,/, whoever/RB or/CC wherever/WRB they/PRP may/MD be/VB -/VBN in/IN Indonesia/NNP or/CC Angola/NNP ,/, in/IN Cuba/NNP ,/, China/NNP or/CC Burma/NNP ,/, whether/IN the/DT perpetrators/NNS are/VBP civilians/NNS or/CC soldiers/NNS ,/, humble/JJ foot-soldier/NN or/CC general/NN or/CC even/RB a/DT minister/NN ./.

Justice/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN in/IN Indonesia/NNP ./.

President/NNP Wahid/NNP needs/VBZ our/PRP$ support/NN to/TO cope/VB with/IN the/DT difficult/JJ situation/NN he/PRP is/VBZ faced/VBN with/IN ./.

The/DT specific/JJ reference/NN in/IN this/DT resolution/NN to/TO East/NNP Timor/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT initiative/NN of/IN the/DT PPE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT timely/JJ one/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO talk/VB about/IN East/NNP Timor/NNP without/IN mentioning/VBG the/DT tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN Timorese/JJ refugees/NNS living/VBG on/IN Indonesian/JJ soil/NN in/IN inhumane/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, under/IN the/DT control/NN of/IN Indonesian/NNP soldiers/NNS and/CC militias/NNS ,/, and/CC being/VBG used/VBN as/IN bargaining/NN chips/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT intolerable/JJ situation/NN which/WDT must/MD cease/VB as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO stress/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP highlighted/VBN ,/, that/IN human/JJ rights/NNS policy/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ identity/NN and/CC that/IN respect/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS should/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT fundamental/JJ principle/NN for/IN international/JJ cooperation/NN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP also/RB duly/RB noted/VBN the/DT concerns/NNS expressed/VBN by/IN many/JJ other/JJ Members/NNS about/IN other/JJ countries/NNS ,/, notably/RB Indonesia/NNP ,/, East/NNP Timor/NNP ,/, the/DT Moluccas/NNPS and/CC Burma/NN ./.

I/PRP could/MD not/RB conclude/VB without/IN mentioning/VBG Mr/NNP Van/NNP Hecke/NNP '/POS s/JJ speech/NN in/IN particular/JJ ,/, in/IN which/WDT he/PRP referred/VBD to/TO the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS situation/NN in/IN Africa/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT role/NN and/CC priorities/NNS of/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, and/CC questioned/VBD the/DT sincerity/NN of/IN the/DT priority/NN we/PRP are/VBP giving/VBG to/TO relations/NNS with/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, I/PRP can/MD not/RB stress/VB enough/RB the/DT significance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ having/VBG concluded/VBN important/JJ negotiations/NNS on/IN the/DT new/JJ convention/NN to/TO succeed/VB the/DT Lom脙/NNP 漏/NNP Convention/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, following/VBG extremely/RB complex/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ negotiations/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP succeeded/VBN in/IN organising/NN -/: or/CC making/VBG preparations/NNS for/IN the/DT organisation/NN of/IN -/: the/DT first/JJ EU-Africa/NNP Summit/NNP ./.

For/IN all/PDT these/DT reasons/NNS I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP essential/JJ to/TO reply/VB directly/RB to/TO Mr/NNP Van/NNP Hecke/NNP '/POS s/JJ question/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT very/RB useful/JJ debate/NN ./.

One/CD or/CC two/CD speeches/NNS have/VBP referred/VBN to/TO specific/JJ issues/NNS which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP well/RB advised/VBN to/TO think/VB about/IN very/RB carefully/RB ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Maij-Weggen/NNP referred/VBD to/TO both/DT Indonesia/NNP and/CC Burma/NNP and/CC made/VBD some/DT important/JJ points/NNS about/IN both/PDT those/DT countries/NNS and/CC the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS situation/NN there/RB ./.

What/WP I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/RP very/RB briefly/NN are/VBP one/CD or/CC two/CD themes/NNS which/WDT ran/VBD through/IN our/PRP$ debate/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT very/RB first/JJ speakers/NNS ,/, Mr/NNP Wuori/NNP ,/, spoke/VBD of/IN the/DT remarks/NNS made/VBN earlier/RB today/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Havel/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT remarkable/JJ speech/NN and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Mr/NNP Gollnisch/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR able/JJ to/TO be/VB with/IN us/PRP ,/, was/VBD able/JJ to/TO hear/VB that/DT speech/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

I/PRP also/RB hope/VBP that/IN ,/, if/IN there/EX is/VBZ any/DT life/NN in/IN outer/JJ space/NN ,/, as/IN has/VBZ been/VBN speculated/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Newton/NNP Dunn/NNP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD tuned/VBN in/IN to/TO Mr/NNP Havel/NNP '/POS s/JJ speech/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Mr/NNP Havel/NNP reminded/VBD us/PRP that/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB about/RB markets/NNS ,/, about/IN GDP/NNP growth/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT Union/NNP of/IN values/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS and/CC is/VBZ reflected/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ obligations/NNS in/IN the/DT whole/JJ area/NN of/IN external/JJ assistance/NN ,/, reflected/VBD quite/RB specifically/RB in/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP charged/VBN to/TO do/VB ./.

How/WRB do/VBP we/PRP implement/VB what/WP the/DT Treaties/NNPS say/VBP in/IN all/PDT those/DT words/NNS about/IN development/NN assistance/NN programmes/NNS ?/.

One/CD or/CC two/CD honourable/JJ Members/NNS ,/, Mr/NNP Ferber/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Cushnahan/NNP ,/, spoke/VBD about/IN the/DT gap/NN between/IN rhetoric/NN and/CC reality/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Cashman/NNP said/VBD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ right/JJ in/IN a/DT sense/NN ,/, that/IN words/NNS are/VBP no/DT substitute/NN for/IN real/JJ action/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, words/NNS can/MD make/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT difference/NN ,/, a/DT point/NN that/WDT was/VBD made/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Malmstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP ./.

She/PRP said/VBD that/IN she/PRP had/VBD received/VBN a/DT letter/NN from/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ Ambassador/NN ,/, a/DT very/RB amiable/JJ and/CC highly/RB intelligent/JJ representative/NN and/CC servant/NN of/IN his/PRP$ country/NN ,/, to/TO tell/VB her/PRP that/IN she/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ and/CC the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP was/VBD wrong/JJ in/IN its/PRP$ attitude/NN on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS in/IN China/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP after/IN her/PRP$ speech/NN she/PRP will/MD receive/VB a/DT cascade/NN of/IN letters/NNS from/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

She/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO fill/VB a/DT filing/NN cabinet/NN with/IN letters/NNS about/IN what/WP is/VBZ claimed/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT real/JJ situation/NN in/IN China/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP she/PRP was/VBD reflecting/VBG the/DT views/NNS of/IN many/JJ non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ,/, many/JJ people/NNS who/WP admire/VBP Chinese/JJ civilisation/NN but/CC are/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN China/NNP today/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD want/VB to/TO share/VB with/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN vicars/NNS say/VBP ,/, our/PRP$ views/NNS on/IN how/WRB that/DT spending/NN programme/NN to/TO support/VB human/JJ rights/NNS can/MD be/VB best/RBS focused/VBN and/CC best/RB targeted/VBN in/IN the/DT years/NNS ahead/RB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT question/NN which/WDT was/VBD referred/VBN to/TO by/IN Mr/NNP Salafranca/NNP ,/, who/WP I/PRP am/VBP sorry/JJ is/VBZ unable/JJ to/TO be/VB with/IN us/PRP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT brief/JJ but/CC useful/JJ debate/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT question/NN of/IN our/PRP$ overall/JJ policy/NN on/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT relationship/NN between/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC foreign/JJ policy/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO remind/VB Parliament/NNP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB publishing/VBG ,/, before/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, a/DT comprehensive/JJ ,/, intellectual/JJ case/NN for/IN placing/VBG human/JJ rights/NNS at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ immensely/RB important/JJ ,/, and/CC if/IN I/PRP had/VBD not/RB thought/VBN that/DT already/RB ,/, having/VBG listened/VBD to/TO the/DT remarkable/JJ speech/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Havel/NNP earlier/RB in/IN the/DT day/NN I/PRP would/MD have/VB certainly/RB come/VBN to/TO that/DT conclusion/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN December/NNP 1999/CD ,/, the/DT first/JJ round/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS were/VBD held/VBN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP ,/, after/IN an/DT interruption/NN of/IN several/JJ years/NNS in/IN negotiations/NNS between/IN the/DT Cypriot/JJ communities/NNS in/IN the/DT north/NN and/CC south/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN ./.

A/DT further/JJ round/NN was/VBD held/VBN in/IN January/NNP this/DT year/NN ,/, starting/VBG on/IN 31/CD January/NNP ,/, and/CC a/DT third/JJ round/NN is/VBZ scheduled/VBN to/TO start/VB on/IN 23/CD May/NNP in/IN New/NNP York/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT possibility/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN absolutely/RB confirmed/VBN ,/, that/IN continuous/JJ and/CC direct/JJ discussions/NNS may/MD take/VB place/NN ,/, with/IN work/NN continuing/VBG until/IN September/NNP this/DT year/NN ./.

These/DT discussions/NNS essentially/RB cover/VB four/CD areas/NNS :/: security/NN ,/, the/DT structure/NN of/IN government/NN ,/, territorial/VBP adjustments/NNS and/CC issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO refugees/NNS and/CC compensation/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN following/VBG the/DT partition/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, agreement/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN reached/VBN on/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN including/VBG other/JJ issues/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT northern/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN ,/, Rauf/NNP Denktash/NNP ,/, has/VBZ suggested/VBN three/CD new/JJ topics/NNS :/: sovereignty/NN ,/, confidence-building/JJ measures/NNS and/CC the/DT issue/NN of/IN lifting/VBG the/DT embargo/NN on/IN products/NNS from/IN the/DT north/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT Secretary-General/NNP of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC it/PRP will/MD therefore/RB have/VB to/TO form/VB part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ future/JJ analysis/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD take/VB place/NN after/IN the/DT election/NN in/IN the/DT north/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN scheduled/VBN for/IN 18/CD April/NNP ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN ,/, following/VBG the/DT example/NN of/IN previous/JJ presidencies/NNS ,/, to/TO appoint/VB a/DT representative/NN to/TO establish/VB contacts/NNS with/IN the/DT various/JJ parties/NNS involved/VBN in/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

This/DT representative/NN has/VBZ already/RB contacted/VBN all/PDT these/DT parties/NNS and/CC has/VBZ ,/, in/IN close/JJ cooperation/NN with/IN the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Secretary-General/NNP of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ,/, been/VBN monitoring/VBG and/CC assisting/VBG with/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ rounds/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB another/DT important/JJ aspect/NN which/WDT I/PRP referred/VBD to/TO at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN my/PRP$ statement/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT relates/VBZ to/TO Turkey/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN in/IN helping/VBG the/DT north/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN accession/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB necessary/JJ to/TO read/VB the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP with/IN some/DT care/NN and/CC attention/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN we/PRP should/MD also/RB take/VB advantage/NN of/IN the/DT willingness/NN of/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO help/VB to/TO resolve/VB this/DT situation/NN ./.

This/DT window/NN of/IN opportunity/NN involves/VBZ combining/VBG various/JJ factors/NNS ,/, one/CD of/IN which/WDT -/: and/CC let/VB us/PRP be/VB frank/JJ about/IN this/DT -/: is/VBZ the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN Turkey/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ key/JJ as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT future/NN of/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, this/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP in/IN the/DT Council/NNP -/: and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP will/MD join/VB us/PRP in/IN this/DT -/: should/MD encourage/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ involvement/NN in/IN this/DT undertaking/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO send/VB the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT message/NN of/IN confidence/NN about/IN its/PRP$ role/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD at/IN the/DT beginning/NN ,/, the/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP last/JJ December/NNP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT visible/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT positions/NNS of/IN the/DT various/JJ parties/NNS to/TO this/DT process/NN have/VBP developed/VBN ./.

The/DT Nicosia/NNP Government/NNP has/VBZ expressed/VBN its/PRP$ satisfaction/NN with/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP conclusions/NNS ,/, which/WDT open/VBP up/RP the/DT way/NN to/TO accession/VB to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP without/IN solving/VBG the/DT partition/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN beforehand/RB ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT same/JJ authorities/NNS have/VBP expressed/VBN their/PRP$ concern/NN about/IN the/DT pressure/NN they/PRP may/MD come/VB under/IN to/TO resolve/VB the/DT issues/NNS raised/VBN by/IN partition/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD evidently/RB imply/VB some/DT concessions/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ related/VBN to/TO developments/NNS in/IN the/DT sphere/NN of/IN displaced/JJ people/NNS and/CC the/DT possibility/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ arrangement/NN regarding/VBG displaced/JJ people/NNS should/MD a/DT different/JJ solution/NN be/VB found/VBN for/IN the/DT island/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, this/DT discharge/NN report/NN is/VBZ naturally/RB addressed/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

But/CC this/DT does/VBZ not/RB detract/VB from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP should/MD also/RB put/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN ./.

As/RB long/RB as/IN we/PRP have/VBP no/DT status/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB credible/JJ as/IN a/DT force/NN for/IN reforming/VBG the/DT Union/NNP ./.

The/DT reforms/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO continue/VB Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ development/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB have/VB a/DT decisive/JJ and/CC fair/JJ Europe/NNP unless/IN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB open/JJ and/CC democratic/JJ ./.

All/DT institutions/NNS must/MD now/RB join/VB forces/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO work/VB together/RB towards/IN building/VBG this/DT type/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Industry/NNP decided/VBD to/TO go/VB ahead/RB and/CC draw/VB up/RP a/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT discharge/NN for/IN 1997/CD although/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB specifically/RB asked/VBN to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

We/PRP went/VBD ahead/RB because/IN we/PRP felt/VBD we/PRP should/MD start/VB this/DT Parliament/NNP in/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP mean/VBP to/TO go/VB on/RP ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, by/IN making/VBG sure/JJ that/IN we/PRP take/VBP good/JJ care/NN of/IN taxpayers/NNS '/POS money/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

During/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN our/PRP$ work/NN on/IN this/DT report/NN it/PRP became/VBD clear/JJ that/IN there/EX are/VBP persistent/JJ problems/NNS in/IN the/DT spending/VBG areas/NNS under/IN the/DT control/NN of/IN our/PRP$ budget/NN ./.

They/PRP were/VBD not/RB unique/JJ to/TO 1997/CD and/CC two/CD strands/NNS seem/VBP to/TO run/VB through/IN them/PRP ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ a/DT tendency/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO embark/VB on/IN very/RB ambitious/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, particularly/RB in/IN third/JJ countries/NNS ,/, without/IN sufficient/JJ assessment/NN of/IN the/DT practicalities/NNS of/IN implementation/NN and/CC proper/JJ resourcing/NN ./.

The/DT second/NN involves/VBZ serious/JJ managerial/JJ shortcomings/NNS in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN particular/JJ in/IN relation/NN to/TO coordination/NN across/IN departments/NNS and/CC management/NN of/IN external/JJ contracts/NNS ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN all/PDT the/DT Institutions/NNS bear/VBP some/DT responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT increasing/VBG workload/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC for/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./.

That/DT can/MD not/RB excuse/VB everything/NN that/IN we/PRP came/VBD across/RP ./.

Citizens/NNPS of/IN Europe/NNP expect/VBP the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS to/TO be/VB properly/RB managed/VBN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP right/JJ to/TO do/VB so/RB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP want/VBP to/TO echo/VB the/DT comments/NNS from/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN about/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT reform/NN process/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN promised/VBN to/TO the/DT people/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP by/IN Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ./.

We/PRP need/VBP from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP material/NN we/PRP can/MD use/VB to/TO help/VB us/PRP scrutinise/VB spending/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP proper/JJ information/NN ,/, given/VBN in/IN a/DT proper/JJ way/NN and/CC we/PRP all/DT have/VBP to/TO take/VB this/DT whole/JJ process/NN a/DT lot/RB more/RBR seriously/RB than/IN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN seen/VBN as/IN a/DT bureaucratic/JJ process/NN to/TO be/VB done/VBN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ in/IN as/IN little/JJ time/NN as/RB possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP colleagues/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP will/MD support/VB the/DT grounds/NNS for/IN discharge/NN for/IN 1997/CD and/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD push/VB ahead/RB with/IN the/DT reform/NN process/NN which/WDT is/VBZ long/RB overdue/JJ ./.

Only/RB in/IN this/DT way/NN can/NN we/PRP create/VBP a/DT new/JJ culture/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN get/VB public/JJ confidence/NN restored/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB relieved/VBN to/TO hear/VB that/IN the/DT 97/CD discharge/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ to/TO have/VB the/DT same/JJ impact/NN as/IN the/DT 96/CD discharge/NN which/WDT ,/, as/IN you/PRP are/VBP all/DT so/RB very/RB well/RB aware/JJ ,/, led/VBD to/TO the/DT forced/VBN resignation/NN of/IN the/DT Santer/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

The/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP will/MD be/VB voting/VBG to/TO grant/VB discharge/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP will/MD be/VB relieved/VBN to/TO hear/VB that/DT as/RB well/RB ./.

But/CC that/DT is/VBZ not/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP satisfied/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN everything/NN in/IN the/DT garden/NN is/VBZ rosy/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN a/DT radical/JJ overhaul/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ long/RB overdue/JJ ./.

It/PRP indicates/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP acknowledge/VBP that/IN steps/NNS are/VBP being/VBG made/VBN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO outline/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT issues/NNS that/IN we/PRP ,/, as/IN Socialists/NNPS ,/, have/VBP put/VBN down/RP as/IN amendments/NNS ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP these/DT will/MD be/VB carried/VBN because/IN they/PRP are/VBP important/JJ in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN they/PRP will/MD impact/VB on/IN future/JJ reform/NN ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT immunity/NN of/IN officials/NNS :/: this/DT should/MD be/VB lifted/VBN if/IN and/CC when/WRB requested/VBD by/IN a/DT national/JJ prosecutor/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP much/RB easier/JJR to/TO prosecute/VB officials/NNS who/WP are/VBP guilty/JJ of/IN fraud/NN and/CC corruption/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ critical/JJ to/TO note/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ too/RB often/RB failed/VBN to/TO act/VB on/IN the/DT reforms/NNS recommended/VBN by/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS ./.

The/DT Court/NNP 's/POS report/NN is/VBZ there/RB for/IN a/DT reason/NN ,/, our/PRP$ response/NN to/TO it/PRP is/VBZ there/RB for/IN a/DT reason/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ followed/VBN through/IN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP just/RB heard/VBN now/RB that/IN an/DT audit/NN progress/NN board/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB set/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Even/RB if/IN we/PRP hear/VBP nothing/NN else/RB ,/, we/PRP know/VBP that/IN is/VBZ going/VBG in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT reforms/NNS that/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB ./.

Too/RB often/RB we/PRP have/VBP put/VBN forward/RP recommendations/NNS and/CC they/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN acted/VBN upon/RB even/RB though/IN you/PRP have/VBP said/VBN very/RB often/RB that/IN you/PRP will/MD act/VB on/IN them/PRP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB that/DT follow-through/JJ to/TO a/DT much/RB greater/JJR extent/NN in/IN future/NN ./.

The/DT other/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ access/NN to/TO confidential/JJ documents/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN problems/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ responsibility/NN in/IN carrying/VBG out/RP discharge/NN because/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB had/VBN access/NN to/TO the/DT documents/NNS we/PRP should/MD have/VB had/VBN ./.

We/PRP understand/VBP that/IN we/PRP also/RB have/VBP a/DT responsibility/NN here/RB ,/, that/IN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP given/VBN documents/NNS we/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN confidential/JJ documents/NNS will/MD indeed/RB be/VB kept/VBN confidential/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP put/VBN down/RB an/DT amendment/NN to/TO that/DT effect/NN ./.

One/CD issue/NN which/WDT is/VBZ referred/VBN to/TO in/IN the/DT van/NNP der/NNP Laan/NNP report/NN is/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ question/NN of/IN the/DT Gaza/NNP hospital/NN ./.

The/DT situation/NN there/RB is/VBZ totally/RB unacceptable/JJ ./.

We/PRP will/MD not/RB put/VB up/RP with/IN it/PRP for/IN much/RB longer/RB and/CC we/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN immediate/JJ action/NN on/IN that/DT issue/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Lousewies/NNP van/NNP der/NNP Laan/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB usually/RB bother/VB congratulating/NN people/NNS but/CC I/PRP think/VBP she/PRP has/VBZ produced/VBN a/DT very/RB cogent/JJ report/NN and/CC deserves/VBZ our/PRP$ thanks/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP honest/JJ ,/, we/PRP find/VBP ourselves/PRP in/IN a/DT somewhat/RB unusual/JJ situation/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP discussing/VBG last/JJ year/NN '/POS s/JJ discharge/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ responsibility/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO raise/VB the/DT problems/NNS which/WDT are/VBP still/RB piled/VBN up/RB high/JJ on/IN our/PRP$ desks/NNS ./.

The/DT assessment/NN of/IN whether/IN or/CC not/RB the/DT discharge/NN will/MD be/VB granted/VBN also/RB depends/VBZ to/TO some/DT extent/NN on/IN where/WRB the/DT emphasis/NN is/VBZ placed/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN a/DT Commission/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ no/RB more/JJR ./.

There/EX is/VBZ now/RB a/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

Then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ logical/JJ to/TO grant/VB discharge/NN ,/, because/IN how/WRB can/MD the/DT current/JJ Commissioner/NNP be/VB blamed/VBN where/WRB 1997/CD is/VBZ concerned/JJ ?/.

The/DT problems/NNS remain/VBP and/CC this/DT gives/VBZ rise/NN to/TO doubts/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO take/VB a/DT decision/NN now/RB regarding/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ good/JJ intentions/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ still/RB no/DT structural/JJ outline/NN for/IN these/DT good/JJ intentions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP will/MD present/VB his/PRP$ proposal/NN next/JJ month/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB very/RB much/RB anticipating/VBG this/DT ,/, but/CC the/DT facts/NNS are/VBP still/RB missing/VBG at/IN this/DT time/NN when/WRB we/PRP already/RB have/VBP to/TO decide/VB whether/IN or/CC not/RB to/TO grant/VB discharge/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clearly/RB a/DT dilemma/NN with/IN which/WDT the/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ also/RB struggled/VBN ./.

This/DT dilemma/NN stretches/VBZ beyond/IN the/DT areas/NNS which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP already/RB listed/VBN ./.

Take/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT pledges/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

They/PRP look/VBP good/JJ in/IN themselves/PRP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP read/VBN a/DT few/JJ documents/NNS written/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP and/CC we/PRP have/VBP every/DT confidence/NN in/IN them/PRP ./.

But/CC I/PRP will/MD give/VB two/CD examples/NNS from/IN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB as/RB evident/JJ that/IN the/DT good/JJ intentions/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ now/RB expressed/VBN will/MD lead/VB to/TO a/DT good/JJ outcome/NN :/: the/DT public/JJ nature/NN and/CC confidentiality/NN of/IN documents/NNS ./.

The/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN already/RB said/VBD something/NN about/IN this/DT ./.

A/DT document/NN is/VBZ circulating/VBG at/IN the/DT moment/NN -/: not/RB at/IN a/DT low/JJ level/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN a/DT high/JJ level/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP -/: which/WDT ,/, instead/RB of/IN enhancing/VBG the/DT public/JJ nature/NN of/IN documents/NNS ,/, is/VBZ having/VBG the/DT opposite/JJ effect/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT illustration/NN of/IN empty/JJ pledges/NNS not/RB necessarily/RB leading/VBG to/TO good/JJ results/NNS ./.

This/DT also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO whistle-blowers/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP still/RB not/RB had/VBN a/DT response/NN to/TO crucial/JJ questions/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN ./.

So/IN there/EX is/VBZ doubt/NN as/IN to/TO whether/IN these/DT pledges/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP contain/VBP enough/JJ substance/NN at/IN this/DT crucial/JJ time/NN when/WRB decisions/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB made/VBN ./.

This/DT also/RB applies/VBZ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT very/RB real/JJ projects/NNS which/WDT the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Industry/NNP has/VBZ introduced/VBN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, our/PRP$ group/NN still/RB feels/VBZ sympathy/NN for/IN ,/, and/CC patience/RB with/IN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP because/IN it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB held/VBN responsible/JJ for/IN a/DT large/JJ proportion/NN of/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS made/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT patience/NN has/VBZ a/DT limit/NN ./.

Clear/JJ progress/NN must/MD be/VB visible/JJ ./.

At/IN present/JJ ,/, we/PRP trust/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD produce/VB these/DT sound/JJ proposals/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT foregone/JJ conclusion/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD do/VB so/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT 1996/CD discharge/NN was/VBD the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP express/VBP the/DT hope/NN that/IN -/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT present/JJ Commission/NNP to/TO ensure/VB that/DT -/: the/DT 1997/CD discharge/NN is/VBZ the/DT beginning/NN of/IN a/DT true/JJ reform/NN of/IN financial/JJ policy/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Otherwise/RB this/DT discharge/NN will/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN of/IN any/DT value/NN ./.

In/IN assessing/VBG the/DT question/NN of/IN whether/IN or/CC not/RB to/TO grant/VB the/DT Commission/NNP discharge/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN must/MD be/VB based/VBN upon/IN what/WP actually/RB occurred/VBD during/IN the/DT financial/JJ year/NN concerned/JJ ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN 1997/CD ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ Group/NNP ,/, we/PRP find/VBP it/PRP hard/JJ to/TO see/VB how/WRB the/DT financial/JJ administration/NN for/IN 1997/CD was/VBD in/IN any/DT crucial/JJ way/NN better/JJR than/IN that/DT for/IN 1996/CD ./.

In/IN that/DT year/NN ,/, we/PRP voted/VBD against/IN granting/VBG discharge/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD vote/VB against/IN granting/VBG discharge/NN for/IN 1997/CD ,/, too/RB ./.

We/PRP think/VBP that/IN this/DT picture/NN of/IN ours/PRP is/VBZ confirmed/VBN by/IN the/DT examination/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ both/DT good/JJ and/CC necessary/JJ that/IN reforms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN promised/VBN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, the/DT promises/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN are/VBP still/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB fulfilled/VBN ,/, especially/RB where/WRB transparency/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB going/VBG to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT demands/NNS for/IN reforms/NNS which/WDT are/VBP presented/VBN in/IN the/DT resolution/NN ,/, but/CC against/IN the/DT granting/NN of/IN discharge/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP have/VBP only/RB positive/JJ comments/NNS to/TO make/VB on/IN Mrs/NNP Van/NNP der/NNP Laan/NNP '/POS s/JJ very/JJ expert/NN work/NN on/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Nations/NNP Group/NNP can/MD not/RB vote/VB for/IN approving/VBG the/DT accounts/NNS for/IN 1997/CD ./.

The/DT report/NN on/IN so-called/JJ discharge/NN contains/VBZ a/DT comprehensive/JJ and/CC extremely/RB critical/JJ survey/NN of/IN the/DT accounts/NNS ./.

We/PRP support/VBP these/DT critical/JJ remarks/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP must/MD therefore/RB state/VB that/IN it/PRP would/MD seem/VB quite/RB absurd/JJ ,/, against/IN this/DT background/NN ,/, to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN approving/VBG the/DT accounts/NNS ./.

The/DT majority/NN have/VBP made/VBN their/PRP$ approval/NN of/IN the/DT accounts/NNS conditional/JJ upon/IN the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ implementing/VBG a/DT series/NN of/IN reforms/NNS ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN from/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ period/NN of/IN office/NN is/VBZ not/RB repeated/VBN ./.

Again/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN here/RB with/IN an/DT extremely/RB unfortunate/JJ confusion/NN of/IN the/DT old/JJ Commission/NN '/POS s/JJ accountability/NN for/IN 1997/CD and/CC the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ accountability/NN for/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP ,/, under/IN any/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, could/MD incur/VB liability/NN for/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

We/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ wrong/JJ to/TO talk/VB about/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ liability/NN as/IN an/DT institution/NN ./.

The/DT mistakes/NNS up/RB until/IN 1999/CD are/VBP attributable/JJ to/TO those/DT who/WP had/VBD responsibility/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP still/RB have/VBP no/DT way/NN of/IN knowing/VBG whether/IN the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP can/MD do/VB any/DT better/RBR ./.

By/IN means/NNS of/IN this/DT extraordinary/JJ procedure/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP is/VBZ stopping/VBG itself/PRP from/IN placing/VBG liability/NN for/IN the/DT arrangements/NNS in/IN 1997/CD squarely/RB where/WRB it/PRP belongs/VBZ ,/, namely/RB with/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD the/DT 1996/CD accounts/NNS which/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT downfall/NN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT 1997/CD accounts/NNS are/VBP just/RB as/RB incriminating/VBG ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN why/WRB ,/, against/IN this/DT background/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD agree/VB to/TO grant/VB discharge/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT decision/NN to/TO balance/VB the/DT accounts/NNS is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, we/PRP shall/MD abstain/VB from/IN voting/NN ,/, and/CC where/WRB ,/, finally/RB ,/, the/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, we/PRP shall/MD attach/VB most/JJS importance/NN to/TO the/DT many/JJ correct/JJ instructions/NNS contained/VBN in/IN this/DT and/CC vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT decision/NN relating/VBG to/TO discharge/VB for/IN the/DT 1997/CD financial/JJ year/NN was/VBD postponed/VBN because/IN the/DT erstwhile/JJ Commission/NN ,/, to/TO whom/WP it/PRP was/VBD to/TO be/VB granted/VBN ,/, had/VBD stepped/VBN down/RP before/IN the/DT appointed/VBN time/NN and/CC was/VBD only/RB continuing/VBG in/IN office/NN in/IN a/DT caretaker/NN capacity/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP van/NNP der/NNP Laan/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN -/: on/IN which/WDT she/PRP has/VBZ lavished/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN hard/JJ work/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP indebted/JJ to/TO her/PRP -/: proposes/VBZ that/IN we/PRP should/MD grant/VB discharge/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN 1997/CD ./.

One/PRP might/MD ask/VB how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT current/JJ Commission/NNP is/VBZ to/TO receive/VB the/DT discharge/NN for/IN its/PRP$ predecessor/NN '/POS s/JJ budgetary/JJ management/NN -/: Mr/NNP Camre/NNP just/RB mentioned/VBD this/DT -/: particularly/RB as/IN the/DT discharge/NN for/IN the/DT previous/JJ year/NN ,/, 1996/CD ,/, was/VBD denied/VBN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ just/RB the/DT way/NN things/NNS are/VBP ,/, however/RB ./.

In/IN taking/VBG over/IN the/DT mandate/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ to/TO assume/VB responsibility/NN not/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT achievements/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN but/CC also/RB for/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS made/VBN ./.

This/DT question/NN ought/MD to/TO have/VB been/VBN asked/VBN when/WRB the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP was/VBD appointed/VBN ./.

If/IN Parliament/NNP votes/VBZ in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN this/DT week/NN and/CC grants/VBZ discharge/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD not/RB take/VB this/DT to/TO be/VB a/DT blank/JJ cheque/NN ./.

For/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT third/JJ section/NN of/IN Mrs/NNP van/NNP der/NNP Laan/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, namely/RB the/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN ./.

The/DT comments/NNS contained/VBN within/IN ,/, under/IN eight/CD headings/NNS ,/, are/VBP an/DT integral/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT discharge/NN ,/, the/DT implementation/NN of/IN which/WDT forms/VBZ the/DT basis/NN of/IN our/PRP$ decision/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT discharge/NN procedure/NN for/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS -/: that/WDT for/IN 1998/CD is/VBZ already/RB under/IN way/NN -/: Parliament/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO examine/VB ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgency/NN ,/, whether/IN or/CC not/RB it/PRP was/VBD too/RB quick/JJ to/TO bestow/VB premature/JJ praise/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN 1997/CD ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO judge/VB just/RB as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP presents/VBZ its/PRP$ reform/NN programme/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO use/VB the/DT discharge/NN procedure/NN for/IN 1998/CD to/TO check/VB whether/IN efficiency/NN ,/, transparency/NN and/CC accountability/NN ,/, and/CC likewise/RB a/DT sincere/JJ willingness/NN to/TO provide/VB information/NN ,/, are/VBP being/VBG displayed/VBN vis-脙/JJ -/: vis/VBG the/DT discharge/NN authority/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP all/DT recall/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP decided/VBD to/TO postpone/VB the/DT discharge/NN for/IN the/DT 1997/CD financial/JJ year/NN pending/VBG commitments/NNS from/IN the/DT new/JJ European/NNP Commission/NNP regarding/VBG internal/JJ reform/NN ./.

In/IN response/NN to/TO this/DT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ entered/VBN into/IN various/JJ commitments/NNS and/CC has/VBZ certainly/RB adopted/VBN many/JJ reform/NN measures/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ fair/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT new/JJ President/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ team/NN are/VBP certainly/RB committed/VBN to/TO implementing/VBG the/DT financial/JJ control/NN requirements/NNS as/IN laid/VBN down/RP by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP must/MD now/RB be/VB taken/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN that/WDT is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO take/VB place/NN in/IN the/DT run-up/NN to/TO the/DT forthcoming/JJ Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP and/CC the/DT reform/NN of/IN various/JJ EU/NNP policies/NNS and/CC initiatives/NNS ./.

Existing/VBG EU/NNP treaties/NNS will/MD be/VB amended/VBN so/RB as/IN to/TO ensure/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT enlargement/NN process/NN can/MD succeed/VB ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT doubt/NN further/JJ reform/NN of/IN EU/NNP institutions/NNS will/MD be/VB analysed/VBN in/IN this/DT debate/NN ./.

But/CC from/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN small/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ reformed/VBN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT ensures/VBZ that/IN small/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS continue/VBP to/TO have/VB representation/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ now/RB to/TO obtain/VB its/PRP$ discharge/NN for/IN 1997/CD ,/, but/CC in/IN reality/NN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB deserve/VB it/PRP ./.

1997/CD was/VBD a/DT matter/NN for/IN the/DT old/JJ Commission/NNP and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB think/VB that/IN it/PRP can/MD accept/VB liability/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN implementation/NN of/IN the/DT Budget/NNP for/IN 1997/CD fell/VBD within/IN the/DT old/JJ Commission/NN '/POS s/JJ remit/NN ./.

The/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, undertaken/VBN to/TO carry/VB out/RP a/DT cleaning/NN up/IN exercise/NN following/VBG former/JJ scandals/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP must/MD admit/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB impressed/VBN at/IN all/DT ./.

The/DT old/JJ mindset/NN which/WDT involved/VBN sweeping/JJ things/NNS under/IN the/DT carpet/NN and/CC protecting/VBG one/CD '/POS s/JJ friends/NNS unfortunately/RB still/RB exists/VBZ ./.

There/EX are/VBP some/DT who/WP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/JJR in/IN our/PRP$ interests/NNS to/TO let/VB bygones/NNS be/VB bygones/JJ and/CC make/VB a/DT fresh/JJ start/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, think/VBP we/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT fresh/JJ start/NN if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB tidy/VB things/NNS up/RP properly/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG here/RB especially/RB to/TO the/DT earlier/JJR scandals/NNS involving/VBG ECHO/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP very/RB indignant/JJ about/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB any/DT documents/NNS handed/VBN over/RP on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN ECHO/NNP on/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP shall/MD have/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN difficulty/NN carrying/VBG out/RP my/PRP$ work/NN if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD not/RB give/VB me/PRP the/DT necessary/JJ information/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, it/PRP looks/VBZ as/RB if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ something/NN to/TO hide/VB ./.

My/PRP$ investigations/NNS also/RB unfortunately/RB suggest/VBP that/IN this/DT could/MD be/VB the/DT case/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB putting/VBG all/PDT its/PRP$ cards/NNS on/IN the/DT table/NN and/CC is/VBZ in/IN that/DT way/NN repeating/VBG ancient/JJ practice/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD this/DT practice/NN which/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ downfall/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD therefore/RB fully/RB support/VB the/DT demand/NN to/TO give/VB Parliament/NNP unconditional/JJ right/NN of/IN access/NN to/TO documents/NNS ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Schreyer/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12/CD p.m./RB Response/NNP to/TO Second/NNP Report/NNP of/IN Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0001/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ,/, on/IN action/NN to/TO be/VB taken/VBN on/IN the/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS on/IN reform/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT time/NN last/JJ year/NN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP set/VBD up/RP a/DT committee/NN of/IN independent/JJ experts/NNS chaired/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Middelhoek/NNP to/TO investigate/VB allegations/NNS of/IN fraud/NN ,/, nepotism/NN and/CC corruption/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP ./.

On/IN 15/CD March/NNP the/DT committee/NN published/VBD its/PRP$ first/JJ report/NN concluding/VBG that/DT :/: ``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ becoming/VBG difficult/JJ to/TO find/VB anyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ even/RB the/DT slightest/JJS sense/NN of/IN responsibility/NN ''/'' ./.

I/PRP am/VBP also/RB pleased/JJ that/IN Parliament/NNP essentially/RB supports/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ view/NN that/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP should/MD be/VB applied/VBN in/IN all/DT rural/JJ areas/NNS ,/, that/IN overriding/VBG priorities/NNS should/MD be/VB introduced/VBN and/CC that/IN ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, active/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC networking/NN between/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS should/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, I/PRP note/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP shares/NNS the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP view/VBP that/IN the/DT preferred/JJ form/NN for/IN implementing/VBG LEADER/NNP +/NNP is/VBZ the/DT use/NN of/IN global/JJ grants/NNS ./.

Turning/VBG now/RB to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT individual/JJ questions/NNS raised/VBN here/RB today/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD also/RB confirm/VB that/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO have/VB the/DT widest/JJS possible/JJ partnership/NN and/CC participation/NN in/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP ./.

The/DT various/JJ groups/NNS ,/, be/VB they/PRP environmental/JJ organisations/NNS or/CC groups/NNS concerned/JJ with/IN employment/NN ,/, have/VBP the/DT possibility/NN of/IN taking/VBG part/NN in/IN drafting/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP directives/NNS ./.

And/CC there/EX will/MD not/RB be/VB less/JJR funds/NNS available/JJ than/IN in/IN the/DT current/JJ period/NN either/RB ;/: there/EX will/MD be/VB more/JJR ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN setting/VBG up/RP an/DT observatory/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN new/JJ ./.

There/EX was/VBD also/RB an/DT observatory/NN under/IN LEADER/NNP I/NNP and/CC LEADER/NNP II/NNP ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ one/CD purpose/NN only/RB and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ precisely/RB to/TO maintain/VB active/JJ networking/NN between/IN the/DT individual/JJ LEADER/JJ groups/NNS ./.

The/DT cost/NN of/IN this/DT observatory/NN is/VBZ not/RB permitted/VBN to/TO exceed/VB 2/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT LEADER/JJ budget/NN ./.

I/PRP now/RB come/VBP to/TO the/DT content/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

In/IN point/NN 14/CD ,/, Parliament/NNP calls/VBZ on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO submit/VB an/DT evaluation/NN report/NN on/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP immediately/RB ./.

I/PRP should/MD simply/RB like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN this/DT does/VBZ not/RB make/VB very/RB much/JJ sense/NN at/IN the/DT present/JJ time/NN because/IN ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB possible/JJ -/: and/CC in/IN fact/NN will/MD be/VB until/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2001/CD -/: for/IN LEADER/NNP II/NNP funds/NNS to/TO be/VB disbursed/VBN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB think/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB more/RBR sensible/JJ to/TO wait/VB until/IN the/DT programme/NN '/POS s/JJ conclusion/NN before/IN carrying/VBG out/RP the/DT evaluation/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD obviously/RB do/VB this/DT and/CC will/MD also/RB forward/VB a/DT report/NN to/TO you/PRP on/IN it/PRP ./.

In/IN point/NN 18/CD ,/, Parliament/NNP suggests/VBZ publishing/VBG a/DT compendium/NN of/IN examples/NNS of/IN successful/JJ initiatives/NNS ./.

In/IN response/NN I/PRP can/MD only/RB say/VB that/IN this/DT already/RB exists/VBZ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN compiled/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC I/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT copy/NN available/JJ to/TO any/DT Member/NNP of/IN this/DT House/NNP who/WP is/VBZ interested/JJ ./.

In/IN point/NN 21/CD ,/, Parliament/NNP stresses/VBZ that/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS in/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP now/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB adopted/VBN quickly/RB so/RB that/IN the/DT programmes/NNS can/MD start/VB ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB fully/RB share/VB your/PRP$ concern/NN ./.

As/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT opinion/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP will/MD again/RB be/VB presented/VBN to/TO the/DT STAR/NNP Committee/NNP so/RB that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS can/MD confirm/VB the/DT provisional/JJ agreement/NN which/WDT they/PRP gave/VBD on/IN 14/CD November/NNP ./.

I/PRP assume/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD then/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO adopt/VB the/DT definitive/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT guidelines/NNS in/IN March/NNP or/CC April/NNP ./.

And/CC as/RB soon/RB as/IN these/DT are/VBP published/VBN in/IN the/DT Official/NNP Journal/NNP the/DT remaining/JJ months/NNS -/: in/IN fact/NN six/CD months/NNS -/: can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO submit/VB LEADER/JJ +/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO point/VB out/RP one/CD thing/NN :/: expenditure/NN effected/VBN under/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP is/VBZ eligible/JJ from/IN the/DT time/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP programme/NN starts/VBZ running/VBG ./.

For/IN all/DT programmes/NNS submitted/VBN before/IN 30/CD April/NNP of/IN this/DT year/NN it/PRP will/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO backdate/VB the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT period/NN of/IN eligibility/CD to/TO 1/CD January/NNP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, under/IN point/NN 20/CD the/DT motion/NN for/IN a/DT resolution/NN contains/VBZ seven/CD specific/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT guidelines/NNS ./.

Having/VBG given/VBN them/PRP thorough/JJ consideration/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT proposals/NNS made/VBD under/IN paragraphs/NNP 2/CD ,/, 4/CD ,/, 5/CD and/CC 7/CD are/VBP acceptable/JJ to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC are/VBP adopted/VBN ./.

The/DT proposal/NN in/IN paragraph/NN 6/CD will/MD also/RB be/VB partly/RB accepted/VBN because/IN it/PRP reaffirms/VBZ that/IN the/DT time/NN allowed/VBN for/IN approving/VBG programmes/NNS under/IN LEADER/NNP +/NNP is/VBZ a/DT maximum/NN of/IN 5/CD months/NNS ./.

The/DT amendment/NN proposed/VBN under/IN paragraph/NN 1/CD has/VBZ ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ view/NN ,/, been/VBN overtaken/VBN by/IN events/NNS because/IN ,/, following/VBG consultations/NNS with/IN the/DT representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN the/DT STAR/NNP Committee/NNP ,/, this/DT point/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN reworded/VBN along/IN the/DT lines/NNS proposed/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

That/DT therefore/RB leaves/VBZ only/RB the/DT amendment/NN proposed/VBN under/IN paragraph/NN 3/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD only/RB endorse/VB this/DT request/NN because/IN of/IN course/NN it/PRP corresponds/VBZ precisely/RB to/TO what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP had/VBD originally/RB proposed/VBN ./.

I/PRP must/MD add/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN cooperation/NN between/IN our/PRP$ action/NN groups/NNS and/CC similar/JJ groups/NNS in/IN third/JJ countries/NNS went/VBD too/RB far/RB for/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

An/DT amendment/NN was/VBD therefore/RB made/VBN in/IN the/DT committee/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD now/RB again/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ concern/NN in/IN the/DT revised/VBN version/NN and/CC table/NN the/DT guidelines/NNS in/IN that/DT form/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD also/RB continue/VB to/TO fight/VB for/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS acceptance/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP will/MD comment/VB briefly/RB on/IN the/DT 13/CD amendments/NNS tabled/VBN ./.

Here/RB there/EX are/VBP only/RB three/CD which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB accept/VB ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 3/CD ,/, 12/CD and/CC 13/CD ./.

It/PRP can/MD accept/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT others/NNS either/CC in/IN full/JJ or/CC in/IN essence/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT exceptionally/RB fortunate/JJ circumstance/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG the/DT EQUAL/JJ initiative/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP just/RB at/IN this/DT time/NN ./.

Recently/RB ,/, because/RB of/IN political/JJ developments/NNS in/IN Austria/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ growing/VBG unease/NN within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Political/NNP demonstrations/NNS are/VBP taking/VBG place/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN political/JJ dialogue/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ stressing/VBG that/IN both/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD put/VB forward/RP specific/JJ policies/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP specific/JJ proposals/NNS ,/, both/DT for/IN legislation/NN and/CC for/IN action/NN programmes/NNS associated/VBN with/IN the/DT fight/NN against/IN discrimination/NN and/CC the/DT formation/NN of/IN free/JJ and/CC fair/JJ societies/NNS ./.

So/IN I/PRP will/MD make/VB brief/JJ mention/NN of/IN the/DT package/NN against/IN discrimination/NN and/CC take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO ask/VB the/DT competent/JJ parliamentary/JJ committees/NNS to/TO appoint/VB their/PRP$ rapporteurs/NNS so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD move/VB ahead/RB with/IN the/DT anti-discrimination/JJ package/NN as/IN soon/RB as/RB possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP now/RB come/VBP to/TO the/DT EQUAL/JJ initiative/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN Article/NNP 13/CD ./.

The/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN relates/VBZ to/TO all/DT forms/NNS of/IN discrimination/NN within/IN the/DT meaning/NN of/IN Article/NNP 13/CD ,/, namely/RB the/DT fight/NN against/IN discrimination/NN based/VBN on/IN race/NN ,/, gender/NN ,/, age/NN ,/, and/CC special/JJ needs/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD particularly/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Stenzel/NNP ,/, because/IN her/PRP$ effort/NN to/TO reach/VB agreement/NN on/IN the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN has/VBZ proved/VBN exceptionally/RB difficult/JJ and/CC complex/JJ ,/, both/CC because/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT committees/NNS involved/VBN view/VBP the/DT issue/NN in/IN a/DT different/JJ light/NN and/CC because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB sensitive/JJ political/JJ issue/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ comment/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN by/IN many/JJ others/NNS too/RB ,/, is/VBZ whether/IN women/NNS should/MD be/VB mentioned/VBN separately/RB ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN Article/NNP 13/CD contains/VBZ something/NN we/PRP have/VBP expressed/VBN our/PRP$ disagreement/NN about/IN ,/, but/CC that/WDT is/VBZ how/WRB the/DT Treaty/NNP stands/VBZ right/RB now/RB and/CC among/IN the/DT categories/NNS of/IN types/NNS of/IN discrimination/NN ,/, discrimination/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN gender/NN holds/VBZ equal/JJ place/NN ./.

So/RB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP as/IN it/PRP stands/VBZ today/NN ,/, the/DT EQUAL/NNP initiative/NN is/VBZ structured/VBN in/IN that/DT way/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT special/JJ axis/NNS for/IN the/DT employment/NN strategy/NN which/WDT relates/VBZ to/TO women/NNS and/CC that/IN a/DT special/JJ programme/NN is/VBZ being/VBG prepared/VBN ,/, the/DT fifth/JJ programme/NN for/IN equality/NN between/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP classified/VBN the/DT issues/NNS raised/VBN by/IN the/DT honourable/JJ Members/NNS into/IN four/CD groups/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT thematic/JJ areas/NNS ./.

As/IN in/IN employment/NN strategy/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP four/CD thematic/JJ areas/NNS :/: employability/JJ ,/, entrepreneurship/JJ ,/, adaptability/JJ and/CC equal/JJ opportunities/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP agree/VBP that/IN those/DT thematic/JJ areas/NNS should/MD be/VB enlarged/VBN in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

To/TO answer/VB the/DT concern/NN whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT risk/NN that/IN a/DT country/NN might/MD concentrate/VB all/PDT the/DT funds/NNS on/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT categories/NNS suffering/NN discrimination/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT initiative/NN states/VBZ clearly/RB that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS must/MD submit/VB one/CD thematic/JJ category/NN for/IN each/DT group/NN that/WDT is/VBZ suffering/VBG discrimination/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ subject/NN is/VBZ flexibility/NN and/CC simplification/NN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN Mr/NNP Leinen/NNP that/IN the/DT wording/NN of/IN the/DT initiative/NN is/VBZ indeed/RB very/RB difficult/JJ and/CC hard/JJ to/TO understand/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT services/NNS are/VBP already/RB trying/VBG to/TO revise/VB the/DT text/NN ,/, simplify/VB its/PRP$ structure/NN and/CC make/VB its/PRP$ wording/NN easier/RBR to/TO grasp/VB ./.

This/DT would/MD allow/VB Member/NNP States/NNPS great/JJ flexibility/NN to/TO tailor/VB development/NN cooperation/NN to/TO their/PRP$ own/JJ particular/JJ needs/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT prerequisite/NN for/IN that/DT is/VBZ cooperation/NN between/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, and/CC a/DT network/NN which/WDT will/MD assist/VB the/DT exchange/NN of/IN experience/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB technical/JJ assistance/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO arrange/VB that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB four/CD categories/NNS for/IN which/WDT funding/NN is/VBZ available/JJ ./.

First/NNP ,/, funding/NN for/IN preparation/NN ;/: second/LS ,/, implementation/NN ;/: third/JJ ,/, mutual/JJ cooperation/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT exchange/NN of/IN experience/NN ,/, and/CC fourth/JJ ,/, technical/JJ assistance/NN ./.

Since/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN great/JJ involvement/NN and/CC concern/NN about/IN how/WRB technical/JJ assistance/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB provided/VBN ,/, we/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN external/JJ offices/NNS will/MD be/VB used/VBN ./.

As/IN Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP too/RB pointed/VBD out/RP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ for/IN all/PDT the/DT work/NN previously/RB done/VBN by/IN external/JJ collaborators/NNS to/TO be/VB done/VBN now/RB by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ staff/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

I/PRP shall/MD convey/VB your/PRP$ wish/NN that/IN the/DT rapporteurs/NNS should/MD be/VB quickly/RB appointed/VBN for/IN the/DT files/NNS you/PRP mentioned/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT Bureau/NNP and/CC to/TO the/DT appropriate/JJ committees/NNS ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN noon/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT sitting/NN was/VBD closed/VBN at/IN 8.40/CD p.m./RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Approval/NNP of/IN the/DT Minutes/NNPS of/IN the/DT two/CD previous/JJ sittings/NNS ./.

The/DT Minutes/NNPS of/IN the/DT sittings/NNS of/IN Thursday/NNP 3/NNP February/NNP and/CC Monday/NNP 14/CD February/NNP have/VBP been/VBN distributed/VBN ./.

The/DT Minutes/NNPS of/IN 3/CD February/NNP were/VBD originally/RB distributed/VBN in/IN Brussels/NNP so/IN perhaps/RB this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB some/DT Members/NNS did/VBD not/RB receive/VB them/PRP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ habit/NN is/VBZ always/RB to/TO be/VB here/RB for/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN the/DT part-session/NN on/IN Monday/NNP afternoons/NNS at/IN 5.00/CD p.m./RB Yesterday/NN it/PRP was/VBD impossible/JJ for/IN myself/PRP and/CC many/JJ MEPs/NNS to/TO be/VB here/RB ,/, because/IN the/DT 2.15/CD p.m./NNP Air/NNP France/NNP flight/NN ,/, which/WDT normally/RB brings/VBZ us/PRP here/RB ,/, was/VBD cancelled/VBN ,/, with/IN no/DT explanation/NN from/IN the/DT airline/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP therefore/RB arrived/VBD very/RB late/JJ ./.

If/IN Air/NNP France/NNP insists/VBZ on/IN boycotting/VBG the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD take/VB measures/NNS to/TO prevent/VB this/DT occurring/VBG again/RB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP amazed/VBN at/IN Mr/NNP Corbett/NNP '/POS s/JJ reaction/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- Parliament/NNP gave/VBD its/PRP$ assent/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Commission/NNP 's/VBZ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS and/CC legislative/JJ programme/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT joint/JJ debate/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP statements/NNS on/IN its/PRP$ strategic/JJ objectives/NNS for/IN the/DT coming/JJ five/CD years/NNS and/CC the/DT annual/JJ legislative/JJ programme/NN for/IN 2000/CD ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB immediately/RB give/VBP the/DT floor/NN to/TO the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, a/DT five-year/JJ programme/NN is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ undertaking/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP preferred/VBD that/IN you/PRP be/VB given/VBN the/DT unabridged/JJ text/NN of/IN the/DT speech/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ available/JJ in/IN four/CD languages/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP remember/VB that/IN for/IN half/PDT a/DT century/NN ,/, Europe/NNP has/VBZ provided/VBN us/PRP with/IN peace/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC freedom/NN and/CC a/DT united/VBN Europe/NNP has/VBZ also/RB contributed/VBN to/TO giving/VBG us/PRP a/DT period/NN of/IN unprecedented/JJ prosperity/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB seeing/VBG the/DT beginning/NN of/IN a/DT strong/JJ recovery/NN ,/, which/WDT it/PRP appears/VBZ may/MD even/RB be/VB sustainable/JJ for/IN a/DT good/JJ while/NN yet/RB if/IN we/PRP are/VBP prudent/JJ with/IN our/PRP$ policies/NNS ./.

The/DT crisis/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP was/VBD ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT crucial/JJ point/NN in/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN Europe/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ citizens/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT low/JJ turnout/NN at/IN the/DT European/JJ elections/NNS was/VBD a/DT worrying/JJ indication/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

Even/RB stronger/JJR still/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT sense/NN of/IN insecurity/NN ,/, the/DT feeling/NN of/IN being/VBG unprepared/JJ in/IN a/DT new/JJ world/NN that/WDT is/VBZ moving/VBG forwards/NNP ,/, a/DT world/NN which/WDT is/VBZ completely/RB changing/VBG ,/, where/WRB globalisation/NN will/MD even/RB end/VB up/RP changing/VBG our/PRP$ points/NNS of/IN reference/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN this/DT has/VBZ happened/VBN :/: Europe/NNP was/VBD once/RB confronted/VBN with/IN a/DT similar/JJ transformation/NN ,/, an/DT explosion/NN of/IN its/PRP$ markets/NNS ,/, a/DT change/NN in/IN its/PRP$ points/NNS of/IN reference/NN and/CC a/DT different/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO the/DT sixteenth/JJ century/NN when/WRB the/DT discovery/NN of/IN America/NNP turned/VBD everything/NN upside/RB down/RB ./.

Today/NN ,/, Europe/NNP is/VBZ facing/VBG a/DT similar/JJ challenge/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP know/VBP that/IN ,/, just/RB as/IN history/NN has/VBZ been/VBN unforgiving/JJ in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB forgiving/VBG in/IN the/DT present/NN ./.

But/CC more/JJR vital/NNS still/RB is/VBZ a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT feels/VBZ strong/JJ in/IN the/DT political/JJ arena/NN ./.

In/IN years/NNS past/NN ,/, the/DT single/JJ market/NN and/CC the/DT single/JJ currency/NN have/VBP been/VBN the/DT pivotal/JJ point/NN of/IN our/PRP$ actions/NNS ,/, the/DT mainstay/NN of/IN European/JJ life/NN ./.

Today/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ frontiers/NNS of/IN European/JJ integration/NN are/VBP political/JJ frontiers/NNS :/: common/JJ foreign/JJ and/CC security/NN policy/NN ,/, justice/NN and/CC internal/JJ security/NN ,/, and/CC -/: to/TO a/DT lesser/JJR extent/NN -/: the/DT crucial/JJ question/NN of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ political/JJ values/NNS on/IN which/WDT our/PRP$ coexistence/NN is/VBZ based/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ therefore/RB adopted/VBN the/DT strategic/JJ programme/NN for/IN 2000-2005/CD ,/, a/DT programme/NN that/WDT was/VBD immediately/RB sent/VBN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC with/IN which/WDT you/PRP are/VBP already/RB familiar/JJ ,/, so/IN I/PRP will/MD not/RB go/VB into/IN detail/NN about/IN it/PRP now/RB ./.

Some/DT of/IN you/PRP may/MD find/VB it/PRP lacks/VBZ detail/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT political/JJ structure/NN sets/VBZ out/RP detailed/JJ five-year/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, not/RB the/DT Soviet/NNP Union/NNP ./.

These/DT will/MD be/VB our/PRP$ major/JJ guidelines/NNS for/IN action/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT effective/JJ ,/, transparent/JJ way/NN to/TO proceed/VB and/CC involve/VB all/PDT the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/JJ enlargement/NN that/WDT is/VBZ urging/VBG us/PRP towards/IN this/DT rethink/NN :/: as/IN I/PRP said/VBD a/DT few/JJ moments/NNS ago/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ globalisation/NN itself/PRP ./.

We/PRP must/MD govern/VB Europe/NNP in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN as/RB to/TO make/VB us/PRP more/RBR efficient/JJ ,/, to/TO bring/VB us/PRP closer/RBR to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS and/CC to/TO encourage/VB everyone/NN to/TO get/VB involved/JJ ,/, starting/VBG with/IN the/DT important/JJ issue/NN of/IN the/DT involvement/NN of/IN women/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, elasticity/NN of/IN demand/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN a/DT price/NN elasticity/NN of/IN demand/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ exactly/RB what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB zero/CD ,/, therefore/RB it/PRP must/MD have/VB some/DT effect/NN ./.

My/PRP$ question/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN almost/RB exactly/RB the/DT one/NN raised/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Purvis/NNPS ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO press/VB the/DT point/NN further/RBR ./.

Granted/NNP ,/, as/IN you/PRP say/VBP ,/, that/IN excise/NN duties/NNS lie/VBP within/IN the/DT prerogative/NN of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, nevertheless/RB the/DT use/NN of/IN that/DT prerogative/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT is/VBZ unfairly/RB discriminatory/JJ against/IN producers/NNS in/IN one/CD part/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP versus/IN others/NNS might/MD still/RB conflict/VB with/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN principle/NN ./.

May/NNP I/PRP assure/VBD Mr/NNP MacCormick/NNP and/CC other/JJ Members/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP that/IN the/DT present/JJ situation/NN where/WRB excise/NN taxes/NNS differ/VBP between/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS is/VBZ indeed/RB something/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB conducive/JJ to/TO the/DT proper/JJ functioning/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP not/RB restrict/VB ourselves/PRP to/TO alcoholic/JJ products/NNS ./.

If/IN one/PRP looks/VBZ at/IN petrol/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, one/PRP sees/VBZ that/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS in/IN Germany/NNP are/VBP different/JJ from/IN those/DT of/IN Holland/NNP ,/, and/CC consequently/RB Dutch/JJ motorists/NNS cross/VBP the/DT border/NN and/CC fill/VB up/RP their/PRP$ tanks/NNS in/IN Germany/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB distortion/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

If/IN I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$ way/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD wave/VB a/DT magic/JJ wand/NN and/CC equalise/VB excise/NN taxes/NNS across/IN Europe/NNP ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, smuggling/NN would/MD no/RB longer/RB take/VB place/NN except/IN if/IN products/NNS were/VBD intrinsically/RB more/RBR expensive/JJ in/IN one/CD Member/NNP State/NNP than/IN another/DT ./.

But/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT magic/JJ wand/NN and/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB my/PRP$ way/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT area/NN of/IN unanimity/NN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP MacCormick/NNP knows/VBZ ,/, and/CC unless/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS agree/VBP on/IN the/DT equalisation/NN of/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS ,/, it/PRP will/MD not/RB happen/VB ./.

Once/IN again/RB ,/, towards/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD forward/VB a/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS on/IN excise/NN taxes/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP obviously/RB available/JJ for/IN any/DT discussion/NN with/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN that/DT report/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

Today/NN we/PRP will/MD take/VB note/NN of/IN what/WP you/PRP say/VBP and/CC have/VB a/DT glass/NN or/CC two/CD of/IN Alsace/NNP wine/NN ,/, although/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB how/WRB much/JJ tax/NN is/VBZ put/VBN on/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP suppose/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN ./.

Since/IN the/DT time/NN allotted/VBN to/TO Questions/NNS to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ elapsed/VBN ,/, Questions/CD 55/CD to/TO 114/CD will/MD be/VB replied/VBN to/TO in/IN writing/NN ./.

That/DT concludes/VBZ Questions/NNS to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT sitting/NN was/VBD suspended/VBN at/IN 7.30/CD p.m./RB and/CC resumed/VBN at/IN 9.00/CD p.m./RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT continuation/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT recommendation/NN for/IN second/JJ reading/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP action/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN water/NN policy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT situation/NN regarding/VBG fresh/JJ water/NN in/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ not/RB as/RB serious/JJ as/IN in/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN but/CC ,/, in/IN general/JJ terms/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN water/NN has/VBZ continued/VBN to/TO grow/VB and/CC its/PRP$ quality/NN has/VBZ continued/VBN to/TO decrease/VB ./.

To/TO this/DT we/PRP must/MD add/VB the/DT water/NN pollution/NN problems/NNS which/WDT afflict/VBP the/DT potential/JJ new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS in/IN the/DT East/NNP ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT reservoir/NN containing/VBG cyanide/NN has/VBZ just/RB burst/VBP its/PRP$ banks/NNS in/IN Romania/NNP ,/, threatening/VBG aquifers/NNS which/WDT supply/VBP the/DT population/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP that/IN Mrs/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ presence/NNS here/RB tonight/NN I/PRP appreciate/VBP ,/, is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO visit/VB the/DT area/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN no/DT country/NN ,/, no/DT government/NN and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, no/DT member/NN of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP can/MD fail/VB to/TO recognise/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN this/DT directive/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO end/VB the/DT current/JJ fragmentation/NN of/IN water/NN policy/NN and/CC facilitate/VB the/DT implementation/NN of/IN a/DT programme/NN of/IN specific/JJ measures/NNS for/IN each/DT river/NN basin/NN ./.

The/DT development/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN has/VBZ been/VBN difficult/JJ and/CC complex/JJ ,/, involving/VBG diverse/JJ interests/NNS and/CC divided/VBN opinions/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN this/DT legislature/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ,/, has/VBZ made/VBN great/JJ efforts/NNS and/CC shown/VBN great/JJ dedication/NN in/IN reconciling/VBG positions/NNS ,/, and/CC has/VBZ succeeded/VBN to/TO a/DT large/JJ extent/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ almost/RB impossible/JJ to/TO understand/VB and/CC correctly/RB assess/VB all/PDT the/DT different/JJ situations/NNS and/CC expectations/NNS ./.

I/PRP come/VBP from/IN a/DT country/NN whose/WP$ southern/JJ half/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP and/CC the/DT availability/NN of/IN water/NN historically/RB depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT whims/NNS of/IN an/DT unpredictable/JJ climate/NN and/CC a/DT difficult/JJ terrain/NN ./.

The/DT Mediterranean/NNP region/NN has/VBZ had/VBN to/TO fight/VB for/IN its/PRP$ development/NN by/IN trying/VBG to/TO overcome/VB this/DT adversity/NN ,/, century/NN after/IN century/NN ,/, year/NN after/IN year/NN ,/, day/NN after/IN day/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ still/RB doing/VBG so/RB today/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO us/PRP that/IN the/DT directive/NN complies/VBZ ,/, in/IN practice/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT obligation/NN laid/VBN down/RP in/IN article/NN 164/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN Community/NNP legislation/NN to/TO take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT diversity/NN of/IN its/PRP$ regions/NNS ./.

In/IN accordance/NN with/IN this/DT principle/NN ,/, the/DT Spanish/JJ delegation/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP will/MD oppose/VB Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 4/CD -LRB-/-LRB- Recital/NNP 21/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, 13/CD and/CC 49/CD -LRB-/-LRB- Article/NNP 11/CD -LRB-/-LRB- d/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, since/IN they/PRP imply/VBP a/DT serious/JJ limitation/NN in/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN management/NN exclusive/JJ to/TO the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT regulation/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB difficult/JJ for/IN the/DT Community/NNP to/TO determine/VB the/DT conditions/NNS for/IN the/DT regulation/NN of/IN water/NN in/IN the/DT different/JJ regions/NNS ,/, given/VBN the/DT different/JJ internal/JJ balances/NNS which/WDT are/VBP always/RB in/IN play/NN and/CC which/WDT require/VBP profound/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ areas/NNS and/CC the/DT relevant/JJ interests/NNS ./.

We/PRP also/RB reject/VBP the/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT aim/VBP to/TO incorporate/VB the/DT integral/JJ cost/NN of/IN water/NN for/IN 2010/CD ./.

We/PRP must/MD clearly/RB set/VB water/NN prices/NNS which/WDT promote/VB its/PRP$ efficient/JJ use/NN but/CC which/WDT ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, safeguard/VBD the/DT competitivity/NN of/IN the/DT producing/VBG industries/NNS in/IN the/DT less-favoured/JJ regions/NNS and/CC do/VBP not/RB hinder/VB their/PRP$ legitimate/JJ development/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD lastly/RB like/VB to/TO refer/VB to/TO the/DT amendments/NNS on/IN dangerous/JJ substances/NNS which/WDT establish/VB that/IN we/PRP must/MD achieve/VB a/DT zero/NN ,/, or/CC close/VB to/TO zero/CD ,/, degree/NN of/IN pollution/NN ./.

In/IN no/DT field/NN of/IN human/JJ activity/NN have/VBP we/PRP ever/RB discovered/VBN a/DT zero/CD degree/NN of/IN pollution/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB doing/VBG a/DT general/JJ disservice/NN to/TO the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN this/DT important/JJ directive/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO provide/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT necessary/JJ flexibility/NN and/CC adaptability/RB to/TO guarantee/VB compliance/NN with/IN its/PRP$ provisions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ directive/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO improve/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC the/DT reliability/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN supply/NN and/CC sewage/NN systems/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN the/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ an/DT ambitious/JJ one/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ not/RB too/RB ambitious/JJ if/IN we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN by/IN 2020/CD we/PRP will/MD no/RB longer/RB allow/VB impurities/NNS in/IN water/NN and/CC we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN zero/CD level/NN quantities/NNS of/IN impurities/NNS and/CC toxic/JJ matter/NN by/IN then/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT question/NN of/IN doing/VBG what/WP is/VBZ technically/RB possible/JJ ;/: obviously/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB possible/JJ to/TO do/VB anymore/RB ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD be/VB sufficiently/RB ambitious/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unrealistic/JJ to/TO go/VB on/IN causing/VBG the/DT quality/NN of/IN our/PRP$ water/NN to/TO deteriorate/VB and/CC so/RB ,/, too/RB ,/, the/DT conditions/NNS for/IN life/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ especially/RB unrealistic/JJ in/IN regard/NN to/TO agriculture/NN which/WDT is/VBZ most/RBS dependent/JJ upon/IN a/DT clean/JJ natural/JJ environment/NN and/CC unpolluted/JJ resources/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB appeal/VB to/TO Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO appreciate/VB that/IN tough/JJ demands/NNS for/IN a/DT clean/JJ environment/NN are/VBP a/DT sign/NN of/IN long-term/JJ realism/NN of/IN the/DT highest/JJS order/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP -/: myself/PRP included/VBD -/: support/VBP the/DT report/NN by/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ,/, the/DT targets/NNS it/PRP sets/VBZ and/CC the/DT directive/NN under/IN discussion/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD look/VB a/DT little/RB more/RBR closely/RB at/IN some/DT points/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT major/JJ problem/NN in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN is/VBZ the/DT diversion/NN of/IN rivers/NNS and/CC the/DT consumption/NN of/IN water/NN from/IN lakes/NNS ,/, which/WDT people/NNS try/VBP to/TO justify/VB by/IN pseudo-developmental/JJ arguments/NNS ,/, and/CC which/WDT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, are/VBP a/DT great/JJ risk/NN to/TO ground/NN waters/NNS ,/, water/NN tables/NNS and/CC surface/NN waters/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB think/VBP that/IN regardless/RB of/IN whether/IN we/PRP finally/RB conclude/VBP who/WP should/MD decide/VB whether/IN such/JJ diversions/NNS take/VBP place/NN ,/, the/DT specifications/RB common/JJ to/TO us/PRP all/DT must/MD be/VB very/RB stringent/JJ ./.

But/CC the/DT key/JJ issue/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, planning/VBG how/WRB to/TO restore/VB water/NN tables/NNS ,/, the/DT natural/JJ flow/NN of/IN rivers/NNS and/CC the/DT natural/JJ content/NN of/IN lakes/NNS ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP within/IN the/DT ten/CD year/NN period/NN we/PRP have/VBP in/IN mind/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP such/JJ projects/NNS ought/MD to/TO be/VB eligible/JJ for/IN funding/NN ,/, because/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, that/DT restoration/NN may/MD well/RB prove/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT first-rate/JJ development/NN policy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, here/RB we/PRP have/VBP what/WP is/VBZ basically/RB a/DT good/JJ measure/NN ./.

It/PRP sets/VBZ out/RP achievable/JJ standards/NNS based/VBN on/IN subsidiarity/JJ principles/NNS and/CC the/DT water/NN basin/NN management/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ aim/NN of/IN good-quality/JJ water/NN for/IN drinking/NN ,/, for/IN wildlife/NN ,/, the/DT environment/NN and/CC economic/JJ purposes/NNS is/VBZ right/JJ ./.

The/DT prevention/NN of/IN pollution/NN and/CC water/NN deterioration/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB right/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO manage/VB water/NN in/IN times/NNS of/IN drought/NN and/CC flood/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP three/CD outstanding/JJ problems/NNS ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT transfer/NN of/IN water/NN between/IN basin/NN areas/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN which/WDT affects/VBZ my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS from/IN Spain/NNP ,/, Ireland/NNP and/CC the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

Amendments/NNS Nos/CD 4/CD ./.

49/CD and/CC 87/CD would/MD not/RB be/VB acceptable/JJ because/IN they/PRP would/MD restrict/VB the/DT ability/NN of/IN a/DT country/NN to/TO move/VB water/NN from/IN where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN supply/NN to/TO where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, be/VB that/DT arid/JJ areas/NNS or/CC urban/JJ areas/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB realistic/JJ targets/NNS ,/, but/CC targets/VBZ nevertheless/RB ./.

Looking/VBG at/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 7/CD ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, which/WDT calls/VBZ for/IN the/DT complete/JJ elimination/NN of/IN naturally/RB occurring/VBG substances/NNS ,/, you/PRP can/MD see/VB that/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT targets/NNS set/NN are/VBP unrealistic/JJ ./.

Also/RB ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT targets/NNS which/WDT are/VBP set/VBN at/IN close/VB to/TO zero/CD -/: in/IN English/NNP ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT meaningless/JJ term/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO look/VB very/RB carefully/RB at/IN those/DT ./.

The/DT concept/NN of/IN continuing/VBG reduction/NN as/RB in/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 58/CD is/VBZ much/RB better/JJR ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, I/PRP raise/VBP the/DT problem/NN faced/VBN by/IN Scotch/NNP whisky/NNP ./.

Scotch/NNP whisky/NNP -/: especially/RB malt/JJ whisky/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS -/: requires/VBZ water/NN extraction/NN which/WDT is/VBZ used/VBN in/IN some/DT quantity/NN and/CC then/RB returned/VBN to/TO the/DT water/NN stream/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN it/PRP ends/VBZ up/RP in/IN the/DT bottle/NN and/CC is/VBZ drunk/JJ ./.

We/PRP must/MD make/VB sure/JJ that/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 49/CD and/CC 87/CD leave/VBP the/DT deletion/NN exemption/NN so/RB that/IN whisky/NN can/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB drunk/JJ in/IN ``/`` high/JJ quality/NN ''/'' ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ it/PRP must/MD use/VB good/JJ ,/, Scottish/JJ peat/NN water/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ third/JJ request/NN -/: that/IN we/PRP look/VBP carefully/RB at/IN these/DT measures/NNS before/IN passing/VBG this/DT measure/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

Turning/VBG to/TO the/DT report/NN ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN implementing/VBG the/DT principle/NN that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN water/NN services/NNS should/MD be/VB recoverable/JJ must/MD never/RB result/VB in/IN additional/JJ taxation/NN of/IN the/DT economically/RB weakest/JJ strata/NN ,/, or/CC even/RB in/IN the/DT annihilation/NN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-scale/JJ farmers/NNS because/RB of/IN the/DT prohibitive/JJ cost/NN of/IN water/NN for/IN irrigation/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT spirit/NN ,/, we/PRP support/VBP Amendment/NNP No/NNP 107/NNP by/IN Mr/NNP Marset/NNP Campos/NNP ./.

River/NNP waters/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB used/VBN more/RBR effectively/RB so/RB as/RB to/TO preserve/VB life/NN in/IN areas/NNS that/WDT suffer/VBP chronic/JJ drought/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ allegation/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP echoes/VBZ ,/, that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN for/IN many/JJ specific/JJ references/NNS and/CC explanations/NNS because/IN they/PRP are/VBP covered/VBN by/IN the/DT examples/NNS given/VBN in/IN the/DT directive/NN or/CC contained/VBN elsewhere/RB therein/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ chicanery/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ purpose/NN is/VBZ to/TO preserve/VB a/DT semi-transparent/JJ field/NN of/IN action/NN ,/, which/WDT during/IN the/DT directive/NN '/POS s/JJ first/JJ implementation/NN period/NN will/MD allow/VB critical/JJ choices/NNS to/TO be/VB finalised/VBN to/TO the/DT benefit/NN of/IN big/JJ business/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/RB and/CC foremost/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN protection/NN of/IN the/DT aquatic/JJ environment/NN ,/, both/DT surface/NN water/NN and/CC groundwater/NN ,/, is/VBZ probably/RB one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ duties/NNS of/IN all/DT ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB only/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ about/IN guaranteeing/VBG sufficient/JJ water/NN resources/NNS but/CC also/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, to/TO a/DT large/JJ degree/NN ,/, about/IN safeguarding/VBG water/NN resources/NNS against/IN pollution/NN so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD also/RB have/VB clean/JJ drinking/NN water/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB entitled/VBN to/TO clean/VB drinking/NN water/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ great/JJ appreciation/NN of/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT huge/JJ task/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ support/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

These/DT are/VBP all/DT improvements/NNS to/TO the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP shall/MD only/RB highlight/VB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ ones/NNS ./.

First/RB and/CC foremost/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD establish/VB some/DT clear/JJ objectives/NNS concerning/VBG the/DT condition/NN we/PRP should/MD have/VB achieved/VBN for/IN our/PRP$ water/NN within/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN no/DT more/JJR than/IN 10/CD years/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD put/VB pressure/NN on/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO devise/VB the/DT necessary/JJ action/NN programmes/NNS more/RBR quickly/RB than/IN is/VBZ proposed/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT 2010/CD deadline/NN is/VBZ appropriate/JJ ./.

If/IN this/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB adopted/VBN as/IN the/DT objective/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP am/VBP naturally/RB prepared/VBN to/TO support/VB the/DT proposal/NN to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD have/VB achieved/VBN levels/NNS very/RB close/JJ to/TO zero/VB by/IN the/DT year/NN 2020/CD ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ basis/NN for/IN further/JJ negotiations/NNS with/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN some/DT excellent/JJ work/NN in/IN drafting/VBG this/DT important/JJ directive/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ reading/NN of/IN the/DT framework/NN directive/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ most/RBS timely/JJ ;/: the/DT shocking/JJ news/NN of/IN the/DT environmental/JJ catastrophe/NN in/IN Romania/NNP must/MD feature/VB in/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ discussions/NNS and/CC also/RB more/RBR generally/RB when/WRB we/PRP ponder/VBP the/DT environmental/JJ dimension/NN of/IN Union/NNP enlargement/NN ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT we/PRP have/VBP to/TO find/VB and/CC call/VB to/TO account/VB those/DT who/WP are/VBP guilty/JJ of/IN the/DT act/NN ./.

The/DT cyanide/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ metals/NNS in/IN the/DT rivers/NNS are/VBP gruesome/JJ examples/NNS of/IN how/WRB environmental/JJ negligence/NN may/MD ruin/VB the/DT waterways/NNS for/IN decades/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

The/DT event/NN proves/VBZ that/IN in/IN some/DT countries/NNS applying/VBG for/IN EU/NNP membership/NN the/DT environmental/JJ norms/NNS and/CC environmental/JJ thinking/NN are/VBP still/RB light/JJ years/NNS behind/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

The/DT Union/NNP ought/MD to/TO reassess/VB how/WRB aid/NN for/IN environmental/JJ projects/NNS can/MD be/VB allocated/VBN in/IN a/DT better/JJR way/NN in/IN support/NN of/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ policy/NN on/IN water/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT proposal/NN for/IN the/DT directive/NN it/PRP is/VBZ worrying/VBG that/IN the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/VBD by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NNP ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP do/VBP not/RB take/VB sufficient/JJ account/NN of/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN unpolluted/JJ surface/NN waters/NNS to/TO increase/VB the/DT occurrence/NN of/IN clean/JJ ,/, natural/JJ groundwater/NN ./.

In/IN Finland/NNP surface/NN waters/NNS are/VBP very/RB clean/JJ ./.

The/DT production/NN of/IN so-called/JJ artificial/JJ groundwater/NN is/VBZ an/DT ecological/JJ means/NN of/IN filtering/VBG a/DT clean/JJ supply/NN of/IN fresh/JJ surface/NN water/NN through/IN to/TO the/DT groundwater/NN reserves/NNS ./.

The/DT process/NN does/VBZ not/RB require/VB a/DT chemical/JJ sewage/NN plant/NN ./.

The/DT directive/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO endanger/VB this/DT work/NN ./.

Deviating/VBG from/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ position/NN ,/, the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP is/VBZ also/RB attempting/VBG to/TO restrict/VB further/RBR the/DT facilities/NNS for/IN the/DT transfer/NN of/IN water/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD cause/VB problems/NNS for/IN those/DT countries/NNS where/WRB reserves/NNS of/IN water/NN are/VBP unevenly/RB distributed/VBN ./.

The/DT ecologically/RB sustainable/JJ transfer/NN of/IN water/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB restricted/VBN by/IN Union/NNP acts/NNS ./.

The/DT work/NN should/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB regulated/JJ and/CC subject/JJ to/TO license/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN too/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT same/JJ rules/NNS can/MD not/RB apply/VB to/TO ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Finland/NNP and/CC Greece/NNP ,/, which/WDT suffers/VBZ from/IN drought/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, water/NN is/VBZ a/DT precious/JJ natural/JJ asset/NN ,/, a/DT vital/JJ necessity/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ duty/NN to/TO protect/VB it/PRP ./.

I/PRP must/MD say/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN ,/, there/EX are/VBP discrepancies/NNS between/IN the/DT countries/NNS in/IN the/DT north/NN and/CC south/JJ concerning/VBG water/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT matter/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP parts/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP with/IN an/DT inherent/JJ shortage/NN of/IN water/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT should/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN by/IN this/DT directive/NN ./.

In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, climate/NN change/NN has/VBZ compelled/VBN Mediterranean/NNP countries/NNS to/TO face/VB serious/JJ problems/NNS of/IN flooding/NN or/CC lack/NN of/IN rain/NN ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN but/CC we/PRP also/RB accept/VBP several/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/NN ,/, whose/WP$ aim/NNS is/VBZ to/TO improve/VB it/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB amendments/NNS such/JJ as/IN those/DT that/WDT refer/VBP to/TO the/DT issue/NN of/IN costing/VBG water/NN ,/, granted/VBN that/IN in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN a/DT high/JJ proportion/NN of/IN the/DT users/NNS are/VBP farmers/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, amendments/NNS which/WDT ban/VBP the/DT transfer/NN of/IN water/NN from/IN one/CD hydrological/JJ basin/NN to/TO another/DT would/MD condemn/VB many/JJ areas/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN to/TO water/NN shortage/NN ./.

The/DT issue/NN of/IN eliminating/VBG hazardous/JJ substances/NNS ought/MD ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, to/TO be/VB made/VBN more/RBR realistic/JJ so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD achieve/VB it/PRP ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT time/NN scale/NN demanded/VBN for/IN the/DT directive/NN '/POS s/JJ implementation/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB borne/VBN in/IN mind/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP countries/NNS where/WRB creating/VBG the/DT infrastructure/NN for/IN this/DT directive/NN '/POS s/JJ implementation/NN will/MD take/VB time/NN and/CC considerable/JJ resources/NNS ./.

In/IN spite/NN of/IN these/DT remarks/NNS however/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP our/PRP$ common/JJ objective/NN of/IN sustainable/JJ use/NN of/IN water/NN resources/NNS can/MD be/VB maintained/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT measures/NNS contained/VBN in/IN this/DT directive/NN range/NN from/IN drafting/VBG water/NN management/NN plans/NNS ,/, comprehensive/JJ information/NN and/CC hearing/NN rights/NNS ,/, and/CC close/JJ cooperation/NN between/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, to/TO combating/VBG water/NN pollution/NN caused/VBN by/IN individual/JJ pollutants/NNS ./.

And/CC considering/VBG how/WRB long/RB this/DT Chamber/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN trying/VBG to/TO introduce/VB a/DT framework/NN directive/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ to/TO be/VB present/JJ here/RB today/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN being/VBG in/IN the/DT happy/JJ position/NN of/IN presenting/VBG this/DT report/NN to/TO us/PRP ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB extremely/RB important/JJ to/TO me/PRP to/TO point/VB something/NN out/RP that/IN many/JJ people/NNS actually/RB take/VB for/IN granted/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD still/RB like/VB to/TO highlight/VB this/DT point/NN though/RB :/: this/DT directive/NN does/VBZ not/RB constitute/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN legal/JJ basis/NN for/IN diverting/VBG water/NN from/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP '/POS s/JJ territory/NN against/IN its/PRP$ will/NN ./.

And/CC by/IN way/NN of/IN reaffirming/VBG this/DT once/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP introduced/VBN an/DT amendment/NN -/: gratifyingly/JJ with/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN Members/NNS -/: and/CC I/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB pleased/JJ if/IN Parliament/NNP would/MD endorse/VB my/PRP$ proposed/VBN amendment/NN tomorrow/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP aware/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN highlighted/VBD this/DT ,/, that/IN there/EX are/VBP States/NNPS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP that/WDT have/VBP problems/NNS with/IN water/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN every/DT one/NN of/IN us/PRP ,/, in/IN every/DT country/NN ,/, could/MD improve/VB the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP manage/VBP our/PRP$ water/NN and/CC could/MD make/VB use/NN of/IN it/PRP in/IN a/DT cleaner/JJR way/NN ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ to/TO every/DT country/NN ./.

But/CC only/RB when/WRB each/DT country/NN has/VBZ done/VBN its/PRP$ utmost/NN to/TO conserve/VB its/PRP$ water/NN resources/NNS ,/, when/WRB literally/RB everything/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN that/IN could/MD have/VB been/VBN done/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ countries/NNS ,/, only/RB then/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, should/MD it/PRP be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO start/VB thinking/VBG in/IN terms/NNS of/IN harmonising/VBG water/NN usage/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB pleased/JJ that/IN this/DT directive/NN has/VBZ already/RB reached/VBN second/JJ reading/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB over-pleased/JJ because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ not/RB of/IN great/JJ quality/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO implement/VB and/CC has/VBZ many/JJ shortcomings/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ excessively/RB tough/JJ ,/, simplistic/JJ and/CC reductionist/JJ ./.

In/IN many/JJ cases/NNS other/JJ existing/VBG directives/NNS on/IN water/NN have/VBP not/RB been/VBN complied/VBN with/IN and/CC governments/NNS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP have/VBP often/RB not/RB imposed/VBN discipline/NN as/IN they/PRP should/MD have/VB done/VBN ,/, although/IN I/PRP know/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB pleasant/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT reductionist/JJ directive/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB lump/VB countries/NNS with/IN navigable/JJ rivers/NNS together/RB with/IN countries/NNS which/WDT lack/VBP water/NN ,/, where/WRB great/JJ cracks/NNS open/VB up/RP in/IN the/DT ground/NN through/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC which/WDT see/VBP temperatures/NNS of/IN 55脗潞C/NNS or/CC 60脗潞C/NNS in/IN the/DT sun/NN ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO be/VB informed/VBN of/IN why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB choose/VB to/TO apply/VB the/DT invalidity/JJ penalty/NN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN evident/JJ infringements/NNS of/IN the/DT competition/NN rules/NNS ./.

Fifthly/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT pending/VBG enlargement/NN ,/, I/PRP wonder/VBP whether/IN the/DT candidate/NN counties/NNS will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO play/VB our/PRP$ game/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP still/RB in/IN training/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ./.

What/WDT guarantees/NN do/VBP we/PRP have/VB that/IN they/PRP will/MD grow/VB into/IN first-class/JJ players/NNS in/IN the/DT league/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ?/.

Sixthly/JJ and/CC lastly/JJ ,/, I/PRP would/MD remind/VB you/PRP of/IN a/DT point/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB raised/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ report/NN on/IN vertical/JJ restrictions/NNS ,/, namely/RB the/DT legal/JJ privilege/NN of/IN company/NN lawyers/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT Commission/NNP implements/VBZ the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP objectives/NNS ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN discrimination/NN within/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC between/IN external/JJ and/CC internal/JJ legal/JJ advisers/NNS will/MD become/VB more/RBR pronounced/JJ and/CC hence/RB even/RB less/RBR acceptable/JJ ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP considering/VBG taking/VBG any/DT action/NN to/TO allow/VB in-house/JJ lawyers/NNS in/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNP legal/JJ privilege/NN ?/.

Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP asking/VBG these/DT questions/NNS as/IN a/DT defender/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP all/DT partners/NNS and/CC that/IN the/DT discussion/NN between/IN these/DT partners/NNS does/VBZ not/RB remain/VB sterile/JJ but/CC can/MD bear/VB fruit/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB ,/, in/IN beginning/VBG my/PRP$ speech/NN regarding/VBG the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ,/, to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Party/NNP of/IN European/JJ Socialists/NNS is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ in/IN agreement/NN with/IN your/PRP$ report/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB demonstrated/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN only/RB one/CD amendment/NN has/VBZ been/VBN presented/VBN during/IN this/DT procedure/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT broad/JJ outlines/NN of/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

Since/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP entered/VBD into/IN force/NN ,/, Community/NNP law/NN on/IN competition/NN has/VBZ been/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT tenets/NNS of/IN Community/NNP policy/NN ./.

After/IN almost/RB forty/JJ years/NNS of/IN being/VBG in/IN force/NN ,/, these/DT rules/NNS were/VBD beginning/VBG to/TO show/VB signs/NNS of/IN exhaustion/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, modernisation/NN was/VBD essential/JJ ./.

That/DT modernisation/NN came/VBD to/TO be/VB particularly/RB necessary/JJ for/IN five/CD reasons/NNS ./.

Firstly/NNP ,/, the/DT authorisation/NN system/NN ;/: secondly/JJ ,/, decentralised/JJ application/NN ;/: thirdly/JJ ,/, procedural/JJ rules/NNS ;/: fourthly/JJ ,/, judicial/JJ application/NN ;/: and/CC fifthly/RB and/CC finally/RB ,/, excessive/JJ red/NN tape/NN ./.

The/DT system/NN of/IN individual/JJ approvals/NNS needed/VBD urgent/JJ reform/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD unanimously/RB requested/VBN by/IN specialised/JJ companies/NNS ,/, academics/NNS and/CC lawyers/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP not/RB attended/VBN a/DT single/JJ forum/NN of/IN specialists/NNS in/IN competition/NN law/NN which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB requested/VBN a/DT change/NN to/TO the/DT system/NN ./.

A/DT system/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT current/JJ one/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN making/VBG so/RB few/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, be/VB they/PRP approvals/NNS or/CC prohibitions/NNS ,/, is/VBZ something/NN less/JJR than/IN a/DT valid/JJ system/NN ./.

National/NNP competition/NN authorities/NNS were/VBD able/JJ to/TO apply/VB Articles/CD 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC 82/CD for/IN some/DT time/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, they/PRP could/MD not/RB apply/VB Article/NNP 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 3/LS -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT ,/, to/TO a/DT certain/JJ extent/NN ,/, prevented/VBD the/DT coherent/JJ application/NN of/IN Article/NNP 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

You/PRP will/MD know/VB that/IN there/EX are/VBP currently/RB two/CD preliminary/JJ issues/NNS before/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, both/DT brought/VBD by/IN German/JJ courts/NNS ,/, which/WDT question/VBP the/DT feasibility/NN of/IN applying/VBG 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- without/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO apply/VB 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 3/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

A/DT reform/NN of/IN this/DT point/NN was/VBD therefore/RB also/RB necessary/JJ ./.

The/DT procedure/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN competition/NN is/VBZ basically/RB contained/VBN in/IN Regulation/NNP 1762/CD ./.

The/DT voices/NNS in/IN favour/NN of/IN its/PRP$ amendment/NN were/VBD unanimous/JJ ./.

The/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP did/VBD not/RB establish/VB a/DT genuine/JJ procedure/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP did/VBD not/RB establish/VB time/NN limits/NNS ,/, that/IN it/PRP did/VBD not/RB regulate/VB access/NN for/IN interested/JJ parties/NNS to/TO the/DT files/NNS ,/, or/CC that/IN the/DT right/NN to/TO defence/NN was/VBD not/RB properly/RB recognised/VBN ,/, were/VBD factors/NNS which/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT unanimous/JJ demand/NN for/IN reform/NN ./.

The/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP accepted/VBD some/DT time/NN ago/RB that/IN Community/NNP competition/NN law/NN could/MD be/VB applied/VBN by/IN the/DT legal/JJ bodies/NNS of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC in/IN 1994/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP published/VBD a/DT communication/NN on/IN this/DT subject/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO facilitate/VB this/DT approach/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS frequent/JJ criticisms/NNS of/IN Community/NNP competition/NN law/NN is/VBZ its/PRP$ excessive/JJ red/JJ tape/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN the/DT continental/JJ legal/JJ tradition/NN ,/, consideration/NN of/IN whether/IN certain/JJ agreements/NNS are/VBP anti-competitive/JJ or/CC not/RB depends/VBZ more/RBR on/IN an/DT analysis/NN of/IN their/PRP$ clauses/NNS than/IN on/IN their/PRP$ effects/NNS on/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO introduce/VB an/DT economic/JJ analysis/NN ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO resolve/VB these/DT problems/NNS and/CC we/PRP therefore/RB support/VB these/DT proposals/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB true/JJ that/IN we/PRP note/VBP certain/JJ deficiencies/NNS which/WDT have/VBP come/VBN to/TO light/VB in/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

Amongst/VB these/DT ,/, firstly/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/WDT ,/, despite/IN trying/VBG to/TO modernise/VB Articles/NNP 81/CD and/CC 82/CD ,/, Article/NNP 81/CD and/CC not/RB Article/NNP 82/NNP carries/VBZ exclusive/JJ weight/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, with/IN inter-company/JJ agreements/NNS and/CC the/DT privatisation/NN of/IN monopolies/NNS preserving/VBG dominant/JJ positions/NNS and/CC even/RB consolidating/VBG them/PRP ,/, the/DT combating/NN of/IN abusive/JJ conduct/NN is/VBZ becoming/VBG particularly/RB important/JJ ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, Regulation/NNP 1762/NNP must/MD be/VB repealed/VBN and/CC replaced/VBN with/IN a/DT new/JJ regulation/NN ./.

For/IN these/DT reasons/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, if/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS are/VBP accepted/VBN ,/, particularly/RB those/DT presented/VBD by/IN the/DT PPE-DE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, we/PRP would/MD consider/VB the/DT report/NN to/TO be/VB stripped/VBN of/IN its/PRP$ value/NN and/CC to/TO have/VB become/VBN an/DT inconsistent/JJ document/NN ,/, lacking/VBG in/IN rigour/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN that/WDT event/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD reconsider/VB our/PRP$ support/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, amongst/VBG the/DT various/JJ issues/NNS being/VBG dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN this/DT joint/JJ debate/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO comment/VB on/IN the/DT one/NN mentioned/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Berenguer/NNP ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, the/DT modernisation/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP White/NNP Paper/NNP ./.

Frankly/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT modernisation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN satisfactory/JJ ./.

If/IN it/PRP functions/VBD well/RB ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP satisfied/JJ ,/, if/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ basically/RB acted/VBN correctly/RB ,/, why/WRB the/DT need/VB for/IN the/DT modification/NN ?/.

Various/JJ arguments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ favour/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Berenguer/NNP made/VBD a/DT very/RB accurate/JJ analysis/NN ,/, justifying/VBG the/DT need/NN and/CC the/DT relevant/JJ reforms/NNS for/IN improving/VBG the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN competition/NN ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ concern/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT standards/NNS and/CC criteria/NNS which/WDT will/MD be/VB applied/VBN through/IN the/DT corresponding/JJ administrations/NNS in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, are/VBP truly/RB identical/JJ in/IN all/DT regions/NNS ./.

Because/IN ,/, if/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB faced/VBN with/IN the/DT paradox/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP will/MD introduce/VB elements/NNS of/IN unfair/JJ competition/NN into/IN the/DT functioning/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ internal/JJ market/NN ./.

In/IN that/DT event/NN we/PRP would/MD not/RB have/VB moved/VBN forward/RP ,/, but/CC rather/RB backwards/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB firstly/RB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ appreciation/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT improvement/NN represented/VBD by/IN the/DT XXVIIIth/NNP report/NN on/IN competition/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, when/WRB compared/VBN to/TO previous/JJ reports/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO highlight/VB the/DT work/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP ,/, who/WP has/VBZ dissected/VBN this/DT dense/JJ and/CC comprehensive/JJ text/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT concise/JJ way/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO fully/RB support/VB his/PRP$ comments/NNS on/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO allow/VB the/DT regions/NNS -/: such/JJ as/IN the/DT Basque/JJ Country/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP represent/VBP -/: a/DT margin/NN for/IN action/NN ,/, by/IN virtue/NN of/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

The/DT only/JJ guarantee/NN has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO seek/VB prior/JJ favourable/NN approval/NN ,/, through/IN individual/JJ cases/NNS ,/, which/WDT will/MD take/VB more/JJR than/IN six/CD or/CC eight/CD months/NNS to/TO resolve/VB ,/, an/DT excessively/RB long/JJ period/NN ,/, which/WDT simply/RB leads/VBZ to/TO problems/NNS of/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN flexibility/NN ,/, affecting/VBG the/DT generation/NN of/IN wealth/NN and/CC employment/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB believe/VBP that/IN something/NN is/VBZ missing/VBG and/CC I/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN we/PRP establish/VB more/JJR regulations/NNS ,/, lay/VBD down/RP clear/JJ rules/NNS ,/, which/WDT will/MD benefit/VB all/DT of/IN us/PRP :/: businesspeople/NN ,/, investors/NNS ,/, workers/NNS and/CC the/DT citizens/NNS in/IN general/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB that/WDT ,/, in/IN an/DT age/NN of/IN significant/JJ technological/JJ changes/NNS -/: just/RB look/VBP at/IN what/WP is/VBZ happening/VBG in/IN the/DT information/NN technology/NN sector/NN and/CC other/JJ sectors/NNS such/JJ as/IN energy/NN and/CC transport/NN -/: safeguarding/VBG competition/NN will/MD be/VB of/IN fundamental/JJ importance/NN for/IN our/PRP$ future/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN economic/JJ growth/NN ,/, and/CC therefore/RB of/IN increasing/VBG employment/NN and/CC wealth/NN ,/, safeguarding/VBG a/DT competition/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS is/VBZ becoming/VBG a/DT crucial/JJ factor/NN ,/, and/CC one/CD that/WDT is/VBZ certainly/RB very/RB important/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ future/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP give/VBP this/DT report/NN my/PRP$ full/JJ support/NN ./.

Recently/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP noticed/VBN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN working/VBG hard/RB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN this/DT principal/NN is/VBZ respected/JJ in/IN a/DT proper/JJ and/CC effective/JJ manner/NN ,/, precisely/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO safeguard/VB market/NN flexibility/NN ,/, both/DT for/IN products/NNS and/CC for/IN services/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD emphasise/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB extremely/RB important/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ future/NN ,/, for/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ economy/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, for/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN our/PRP$ wealth/NN and/CC technological/JJ development/NN in/IN Europe/NNP in/IN general/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, for/IN British/JJ Conservatives/NNS the/DT efficient/JJ and/CC uniform/JJ application/NN of/IN European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT core/NN of/IN achieving/VBG an/DT effective/JJ single/JJ market/NN across/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP therefore/RB follows/VBZ that/IN any/DT proposal/NN which/WDT suggests/VBZ major/JJ reform/NN of/IN the/DT machinery/NN for/IN competition/NN policy/NN enforcement/NN must/MD be/VB closely/RB and/CC carefully/RB examined/VBN ./.

The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB complete/JJ ./.

During/IN my/PRP$ six/CD months/NNS as/IN a/DT Member/NNP of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP become/VBN acutely/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT determination/NN of/IN many/JJ Members/NNS to/TO drive/VB forward/RP what/WP is/VBZ described/VBN as/IN the/DT European/JJ project/NN ./.

We/PRP daily/RB hear/VBP the/DT need/NN to/TO promote/VB a/DT wider/JJR and/CC deeper/JJR Europe/NNP ./.

But/CC all/PDT this/DT ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, is/VBZ so/RB much/RB rhetoric/NN when/WRB we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT national/JJ ,/, regional/JJ and/CC local/JJ obstacles/NNS which/WDT continue/VBP to/TO block/VB the/DT operation/NN of/IN a/DT true/JJ European/JJ single/JJ market/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT context/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP want/VBP to/TO consider/VB the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS proposals/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT greatest/JJS confidence/NN in/IN and/CC respect/VB for/IN Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP ./.

We/PRP look/VBP to/TO him/PRP as/IN the/DT man/NN to/TO root/VB out/RP cartels/NNS ./.

But/CC he/PRP would/MD recognise/VB that/IN ,/, as/IN for/IN everybody/NN else/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO consider/VB his/PRP$ particular/JJ proposals/NNS and/CC subject/VB them/PRP to/TO rigorous/JJ examination/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN on/IN the/DT Committee/NNP for/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP ./.

I/PRP want/VBP to/TO congratulate/VB him/PRP ,/, sadly/RB in/IN his/PRP$ absence/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT thorough/JJ and/CC rigorous/JJ way/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PRP has/VBZ undertaken/VBN the/DT preparation/NN of/IN his/PRP$ report/NN -/: and/CC also/RB for/IN putting/VBG up/RP with/IN my/PRP$ being/VBG such/PDT a/DT thorn/NN in/IN his/PRP$ side/NN !/. ./.

He/PRP mentioned/VBD earlier/RBR that/IN the/DT report/NN was/VBD carried/VBN with/IN a/DT significant/JJ majority/NN but/CC not/RB with/IN my/PRP$ support/NN ./.

So/IN although/IN I/PRP may/MD not/RB share/VB his/PRP$ conclusions/NNS ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP he/PRP has/VBZ illustrated/VBN in/IN his/PRP$ report/NN many/JJ of/IN the/DT issues/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD address/VB ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT potential/NN for/IN renationalisation/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ set/VBN against/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC the/DT potential/NN exists/VBZ ./.

I/PRP remain/VBP worried/JJ about/IN the/DT capacity/NN of/IN national/JJ courts/NNS and/CC the/DT capacity/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ competition/NN authorities/NNS ./.

I/PRP remain/VBP worried/JJ about/IN the/DT whole/JJ operation/NN of/IN the/DT judicial/JJ process/NN ./.

I/PRP asked/VBD Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP the/DT other/JJ day/NN what/WP happens/VBZ if/IN he/PRP proves/VBZ to/TO be/VB wrong/JJ and/CC there/EX is/VBZ an/DT effective/JJ renationalisation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP said/VBD we/PRP can/MD look/VB to/TO the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP ./.

Well/UH ,/, we/PRP in/IN Britain/NNP are/VBP looking/VBG to/TO the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.

We/PRP find/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP is/VBZ not/RB able/JJ to/TO provide/VB us/PRP with/IN interim/JJ measures/NNS in/IN a/DT certain/JJ dispute/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP with/IN France/NNP at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP the/DT support/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Unless/IN anybody/NN thinks/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ merely/RB a/DT nationalistic/JJ point/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT Factortame/JJ case/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT British/JJ Government/NN was/VBD the/DT defendant/NN ,/, it/PRP took/VBD ten/CD years/NNS for/IN the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP to/TO give/VB a/DT ruling/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, judicially/RB ,/, something/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP what/WP can/MD be/VB done/VBN to/TO speed/VB up/RP implementation/NN in/IN this/DT particular/JJ area/NN ./.

In/IN relation/NN to/TO legal/JJ certainty/NN ,/, I/PRP endorse/VBP the/DT point/NN made/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Thyssen/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN business/NN has/VBZ legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

I/PRP mentioned/VBD this/DT again/RB to/TO Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP recently/RB ./.

He/PRP said/VBD we/PRP must/MD not/RB always/RB be/VB carried/VBN along/RP by/IN lawyers/NNS ./.

I/PRP must/MD declare/VB an/DT interest/NN as/IN a/DT lawyer/NN but/CC also/RB as/IN a/DT former/JJ competition/NN minister/NN in/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ./.

We/PRP all/DT have/VBP ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, our/PRP$ histories/NNS to/TO live/VB with/IN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN business/NN has/VBZ legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB ask/VB the/DT Commission/NNP whether/IN an/DT analysis/NN has/VBZ been/VBN undertaken/VBN of/IN the/DT implications/NNS of/IN this/DT change/NN for/IN business/NN :/: a/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT sort/NN that/WDT is/VBZ now/RB becoming/VBG so/RB much/RB more/RBR European/JJ policy/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT implications/NNS for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP of/IN the/DT change/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP been/VBN told/VBN how/WRB ,/, currently/RB ,/, people/NNS 's/POS time/NN is/VBZ being/VBG wasted/VBN and/CC that/IN the/DT changes/NNS ,/, therefore/RB ,/, could/MD be/VB beneficial/JJ ./.

But/CC I/PRP really/RB feel/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT circumstances/NNS ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO know/VB what/WP the/DT implications/NNS would/MD be/VB for/IN business/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP ,/, as/IN British/JJ Conservatives/NNS ,/, are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT change/NN in/IN direction/NN ,/, towards/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN an/DT independent/JJ competition/NN authority/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO hear/VB what/WP Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP has/VBZ to/TO say/VB about/IN that/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ competition/NN policy/NN has/VBZ been/VBN of/IN central/JJ importance/NN since/IN European/JJ integration/NN began/VBD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB with/IN some/DT justification/NN that/IN competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ policies/NNS ./.

We/PRP can/MD be/VB proud/JJ of/IN a/DT European/JJ competition/NN culture/NN ,/, for/IN it/PRP is/VBZ this/DT that/WDT will/MD make/VB the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN a/DT reality/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD be/VB proud/JJ of/IN monopolies/NNS and/CC mergers/NNS supervision/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB vigilant/JJ in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN global/JJ operators/NNS ,/, against/IN whom/WP nation-states/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR able/JJ to/TO impose/VB limits/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP should/MD bear/VB in/IN mind/NN what/WP was/VBD said/VBN by/IN the/DT French/JJ writer/NN Vivienne/NNP Forestier/NNP ,/, who/WP described/VBD the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN '/POS s/JJ reign/NN of/IN terror/NN ./.

Society/NNP is/VBZ surrendering/VBG itself/PRP to/TO the/DT economy/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB what/WP we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP very/RB often/RB forget/VB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB just/RB important/JJ for/IN fair/JJ competition/NN as/IN such/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB for/IN prices/NNS ,/, growth/NN and/CC employment/NN ,/, and/CC hence/RB for/IN the/DT public/NN ./.

In/IN common/JJ with/IN the/DT other/JJ Members/NNS ,/, I/PRP call/VBP for/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO have/VB codecision/NN rights/NNS where/WRB competition/NN law/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN this/DT long/JJ overdue/JJ step/NN be/VB taken/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ to/TO underline/VB the/DT connection/NN between/IN competition/NN policy/NN and/CC consumer/NN protection/NN ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO make/VB progress/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN in/IN the/DT dialogue/NN with/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN he/PRP does/VBZ in/IN the/DT dialogue/NN with/IN non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ,/, consumer/NN protection/NN associations/NNS and/CC the/DT public/NN ./.

Greater/NNP transparency/RB will/MD also/RB help/VB to/TO achieve/VB public/JJ acceptance/NN of/IN decisions/NNS relating/VBG to/TO competition/NN policy/NN ./.

Then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO understand/VB that/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, lower/JJR electricity/NN and/CC telecommunications/NN prices/NNS are/VBP due/JJ to/TO European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN ,/, and/CC Brussels/NNP should/MD not/RB be/VB pilloried/VBN when/WRB aid/NN decisions/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN which/WDT are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, bound/VBN to/TO cause/VB problems/NNS at/IN a/DT particular/JJ moment/NN in/IN time/NN or/CC in/IN a/DT local/JJ context/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ for/IN there/EX to/TO be/VB clarity/JJ in/IN relation/NN to/TO competition/NN rules/NNS in/IN view/NN of/IN EU/NNP enlargement/NN ./.

Emphasis/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB placed/VBN on/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT state/NN aid/NN policy/NN -/: and/CC the/DT Jonckheer/NNP report/NN makes/VBZ this/DT very/RB clear/JJ -/: must/MD continue/VB to/TO afford/VB each/DT state/NN the/DT freedom/NN to/TO define/VB and/CC organise/VB the/DT tasks/NNS of/IN the/DT public/JJ sector/NN and/CC ownership/NN structures/NNS on/IN an/DT independent/JJ basis/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB made/VBN clear/JJ that/IN aid/NN can/MD serve/VB a/DT useful/JJ purpose/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO offsetting/VBG the/DT deficiencies/NNS of/IN the/DT market/NN and/CC furthering/VBG Community/NNP objectives/NNS ./.

A/DT word/NN on/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP :/: the/DT revision/NN of/IN Articles/NNP 81/CD and/CC 82/CD represents/VBZ a/DT change/NN of/IN direction/NN in/IN monopolies/NNS policy/NN ./.

The/DT system/NN currently/RB in/IN force/NN creates/VBZ transparency/RB ,/, affords/VBZ enterprises/JJ legal/JJ certainty/NN and/CC has/VBZ ,/, without/IN a/DT shadow/NN of/IN a/DT doubt/NN ,/, led/VBN to/TO discipline/NN and/CC acted/VBN as/IN a/DT deterrent/NN on/IN account/NN of/IN the/DT notification/NN requirement/NN ./.

The/DT problem/NN of/IN overwork/NN highlighted/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT sufficient/JJ reason/NN for/IN making/VBG radical/JJ changes/NNS to/TO the/DT legal/JJ system/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ debatable/JJ whether/IN this/DT could/MD be/VB carried/VBN through/RP at/IN all/DT without/IN amending/VBG the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB glad/JJ that/IN Mrs/NNP Randzio-Plath/NNP mentioned/VBD the/DT very/RB important/JJ context/NN of/IN our/PRP$ debate/NN because/IN up/RB until/IN now/RB no/DT other/JJ speaker/NN has/VBZ done/VBN so/RB ./.

The/DT advent/NN of/IN the/DT euro/NN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN unleashed/VBD enormous/JJ competitive/JJ forces/NNS within/IN European/JJ business/NN which/WDT are/VBP being/VBG met/VBN by/IN a/DT merger/NN wave/NN of/IN quite/RB unprecedented/JJ proportions/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT figures/NNS for/IN last/JJ year/NN now/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT total/JJ value/NN of/IN mergers/NNS in/IN the/DT European/JJ area/NN was/VBD EUR/$ 1.4/CD trillion/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ seven/CD times/NNS the/DT level/NN of/IN merger/NN activity/NN at/IN the/DT peak/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ European/JJ merger/NN boom/NN in/IN 1990/CD ./.

Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS have/VBP a/DT tremendous/JJ challenge/NN ahead/RB of/IN them/PRP and/CC our/PRP$ worries/NNS in/IN the/DT ELDR/NNP Group/NNP are/VBP that/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT weakening/NN in/IN the/DT thrust/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN either/CC in/IN the/DT examination/NN of/IN mergers/NNS or/CC the/DT monitoring/NN of/IN restrictive/JJ practices/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT criticism/NN that/IN no/DT emphasis/NN has/VBZ been/VBN put/VBN on/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN Article/NNP 82/CD ,/, especially/RB when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG abusive/JJ conduct/NN in/IN a/DT context/NN of/IN market/NN concentration/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT Member/NNP for/IN the/DT Basque/JJ Country/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ total/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN measures/NNS for/IN fair/JJ competition/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN ./.

I/PRP say/VBP this/DT in/IN case/NN there/EX is/VBZ any/DT doubt/NN about/IN the/DT criticisms/NNS which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP directed/VBN at/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN general/NN ,/, and/CC Mr/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, for/IN its/PRP$ persecution/NN of/IN the/DT incentives/NNS to/TO Basque/JJ companies/NNS and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP considers/VBZ them/PRP to/TO be/VB state/NN aid/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, competition/NN is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP we/PRP need/VBP ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP must/MD succeed/VB in/IN linking/VBG the/DT competition/NN criteria/NNS that/WDT are/VBP necessary/JJ to/TO the/DT economy/NN with/IN those/DT relating/VBG to/TO managerial/JJ economics/NNS ./.

I/PRP often/RB have/VBP the/DT impression/NN ,/, unlike/IN the/DT country/NN I/PRP come/VBP from/IN -/: former/JJ East/NNP Germany/NNP -/: where/WRB economic/JJ competitiveness/NN is/VBZ prized/VBN above/IN all/DT else/NN and/CC competitiveness/NN relating/VBG to/TO managerial/JJ economics/NNS is/VBZ disregarded/JJ ,/, that/IN very/RB often/RB the/DT reverse/NN is/VBZ the/DT case/NN ;/: society/NN thinks/VBZ almost/RB exclusively/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN managerial/JJ economics/NNS ./.

I/PRP say/VBP that/DT as/IN an/DT entrepreneur/NN who/WP has/VBZ a/DT vested/JJ interest/NN in/IN this/DT ./.

But/CC a/DT system/NN can/MD not/RB function/VB in/IN this/DT way/NN :/: it/PRP will/MD only/RB work/VB if/IN the/DT two/CD aspects/NNS go/VBP hand/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB you/PRP an/DT example/NN :/: the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP was/VBD right/JJ to/TO support/VB the/DT Gr脙/NNP 露/NNP nitz/NN steelworks/NNS in/IN Brandenburg/NNP ,/, although/IN out/NN of/IN 5/CD 000/CD jobs/NNS only/RB 700/CD remained/VBD ./.

But/CC these/DT are/VBP competitive/JJ jobs/NNS ,/, for/IN this/DT steelworks/NNS is/VBZ now/RB the/DT number/NN two/CD tool/NN steel/NN manufacturer/NN in/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Germany/NNP ./.

It/PRP goes/VBZ without/IN saying/VBG that/IN that/DT is/VBZ not/RB what/WP the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB ./.

If/IN we/PRP want/VBP there/EX to/TO be/VB competition/NN then/RB we/PRP must/MD establish/VB this/DT link/NN between/IN the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT national/JJ economy/NN and/CC the/DT pre-requisites/NNS of/IN managerial/JJ economics/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB that/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO build/VB up/RP regional/JJ economic/JJ circulation/NN in/IN the/DT under-developed/JJ regions/NNS that/WDT will/MD protect/VB people/NNS '/POS s/JJ social/JJ welfare/NN and/CC boost/VB purchasing/VBG power/NN ./.

To/TO that/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD also/RB make/VB it/PRP our/PRP$ business/NN to/TO take/VB more/JJR account/NN of/IN demand-orientated/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN as/RB opposed/VBN to/TO one/CD focusing/VBG heavily/RB on/IN supply/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ever/RB since/IN I/PRP was/VBD elected/VBN to/TO this/DT Parliament/NNP in/IN 1994/CD I/PRP have/VBP never/RB witnessed/VBN a/DT report/NN which/WDT had/VBD such/JJ anti-Irish/JJ sentiments/NNS and/CC overtones/NNS as/IN the/DT Jonckheer/NNP report/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG today/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO quote/VB verbatim/RB from/IN the/DT report/NN :/: ``/`` State/NN aid/NN per/IN capita/NN is/VBZ highest/JJS in/IN Italy/NNP ,/, Germany/NNP and/CC Ireland/NNP ./.

Ireland/NNP clearly/RB is/VBZ in/IN the/DT lead/NN when/WRB national/JJ and/CC Community/NNP regional/JJ and/CC social/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP put/VBN together/RB ./. ''/'' ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN is/VBZ simply/RB playing/VBG with/IN figures/NNS ./.

I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO understand/VB how/WRB he/PRP can/MD index/NN regional/JJ and/CC social/JJ funds/NNS into/IN this/DT mathematical/JJ equation/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB the/DT Member/NNP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ agreed/VBN to/TO the/DT new/JJ regional/JJ aid/NN guidelines/NNS for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000/CD plus/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD merely/RB an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT policy/NN objectives/NNS to/TO complete/VB the/DT internal/JJ market/NN within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Regional/NNP disparities/NNS must/MD be/VB overcome/VBN if/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN is/VBZ to/TO succeed/VB and/CC prosper/VB ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN grant/NN aid/NN of/IN 40/CD %/NN and/CC a/DT top-up/NN of/IN 15/CD %/NN for/IN SMEs/NNP for/IN fixed/JJ investment/NN will/MD be/VB permitted/VBN for/IN companies/NNS setting/VBG up/RP in/IN Objective/NNP 1/CD regions/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP post-2000/CD ./.

I/PRP remind/VB Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP that/IN Irish/JJ companies/NNS or/CC foreign/JJ companies/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP still/RB have/VBP to/TO cross/VB two/CD sea/NN masses/NNS to/TO reach/VB the/DT mainland/JJ European/JJ marketplace/NN ./.

No/DT other/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP is/VBZ at/IN such/PDT a/DT disadvantage/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT monopolies/NNS '/POS ban/NN is/VBZ the/DT key/JJ element/NN of/IN functioning/VBG competition/NN order/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Commission/NNP for/IN a/DT useful/JJ and/CC thorough/JJ conciliation/NN procedure/NN and/CC one/CD that/WDT was/VBD good-tempered/VBN all/DT round/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB always/RB the/DT case/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP can/MD regard/VB the/DT end/NN result/NN of/IN conciliation/NN as/RB very/RB satisfactory/JJ for/IN Parliament/NNP as/IN the/DT joint/JJ text/NN has/VBZ incorporated/VBN all/PDT its/PRP$ amendments/NNS either/CC in/IN full/JJ or/CC in/IN a/DT re-worded/JJ form/NN ./.

The/DT financial/JJ amount/NN finally/RB allocated/VBN to/TO the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT considerable/JJ improvement/NN on/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN at/IN second/JJ reading/NN which/WDT we/PRP found/VBD completely/RB unacceptable/JJ and/CC we/PRP have/VBP made/VBN quite/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN progress/NN there/RB ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB propose/VBP that/IN this/DT House/NNP agree/VBP to/TO adopt/VB the/DT proposals/NNS on/IN SAVE/NNP and/CC the/DT conclusion/NN at/IN the/DT conciliation/NN at/IN third/JJ reading/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB the/DT House/NNP that/IN at/IN second/JJ reading/NN Parliament/NNP adopted/VBD this/DT report/NN containing/VBG eight/CD amendments/NNS ,/, including/VBG a/DT re-instatement/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ original/JJ budget/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP accepted/VBD five/CD of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN amendments/NNS including/VBG the/DT budgetary/JJ allocation/NN and/CC I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ continued/VBN support/NN on/IN the/DT budget/NN during/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN as/IN what/WP the/DT Council/NNP had/VBD proposed/VBN was/VBD unacceptable/JJ ./.

During/IN the/DT procedure/NN ,/, agreement/NN was/VBD reached/VBN on/IN the/DT studies/NNS and/CC actions/NNS to/TO devise/VB ,/, implement/VB ,/, complement/VB and/CC assess/VB the/DT Community/NNP measures/NNS ./.

Compromise/JJ wordings/NNS were/VBD agreed/VBN for/IN five/CD other/JJ amendments/NNS including/VBG legislative/JJ and/CC non-legislative/JJ measures/NNS and/CC the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN local/JJ energy/NN centres/NNS and/CC ,/, very/RB importantly/RB ,/, the/DT energy/NN audit/NN systems/NNS in/IN the/DT review/NN of/IN progress/NN on/IN energy/NN efficiency/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN you/PRP will/MD all/RB agree/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ important/JJ progress/NN ./.

The/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ envelope/NN was/VBD staunchly/RB defended/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/NNP very/RB meagre/JJ opening/NN offer/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT event/NN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO have/VB several/JJ meetings/NNS before/IN the/DT Council/NNP finally/RB increased/VBD this/DT to/TO a/DT substantial/JJ amount/NN ./.

We/PRP got/VBD an/DT increase/NN of/IN 2/CD million/CD on/IN their/PRP$ starting/JJ figure/NN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT decisive/JJ increase/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD recommend/VB to/TO you/PRP and/CC which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP confirmed/VBD that/IN it/PRP could/MD implement/VB the/DT programmes/NNS under/IN ./.

This/DT was/VBD an/DT important/JJ consideration/NN for/IN us/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB however/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, and/CC has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN ,/, a/DT very/RB modest/JJ budget/NN and/CC therefore/RB the/DT funding/NN for/IN this/DT programme/NN is/VBZ more/RBR symbolic/JJ than/IN real/JJ ./.

Funding/NNP for/IN energy/NN saving/NN still/RB comes/VBZ primarily/RB from/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO bear/VB that/DT in/IN mind/NN when/WRB approving/VBG this/DT programme/NN ./.

If/IN there/EX is/VBZ more/JJR symbolism/NN than/IN reality/NN in/IN what/WP we/PRP can/MD achieve/VB at/IN Community/NNP level/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT pity/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN enthusiasm/NN at/IN local/JJ level/NN for/IN action/NN ,/, including/VBG Community/NNP actions/NNS ,/, on/IN energy/NN saving/NN ./.

Where/WRB the/DT Community/NNP can/MD step/VB in/RP is/VBZ to/TO put/VB the/DT local/JJ activators/NNS in/IN touch/NN with/IN each/DT other/JJ so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD actually/RB not/RB re-invent/VB the/DT wheel/NN in/IN every/DT region/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP an/DT important/JJ part/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN the/DT Community/NNP in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

SAVE/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/RB Community-wide/JJ programme/NN dedicated/VBN to/TO promoting/VBG the/DT rational/JJ use/NN of/IN energy/NN ./.

It/PRP focuses/VBZ on/IN non-technical/JJ elements/NNS ,/, helping/VBG to/TO build/VB energy/NN efficiency/NN infrastructure/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN is/VBZ to/TO create/VB an/DT environment/NN in/IN which/WDT investments/NNS and/CC energy/NN efficiency/NN will/MD be/VB promoted/VBN ./.

Here/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO realise/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT market/NN opportunity/NN in/IN industry/NN for/IN energy/NN savings/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN a/DT lot/NN about/IN difficulties/NNS of/IN competition/NN in/IN renewable/JJ energies/NNS but/CC energy/NN efficiency/NN saves/VBZ money/NN for/IN business/NN ,/, saves/VBZ money/NN all/DT round/NN in/IN fact/NN and/CC therefore/RB it/PRP should/MD be/VB non-problematical/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ something/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD all/RB support/VB ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, like/IN motherhood/NN ,/, although/IN we/PRP all/RB support/VB it/PRP ,/, sometimes/RB we/PRP do/VBP very/RB little/RB substantially/RB and/CC concretely/JJ to/TO help/VB the/DT mothers/NNS or/CC the/DT people/NNS engaged/VBN in/IN energy-saving/NN ./.

We/PRP could/MD do/VB rather/RB more/JJR ,/, considering/VBG that/IN we/PRP have/VBP made/VBN great/JJ commitments/NNS in/IN reducing/VBG CO2/NN and/CC greenhouse/NN gases/NNS and/CC to/TO reduce/VB dependence/NN on/IN energy/NN imports/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB taking/VBG the/DT kind/NN of/IN action/NN that/IN the/DT citizens/NNS want/VBP to/TO see/VB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB making/VBG the/DT connection/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT citizens/NNS can/MD actually/RB do/VB something/NN concretely/NN either/CC at/IN home/NN or/CC in/IN their/PRP$ offices/NNS or/CC in/IN industry/NN to/TO support/VB action/NN against/IN global/JJ climate/NN change/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP could/MD communicate/VB this/DT it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB once/RB again/RB to/TO thank/VB all/DT who/WP helped/VBD in/IN this/DT conciliation/NN process/NN ./.

As/IN Mrs/NNP Ahern/NNP has/VBZ explained/VBN very/RB well/RB ,/, the/DT budgets/NNS of/IN both/PDT the/DT SAVE/JJ programme/NN and/CC the/DT ALTENER/JJ programme/NN ,/, are/VBP basically/RB symbolic/JJ budgets/NNS ,/, since/IN the/DT burden/NN is/VBZ shouldered/VBN by/IN the/DT countries/NNS ,/, the/DT States/NNPS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, the/DT regions/NNS or/CC even/RB ,/, in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, the/DT local/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

This/DT improvement/NN has/VBZ been/VBN achieved/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ funds/NNS ,/, as/IN we/PRP said/VBD at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN achieved/VBN while/IN safeguarding/VBG this/DT Parliament/NNP '/POS s/CD prerogatives/NNS and/CC competences/NNS ./.

From/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN this/DT interinstitutional/JJ game/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ important/JJ and/CC I/PRP am/VBP very/RB happy/JJ to/TO highlight/VB it/PRP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN 11/CD a.m./RB tomorrow/NN ./.

CULTURE/VB 2000/CD ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP actually/RB feel/VBP that/IN we/PRP ought/MD not/RB to/TO have/VB continued/VBN discussing/VBG this/DT because/IN we/PRP said/VBD everything/NN there/EX was/VBD to/TO say/VB in/IN the/DT last/JJ debate/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN no/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP always/RB talks/VBZ about/IN culture/NN but/CC fails/VBZ to/TO allocate/VB any/DT money/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP the/DT feeling/NN ,/, and/CC are/VBP in/IN fact/NN convinced/VBN ,/, that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS would/MD be/VB more/RBR than/IN happy/JJ to/TO withdraw/VB the/DT things/NNS they/PRP wrote/VBD in/IN 1992/CD in/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Maastricht/NNP ./.

For/IN no/DT one/NN is/VBZ very/RB keen/JJ to/TO spend/VB money/NN on/IN culture/NN ./.

Sadly/RB that/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD face/VB facts/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, who/WP really/RB has/VBZ chipped/VBN away/RP tirelessly/RB at/IN this/DT monumental/JJ task/NN ,/, in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP of/IN course/NN ./.

We/PRP simply/RB had/VBD to/TO take/VB on/IN board/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN whilst/IN we/PRP actually/RB attained/VBN our/PRP$ goal/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN content/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN the/DT same/JJ could/MD not/RB be/VB said/VBN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ aspect/NN ./.

One/PRP seems/VBZ powerless/JJ in/IN a/DT dialogue/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT other/JJ party/NN actually/RB has/VBZ to/TO reach/VB a/DT unanimous/JJ decision/NN ./.

What/WDT kind/NN of/IN horse-trading/JJ system/NN is/VBZ this/DT ?/.

Certainly/RB not/RB a/DT fair/JJ one/NN !/.

There/EX are/VBP always/RB people/NNS who/WP are/VBP in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO reject/VB everything/NN and/CC there/RB we/PRP are/VBP on/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN ,/, begging/VBG for/IN a/DT little/RB more/JJR money/NN for/IN culture/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ downright/RB scandalous/JJ what/WP goes/VBZ on/IN !/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT awful/JJ sort/NN of/IN horse-trading/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN unequal/JJ positions/NNS !/. ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN this/DT programme/NN has/VBZ turned/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD it/PRP to/TO ./.

It/PRP lives/VBZ up/RP to/TO the/DT expectations/NNS the/DT citizens/NNS have/VBP of/IN us/PRP ./.

We/PRP will/MD support/VB small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ events/NNS ,/, not/RB the/DT large/JJ ones/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP will/MD afford/VB individual/JJ citizens/NNS and/CC also/RB the/DT smaller/JJR operators/NNS easier/JJR access/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT fact/NN that/WDT Culture/NN and/CC ,/, fittingly/RB ,/, Education/NNP and/CC Youth/NNP now/RB fall/VBP within/IN the/DT same/JJ Commissioner/NNP '/POS s/JJ remit/NN ,/, will/MD also/RB serve/VB to/TO guarantee/VB more/JJR synergy/NN between/IN these/DT three/CD programmes/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP certainly/RB worthwhile/JJ programmes/NNS for/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

If/IN one/PRP puts/VBZ all/PDT the/DT money/NN together/RB and/CC creates/VBZ synergy/NN then/RB one/PRP can/MD be/VB a/DT tiny/JJ bit/NN satisfied/JJ ,/, but/CC then/RB only/RB a/DT tiny/JJ bit/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ hope/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN synergy/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ money/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT fine/JJ words/NNS with/IN which/WDT the/DT rapporteur/NN began/VBD his/PRP$ intervention/NN and/CC I/PRP must/MD add/VB that/IN ,/, during/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD personally/RB a/DT little/RB disappointed/VBN with/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

On/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, it/PRP continued/VBD to/TO refuse/VB to/TO accept/VB the/DT term/NN ``/`` European/JJ cultural/JJ policy/NN ''/'' or/CC other/JJ similar/JJ terms/NNS ,/, even/RB undervaluing/VBG the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP defines/VBZ ``/`` Culture/NNP 2000/CD ''/'' simply/RB as/IN an/DT instrument/NN for/IN cultural/JJ cooperation/NN and/CC no/RB more/JJR ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ shown/VBN complete/JJ intransigence/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT funds/NNS requested/VBN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT were/VBD minimal/JJ anyway/RB ./.

Incidentally/RB ,/, this/DT last/JJ point/NN would/MD be/VB unfair/JJ to/TO fourteen/CD Members/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, since/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB one/CD ,/, the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD responsible/JJ for/IN that/DT intransigence/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ once/RB again/RB been/VBN demonstrated/VBN that/IN conciliation/NN is/VBZ incompatible/JJ with/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN unanimity/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

This/DT demand/NN makes/VBZ conciliation/NN almost/RB impossible/JJ and/CC even/RB affects/VBZ the/DT dignity/NN of/IN the/DT parliamentary/JJ institution/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, these/DT considerations/NNS must/MD not/RB hide/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT joint/JJ text/NN which/WDT we/PRP will/MD vote/VB on/IN tomorrow/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT the/DT Socialists/NNPS will/MD vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN ,/, will/MD put/VB in/IN place/NN one/CD of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ most/RBS important/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

By/IN taking/VBG action/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN culture/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP directly/RB contributing/VBG to/TO the/DT construction/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ soul/NN ,/, especially/RB given/VBN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT sub-programmes/NNS which/WDT make/VBP up/IN ``/`` Culture/NNP 2000/CD ''/'' are/VBP superb/JJ ./.

In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, these/DT have/VBP been/VBN amongst/IN the/DT programmes/NNS most/RBS eagerly/RB accepted/VBN by/IN the/DT youngest/JJS and/CC most/RBS dynamic/JJ citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB the/DT profoundly/RB human/JJ impression/NN I/PRP have/VBP formed/VBN of/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Gra脙/NNP 搂/VBD a/DT Moura/NNP :/: his/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, his/PRP$ sense/NN of/IN balance/NN ,/, his/PRP$ intellectual/JJ qualities/NNS ,/, make/VBP him/PRP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ rapporteur/NN this/DT report/NN could/MD have/VB had/VBN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Commissioner/NNP Reding/NNP ,/, Vice-President/NNP Imbeni/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Gargani/NNP ,/, chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Culture/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT firm/JJ and/CC intelligent/JJ position/NN which/WDT ,/, each/DT within/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ role/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP maintained/VBN during/IN the/DT entire/JJ conciliation/NN process/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, rapporteur/VBP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN thanking/VBG Mr/NNP Gra脙/NNP 搂/VBG a/DT Moura/NNP most/JJS warmly/RB for/IN the/DT tremendous/JJ efforts/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN into/IN the/DT discussion/NN of/IN this/DT Culture/NNP 2000/CD programme/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN before/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP have/VBP discussed/VBN this/DT between/IN ourselves/PRP on/IN various/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, that/WDT culture/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, extremely/RB important/JJ as/IN an/DT area/NN unto/NN itself/PRP -/: I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB this/DT once/RB again/RB -/: but/CC also/RB as/IN the/DT instrument/NN par/NN excellence/NN for/IN furthering/VBG the/DT European/JJ idea/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB of/IN great/JJ importance/NN to/TO citizens/NNS ./.

Today/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP arrived/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ road/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD nonetheless/RB like/VB ,/, as/IN others/NNS have/VBP done/VBN ,/, to/TO touch/VB upon/IN the/DT procedure/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ unclear/JJ and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, unwanted/JJ ./.

Codecision/NN and/CC unanimity/NN do/VBP not/RB go/VB hand/NN in/IN hand/NN ./.

They/PRP are/VBP like/IN a/DT snake/NN biting/VBG its/PRP$ own/JJ tail/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ little/JJ room/NN for/IN negotiation/NN if/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT parties/NNS states/VBZ beforehand/RB :/: anything/NN is/VBZ open/JJ for/IN discussion/NN ,/, as/RB long/JJ as/IN the/DT budget/NN stays/VBZ fixed/VBN ./.

As/IN it/PRP happens/VBZ -/: and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO add/VB this/DT for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS -/: negotiations/NNS on/IN this/DT matter/NN have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN at/IN an/DT earlier/JJR stage/NN ./.

The/DT result/NN is/VBZ 30/CD %/NN growth/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB completely/RB dissatisfied/JJ with/IN the/DT result/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ always/RB better/JJR to/TO make/VB more/JJR funding/NN available/JJ more/RBR quickly/RB -/: and/CC I/PRP for/IN one/CD will/MD always/RB advocate/VB this/DT -/: but/CC I/PRP do/VBP think/VBP that/IN this/DT programme/NN opens/VBZ up/RP good/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN quite/PDT a/DT few/JJ programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB that/IN culture/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB funded/VBN from/IN this/DT particular/JJ pot/NN ./.

Culture/NNP does/VBZ not/RB only/RB fall/VB under/IN the/DT banner/NN of/IN culture/NN but/CC also/RB under/IN that/DT of/IN all/DT kinds/NNS of/IN other/JJ areas/NNS ./.

A/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN money/NN for/IN culture/NN is/VBZ also/RB set/VBN aside/RP in/IN the/DT Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT we/PRP should/MD definitely/RB consider/VB and/CC bear/VB in/IN mind/NN ./.

Fortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP on/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Regional/NNP Policy/NNP ./.

So/IN I/PRP myself/PRP will/MD make/VB sure/JJ that/IN this/DT aspect/NN receives/VBZ due/JJ attention/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP also/RB opted/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN allowing/VBG the/DT budget/NN to/TO be/VB of/IN an/DT adequate/JJ size/NN because/IN ,/, if/IN it/PRP happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB cancelled/VBN ,/, then/RB surely/RB this/DT does/VBZ not/RB benefit/VB the/DT citizen/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP always/RB given/VBN the/DT rapporteur/NN my/PRP$ backing/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ ,/, as/IN he/PRP always/RB states/NNS too/RB ,/, that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT next/JJ IGC/NN ,/, changes/NNS will/MD be/VB made/VBN to/TO codecision/NN ,/, when/WRB unanimity/NN will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB necessary/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP very/RB positive/JJ about/IN the/DT many/JJ improvements/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN :/: no/DT more/JJR mega-projects/NNS ,/, room/NN for/IN cultural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, and/CC sufficient/JJ attention/NN to/TO promoting/VBG reading/NN ,/, translating/NN and/CC translation/NN companies/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ especially/RB important/JJ to/TO smaller/JJR linguistic/JJ areas/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN and/CC also/RB Mrs/NNP Reding/NNP for/IN Culture/NNP 2000/CD ./.

All/DT that/WDT remains/VBZ for/IN me/PRP to/TO say/VB is/VBZ :/: time/NN to/TO get/VB down/RP to/TO business/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, all/DT that/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO say/VB has/VBZ been/VBN covered/VBN by/IN those/DT fellow/JJ Members/NNS who/WP spoke/VBD before/IN me/PRP and/CC I/PRP think/VBP there/EX is/VBZ unanimity/RB among/IN the/DT groups/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC among/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP on/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Culture/NNP ./.

I/PRP too/RB must/MD say/VB that/IN I/PRP will/MD be/VB voting/VBG for/IN this/DT joint/JJ text/NN for/IN a/DT Council/NNP and/CC European/NNP Parliament/NNP decision/NN with/IN a/DT very/RB heavy/JJ heart/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ shameful/JJ !/. ./.

That/DT figure/NN of/IN EUR/$ 167/CD million/CD for/IN so/RB many/JJ years/NNS is/VBZ a/DT disgrace/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP !/. ./.

So/IN long/RB as/IN we/PRP continue/VBP to/TO have/VB unanimity/NN ,/, so/RB long/RB as/RB yesterday/NN the/DT Dutch/JJ Government/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO impose/VB those/DT EUR/$ 167/CD million/CD as/IN an/DT ultimatum/NN and/CC so/RB long/RB as/IN a/DT government/NN with/IN Mr/NNP Haider/NNP will/MD soon/RB be/VB telling/VBG us/PRP what/WP cultural/JJ activities/NNS we/PRP can/MD pursue/VB ,/, we/PRP will/MD never/RB progress/VB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ for/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP to/TO take/VB important/JJ decisions/NNS and/CC to/TO cut/VB free/JJ so/RB that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO create/VB a/DT meaningful/JJ cultural/JJ impetus/NN within/IN the/DT European/JJ area/NN may/MD be/VB rid/VBN of/IN this/DT constraint/NN by/IN all/PDT the/DT governments/NNS ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP absolutely/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN '/POS s/JJ analysis/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Culture/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Gargani/NNP ,/, for/IN his/PRP$ praiseworthy/JJ work/NN in/IN a/DT mediation/NN process/NN that/WDT was/VBD also/RB ,/, considerably/RB difficult/JJ ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP felt/VBD the/DT need/NN to/TO simplify/VB and/CC consolidate/VB the/DT previous/JJ programmes/NNS ,/, but/CC everyone/NN hoped/VBD that/IN the/DT Culture/NNP programme/NN could/MD help/VB to/TO promote/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT unique/JJ features/NNS of/IN each/DT cultural/JJ sector/NN ,/, even/RB -/: and/CC I/PRP could/MD say/VB especially/RB -/: of/IN the/DT unique/JJ features/NNS of/IN less/RBR well-known/JJ sectors/NNS ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT ,/, at/IN the/DT least/JJS ,/, will/MD come/VB about/RP during/IN the/DT evaluation/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP sincerely/RB believe/VBP in/IN the/DT validity/NN of/IN cultural/JJ action/NN ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN making/VBG a/DT contribution/NN to/TO the/DT social/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN economic/JJ ,/, development/NN of/IN a/DT people/NNS ./.

And/CC a/DT fully-fledged/JJ Europe/NNP can/MD compete/VB with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC fully/RB rediscover/VB its/PRP$ roots/NNS ,/, highlight/VB its/PRP$ common/JJ cultural/JJ heritage/NN and/CC enhance/VB and/CC restore/VB dignity/NN to/TO cultural/JJ and/CC linguistic/JJ islands/NNS that/IN until/IN now/RB were/VBD less/RBR well-known/JJ ./.

The/DT overall/JJ growth/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT awareness/NN of/IN being/VBG European/JJ citizens/NNS :/: this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Culture/NNP 2000/CD programme/NN ,/, albeit/IN with/IN a/DT scarcity/NN of/IN funds/NNS ,/, can/MD make/VB a/DT considerable/JJ contribution/NN to/TO this/DT great/JJ common/JJ goal/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP will/MD add/VB to/TO the/DT unanimity/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN and/CC say/VB that/IN I/PRP support/VBP the/DT adoption/NN of/IN Culture/NNP 2000/CD and/CC add/VB my/PRP$ thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Gra脙/NNP 搂/VB a/DT Moura/NNP ,/, who/WP took/VBD over/RP from/IN our/PRP$ former/JJ colleague/NN Nana/NNP Mouskouri/NNP ./.

Both/DT of/IN them/PRP have/VBP done/VBN a/DT first-class/JJ job/NN ./.

Alongside/IN the/DT debate/NN we/PRP had/VBD earlier/JJR on/IN in/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, culture/NN may/MD not/RB seem/VB that/DT important/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ;/: and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB careful/JJ in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP not/RB to/TO allow/VB the/DT urgent/JJ to/TO get/VB in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN the/DT important/JJ ./.

Why/WRB do/VBP I/PRP say/VB that/IN culture/NN is/VBZ important/JJ ?/.

Well/RB in/IN simple/JJ economic/JJ terms/NNS ,/, Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ culture/NN adds/VBZ to/TO genuine/JJ prosperity/NN ./.

Where/WRB would/MD Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ tourism/NN industry/NN be/VB without/IN the/DT richness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ culture/NN ?/.

But/CC ,/, more/RBR importantly/RB than/IN that/DT ,/, cultural/JJ activities/NNS are/VBP what/WP make/VBP mankind/NN civilised/JJ ./.

Culture/NNP is/VBZ at/IN the/DT root/NN of/IN our/PRP$ democratic/JJ beliefs/NNS ;/: and/CC an/DT uncultured/JJ society/NN is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO sustain/VB tolerance/NN and/CC freedom/NN and/CC democracy/NN ./.

Cultural/NNP diversity/NN is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ under/IN threat/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB under/IN threat/NN from/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Many/JJ people/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ country/NN say/VBP they/PRP see/VBP British/JJ culture/NN being/VBG under/IN threat/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, from/IN Portugal/NNP ,/, from/IN Germany/NNP ,/, from/IN Finland/NNP ,/, for/IN heaven/NN '/POS s/VBG sake/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP drink/NN port/NN wine/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP do/VBP like/IN German/JJ beer/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP even/RB use/VBP Finnish/JJ saunas/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB from/IN Europe/NNP that/IN culture/NN is/VBZ under/IN threat/NN ./.

What/WP I/PRP do/VBP see/VB right/RB across/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ people/NNS drinking/VBG Coca/NNP Cola/NNP ,/, eating/VBG hamburgers/NNS ,/, wearing/VBG baseball/NN caps/NNS ,/, watching/VBG Hollywood/NNP films/NNS and/CC often/RB doing/VBG all/PDT this/DT at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.

Now/RB I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN protectionism/NN and/CC regulation/NN is/VBZ the/DT way/NN of/IN defending/VBG Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ culture/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP believe/VB in/IN lending/VBG a/DT helping/VBG hand/NN when/WRB we/PRP can/MD ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP Culture/NNP 2000/CD is/VBZ about/IN ./.

So/RB ,/, I/PRP say/VBP to/TO the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP :/: Keep/VB this/DT programme/NN genuinely/RB under/IN review/NN ./.

Are/VBP we/PRP doing/VBG enough/JJ ?/.

And/CC ,/, I/PRP say/VBP to/TO Madame/VB Reding/NN ,/, thank/VB you/PRP for/IN the/DT support/NN and/CC the/DT help/NN you/PRP have/VBP given/VBN so/RB far/RB ,/, keep/VB up/RP the/DT good/JJ work/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP on/IN your/PRP$ side/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO warmly/RB thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Graa/NNP Moura/NNP ,/, and/CC Commissioner/NNP Reding/NNP ,/, for/IN their/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT creation/NN of/IN this/DT programme/NN ./.

The/DT Culture/NNP 2000/CD programme/NN was/VBD finalised/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN conciliation/NN between/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ./.

The/DT outcome/NN can/MD be/VB considered/VBN reasonable/JJ ,/, when/WRB we/PRP take/VBP into/IN account/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN called/VBD for/IN a/DT unanimous/JJ decision/NN to/TO be/VB made/VBN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO hope/VB that/IN at/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ IGC/NN we/PRP will/MD also/RB end/VB up/RP with/IN qualified/JJ majority/NN decisions/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN culture/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB strange/JJ that/IN legislation/NN that/WDT adheres/VBZ to/TO the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ being/VBG debated/VBN requires/VBZ unanimity/RB for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB passed/VBN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

The/DT framework/NN programme/NN on/IN culture/NN is/VBZ replacing/VBG the/DT present/JJ Kaleidoscope/JJ ,/, Ariane/NNP and/CC Raphael/NNP programmes/NNS ./.

When/WRB implementation/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN begins/VBZ ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP in/IN particular/JJ that/IN the/DT scope/NN it/PRP offers/VBZ for/IN literature/NN and/CC the/DT translation/NN of/IN books/NNS can/MD be/VB utilised/VBN to/TO the/DT full/JJ ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP and/CC hope/VBP that/IN ,/, despite/IN the/DT assault/NN on/IN us/PRP all/DT of/IN the/DT new/JJ technology/NN ,/, literature/NN will/MD maintain/VB its/PRP$ status/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP the/DT depth/NN of/IN spirit/NN that/IN literature/NN provides/VBZ in/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN a/DT culture/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT short/JJ attention/NN span/NN and/CC is/VBZ inclined/VBN towards/IN the/DT superficial/JJ ./.

Literature/NNP likewise/RB plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ part/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP transmits/VBZ our/PRP$ cultural/JJ heritage/NN ,/, increases/VBZ mutual/JJ familiarity/NN and/CC preserves/VBZ linguistic/JJ wealth/NN and/CC the/DT diversity/NN of/IN tongues/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN this/DT conference/NN will/MD also/RB encourage/VB the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN libraries/NNS into/IN active/JJ consideration/NN in/IN the/DT fifth/JJ framework/NN programme/NN in/IN respect/NN of/IN the/DT information/NN society/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, rapporteur/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, somehow/RB or/CC other/JJ ,/, today/NN '/POS s/JJ agenda/NN has/VBZ come/VBN full/JJ circle/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO say/VB today/NN about/IN Europe/NNP as/IN a/DT community/NN of/IN values/NNS ,/, about/IN tolerance/NN ,/, human/JJ dignity/NN ,/, human/JJ rights/NNS ,/, a/DT positive/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT enlargement/JJ process/NN ,/, transparency/NN and/CC respect/NN for/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.

Youth/JJ ,/, education/NN and/CC cultural/JJ policies/NNS are/VBP important/JJ tools/NNS for/IN creating/VBG these/DT values/NNS ,/, for/IN giving/VBG the/DT citizens/NNS confidence/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC making/VBG it/PRP credible/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./.

The/DT funding/NN approved/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP for/IN the/DT cultural/JJ programme/NN does/VBZ not/RB do/VB justice/NN to/TO the/DT importance/NN of/IN cultural/JJ and/CC educational/JJ policy/NN and/CC of/IN this/DT programme/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ goals/NNS ./.

Cultural/NNP activity/NN creates/VBZ identity/NN ./.

Cultural/NNP activity/NN is/VBZ an/DT expression/NN of/IN individuality/NN ,/, of/IN an/DT individual/NN '/POS s/JJ own/JJ personality/NN ;/: it/PRP builds/VBZ relationships/NNS and/CC communicates/NNS ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT colourful/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT Europe/NNP based/VBN on/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN diversity/NN within/IN unity/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, despite/IN the/DT fears/NNS that/WDT may/MD be/VB felt/VBN by/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS on/IN the/DT island/NN ,/, these/DT points/NNS ,/, which/WDT could/MD be/VB viewed/VBN in/IN a/DT negative/JJ light/NN by/IN the/DT authorities/NNS on/IN both/DT sides/NNS ,/, may/MD in/IN the/DT end/NN justify/VB hopes/NNS of/IN an/DT ultimate/JJ solution/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT has/VBZ created/VBN the/DT framework/NN for/IN a/DT positive/JJ outcome/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP presidency/NN ,/, are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, we/PRP will/MD continue/VB to/TO follow/VB these/DT developments/NNS very/RB closely/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP will/MD certainly/RB cooperate/VB with/IN the/DT Secretary-General/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ personal/JJ representative/NN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD make/VB the/DT Community/NNP institutions/NNS aware/JJ of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO do/VB ,/, and/CC what/WP is/VBZ possible/JJ in/IN general/NN ,/, as/IN regards/JJ coordination/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB at/IN political/JJ level/NN but/CC also/RB as/IN regards/VBZ what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP can/MD achieve/VB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ scope/NN for/IN managing/VBG the/DT accession/NN process/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP will/MD make/VB known/VBN the/DT flexibility/NN that/IN both/DT parties/NNS have/VBP demonstrated/VBN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP listened/VBD to/TO the/DT statements/NNS by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT following/VBG observations/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB refer/VB to/TO the/DT government/NN of/IN Nicosia/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Cypriot/NNP Government/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP ,/, not/RB the/DT government/NN of/IN Nicosia/NNP ./.

That/DT government/NN has/VBZ proposed/VBN a/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT Turkish/JJ Cypriot/NNP side/NN can/MD take/VB part/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB right/JJ for/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO urge/VB the/DT Turkish/JJ Cypriot/NNP side/NN to/TO take/VB part/NN institutionally/NN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS conducted/VBN by/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT protocols/NNS and/CC the/DT pre-accession/JJ strategy/NN has/VBZ been/VBN addressed/VBN so/RB far/RB creates/VBZ some/DT doubts/NNS for/IN us/PRP ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB understand/VB why/WRB the/DT two/CD small/JJ countries/NNS must/MD be/VB treated/VBN differently/RB ,/, nor/CC why/WRB a/DT clash/NN was/VBD necessary/JJ between/IN the/DT institutional/JJ bodies/NNS ./.

Nor/CC can/MD I/PRP understand/VB the/DT pressure/NN applied/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO include/VB the/DT funds/NNS in/IN Chapter/NNP 7/CD for/IN the/DT pre-accession/JJ strategy/NN ./.

How/WRB can/MD the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP treat/VB ,/, in/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, two/CD small/JJ countries/NNS situated/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ periphery/NN ?/.

Not/RB only/JJ are/VBP they/PRP countries/NNS which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP needs/VBZ ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP also/RB countries/NNS which/WDT are/VBP fully/RB qualified/VBN to/TO operate/VB within/IN the/DT Union/NNP and/CC are/VBP already/RB considered/VBN capable/JJ of/IN participating/VBG in/IN economic/JJ and/CC monetary/JJ union/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP said/VBD ,/, and/CC I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN him/PRP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN of/IN political/JJ decision/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ political/JJ decision/NN which/WDT would/MD bring/VB major/JJ benefits/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN helping/VBG the/DT two/CD communities/NNS effectively/RB to/TO constitute/VB one/CD state/NN ,/, to/TO achieve/VB effective/JJ rapprochement/JJ -/: because/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS were/VBD once/RB close/JJ -/: and/CC for/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Cyprus/NNP ,/, genuinely/NNP ,/, to/TO be/VB rid/VBN of/IN occupying/JJ forces/NNS ./.

This/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO the/DT proposal/NN submitted/VBN for/IN other/JJ candidate/NN countries/NNS and/CC ,/, once/IN it/PRP is/VBZ implemented/VBN ,/, will/MD replace/VB the/DT financial/JJ protocols/NNS which/WDT have/VBP now/RB expired/VBN ./.

Pre-accession/JJ instruments/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO provide/VB technical/JJ and/CC financial/JJ support/NN for/IN efforts/NNS by/IN candidate/NN countries/NNS to/TO meet/VB the/DT demands/NNS of/IN the/DT Community/NNP acquis/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ analysis/NN has/VBZ in/IN fact/NN shown/VBN that/IN ,/, although/IN classified/JJ as/IN high/JJ income/NN countries/NNS by/IN the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP ,/, Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP have/VBP the/DT same/JJ difficulties/NNS as/IN the/DT CEECs/NNPS in/IN transposing/VBG Community/NNP law/NN due/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN administrative/JJ and/CC judicial/JJ capacity/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD pointed/VBN out/RP ,/, during/IN the/DT discussion/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Brok/NNP '/POS s/JJ excellent/JJ report/NN in/IN committee/NN ,/, that/IN both/DT countries/NNS can/MD also/RB benefit/VB from/IN the/DT MEDA/NNP budget/NN line/NN for/IN horizontal/JJ projects/NNS of/IN regional/JJ interest/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ if/IN the/DT Commissioner/NNP could/MD explicitly/RB confirm/VB that/DT ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, part/NN of/IN the/DT technical/JJ and/CC financial/JJ aid/NN provided/VBN for/IN in/IN the/DT instruments/NNS will/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO bring/VB the/DT Greek/JJ and/CC Turkish/JJ communities/NNS closer/RBR together/RB and/CC solve/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT partition/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN once/RB and/CC for/IN all/DT ./.

The/DT declarations/NNS made/VBD on/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP question/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP were/VBD therefore/RB most/RBS opportune/JJ and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Commissioner/NNP Verheugen/NNP ./.

Since/IN 4/CD July/NNP 1990/CD ,/, when/WRB Cyprus/NNP applied/VBD to/TO join/VB the/DT EU/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ passed/VBN numerous/JJ resolutions/NNS calling/VBG for/IN a/DT political/JJ solution/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN international/JJ law/NN and/CC the/DT relevant/JJ resolutions/NNS of/IN the/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

In/IN April/NNP 1999/CD ,/, Parliament/NNP again/RB reiterated/VBD its/PRP$ position/NN that/IN the/DT accession/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP should/MD benefit/VB the/DT whole/JJ island/NN ,/, and/CC help/VB towards/IN a/DT political/JJ solution/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN accession/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB dependent/JJ upon/IN such/PDT a/DT solution/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, accession/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB held/VBN hostage/NN to/TO a/DT political/JJ solution/NN ./.

The/DT two/CD processes/NNS are/VBP separate/JJ processes/NNS ./.

This/DT unequivocal/JJ position/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP gave/VBD rise/NN to/TO a/DT certain/JJ degree/NN of/IN controversy/NN ./.

The/DT position/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ and/CC we/PRP must/MD now/RB hope/VB that/IN the/DT improved/VBN climate/NN surrounding/VBG relations/NNS between/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC Turkey/NNP and/CC between/IN Greece/NNP and/CC Turkey/NNP will/MD bear/VB favourably/RB on/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ Cypriot/NNP community/NN and/CC that/IN it/PRP will/MD withdraw/VB its/PRP$ refusal/NN to/TO send/VB representatives/NNS to/TO the/DT accession/NN negotiations/NNS ./.

The/DT presence/NN of/IN these/DT representatives/NNS will/MD not/RB prejudge/VB the/DT final/JJ political/JJ solution/NN in/IN any/DT way/NN whatsoever/RB ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD allow/VB the/DT interests/NNS of/IN all/DT concerned/VBN to/TO be/VB highlighted/VBN as/IN and/CC when/WRB Cyprus/NNP joins/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC prepares/VBZ for/IN a/DT turning/NN point/NN in/IN its/PRP$ history/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP share/VBP the/DT other/JJ rapporteurs/NNS '/POS delight/NN at/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN better/JJR opportunities/NNS are/VBP now/RB to/TO be/VB glimpsed/VBN for/IN making/VBG further/JJ progress/NN in/IN Cyprus/NNP in/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT improvement/NN in/IN relations/NNS between/IN Turkey/NNP and/CC the/DT EU/NNP and/CC between/IN Turkey/NNP and/CC Greece/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP also/RB think/VBP that/IN we/PRP in/IN the/DT EU/NNP should/MD be/VB making/VBG a/DT constructive/JJ contribution/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB think/VBP -/: as/IN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN -/: that/IN there/EX are/VBP certain/JJ problems/NNS with/IN the/DT financing/VBG arrangements/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP must/MD solve/VB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN of/IN pre-accession/JJ aid/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT belongs/VBZ in/IN category/NN seven/CD ./.

Resources/NNP should/MD therefore/RB be/VB set/VBN aside/RP from/IN category/NN seven/CD ,/, where/WRB a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ perspectives/NNS must/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT crux/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT amount/NN which/WDT is/VBZ quoted/VBN in/IN the/DT Brok/NNP report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- EUR/$ 130/CD million/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO say/VB ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/NNP ,/, Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP ,/, that/IN we/PRP must/MD negotiate/VB our/PRP$ way/NN towards/IN finding/VBG a/DT sum/NN of/IN money/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS important/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT multi-annual/JJ programme/NN be/VB guaranteed/VBN ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT correct/JJ category/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO begin/VB making/VBG plans/NNS where/WRB Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/European/NNP Free/NNP Alliance/NNP support/VBP the/DT decision/NN adopted/VBD by/IN the/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN Helsinki/NNP according/VBG to/TO which/WDT the/DT resolution/NN of/IN the/DT conflict/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT prior/JJ condition/NN for/IN the/DT accession/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD continue/VB to/TO exert/VB strong/JJ pressure/NN on/IN the/DT Government/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP ,/, but/CC one/CD section/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN can/MD not/RB blackmail/VB the/DT wish/NN of/IN the/DT majority/NN ./.

Besides/IN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP strong/JJ doubts/NNS as/IN to/TO how/WRB representative/JJ the/DT government/NN is/VBZ of/IN that/WDT part/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN is/VBZ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN the/DT window/NN of/IN opportunity/NN mentioned/VBN by/IN the/DT presidency/NN should/MD be/VB exploited/VBN to/TO the/DT full/JJ ./.

But/CC we/PRP are/VBP also/RB convinced/VBN that/IN ,/, despite/IN improved/VBN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ and/CC Greek/JJ populations/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

The/DT conflict/NN in/IN Cyprus/NNP will/MD only/RB be/VB resolved/VBN through/IN improved/JJ relations/NNS between/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO establishing/VBG a/DT federation/NN in/IN the/DT -/: we/PRP hope/VBP -/: not/RB too/RB distant/JJ future/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB working/VBG towards/IN establishing/VBG genuine/JJ freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN and/CC resolving/VBG the/DT problems/NNS of/IN demilitarising/VBG and/CC disarming/VBG the/DT island/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD be/VB taking/VBG a/DT more/RBR decisive/JJ role/NN that/WDT goes/VBZ further/RBR than/IN merely/RB providing/VBG financial/JJ support/NN ,/, although/IN that/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, by/IN promoting/VBG and/CC guaranteeing/VBG reconciliation/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS through/IN the/DT setting/NN up/RP of/IN fora/NN and/CC confidence-building/NN programmes/NNS ./.

I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN Alex/NNP Langer/NNP 's/POS presence/NN here/RB in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP is/VBZ sadly/RB missed/VBN ./.

His/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO build/VB peace/NN should/MD serve/VB as/IN an/DT example/NN ,/, to/TO all/DT of/IN us/PRP ,/, on/IN how/WRB peaceful/JJ coexistence/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP listened/VBD to/TO the/DT somewhat/RB equivocal/JJ talk/NN and/CC silences/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP which/WDT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, need/VBP clarifying/VBG ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP ,/, first/RB and/CC foremost/RB ,/, to/TO bear/VB the/DT main/JJ point/NN of/IN reference/NN for/IN any/DT international/JJ community/NN in/IN such/JJ cases/NNS in/IN mind/NN ,/, i.e./VBG the/DT resolutions/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS ./.

The/DT Security/NNP Council/NNP feels/VBZ that/IN the/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT Cypriot/NNP problem/NN should/MD be/VB sought/VBN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN a/DT two-zone/JJ ,/, twin-community/JJ federation/NN ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS a/DT single/JJ state/NN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Verheugen/NNP mentioned/VBD ,/, consisting/VBG of/IN two/CD local/JJ administrations/NNS elected/VBN by/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS ./.

Cyprus/NNP should/MD be/VB one/CD sovereign/JJ state/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT single/JJ international/JJ personality/NN and/CC single/JJ citizenship/NN and/CC this/DT state/NN should/MD be/VB demilitarised/VBN ./.

The/DT international/JJ community/NN has/VBZ thus/RB indicated/VBN that/IN it/PRP rejects/VBZ any/DT act/NN accomplished/VBN by/IN force/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP stands/VBZ to/TO gain/VB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, by/IN minimising/VBG the/DT scope/NN for/IN interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT position/NN laid/VBN down/RP by/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP ./.

The/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT Cypriot/NNP problem/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT precondition/NN to/TO Cyprus/NNP '/POS s/JJ accession/NN to/TO the/DT Union/NNP ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Poos/NNP has/VBZ reminded/VBN us/PRP ./.

If/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, Turkey/NNP would/MD have/VB a/DT sort/NN of/IN right/NN of/IN veto/NN over/IN the/DT accession/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, unacceptable/JJ ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD not/RB ,/, in/IN turn/VB ,/, allow/VB the/DT position/NN taken/VBN by/IN the/DT Helsinki/NNP European/NNP Council/NNP to/TO temper/VB our/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO resolve/VB the/DT Cypriot/NNP question/NN before/IN Cyprus/NNP joins/VBZ the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT general/JJ consensus/NN of/IN opinion/NN that/IN financial/JJ aid/NN to/TO Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

The/DT big/JJ question/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ from/IN what/WP budget/NN heading/VBG should/MD this/DT aid/NN be/VB financed/VBN ?/.

The/DT Council/NNP and/CC Commission/NNP have/VBP suggested/VBN deleting/VBG the/DT protocols/NNS under/IN category/NN 4/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT budget/NN order/NN issued/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN December/NNP last/JJ ./.

The/DT rapporteur/NN is/VBZ now/RB making/VBG reference/NN to/TO this/DT and/CC proposes/VBZ classing/VBG Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP under/IN category/NN 7/CD ./.

The/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP has/VBZ even/RB suggested/VBN postponing/VBG approval/NN of/IN the/DT Brok/NNP report/NN until/IN the/DT Council/NNP agrees/VBZ to/TO increase/VB the/DT financial/JJ ceilings/NNS for/IN category/NN 7/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB risky/JJ strategy/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT financial/JJ protocols/NNS can/MD not/RB go/VB ahead/RB without/IN a/DT vote/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP will/MD thus/RB become/VB the/DT victims/NNS of/IN a/DT political/JJ game/NN between/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC Parliament/NNP regarding/VBG the/DT height/NN of/IN the/DT ceilings/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, what/WDT is/VBZ the/DT real/JJ significance/NN of/IN financial/JJ ceilings/NNS if/IN they/PRP are/VBP increased/VBN for/IN every/DT new/JJ action/NN ?/.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB advocate/VB that/IN the/DT EUR/$ 15/CD million/CD in/IN category/NN 4/CD be/VB dropped/VBN ,/, in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN ./.

A/DT multiannual/JJ budget/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP later/RB on/IN in/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, may/MD give/VB a/DT decisive/JJ answer/NN regarding/VBG credits/NNS for/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, all/DT over/IN the/DT world/NN work/NN is/VBZ being/VBG done/VBN to/TO resolve/VB long-standing/JJ conflicts/NNS and/CC bring/VB together/RP communities/NNS divided/VBN by/IN history/NN and/CC by/IN old/JJ tribal/JJ enmities/NNS and/CC hatreds/NNS ./.

Now/RB is/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO devote/VB our/PRP$ time/NN and/CC energy/NN to/TO aiding/VBG Cypriots/NNS from/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT ``/`` green/JJ line/NN ''/'' in/IN finding/VBG a/DT solution/NN to/TO a/DT conflict/NN which/WDT has/VBZ lasted/VBN for/IN far/RB too/RB long/RB ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN special/JJ care/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ brought/VBN successfully/RB into/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT decisions/NNS taken/VBN at/IN Helsinki/NNP give/VBP an/DT added/VBN dimension/NN to/TO this/DT debate/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT acceptance/NN of/IN Turkey/NNP as/IN a/DT candidate/NN country/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT decisions/NNS taken/VBN at/IN Helsinki/NNP lead/VBP to/TO progress/VB on/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP issue/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP this/DT signals/VBZ a/DT new/JJ era/NN of/IN hope/NN for/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Turkey/NNP begins/VBZ to/TO play/VB a/DT constructive/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP issue/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ to/TO hear/VB the/DT words/NNS of/IN support/NN from/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT UN/NNP and/CC the/DT work/NN it/PRP is/VBZ doing/VBG in/IN encouraging/VBG proximity/JJ talks/NNS between/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS to/TO encourage/VB reconciliation/NN and/CC the/DT rebuilding/NN of/IN trust/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD communities/NNS in/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS support/NN for/IN that/DT bizonal/JJ ,/, bicommunal/JJ ,/, federal/JJ Cyprus/NN for/IN which/WDT the/DT UN/NNP has/VBZ campaigned/VBN for/IN so/RB long/RB and/CC which/WDT both/CC the/DT Greek/JJ Cypriot/NNP side/NN and/CC the/DT Turkish/JJ Cypriot/NNP side/NN should/MD be/VB working/VBG hard/RB to/TO bring/VB about/RP ./.

I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT renewed/VBN warmth/NN in/IN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT Greek/JJ Government/NN and/CC the/DT Turkish/JJ Government/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN has/VBZ an/DT encouraging/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP talks/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT accession/NN money/NN available/JJ to/TO assist/VB Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ used/VBN partly/RB to/TO promote/VB that/DT reconciliation/NN and/CC rebuilding/NN of/IN trust/NN and/CC that/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT divided/VBN communities/NNS in/IN Cyprus/NNP accept/VBP and/CC use/VBP that/DT money/NN in/IN the/DT spirit/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ given/VBN ./.

We/PRP all/DT ,/, throughout/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS -/: in/IN Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP -/: should/MD be/VB doing/VBG our/PRP$ best/JJS to/TO aid/VB Cyprus/NNP in/IN its/PRP$ quest/NN to/TO reach/VB a/DT peaceful/JJ solution/NN which/WDT brings/VBZ together/RP these/DT two/CD communities/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN divided/VBN for/IN too/RB many/JJ years/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Verheugen/NNP ,/, the/DT regulation/NN on/IN accession/NN aid/NN is/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB an/DT advertisement/NN for/IN coherent/JJ work/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Rather/RB ,/, the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT these/DT aid/NN measures/NNS have/VBP been/VBN cobbled/VBN together/RB smacks/VBZ of/IN amateurism/NN to/TO me/PRP ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ both/DT in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT substance/NN and/CC the/DT financial/JJ aspect/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD hardly/RB enable/VB us/PRP to/TO present/VB the/DT accession/NN activities/NNS conducted/VBN by/IN the/DT Union/NNP to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP as/IN evidence/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ worth/IN their/PRP$ while/NN joining/VBG ./.

As/IN Vaclav/NNP Havel/NNP rightly/RB said/VBD today/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD be/VB judged/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ political/JJ qualities/NNS according/VBG to/TO what/WP it/PRP can/MD do/VB for/IN the/DT individual/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT citizens/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ what/WP a/DT regulation/NN can/MD do/VB for/IN them/PRP that/WDT matters/VBZ ./.

We/PRP will/MD not/RB exactly/RB win/VB any/DT awards/NNS with/IN this/DT regulation/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN that/DT is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ makeshift/JJ and/CC contains/VBZ heteronomous/JJ paragraphs/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ no/DT way/NN to/TO set/VB a/DT shining/VBG example/NN ./.

The/DT quality/NN of/IN an/DT aid/NN package/NN is/VBZ assessed/VBN according/VBG to/TO the/DT following/JJ criteria/NNS :/: is/VBZ it/PRP decentralised/VBN ,/, is/VBZ it/PRP transparent/JJ ,/, is/VBZ it/PRP accessible/JJ to/TO the/DT citizens/NNS and/CC does/VBZ it/PRP work/VB ?/.

Nonetheless/RB ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT divided/VBN island/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, overall/RB ,/, this/DT pre-accession/JJ strategy/NN is/VBZ bound/VBN up/RP with/IN a/DT major/JJ political/JJ challenge/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP to/TO employ/VB all/DT instruments/NNS ,/, including/VBG this/DT one/NN ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO contribute/VB towards/IN resolving/VBG the/DT conflict/NN on/IN the/DT island/NN by/IN political/JJ means/NNS ./.

I/PRP must/MD take/VB this/DT opportunity/NN to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT amendment/NN submitted/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ to/TO me/PRP in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

Both/DT the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP have/VBP been/VBN making/VBG very/RB optimistic/JJ speeches/NNS here/RB today/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP delighted/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP all/RB heading/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ direction/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP would/MD truly/RB be/VB preferable/JJ to/TO secure/VB a/DT peaceful/JJ resolution/NN to/TO the/DT problems/NNS in/IN Cyprus/NNP before/IN admitting/VBG this/DT country/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT view/NN of/IN the/DT Greek/JJ Communist/NNP Party/NNP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT main/JJ problem/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ not/RB its/PRP$ accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP but/CC the/DT occupation/NN of/IN 40/CD %/NN of/IN its/PRP$ territory/NN by/IN Turkey/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ continued/VBN for/IN 26/CD years/NNS ./.

Regardless/RB of/IN the/DT national/JJ origin/NN of/IN each/DT Cypriot/NNP ,/, the/DT future/NN of/IN the/DT Cypriot/NNP people/NNS must/MD involve/VB the/DT unity/NN of/IN that/DT small/JJ country/NN ./.

The/DT only/RB acceptable/JJ solution/NN that/WDT guarantees/VBZ the/DT future/NN ,/, that/WDT leaves/VBZ no/DT room/NN for/IN foreign/JJ interventions/NNS ,/, like/IN those/DT that/WDT led/VBN to/TO all/PDT the/DT problems/NNS of/IN the/DT last/JJ fifty/JJ years/NNS ,/, is/VBZ a/DT unified/JJ and/CC federal/JJ Cyprus/NN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT resolutions/NNS of/IN the/DT UN/NNP '/POS s/NNP Security/NNP Council/NNP ./.

The/DT key/NN to/TO solving/VBG the/DT Cyprus/NNP problem/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ Government/NN ,/, which/WDT supports/VBZ and/CC encourages/VBZ the/DT intransigence/NN of/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ Cypriot/JJ leader/NN Raouf/NNP Denkta脗潞/NNP ./.

Even/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ representative/NN referred/VBD to/TO the/DT north/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP and/CC not/RB to/TO the/DT occupied/JJ territories/NNS ./.

The/DT recent/JJ Helsinki/NNP decision/NN to/TO grant/VB Turkey/NNP accession/NN country/NN status/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP has/VBZ made/VBN not/RB the/DT slightest/JJS concession/NN over/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN its/PRP$ occupation/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, by/IN reducing/VBG its/PRP$ military/JJ presence/NN there/RB or/CC giving/VBG back/RP Ammokhostos/NNS ,/, is/VBZ clearly/RB encouraging/VBG Turkey/NNP '/POS s/JJ intransigence/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB by/IN chance/NN that/IN ,/, immediately/RB after/IN Helsinki/NNP ,/, the/DT Turkish/JJ Prime/NNP Minister/NNP ,/, Bulent/NNP Ecevit/NNP ,/, stated/VBD that/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP issue/NN had/VBD been/VBN resolved/VBN in/IN 1974/CD ./.

On/IN their/PRP$ course/NN towards/IN accession/NN ,/, the/DT people/NNS of/IN Cyprus/NNP have/VBP already/RB lost/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN ,/, but/CC stand/VBP to/TO lose/VB even/RB more/JJR ./.

The/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT acquis/JJ communautaire/NN has/VBZ created/VBN serious/JJ problems/NNS for/IN the/DT Cypriot/NNP economy/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN agriculture/NN ./.

It/PRP entails/VBZ the/DT liquidation/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ sector/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP dislocates/VBZ and/CC destroys/VBZ the/DT developed/VBN system/NN of/IN social/JJ solidarity/NN that/WDT exists/VBZ in/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP beg/VBZ your/PRP$ pardon/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT French/JJ interpreter/NN made/VBD a/DT small/JJ error/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT most/RBS sensitive/JJ word/NN in/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, during/IN the/DT translation/NN of/IN what/WP Mr/NNP Alyssandrakis/NNP just/RB said/VBD ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/RB ambiguity/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP Alyssandrakis/NNP was/VBD translated/VBN as/IN saying/VBG ``/`` the/DT confederate/JJ solution/NN would/MD be/VB best/JJS ''/'' ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT most/RBS important/JJ point/NN and/CC needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB clarified/VBN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ for/IN the/DT clarification/NNP Mr/NNP Wurtz/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Malta/NNP and/CC Cyprus/NNP are/VBP very/RB different/JJ from/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN mainland/JJ Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Maltese/NN in/IN particular/NN have/VBP been/VBN very/RB good/JJ at/IN surviving/VBG in/IN hostile/JJ geographical/JJ and/CC geopolitical/JJ environments/NNS ./.

Their/PRP$ success/NN has/VBZ relied/VBN in/IN great/JJ part/NN on/IN their/PRP$ enterprise/NN ,/, their/PRP$ dynamism/NN and/CC their/PRP$ flexibility/NN ./.

Malta/NNP has/VBZ vibrant/JJ light/NN and/CC heavy/JJ industry/NN ,/, growing/JJ financial/JJ services/NNS ,/, good/JJ agriculture/NN ,/, magnificent/JJ tourism/NN and/CC an/DT amazing/JJ range/NN of/IN employment/NN opportunities/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN this/DT on/IN an/DT island/NN virtually/RB barren/JJ of/IN natural/JJ resources/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP certain/JJ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, that/IN an/DT island/NN such/JJ as/IN Malta/NNP ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ population/NN of/IN 340/CD 000/CD can/MD not/RB accommodate/VB the/DT rigidities/NNS of/IN the/DT economic/JJ and/CC legal/JJ structures/NNS of/IN the/DT mainland/NN which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT population/NN a/DT thousand/CD times/NNS greater/JJR ./.

Thus/RB ,/, when/WRB I/PRP look/VBP at/IN this/DT proposed/VBN instrument/NN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB see/VB a/DT measure/NN to/TO bring/VB two/CD peoples/NNS into/IN the/DT fold/NN of/IN Mother/NNP Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT situation/NN is/VBZ more/RBR akin/JJ to/TO a/DT black/JJ hole/NN in/IN space/NN ,/, sucking/VBG in/RP masses/NNS so/RB powerfully/JJ that/IN not/RB even/RB light/NN escapes/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB bribing/VBG these/DT island/NN peoples/NNS to/TO cooperate/VB in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ destruction/NN ,/, giving/VBG them/PRP money/NN to/TO absorb/VB laws/NNS which/WDT are/VBP as/RB alien/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ culture/NN as/IN a/DT black/JJ hole/NN is/VBZ to/TO Mother/NNP Earth/NNP ./.

The/DT EU/NNP should/MD leave/VB Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP alone/RB ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT only/JJ people/NNS in/IN Malta/NNP that/WDT want/VBP this/DT are/VBP the/DT political/JJ class/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP shall/MD be/VB keeping/VBG my/PRP$ fingers/NNS crossed/VBD that/IN once/RB again/RB the/DT Maltese/JJ people/NNS are/VBP the/DT winners/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ occasions/NNS when/WRB ,/, from/IN what/WP the/DT speakers/NNS have/VBP said/VBN in/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, from/IN all/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ clearly/RB the/DT greatest/JJS convergence/NN of/IN views/NNS on/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP issue/NN and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT pre-accession/JJ process/NN for/IN Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT political/JJ dimension/NN of/IN the/DT Cyprus/NNP problem/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PRP means/VBZ that/IN both/CC the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP have/VBP a/DT very/RB strong/JJ mandate/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN the/DT strength/NN of/IN opinion/NN expressed/VBN by/IN all/PDT the/DT European/JJ parties/NNS ,/, and/CC all/PDT the/DT peoples/NNS ,/, can/MD empower/VB their/PRP$ political/JJ ability/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT problem/NN ./.

Helsinki/NNP was/VBD an/DT historic/JJ event/NN ,/, an/DT historic/JJ turning-point/NN and/CC an/DT historic/JJ new/JJ reference/NN point/NN ./.

If/IN ,/, for/IN any/DT reason/NN ,/, the/DT balance/NN achieved/VBD there/EX should/MD be/VB considered/VBN by/IN some/DT to/TO be/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN departure/NN for/IN new/JJ negotiations/NNS anywhere/RB else/RB ,/, if/IN some/DT people/NNS destabilise/VBP this/DT totality/NN of/IN facts/NNS and/CC equilibrium/NN by/IN their/PRP$ attitude/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD be/VB making/VBG a/DT tragic/JJ mistake/NN ./.

Conditions/NNS are/VBP ripe/JJ ./.

To/TO this/DT end/NN ,/, the/DT Brok/NNP report/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ instrument/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB a/DT bit/RB distressing/JJ that/IN ,/, because/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT joint/JJ debate/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ politically/RB overshadowed/VBN by/IN the/DT political/JJ position/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC we/PRP can/MD not/RB therefore/RB say/VB more/JJR about/IN this/DT good/JJ report/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, the/DT outcome/NN is/VBZ in/IN your/PRP$ hands/NNS ./.

The/DT outcome/NN is/VBZ in/IN our/PRP$ hands/NNS to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP providing/VBG you/PRP with/IN decisions/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP providing/VBG you/PRP with/IN options/NNS ./.

Now/RB ,/, as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT Brok/NNP report/NN ,/, Cyprus/NNP and/CC Malta/NNP are/VBP the/DT last/JJ of/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP islands/NNS ,/, and/CC ,/, unless/IN I/PRP am/VBP mistaken/VBN ,/, the/DT last/JJ islands/NNS anywhere/RB in/IN Europe/NNP which/WDT have/VBP not/RB acceded/VBN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT has/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ semiological/JJ value/NN because/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ islands/NNS -/: and/CC I/PRP too/RB come/VBP from/IN an/DT island/NN -/: are/VBP the/DT area/NN which/WDT most/JJS of/IN those/DT who/WP come/VBN from/IN northern/JJ Europe/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ summer/NN holidays/NNS get/VBP to/TO see/VB ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT people/NNS who/WP live/VBP there/RB ./.

From/IN that/DT standpoint/NN ,/, Aphrodite/NNP '/POS s/VBZ island/NN ,/, as/IN Cyprus/NNP is/VBZ known/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT pirates/NNS '/POS island/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP islanders/VBZ say/VB of/IN Malta/NNP with/IN great/JJ affection/NN ,/, are/VBP two/CD jewels/NNS which/WDT should/MD be/VB welcomed/VBN into/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP without/IN delay/NN ./.

They/PRP have/VBP healthy/JJ economies/NNS ,/, high-level/JJ economic/JJ relations/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN they/PRP constitute/VBP a/DT testing/NN ground/NN for/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ political/JJ will/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, since/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB I/PRP need/VBP to/TO say/VB much/JJ ,/, given/VBN the/DT unanimity/NN that/WDT exists/VBZ here/RB ,/, I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO make/VB one/CD brief/JJ remark/NN to/TO the/DT President-in-Office/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT peculiarities/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ position/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN an/DT interpretation/NN error/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN he/PRP will/MD clarify/VB the/DT matter/NN in/IN his/PRP$ follow-up/NN speech/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Wurtz/NNP ,/, in/IN no/DT way/NN can/MD it/PRP be/VB said/VBN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ maintaining/VBG an/DT ambiguous/JJ silence/NN about/IN this/DT issue/NN :/: the/DT Council/NNP assumes/VBZ total/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN its/PRP$ interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN in/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD this/DT situation/NN and/CC this/DT interpretation/NN which/WDT led/VBD the/DT Council/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT decision/NN it/PRP took/VBD in/IN Luxembourg/NNP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 1997/CD ,/, when/WRB it/PRP decided/VBD to/TO take/VB the/DT first/JJ steps/NNS in/IN the/DT accession/NN process/NN for/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Cyprus/NNP to/TO join/VB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN honourable/JJ Members/NNS will/MD realise/VB that/IN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN the/DT more/JJR or/CC less/JJR emotional/JJ statements/NNS made/VBN about/IN issues/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, the/DT day-to-day/JJ reality/NN of/IN international/JJ negotiations/NNS normally/RB forces/VBZ governments/NNS to/TO adopt/VB a/DT somewhat/RB more/RBR flexible/JJ stance/NN -/: and/CC when/WRB I/PRP say/VBP governments/NNS I/PRP mean/VBP all/DT governments/NNS ./.

But/CC opinion/NN differs/VBZ as/IN to/TO the/DT solution/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN does/VBZ not/RB formally/RB deviate/VB from/IN the/DT monopolies/NNS ban/NN but/CC the/DT upshot/NN of/IN this/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ a/DT transition/NN from/IN a/DT ban/NN with/IN permit/NN reservation/NN to/TO a/DT permit/NN with/IN ban/NN reservation/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, we/PRP are/VBP making/VBG the/DT transition/NN from/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN banning/VBG to/TO that/DT of/IN misuse/NN ./.

Both/DT I/NN and/CC other/JJ MEPs/NNS utterly/RB reject/VBP such/PDT a/DT drastic/JJ change/NN of/IN system/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB accept/VB that/IN a/DT practical/JJ transposition/NN problem/NN should/MD give/VB rise/NN to/TO changing/VBG the/DT law/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD be/VB changing/VBG the/DT law/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP executable/VB again/RB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP consider/VBP to/TO be/VB unacceptable/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ giving/VBG up/RP its/PRP$ monopoly/NN on/IN exemptions/NNS ./.

Competition/NN restrictions/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB automatically/RB exempted/VBN against/IN the/DT background/NN of/IN this/DT planned/JJ system/NN of/IN legal/JJ exemption/NN ,/, insofar/RB as/IN the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN Article/NNP 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 3/CD -RRB-/-RRB- of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN European/NNP Union/NNP allow/VB ./.

The/DT requirement/NN to/TO lodge/VB applications/NNS in/IN Brussels/NNP will/MD be/VB dropped/VBN ;/: in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD be/VB completely/RB in/IN the/DT dark/NN in/IN future/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ programme/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB supplemented/VBN by/IN enhanced/JJ follow-up/NN supervision/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC Member/NNP States/NNPS '/POS courts/NNS ./.

But/CC if/IN this/DT takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN renationalisation/NN then/RB what/WP we/PRP will/MD have/VB here/RB is/VBZ a/DT patchwork/JJ quilt/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD weaken/VB a/DT key/JJ element/NN of/IN European/JJ policy/NN ./.

The/DT change/NN of/IN system/NN in/IN European/JJ monopolies/NNS law/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ contemplating/VBG is/VBZ high/JJ risk/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

There/EX are/VBP enough/JJ other/JJ options/NNS in/IN the/DT present/JJ system/NN to/TO safeguard/VB open/JJ markets/NNS and/CC free/JJ competition/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN refers/VBZ back/RP to/TO old/JJ proposals/NNS that/WDT were/VBD put/VBN forward/RB as/RB long/RB ago/RB as/IN the/DT fifties/NNS and/CC sixties/NNS ./.

There/EX was/VBD no/DT majority/NN for/IN this/DT at/IN the/DT time/NN ./.

Since/IN France/NNP laid/VBD a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN emphasis/NN on/IN legal/JJ exemption/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD damaged/VBN by/IN concessions/NNS in/IN agricultural/JJ policy/NN ./.

Forty/CD years/NNS on/IN ,/, this/DT proposal/NN has/VBZ again/RB been/VBN placed/VBN on/IN the/DT table/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP certain/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD create/VB room/NN for/IN manoeuvre/NN for/IN the/DT monopolies/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ consumers/NNS ./.

I/PRP consider/VBP this/DT to/TO be/VB unacceptable/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN this/DT important/JJ debate/NN on/IN competition/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP speaking/VBG this/DT morning/NN with/IN particular/JJ reference/NN to/TO Mr/NNP Langen/NNP '/POS s/JJ document/NN on/IN the/DT Steel/NNP Aid/NNP Code/NNP ./.

As/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP recognised/VBD in/IN 1996/CD ,/, the/DT steel/NN industry/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB sensitive/JJ to/TO competition-related/JJ disturbances/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, several/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ,/, this/DT was/VBD the/DT conclusion/NN of/IN a/DT report/NN that/IN I/PRP compiled/VBN on/IN the/DT strengths/NNS and/CC weaknesses/NNS of/IN the/DT European/JJ steel/NN sector/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP was/VBD justifiable/JJ to/TO set/VB up/RP a/DT system/NN of/IN aid/NN to/TO this/DT sector/NN with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN ensuring/VBG the/DT survival/NN of/IN successful/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, even/RB if/IN this/DT was/VBD in/IN contradiction/NN of/IN Article/NNP 4/CD of/IN the/DT ECSC/NNP Treaty/NNP ./.

This/DT indeed/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT sixth/JJ Steel/NNP Aid/NNP Code/NNP ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO avoid/VB any/DT infringement/NN of/IN the/DT conditions/NNS of/IN competition/NN and/CC any/DT serious/JJ disturbance/NN of/IN the/DT markets/NNS ,/, hence/RB the/DT importance/NN of/IN regulating/VBG such/JJ aid/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO continue/VB to/TO limit/VB state/NN aid/NN for/IN research/NN ,/, development/NN ,/, environmental/JJ protection/NN and/CC cases/NNS of/IN company/NN closure/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT same/JJ category/NN of/IN ideas/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ that/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS fulfil/VBP their/PRP$ obligation/NN to/TO be/VB accountable/JJ to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN the/DT aid/NN granted/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ steel/NN companies/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP suggests/VBZ shorter/JJR deadlines/NNS ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN this/DT request/NN ./.

Like/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, while/IN I/PRP am/VBP pleased/VBN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP report/NN ,/, nonetheless/RB I/PRP deplore/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB cover/VB all/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT aid/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT Steel/NNP Aid/NNP Code/NNP is/VBZ expressed/VBN in/IN a/DT very/RB clear/JJ way/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ authorised/VBN granting/VBG steel/NN companies/NNS aid/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT categories/NNS stipulated/VBD by/IN the/DT Code/NNP ./.

In/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN equality/NN ,/, either/RB the/DT Code/NNP must/MD be/VB applied/VBN or/CC it/PRP must/MD be/VB modified/VBN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB await/VBP ,/, and/CC I/PRP await/VBP ,/, the/DT European/JJ Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ proposals/NNS on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP also/RB going/VBG to/TO refer/VB to/TO the/DT report/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Langen/NNP ,/, which/WDT concerns/VBZ aid/NN to/TO the/DT steel/NN industry/NN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN two/CD issues/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP on/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO guarantee/VB equal/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN aid/NN to/TO all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC ,/, secondly/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN transparency/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT aid/NN ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN regarding/VBG his/PRP$ criticism/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, despite/IN the/DT rules/NNS laid/VBN down/RP in/IN the/DT sixth/JJ Steel/NNP Aid/NNP Code/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ frequently/RB authorised/VBN aid/NN to/TO companies/NNS which/WDT do/VBP not/RB correspond/VB to/TO the/DT categories/NNS in/IN that/DT Code/NNP ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT thing/NN that/WDT worries/VBZ us/PRP most/JJS ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT decrease/NN in/IN prices/NNS ,/, by/IN 30/CD %/NN ,/, owing/VBG to/TO imports/NNS ./.

The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT decrease/NN is/VBZ unfair/JJ competition/NN from/IN South/NNP Korea/NNP and/CC Taiwan/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN steel/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN their/PRP$ different/JJ working/JJ conditions/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS governing/VBG aid/NN ./.

Orders/NNS in/IN the/DT steel/NN industry/NN and/CC the/DT ship-building/JJ industry/NN -/: we/PRP also/RB spoke/VBD about/IN this/DT a/DT while/NN ago/RB -/: have/VBP decreased/VBN drastically/RB ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT loss/NN of/IN jobs/NNS ./.

I/PRP live/VBP in/IN a/DT region/NN where/WRB the/DT ship-building/JJ industry/NN now/RB has/VBZ very/RB serious/JJ problems/NNS :/: Asturias/NNP ./.

With/IN global/JJ markets/NNS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP global/JJ employment/NN laws/NNS and/CC global/JJ subsidies/NNS ./.

I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO achieve/VB now/RB ,/, but/CC if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB achieve/VB fair/JJ employment/NN laws/NNS for/IN all/DT workers/NNS ,/, here/RB and/CC elsewhere/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP do/VBP not/RB secure/VB equitable/JJ subsidies/NNS for/IN all/DT countries/NNS ,/, here/RB and/CC elsewhere/RB ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO preserve/VB jobs/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC outside/IN it/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, Director-General/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD particularly/RB like/VB to/TO emphasise/VB the/DT following/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT von/NNP Wogau/NNP report/NN :/: I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ open-minded/JJ endeavours/NNS to/TO initiate/VB debate/NN on/IN the/DT hitherto/JJ strict/JJ procedural/JJ rules/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO propose/VB practical/JJ reform/NN measures/NNS ./.

I/PRP congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN Karl/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP ,/, who/WP takes/VBZ up/RP the/DT theme/NN but/CC also/RB makes/VBZ quite/RB plain/JJ his/PRP$ demand/NN for/IN clarification/NN ,/, indicates/VBZ the/DT accompanying/VBG measures/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB taken/VBN ,/, and/CC pulls/VBZ no/DT punches/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT problems/NNS currently/RB under/IN discussion/NN ./.

Competition/NN policy/NN must/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB accorded/VBN central/JJ importance/NN and/CC will/MD not/RB be/VB renationalised/VBN because/IN this/DT would/MD jeopardise/VB the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC Europe/NNP as/IN a/DT business/NN location/NN in/IN a/DT global/JJ economy/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB ``/`` europeanised/JJ ''/'' taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN responsibility/NN is/VBZ to/TO fall/VB to/TO the/DT individual/NN ,/, without/IN the/DT Commission/NNP giving/VBG up/RP any/DT of/IN its/PRP$ responsibility/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP report/NN confirms/VBZ that/IN ,/, with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN Germany/NNP ,/, state/NN aid/NN to/TO businesses/NNS is/VBZ increasing/VBG ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP finds/VBZ this/DT worrying/VBG only/RB from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT conditions/NNS of/IN competition/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, we/PRP look/VBP at/IN things/NNS from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN the/DT working/VBG classes/NNS ./.

Society/NNP gains/VBZ nothing/NN from/IN these/DT massive/JJ transfers/NNS of/IN public/JJ funds/NNS to/TO private/JJ business/NN ./.

Take/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT car/NN manufacturing/VBG sector/NN ,/, where/WRB subsidies/NNS and/CC state/NN aid/NN of/IN various/JJ sorts/NNS have/VBP increased/VBN by/IN 24/CD %/NN during/IN the/DT reference/NN period/NN ./.

With/IN what/WDT aim/NN ?/.

Not/RB to/TO save/VB jobs/NNS ./.

All/PDT these/DT firms/NNS have/VBP gone/VBN ahead/RB with/IN job/NN cuts/NNS and/CC even/RB redundancies/NNS ./.

Not/RB to/TO improve/VB working/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, for/IN in/IN increasing/VBG production/NN with/IN fewer/JJR workers/NNS ,/, working/JJ conditions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN worse/RBR ./.

Did/VBD these/DT firms/NNS need/VB state/NN aid/NN to/TO survive/VB ?/.

No/UH ,/, car/NN manufacturers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN making/VBG colossal/JJ profits/NNS for/IN years/NNS ./.

State/NNP aid/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB counterproductive/JJ because/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT Jonckheer/NNP report/NN acknowledges/VBZ ,/, it/PRP gives/VBZ rise/NN to/TO subsidy/NN hunting/NN with/IN firms/NNS relocating/VBG from/IN one/CD country/NN to/TO another/DT ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ because/IN it/PRP allocates/VBZ public/JJ monies/NNS to/TO the/DT enrichment/NN of/IN a/DT handful/NN of/IN private/JJ shareholders/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ because/IN the/DT richest/JJS people/NNS are/VBP being/VBG favoured/VBN everywhere/RB with/IN state/NN money/NN that/IN throughout/IN Europe/NNP social/JJ protection/NN is/VBZ being/VBG reduced/VBN ,/, public/JJ services/NNS are/VBP being/VBG abandoned/VBN ,/, hospitals/NNS are/VBP being/VBG closed/VBN ./.

In/IN voting/VBG against/IN the/DT Jonckheer/NNP report/NN ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP to/TO assert/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN another/DT policy/NN ,/, to/TO wit/NN ,/, ceasing/VBG all/DT aid/NN to/TO private/JJ firms/NNS and/CC utilising/VBG the/DT money/NN thereby/RB saved/VBN to/TO develop/VB public/JJ services/NNS and/CC recruit/NN staff/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, today/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ because/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN competition/NN has/VBZ probably/RB been/VBN the/DT cornerstone/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

In/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, the/DT legislation/NN has/VBZ implemented/VBN Articles/NNPS 85/CD to/TO 94/CD ,/, competition/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT strict/JJ sense/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT revision/NN of/IN all/DT state/NN aid/NN and/CC tax/NN provisions/NNS which/WDT may/MD affect/VB competition/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, fiscal/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN an/DT indirect/JJ nature/NN and/CC recently/RB ,/, thanks/NNS to/TO Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN direct/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, the/DT code/NN of/IN good/JJ conduct/NN in/IN particular/JJ ./.

This/DT has/VBZ worked/VBN fairly/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC ,/, as/IN in/IN the/DT famous/JJ film/NN Casablanca/NNP `/`` time/NN goes/VBZ by/IN '/'' and/CC we/PRP must/MD adapt/VB the/DT legislation/NN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN applying/VBG until/IN now/RB to/TO the/DT new/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN I/PRP have/VBP observed/VBN a/DT significant/JJ consensus/NN in/IN all/PDT the/DT interventions/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ ,/, in/IN drawing/VBG up/RP the/DT legislation/NN ,/, to/TO produce/VB clear/JJ and/CC complete/JJ rules/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB horrendous/JJ ,/, especially/RB in/IN this/DT particular/JJ raft/NN of/IN legislation/NN ,/, that/IN there/EX are/VBP confused/VBN rules/NNS ,/, regulatory/JJ vacuums/NNS and/CC rules/NNS that/WDT only/RB lay/VBD down/RP undefined/JJ legal/JJ concepts/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ all/RB the/DT worse/JJR -/: as/IN is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT second/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT reform/NN -/: when/WRB responsibility/NN for/IN implementing/VBG the/DT legislation/NN lies/VBZ with/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP important/JJ that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD play/VB a/DT role/NN in/IN resisting/VBG the/DT temptation/NN to/TO create/VB independent/JJ agencies/NNS which/WDT would/MD distort/VB the/DT very/JJ essence/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO guarantee/VB uniform/JJ application/NN by/IN international/JJ bodies/NNS ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, and/NNP lastly/RB -/: and/CC this/DT has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN mentioned/VBN -/: the/DT international/JJ legal/JJ order/NN has/VBZ changed/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN this/DT in/IN the/DT aborted/JJ Seattle/NNP Conference/NNP and/CC we/PRP are/VBP now/RB seeing/VBG it/PRP in/IN the/DT bilateral/JJ conferences/NNS with/IN different/JJ regions/NNS or/CC countries/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

The/DT principle/NN of/IN competition/NN must/MD now/RB be/VB universal/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ application/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, there/RB is/VBZ much/JJ that/IN is/VBZ good/JJ in/IN Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN state/NN aid/NN for/IN manufacturing/VBG industry/NN and/CC certain/JJ other/JJ sectors/NNS ./.

First/NNP of/IN all/PDT the/DT report/NN reveals/VBZ Parliament/NNP '/POS s/VBZ single-minded/JJ determination/NN to/TO reduce/VB state/NN aid/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN functions/NNS flawlessly/VBP ./.

Many/JJ of/IN the/DT report/NN '/POS s/JJ conclusions/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, are/VBP cause/NN for/IN concern/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS for/IN our/PRP$ group/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT amount/NN and/CC level/NN of/IN state/NN aid/NN calculated/VBN on/IN a/DT per/IN capita/NN basis/NN vary/VBP considerably/RB from/IN Member/NNP State/NNP to/TO Member/NNP State/NNP reveals/VBZ the/DT need/NN for/IN surveys/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT ./.

Aid/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT self-seeking/JJ ambitions/NNS of/IN a/DT nation/NN gives/VBZ companies/NNS unfair/JJ advantages/NNS ,/, thus/RB distorting/VBG competition/NN and/CC leading/VBG to/TO an/DT ineffective/JJ ,/, uneconomic/JJ division/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ meagre/JJ resources/NNS ./.

The/DT form/NN the/DT aid/NN takes/VBZ is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

Forms/NNS of/IN state/NN aid/NN that/WDT require/VBP an/DT effort/NN from/IN the/DT beneficiary/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB supported/VBN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, state/NN guarantees/NNS ,/, on/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ just/RB publicised/VBN its/PRP$ position/NN ,/, must/MD naturally/RB be/VB considered/VBN state/NN aid/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, a/DT better/JJR option/NN than/IN granting/VBG aid/NN directly/RB to/TO companies/NNS ./.

The/DT report/NN on/IN competition/NN policy/NN further/RB stresses/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ confidence/NN in/IN hard/JJ and/CC fast/JJ rules/NNS instead/RB of/IN putting/VBG the/DT emphasis/NN on/IN economic/JJ arguments/NNS regarding/VBG efficiency/NN ,/, which/WDT affects/VBZ competitiveness/NN ./.

The/DT European/JJ economy/NN will/MD never/RB achieve/VB the/DT level/NN of/IN competitiveness/NN desired/VBD if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB show/VB we/PRP trust/NN in/IN the/DT markets/NNS ./.

If/IN competition/NN policy/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB made/VBN subordinate/JJ to/TO the/DT aims/NNS of/IN social/JJ and/CC environmental/JJ policy/NN ,/, real/JJ efficiency/NN and/CC economic/JJ growth/NN will/MD remain/VB just/RB a/DT dream/NN ./.

Competition/NN policy/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC it/PRP must/MD be/VB assessed/VBN with/IN reference/NN to/TO trade/VB policy/NN and/CC non-material/NN rights/NNS :/: we/PRP should/MD not/RB just/RB be/VB emphasising/VBG its/PRP$ social/JJ dimension/NN ./.

The/DT aims/NNS of/IN social/JJ policy/NN can/MD be/VB best/RBS realised/VBN through/IN stronger/JJR economic/JJ growth/NN ,/, not/RB by/IN making/VBG compromises/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO decisions/NNS on/IN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN also/RB emphasises/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT international/JJ dimension/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO competition/NN law/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB good/JJ if/IN we/PRP could/MD achieve/VB consensus/NN at/IN the/DT international/JJ level/NN regarding/VBG certain/JJ basic/JJ principles/NNS of/IN competition/NN law/NN ./.

Aiming/VBG instead/RB at/IN harmonised/JJ minimum/JJ standards/NNS will/MD easily/RB lead/VB to/TO a/DT situation/NN where/WRB we/PRP leap/VB over/IN the/DT lowest/JJS hurdle/NN and/CC end/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT lowest/JJS common/JJ denominator/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD water/VB down/RP all/PDT the/DT aims/NNS of/IN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Monti/NNP ,/, the/DT reform/NN of/IN competition/NN rules/NNS calls/VBZ for/IN a/DT commitment/NN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN the/DT light/NN and/CC as/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN changes/NNS which/WDT have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN through/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB with/IN a/DT forward-looking/JJ view/NN to/TO the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ enlargement/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP ,/, for/IN his/PRP$ commitment/NN and/CC I/PRP welcome/VBP his/PRP$ thoughts/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP appreciate/VBP the/DT remarks/NNS and/CC observations/NNS that/IN Professor/NNP Tesauro/NNP ,/, Chairman/NNP of/IN the/DT Italian/JJ Competition/NNP Authority/NNP ,/, sent/VBD me/PRP ,/, and/CC which/WDT I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ Mr/NNP Monti/NNP will/MD take/VB into/IN due/JJ account/NN with/IN a/DT strong/JJ sense/NN of/IN collaboration/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ real/JJ concern/NN is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB to/TO initiate/VB further/JJ liberalisation/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, above/RB all/RB ,/, to/TO achieve/VB consistency/NN between/IN the/DT different/JJ national/JJ markets/NNS ./.

As/IN things/NNS stand/VBP ,/, there/EX are/VBP considerable/JJ differences/NNS between/IN them/PRP which/WDT come/VBP to/TO the/DT fore/NN if/IN we/PRP compare/VBP the/DT English/NNP ,/, Italian/JJ and/CC French/JJ markets/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ degree/NN of/IN state/NN protectionism/NN in/IN the/DT French/JJ market/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB found/VBN in/IN the/DT English/JJ market/NN and/CC is/VBZ only/RB present/JJ to/TO an/DT extremely/RB limited/VBN extent/NN in/IN Italy/NNP ./.

Another/DT issue/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT economies/NNS of/IN countries/NNS involved/VBN in/IN enlargement/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD run/VB the/DT risk/NN of/IN remaining/VBG assisted/NN economies/NNS for/IN ever/RB more/JJR if/IN provision/NN is/VBZ not/RB made/VBN for/IN gradual/JJ adjustment/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD also/RB create/VB a/DT threshold/NN below/IN which/WDT two/CD significant/JJ components/NNS which/WDT characterise/VBP our/PRP$ economic/JJ structure/NN should/MD be/VB placed/VBN :/: small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, which/WDT bind/VBZ the/DT European/JJ economy/NN together/RB ,/, and/CC social/JJ protection/NN ,/, which/WDT Europe/NNP has/VBZ always/RB guaranteed/VBN to/TO the/DT weakest/JJS parts/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN ./.

Safeguarding/VBG the/DT social/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN is/VBZ what/WP makes/VBZ the/DT difference/NN between/IN free/JJ trade/NN ,/, pure/JJ and/CC simple/JJ ,/, and/CC a/DT system/NN for/IN improving/VBG people/NNS '/POS s/JJ quality/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

A/DT point/NN to/TO consider/VB regarding/VBG the/DT new/JJ rules/NNS concerns/VBZ the/DT economy/NN of/IN the/DT outermost/JJ regions/NNS and/CC islands/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT must/MD be/VB protected/VBN ./.

We/PRP ought/MD therefore/RB to/TO consider/VB creating/VBG two/CD focal/JJ points/NNS of/IN an/DT external/JJ market/NN by/IN instigating/VBG profitable/JJ relations/NNS with/IN Russia/NNP and/CC the/DT Mediterranean/NNP countries/NNS ,/, precisely/RB so/RB that/IN their/PRP$ economies/NNS become/VBP less/RBR peripheral/JJ ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP -/: and/CC I/PRP thank/VBP Mr/NNP Monti/NNP for/IN this/DT -/: that/IN the/DT new/JJ rules/NNS will/MD reflect/VB as/IN many/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN economic/JJ policy/NN as/RB possible/JJ and/CC that/IN their/PRP$ social/JJ function/NN will/MD be/VB guaranteed/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, competition/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ internal/JJ market/NN policy/NN and/CC is/VBZ also/RB its/PRP$ driving/JJ force/NN ./.

A/DT free/JJ and/CC open/JJ market/NN can/MD only/RB exist/VB by/IN the/DT grace/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, marked/VBN by/IN clear/JJ ,/, uniform/JJ rules/NNS ./.

In/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ,/, Karl/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP manages/VBZ to/TO capture/VB this/DT very/RB well/RB ./.

But/CC Europe/NNP is/VBZ changing/VBG ./.

The/DT economies/NNS are/VBP growing/VBG ,/, we/PRP are/VBP enlarging/VBG to/TO 25-30/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP will/MD become/VB overburdened/JJ if/IN it/PRP pursues/VBZ its/PRP$ current/JJ policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO modernise/VB competition/NN policy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN question/NN ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD this/DT ,/, I/PRP still/RB have/VBP concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT proposed/VBN decentralisation/NN ./.

How/WRB will/MD the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, as/RB keeper/NN of/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ,/, guarantee/VB that/IN decisions/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN uniformly/RB in/IN matters/NNS of/IN competition/NN in/IN London/NNP ,/, Palermo/NNP ,/, Helsinki/NNP and/CC ,/, soon/RB ,/, Budapest/NNP and/CC Ankara/NNP ?/.

This/DT is/VBZ necessary/JJ if/IN legal/JJ inequality/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB prevented/VBN ,/, and/CC issues/NNS of/IN competition/NN will/MD gravitate/VB towards/IN the/DT court/NN where/WRB the/DT most/RBS lenient/JJ judgements/NNS are/VBP given/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ already/RB 40/CD years/NNS '/'' worth/JJ of/IN experience/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, the/DT competition/NN authority/NN is/VBZ still/RB in/IN its/PRP$ infancy/NN ./.

This/DT country/NN has/VBZ a/DT very/RB small/JJ market/NN which/WDT ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, is/VBZ often/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN defined/VBN as/IN the/DT relevant/JJ market/NN ./.

This/DT in/IN contrast/NN to/TO Germany/NNP ,/, where/WRB a/DT very/RB experienced/VBN Kartellamt/NNP is/VBZ exercising/VBG its/PRP$ powers/NNS within/IN a/DT gigantic/JJ market/NN ./.

The/DT European/JJ Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ belief/NN that/WDT ,/, in/IN all/DT quarters/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, legislation/NN will/MD ,/, almost/RB as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB interpreted/VBN in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ,/, is/VBZ what/WP ,/, within/IN catholic/JJ circles/NNS ,/, we/VBP term/NN ``/`` foolhardy/VBZ ,/, ''/'' and/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB allowed/VBN ./.

Uniformity/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB worked/VBN on/RP ./.

Think/VB of/IN specialist/NN ,/, national/JJ courts/NNS with/IN the/DT option/NN of/IN direct/JJ appeal/NN to/TO a/DT special/JJ competition/NN court/NN at/IN the/DT European/NNP Court/NNP ./.

This/DT special/JJ court/NN in/IN Luxembourg/NNP is/VBZ necessary/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO build/VB up/RP broad/JJ expertise/NN ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, due/JJ to/TO the/DT immense/JJ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ interests/NNS involved/VBN ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB afford/VB to/TO wait/VB for/IN a/DT judgement/NN to/TO be/VB pronounced/VBN two/CD years/NNS after/IN the/DT event/NN ,/, as/IN is/VBZ now/RB quite/RB normal/JJ ./.

What/WP is/VBZ the/DT Commissioner/NNP '/POS s/JJ opinion/NN of/IN this/DT ?/.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO finish/VB off/RP by/IN making/VBG an/DT important/JJ point/NN for/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO grant/VB small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ companies/NNS greater/JJR security/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP itself/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO draw/VB up/RP an/DT exemption/NN regulation/NN for/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS so/RB that/DT ,/, alongside/IN vertical/JJ exemptions/NNS ,/, horizontal/JJ exemptions/NNS will/MD also/RB be/VB possible/JJ ./.

Through/IN cooperation/NN ,/, small/JJ ,/, independent/JJ firms/NNS must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO stand/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT large/JJ chains/NNS ./.

It/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT aim/NN of/IN European/JJ competition/NN policy/NN to/TO make/VB life/NN impossible/JJ for/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, regarding/VBG these/DT small/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO consider/VB whether/IN it/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB better/JJR to/TO apply/VB a/DT system/NN with/IN a/DT prior/JJ warning/NN built/VBN in/IN ,/, the/DT yellow/JJ card/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN an/DT immediate/JJ red/JJ card/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB a/DT large/JJ fine/NN and/CC will/MD threaten/VB the/DT company/NN '/POS s/JJ very/JJ existence/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT belong/VBP on/IN the/DT same/JJ boat/NN and/CC want/VBP to/TO row/VB with/IN you/PRP ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB believe/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB absolutely/RB necessary/JJ to/TO establish/VB an/DT interinstitutional/JJ dialogue/NN so/RB that/IN we/PRP might/MD reach/VB a/DT good/JJ conclusion/NN and/CC put/VB all/PDT the/DT finishing/JJ touches/NNS to/TO this/DT essential/JJ reform/NN ./.

The/DT many/JJ ideas/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN expressed/VBN here/RB could/MD be/VB put/VBN into/IN three/CD broad/JJ categories/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT concern/NN that/IN some/DT have/VBP expressed/VBN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ Mrs/NNP Randzio-Plath/NNP ,/, President/NNP of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, of/IN whether/IN this/DT new/JJ system/NN of/IN legal/JJ exception/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB compatible/JJ with/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ./.

I/PRP share/VBP that/DT concern/NN and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT issue/NN should/MD be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT issue/NN of/IN companies/NNS '/POS legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT machine/NN for/IN manufacturing/VBG legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT agree/VBP on/IN this/DT ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB true/JJ -/: and/CC this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN repeated/VBN from/IN all/DT sections/NNS of/IN this/DT House/NNP -/: that/IN the/DT European/JJ industrial/JJ fabric/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP often/RB plays/VBZ the/DT role/NN of/IN auctoritas/NNS ,/, of/IN legitimising/VBG the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

On/IN this/DT point/NN I/PRP will/MD give/VB my/PRP$ opinion/NN on/IN something/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Karas/NNP said/VBD ./.

There/EX have/VBP only/RB been/VBN nine/CD rejections/NNS ./.

But/CC here/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO call/VB on/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN as/IN a/DT lawyer/NN ./.

How/WRB often/RB has/VBZ a/DT lawyer/NN with/IN two/CD companies/NNS and/CC one/CD project/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DT Commission/NNP guideline/NN given/VBN ex/FW ante/FW ,/, changed/VBD that/DT project/NN in/IN order/NN for/IN it/PRP to/TO comply/VB with/IN the/DT competition/NN rules/NNS !/. ./.

This/DT is/VBZ therefore/RB an/DT aspect/NN to/TO be/VB considered/VBN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT uniform/JJ application/NN of/IN Community/NNP law/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, the/DT excellent/JJ speech/NN by/IN Mrs/NNP Thyssen/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB improved/VBN upon/RB ./.

In/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ,/, this/DT damage/NN and/CC these/DT tragedies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP happening/VBG ,/, as/RB in/IN Romania/NNP ,/, are/VBP not/RB the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT legislative/JJ ,/, but/CC of/IN the/DT executive/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT governments/NNS ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT fair/JJ directive/NN because/IN it/PRP ignores/VBZ the/DT large/JJ uninhabited/JJ areas/NNS ,/, climatic/JJ diversity/NN ,/, desert/NN areas/NNS and/CC arid/JJ areas/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ how/WRB the/DT common/JJ position/NN has/VBZ been/VBN worded/VBN ./.

The/DT same/JJ can/MD be/VB said/VBN with/IN regard/NN to/TO transfers/NNS ./.

Transfers/NNS are/VBP an/DT example/NN of/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN wealth/NN ,/, of/IN solidarity/NN between/IN peoples/NNS and/CC territories/NNS ,/, because/IN unfortunately/RB the/DT Earth/NN is/VBZ not/RB perfect/JJ and/CC some/DT areas/NNS have/VBP more/JJR and/CC some/DT have/VBP less/JJR ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP highly/RB critical/JJ of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT directive/NN is/VBZ not/RB accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT study/NN of/IN its/PRP$ impact/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB easy/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO demand/VB that/IN others/NNS assess/VBP its/PRP$ impact/NN but/CC ,/, on/IN environmental/JJ questions/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD demand/VB it/PRP of/IN ourselves/PRP and/CC consider/VB how/WRB many/JJ people/NNS ,/, how/WRB many/JJ farmers/NNS ,/, could/MD be/VB ruined/VBN by/IN having/VBG to/TO pay/VB the/DT costs/NNS ./.

Some/DT kind/NN of/IN study/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB even/RB been/VBN read/VBN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP should/MD carry/VB out/RP impact/NN studies/NNS by/IN way/NN of/IN good/JJ political/JJ practice/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN just/RB laying/VBG down/RP doctrine/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, through/IN the/DT consolidation/NN of/IN existing/VBG directives/NNS this/DT framework/NN directive/NN establishes/VBZ the/DT basic/JJ principle/NN of/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ water/NN policy/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT framework/NN for/IN the/DT protection/NN and/CC management/NN of/IN our/PRP$ water/NN -/: surface/NN ,/, ground/NN ,/, transitional/JJ and/CC coastal/JJ -/: through/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN river/NN basin/NN districts/NNS at/IN national/JJ and/CC ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ case/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP ,/, cross-border/JJ level/NN ./.

Ireland/NNP is/VBZ very/RB supportive/JJ of/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN and/CC many/JJ of/IN the/DT European/JJ Parliament/NNP amendments/NNS ./.

A/DT 25-year/JJ roll-out/NN for/IN legislation/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, is/VBZ hardly/RB acceptable/JJ ./.

We/PRP have/VBP no/DT difficulty/NN with/IN the/DT ``/`` polluter/NN pays/VBZ ''/'' principle/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT recovery/NN of/IN costs/NNS on/IN water/NN usage/NN at/IN industrial/JJ ,/, commercial/JJ and/CC agricultural/JJ level/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP very/RB strongly/RB that/IN as/IN water/NN is/VBZ life/NN and/CC access/NN to/TO clean/VB drinking/NN water/NN is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ human/JJ right/NN ,/, this/DT directive/NN must/MD allow/VB for/IN a/DT basic/JJ domestic/JJ water/NN provision/NN free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ,/, a/DT quota/NN per/IN household/NN for/IN drinking/NN ,/, cooking/NN and/CC sanitation/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD of/IN course/NN pay/VB for/IN wastage/NN and/CC luxury/NN use/NN at/IN domestic/JJ level/NN and/CC the/DT recovery/NN of/IN costs/NNS can/MD be/VB balanced/VBN accordingly/RB ./.

The/DT introduction/NN of/IN water/NN meters/NNS is/VBZ viewed/VBN with/IN great/JJ suspicion/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP where/WRB we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN no/DT domestic/JJ water/NN charges/NNS and/CC hence/RB no/DT meters/NNS since/IN 1977/CD ./.

Meters/NNS could/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT very/RB important/JJ tool/NN in/IN water/NN management/NN by/IN the/DT new/JJ river/NN basin/NN districts/NNS ,/, to/TO help/VB the/DT elimination/NN of/IN water/NN wastage/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT proper/JJ planning/NN of/IN future/JJ requirements/NNS ./.

The/DT whole/JJ purpose/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ to/TO promote/VB sustainable/JJ use/NN of/IN water/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ a/DT scarce/JJ and/CC precious/JJ natural/JJ resource/NN ./.

Ideally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 45/CD to/TO fall/VB tomorrow/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN on/IN Article/NNP 9/CD would/MD hold/VB on/IN water/NN charges/NNS ./.

That/DT would/MD allow/VB for/IN subsidiarity/NN on/IN a/DT cost/NN policy/NN for/IN water/NN charges/NNS ,/, with/IN each/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS drawing/VBG up/RP its/PRP$ own/JJ scheme/NN ,/, so/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT principles/NNS of/IN this/DT directive/NN on/IN incentives/NNS for/IN sustainable/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ use/NN of/IN water/NN are/VBP fully/RB protected/VBN ./.

All/DT legislation/NN must/MD be/VB enforceable/JJ and/CC be/VB based/VBN on/IN the/DT general/JJ principle/NN of/IN political/JJ acceptance/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN access/NN to/TO clean/VB drinking/NN water/NN without/IN charge/NN is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ human/JJ right/NN in/IN the/DT developed/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT developing/JJ world/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, at/IN this/DT point/NN in/IN the/DT debate/NN I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO insist/VB on/IN certain/JJ aspects/NNS which/WDT ,/, from/IN an/DT agronomic/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, and/CC since/IN I/PRP come/VBP from/IN a/DT southern/JJ country/NN ,/, I/PRP consider/VBP to/TO be/VB absolutely/RB essential/JJ to/TO this/DT directive/NN ./.

These/DT include/VBP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, costs/NNS and/CC transfers/NNS ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO costs/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB clarification/NN of/IN what/WP costs/VBZ we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

Are/VBP we/PRP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT distribution/NN and/CC sourcing/VBG of/IN water/NN ?/.

Are/VBP we/PRP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT distribution/NN networks/NNS ?/.

Or/WP are/VBP we/PRP talking/VBG about/IN large-scale/JJ hydraulic/JJ works/NNS and/CC reservoirs/NNS ?/.

All/PDT these/DT costs/NNS added/VBD together/RB would/MD be/VB horrendous/JJ and/CC would/MD have/VB repercussions/NNS for/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ./.

Transfers/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN as/IN the/DT transfer/NN of/IN surface/NN water/NN between/IN different/JJ territorial/JJ areas/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ the/DT Commissioner/NNP aware/JJ that/IN our/PRP$ country/NN has/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT oldest/JJS systems/NNS of/IN transfers/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ?/.

They/PRP already/RB existed/VBD in/IN ancient/JJ times/NNS :/: they/PRP had/VBD them/PRP in/IN Roman/JJ times/NNS ,/, although/IN on/IN a/DT smaller/JJR scale/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS significant/JJ transfers/NNS -/: the/DT Tajo-Segura/JJ transfer/NN -/: which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN use/NN for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ,/, almost/RB 30/CD years/NNS ,/, has/VBZ an/DT allowance/NN of/IN 658/CD hm3/NNS per/IN year/NN ./.

The/DT largest/JJS volume/NN transferred/VBN in/IN one/CD year/NN has/VBZ been/VBN 453/CD and/CC the/DT average/JJ volume/NN over/IN twenty/CD years/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN over/IN 200/CD ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB accused/VBN of/IN bad/JJ management/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB doing/VBG a/DT bad/JJ job/NN of/IN management/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB prohibited/VBN from/IN carrying/VBG out/RP transfers/NNS when/WRB our/PRP$ economy/NN and/CC the/DT development/NN of/IN our/PRP$ regions/NNS depend/VBP on/IN it/PRP ./.

I/PRP will/MD not/RB tackle/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN quality/NN and/CC the/DT best/JJS available/JJ technologies/NNS ,/, because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP will/MD return/VB to/TO a/DT discussion/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN ./.

Take/VB good/JJ note/NN :/: in/IN this/DT diverse/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP building/VBG in/IN a/DT spirit/NN of/IN mutual/JJ cooperation/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO find/VB diverse/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, not/RB single/JJ solutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB appeal/VBP to/TO the/DT common/JJ sense/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, the/DT Council/NNP and/CC this/DT House/NNP so/RB that/IN ,/, when/WRB voting/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VBP not/RB impose/VB uniformity/NN on/IN the/DT different/JJ countries/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP in/IN areas/NNS where/WRB subsidiarity/NN is/VBZ required/VBN ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, Andalusia/NNP is/VBZ not/RB Lapland/JJ ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- SV/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP want/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, to/TO begin/VB by/IN thanking/VBG the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP for/IN the/DT ambitious/JJ and/CC constructive/JJ work/NN she/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN into/IN the/DT present/JJ framework/NN water/NN directive/NN ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ natural/JJ resources/NNS ,/, as/IN many/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP already/RB said/VBN ./.

An/DT ambitious/JJ and/CC well-balanced/JJ European/JJ policy/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ component/NN of/IN guaranteed/VBN sustainable/JJ development/NN for/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Water/NNP is/VBZ also/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT issues/NNS to/TO which/WDT I/PRP shall/MD be/VB devoting/VBG particular/JJ attention/NN during/IN my/PRP$ term/NN of/IN office/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN agreement/NN which/WDT permeates/VBZ the/DT amendments/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN submitted/VBN to/TO Parliament/NNP ./.

Many/JJ of/IN them/PRP are/VBP based/VBN upon/IN the/DT very/RB constructive/JJ ,/, informal/JJ discussions/NNS which/WDT have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN between/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN ./.

Most/JJS of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposed/VBN amendments/NNS help/VBP improve/VB the/DT text/NN and/CC make/VB it/PRP more/RBR ambitious/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD approve/VB 72/CD of/IN the/DT 108/CD amendments/NNS ,/, either/CC in/IN their/PRP$ entirety/NN ,/, partially/RB or/CC in/IN principle/NN ./.

Many/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ submitted/VBN show/VBP that/IN reconciliation/NN will/MD be/VB necessary/JJ ./.

With/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO these/DT forthcoming/JJ negotiations/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB urge/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN an/DT ambitious/JJ position/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB some/DT of/IN my/PRP$ most/RBS important/JJ arguments/NNS ./.

We/PRP now/RB have/VBP the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO put/VB into/IN practice/NN those/DT measures/NNS to/TO which/WDT we/PRP agreed/VBD under/IN the/DT OSPAR/NNP Convention/NNP ./.

Rather/RB than/IN make/VBP these/DT objectives/NNS legally/RB binding/JJ ,/, we/PRP must/MD consider/VB their/PRP$ political/JJ nature/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB reflected/VBN in/IN many/JJ of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

Where/WRB water/NN charges/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, the/DT present/JJ directive/NN will/MD constitute/VB Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ water/NN policy/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD decades/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ duty/NN to/TO ensure/VB from/IN the/DT very/JJ start/NN that/IN the/DT present/JJ directive/NN provides/VBZ the/DT right/JJ incentives/NNS and/CC the/DT proper/JJ driving/VBG force/NN for/IN a/DT pricing/NN system/NN and/CC an/DT efficient/JJ structure/NN of/IN charges/NNS which/WDT will/MD improve/VB our/PRP$ environment/NN in/IN a/DT cost-effective/JJ way/NN ./.

It/PRP sounds/VBZ good/JJ ,/, saying/VBG that/IN access/NN to/TO water/NN should/MD be/VB a/DT human/JJ right/NN and/CC ought/VBG to/TO be/VB free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ./.

But/CC water/NN is/VBZ not/RB free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ,/, any/DT more/RBR than/IN houses/NNS or/CC food/NN are/VBP free/JJ of/IN charge/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB by/IN means/NNS of/IN efficient/JJ instruments/NNS of/IN control/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD arrive/VB at/IN a/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT water/NN is/VBZ better/RBR managed/VBN and/CC more/RBR carefully/RB husbanded/JJ as/IN a/DT resource/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO add/VB that/IN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO groundwater/NN and/CC to/TO water/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN heavily/RB modified/VBN by/IN human/JJ activities/NNS ,/, I/PRP support/VBP a/DT tighter/JJR timetable/NN and/CC a/DT clarification/NN of/IN goals/NNS and/CC of/IN criteria/NNS for/IN allowing/VBG exceptions/NNS to/TO the/DT rules/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB support/VBP expressly/RB mentioning/VBG radioactive/JJ substances/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, many/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP pointed/VBN out/IN how/WRB important/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO consult/VB the/DT general/JJ public/NN and/CC keep/VB them/PRP informed/JJ ./.

I/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB this/DT further/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB crucial/JJ that/IN we/PRP involve/VBP the/DT general/JJ public/NN by/IN keeping/VBG them/PRP well/RB informed/JJ and/CC by/IN proceeding/VBG to/TO consult/VB them/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB expressed/VBN in/IN Recital/NNP 14/CD ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP also/RB to/TO say/VB to/TO Mr/NNP Bowe/NNP that/IN ,/, in/IN common/JJ with/IN my/PRP$ Scottish/JJ colleague/NN ,/, he/PRP need/MD have/VB no/DT pangs/NNS of/IN conscience/NN about/IN continuing/VBG to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT glass/NN of/IN Scotch/NNP whisky/NNP now/RB and/CC again/RB ./.

We/PRP have/VBP not/RB considered/VBN it/PRP necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO regulate/VB the/DT very/RB limited/JJ abstraction/NN of/IN water/NN for/IN whisky/NN production/NN ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP now/RB to/TO comment/VB on/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT areas/NNS in/IN a/DT little/RB more/JJR detail/NN ./.

Limiting/VBG discharges/NNS of/IN hazardous/JJ substances/NNS into/IN our/PRP$ waters/NNS must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendments/NNS have/VBP focused/VBN upon/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP fully/RB supports/VBZ the/DT proposal/NN to/TO introduce/VB the/DT commitments/NNS under/IN the/DT OSPAR/NNP Convention/NNP into/IN the/DT text/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, keep/VB to/TO their/PRP$ precise/JJ scope/NN and/CC content/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, their/PRP$ purpose/NN and/CC the/DT timetable/NN for/IN implementing/VBG them/PRP are/VBP political/JJ in/IN character/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB in/IN keeping/VBG with/IN this/DT to/TO introduce/VB a/DT legally/RB binding/JJ timetable/NN ./.

It/PRP must/MD nonetheless/RB be/VB guaranteed/VBN that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT Community/NNP are/VBP compelled/VBN to/TO take/VB measures/NNS to/TO achieve/VB the/DT relevant/JJ goals/NNS and/CC comply/VB with/IN the/DT timetables/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB welcome/VBP Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 6/CD ,/, 10/CD ,/, 14/CD ,/, 24/CD ,/, 58/CD ,/, 60/CD and/CC 88/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD not/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, approve/VBP Amendment/NNP No/DT 19/CD ,/, in/IN which/WDT hazardous/JJ substances/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN differently/RB than/IN in/IN OSPAR/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ procedure/NN for/IN selecting/VBG substances/NNS ,/, and/CC so/IN no/DT definition/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN ./.

Even/RB if/IN I/PRP too/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT contents/NNS of/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 79/CD and/CC 106/CD ,/, these/DT go/VBP beyond/IN the/DT commitments/NNS under/IN OSPAR/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP can/MD not/RB therefore/RB approve/VB these/DT Amendments/NNPS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD also/RB ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, approve/VB Amendment/NNP No/RB 60/CD ,/, according/VBG to/TO which/WDT a/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ required/VBN for/IN implementing/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN to/TO limit/VB discharges/NNS of/IN prioritised/JJ substances/NNS ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 59/CD introduces/VBZ requirements/NNS to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN prioritised/JJ substances/NNS should/MD continually/RB be/VB reviewed/VBN ./.

This/DT would/MD involve/VB legal/JJ uncertainty/NN as/IN to/TO the/DT status/NN of/IN the/DT list/NN and/CC can/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB approved/VBN ./.

The/DT desire/NN expressed/VBD in/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 60/CD and/CC 93/CD for/IN a/DT list/NN of/IN goals/NNS and/CC a/DT list/NN of/IN substances/NNS for/IN which/WDT no/DT adequate/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ available/JJ can/MD not/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

Lists/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB clear/JJ legal/JJ status/NN and/CC do/VBP not/RB fit/VB in/IN with/IN the/DT procedures/NNS for/IN adopting/VBG the/DT list/NN of/IN prioritised/JJ substances/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD point/VB out/RP in/IN this/DT regard/NN that/IN the/DT OSPAR/NNP Convention/NNP does/VBZ not/RB in/IN any/DT way/NN alter/VB existing/VBG Community/NNP legislation/NN concerning/VBG nitrates/NN from/IN the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ./.

The/DT Nitrates/NNP Directive/NNP will/MD not/RB therefore/RB be/VB influenced/VBN by/IN the/DT present/JJ framework/NN directive/NN ./.

I/PRP appreciate/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ proved/VBN to/TO be/VB flexible/JJ over/IN the/DT very/RB sensitive/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ question/NN of/IN imposing/VBG charges/NNS for/IN water/NN services/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD wholeheartedly/RB support/VB the/DT demand/NN that/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN water/NN should/MD be/VB set/VBN at/IN a/DT level/NN which/WDT creates/VBZ incentives/NNS to/TO use/VB water/NN resources/NNS in/IN a/DT sustainable/JJ way/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB support/VBP the/DT demand/NN for/IN a/DT suitable/JJ contribution/NN from/IN each/DT sector/NN to/TO cover/VB own/JJ costs/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD therefore/RB partly/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN principle/NN ,/, approve/VB Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 43-46/NNP ,/, together/RB with/IN Amendment/NNP No/RB 85/CD ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP legally/RB binding/JJ requirements/NNS stating/VBG that/IN the/DT financial/JJ costs/NNS of/IN water/NN services/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB covered/VBN by/IN each/DT economic/JJ sector/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD constitute/VB a/DT clear/JJ goal/NN against/IN which/WDT progress/NN could/MD be/VB measured/VBN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB support/VBP the/DT overall/JJ thrust/NN of/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 105/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ original/JJ proposal/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB support/VBP a/DT gradual/JJ development/NN in/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN covering/VBG environmental/JJ costs/NNS and/CC the/DT costs/NNS of/IN resources/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC water/NN services/NNS is/VBZ a/DT complicated/JJ issue/NN and/CC that/IN account/NN must/MD be/VB taken/VBN not/RB only/JJ of/IN environmental/JJ goals/NNS but/CC also/RB of/IN social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ goals/NNS ./.

This/DT must/MD not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, be/VB an/DT excuse/NN for/IN subsidising/VBG inefficient/JJ economic/JJ sectors/NNS which/WDT cause/VBP pollution/NN ./.

We/PRP intend/VBP shortly/RB to/TO issue/VB a/DT communication/NN from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN precisely/RB this/DT question/NN ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN Parliament/NNP that/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN '/'' s/VBZ sixteen-year/JJ timeframe/NN for/IN implementing/VBG these/DT measures/NNS must/MD be/VB considerably/RB reduced/VBN ./.

The/DT same/JJ also/RB applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT possibility/NN which/WDT exists/VBZ of/IN extending/VBG the/DT period/NN of/IN implementation/NN by/IN a/DT further/JJ eighteen/NN years/NNS ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 28/CD ,/, cancelling/VBG the/DT third/JJ extension/NN period/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ step/NN in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction/NN ./.

This/DT proposal/NN can/MD therefore/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

A/DT period/NN of/IN ten/CD years/NNS ,/, as/IN proposed/VBD in/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 24/CD and/CC 26/CD ,/, among/IN others/NNS ,/, is/VBZ ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, too/RB short/JJ ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN consideration/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO wording/VB the/DT overall/JJ definition/NN of/IN the/DT requirements/NNS under/IN the/DT proposal/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN it/PRP includes/VBZ a/DT strict/JJ and/CC explicit/JJ condition/NN to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN causing/VBG deterioration/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN must/MD be/VB avoided/VBN ./.

The/DT proposal/NN must/MD also/RB include/VB more/RBR stringent/JJ criteria/NNS for/IN establishing/VBG lesser/JJR environmental/JJ objectives/NNS and/CC for/IN extending/VBG deadlines/NNS in/IN connection/NN with/IN heavily/RB modified/VBN or/CC artificial/JJ bodies/NNS of/IN water/NN ./.

This/DT applies/VBZ to/TO Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 6/CD ,/, 24/CD ,/, 25/CD ,/, 27/CD ,/, 30/CD ,/, 31/CD ,/, 32/CD ,/, 33/CD ,/, 34/CD ,/, 78/CD ,/, 80/CD ,/, 102/CD and/CC 104/CD ./.

These/DT Amendments/NNPS may/MD in/IN large/JJ part/NN be/VB approved/VBN and/CC will/MD be/VB supported/VBN until/IN such/JJ time/NN as/IN an/DT overall/JJ solution/NN can/MD be/VB found/VBN ./.

To/TO comply/VB with/IN the/DT demands/NNS in/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 27/CD and/CC 29/CD ,/, to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD approve/VB every/DT extension/NN ,/, would/MD be/VB going/VBG too/RB far/RB ,/, and/CC these/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

Another/DT important/JJ area/NN is/VBZ protection/NN of/IN the/DT groundwater/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP both/PDT a/DT starting/JJ point/NN and/CC a/DT final/JJ goal/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO reverse/VB the/DT upward/JJ trend/NN in/IN pollution/NN ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP stricter/JJR criteria/NNS for/IN interpreting/VBG the/DT results/NNS of/IN any/DT monitoring/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS important/JJ parts/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/VBZ Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 25/CD and/CC 73/CD can/MD therefore/RB be/VB approved/VBN in/IN principle/NN ./.

The/DT new/JJ definition/NN in/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 72/CD is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, too/RB strict/JJ and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB applied/VBN for/IN this/DT purpose/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD propose/VB that/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 92/NNP should/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN into/IN a/DT broader/JJR solution/NN ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 71/CD does/VBZ not/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN seasonal/JJ variations/NNS and/CC annual/JJ changes/NNS in/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN the/DT groundwater/NN ./.

The/DT proposal/NN can/MD not/RB therefore/RB be/VB approved/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP considers/VBZ it/PRP unrealistic/JJ and/CC unnecessary/JJ to/TO lay/VB down/RP standards/NNS guaranteeing/VBG that/IN the/DT least/JJS intensive/JJ water/NN purification/NN is/VBZ adequate/JJ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN surface/NN water/NN is/VBZ of/IN drinking/VBG water/NN quality/NN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, we/PRP prefer/VBP an/DT addition/NN to/TO those/DT measures/NNS which/WDT are/VBP required/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN Article/NNP 11/CD to/TO promote/VB activities/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

The/DT good/JJ status/NN which/WDT is/VBZ required/VBN under/IN this/DT proposal/NN ought/MD to/TO guarantee/VB that/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN surface/NN water/NN of/IN good/JJ quality/NN is/VBZ fulfilled/VBN ./.

This/DT part/NN of/IN Amendment/NNP No/NNP 41/CD can/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB approved/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP appreciates/VBZ Parliament/NNP '/POS s/VBZ efforts/NNS to/TO guarantee/VB that/IN the/DT so-called/JJ combined/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ given/VBN a/DT central/JJ role/NN ./.

This/DT approach/NN and/CC its/PRP$ scope/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP can/MD in/IN principle/NN approve/VB ,/, are/VBP defined/VBN by/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 22/CD and/CC 47/CD ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ legal/JJ clarity/NN and/CC proportionality/NN ,/, we/PRP wish/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO reformulate/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 47/CD and/CC to/TO add/VB a/DT de/NNP minimis/NNS provision/NN ./.

The/DT transfer/NN of/IN water/NN is/VBZ already/RB covered/VBN by/IN controls/NNS ,/, but/CC explicitly/RB mentioning/VBG it/PRP makes/VBZ the/DT text/NN clearer/JJR ./.

These/DT parts/NNS of/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 49/CD and/CC 87/CD can/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB approved/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ nonetheless/RB unnecessary/JJ to/TO make/VB it/PRP a/DT condition/NN that/IN all/PDT the/DT measures/NNS for/IN controlling/JJ demand/NN should/MD be/VB adopted/VBN ./.

The/DT proposal/NN already/RB specifies/VBZ that/IN water/NN must/MD be/VB abstracted/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT ecological/JJ needs/NNS in/IN the/DT river/NN basin/NN district/NN concerned/VBN ./.

These/DT parts/NNS of/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 49/CD and/CC 87/CD can/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB approved/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP approves/VBZ Amendment/NNP No/NNP 76/CD to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN radioactive/JJ substances/NNS are/VBP explicitly/RB to/TO be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT proposal/NN ./.

To/TO summarise/VB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO approve/VB 72/CD amendments/NNS ,/, either/CC in/IN their/PRP$ entirety/NN ,/, partially/RB or/CC in/IN principle/NN ./.

The/DT following/JJ amendments/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB approved/VBN :/: 1/CD ,/, 4/CD ,/, 9/CD ,/, 11/CD ,/, 13/CD ,/, 15/CD ,/, 19/CD ,/, 23/CD ,/, 39/CD ,/, 40/CD ,/, 51/CD ,/, 59/CD ,/, 61/CD ,/, 64/CD ,/, 66/CD ,/, 70/CD ,/, 71/CD ,/, 71/CD ,/, 72/CD ,/, 74/CD ,/, 77/CD ,/, 79/CD ,/, 81/CD ,/, 83/CD ,/, 87/CD ,/, 89/CD ,/, 90/CD ,/, 91/CD ,/, 95/CD ,/, 97/CD ,/, 98/CD ,/, 100/CD ,/, 101/CD ,/, 103/CD ,/, 106/CD and/CC 107/JJ ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP welcome/VBP the/DT efforts/NNS which/WDT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN to/TO try/VB to/TO solve/VB the/DT questions/NNS on/IN which/WDT the/DT Council/NNP takes/VBZ other/JJ views/NNS ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mrs/NNP Wallstr脙/NNP 露/NNP m/VBP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP already/RB had/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN ,/, to/TO examine/VB this/DT report/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD given/VBN to/TO believe/VB in/IN committee/NN that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT broad/JJ consensus/NN within/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP spoke/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN breaking/VBG down/RP the/DT budget/NN ,/, the/DT allocation/NN of/IN funds/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, into/IN the/DT different/JJ types/NNS of/IN measure/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP opposed/VBD concentrating/VBG heavily/RB on/IN large/JJ networks/NNS and/CC network/NN structures/NNS ,/, because/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO promote/VB the/DT small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ entities/NNS and/CC activities/NNS performed/VBN by/IN individuals/NNS ;/: because/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB thousands/NNS of/IN flowers/NNS bloom/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO second/JJ what/WP the/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN had/VBD to/TO say/VB ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT contradiction/NN in/IN terms/NNS -/: unanimity/JJ principle/NN ,/, codecision/NN procedure/NN ,/, and/CC Conciliation/NNP Committee/NNP -/: and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD we/PRP must/MD resolve/VB if/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO strengthen/VB ,/, and/CC not/RB further/RBR weaken/VB the/DT principles/NNS of/IN cultural/JJ policy/NN that/WDT are/VBP to/TO create/VB a/DT European/JJ consciousness/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN we/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN ,/, all/PDT the/DT groups/NNS have/VBP a/DT common/JJ political/JJ enemy/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB by/IN chance/NN that/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Culture/NNP '/POS s/JJ decisions/NNS are/VBP constantly/RB ending/VBG up/RP in/IN the/DT conciliation/NN procedure/NN ,/, for/IN one/CD or/CC other/JJ Member/NNP State/NNP in/IN the/DT Council/NNP always/RB holds/VBZ culture/NN hostage/NN to/TO other/JJ interests/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT unanimity/JJ principle/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN itself/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT blockading/VBG instrument/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ order/NN ./.

The/DT battle/NN for/IN a/DT workable/JJ compromise/NN lasted/VBD almost/RB two/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC now/RB ,/, at/IN long/RB last/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP can/MD give/VB the/DT go-ahead/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP could/MD not/RB be/VB moved/VBN ,/, not/RB even/RB when/WRB the/DT precursor/NN programmes/NNS Kaleidoscope/VBZ ,/, Ariane/NNP and/CC Raphael/NNP finished/VBD ./.

A/DT pilot/NN programme/NN was/VBD called/VBN for/IN to/TO bridge/VB the/DT gap/NN ./.

This/DT showed/VBD up/RP the/DT weaknesses/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ cultural/JJ policy/NN activities/NNS once/RB again/RB ./.

The/DT political/JJ fight/NN over/IN funding/NN and/CC programme/NN structuring/NNS is/VBZ out/IN of/IN all/DT proportion/NN to/TO the/DT volume/NN of/IN support/NN ./.

Out/IN of/IN 410/CD applications/NNS in/IN 1999/CD only/RB 55/CD projects/NNS with/IN a/DT low/JJ overall/JJ volume/NN of/IN EUR/$ 6.07/CD million/CD could/MD be/VB considered/VBN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP was/VBD not/RB prepared/VBN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ programme/NN to/TO accommodate/VB Parliament/NNP to/TO the/DT tune/NN of/IN even/RB a/DT single/JJ euro/NN !/. ./.

And/CC so/RB the/DT moderate/JJ sum/NN of/IN 167/CD million/CD will/MD stand/VB until/IN 2004/CD ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ as/IN a/DT single/JJ ,/, medium-sized/JJ ,/, German/JJ opera/NN house/NN '/POS s/JJ expenditure/NN over/IN the/DT same/JJ period/NN ,/, when/WRB here/RB in/IN Europe/NNP this/DT sum/NN has/VBZ been/VBN earmarked/VBN for/IN 29/CD countries/NNS over/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN five/CD years/NNS !/. ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT blatant/JJ discrepancy/NN here/RB !/. ./.

And/CC so/RB we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO be/VB content/JJ ,/, albeit/IN very/RB grudgingly/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP at/IN least/JJS managed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB something/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN content/NN ./.

Previous/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP already/RB kindly/RB pointed/VBD this/DT out/RP ./.

We/PRP can/MD only/RB hope/VB that/IN it/PRP will/MD ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, be/VB possible/JJ to/TO persuade/VB the/DT Council/NNP to/TO have/VB a/DT change/NN of/IN heart/NN one/CD day/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB the/DT Council/NNP will/MD come/VB to/TO understand/VB that/IN cultural/JJ activities/NNS do/VBP the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP good/JJ ,/, not/RB harm/FW !/. ./.

Cultural/NNP cooperation/NN -/: and/CC this/DT was/VBD also/RB mentioned/VBN earlier/RBR -/: truly/RB creates/VBZ identity/NN ,/, far/RB more/RBR so/RB than/IN any/DT transport/NN directive/NN ,/, however/RB important/JJ it/PRP might/MD be/VB ./.

Providing/VBG support/NN for/IN culture/NN meets/VBZ with/IN wide-spread/JJ acceptance/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT certainly/RB can/MD not/RB be/VB said/VBN of/IN all/DT policy/NN decisions/NNS ./.

What/WP ,/, may/MD I/PRP ask/VB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP afraid/JJ of/IN ?/.

I/PRP have/VBP noticed/VBN how/WRB the/DT principle/NN of/IN a/DT necessary/JJ culture/NN at/IN European/JJ organisational/JJ level/NN has/VBZ been/VBN firmly/RB asserted/VBN ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP few/JJ opportunities/NNS to/TO address/VB all/PDT the/DT requests/NNS that/IN the/DT European/NNP States/NNPS will/MD make/VB ./.

I/PRP shall/MD simply/RB stress/VB my/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ complaint/NN because/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP did/VBD not/RB manage/VB to/TO adopt/VB a/DT review/NN clause/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, Mrs/NNP Reding/NNP was/VBD certainly/RB receptive/JJ and/CC farsighted/JJ ,/, and/CC personally/RB undertook/VBD to/TO review/VB the/DT issue/NN and/CC carry/VB out/RP a/DT comprehensive/JJ assessment/NN within/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB to/TO change/VB the/DT situation/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB rhetoric/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT new/JJ embodiment/NN of/IN a/DT modern/JJ liberalism/NN which/WDT unites/VBZ the/DT European/NNP States/NNPS and/CC constitutes/VBZ a/DT turning/NN point/VBP for/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Man/NN and/CC culture/NN are/VBP priorities/NNS ,/, and/CC culture/NN can/MD result/VB in/IN economic/JJ growth/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP contemplate/VB this/DT result/NN ,/, derive/VB satisfaction/NN from/IN it/PRP and/CC grant/VB ourselves/PRP a/DT licence/NN to/TO fully/RB embrace/VB this/DT worthwhile/JJ strategy/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, may/MD I/PRP first/RB thank/VBP Mr/NNP Gra脙/NNP 搂/VBZ a/DT Moura/NNP for/IN weaving/VBG his/PRP$ way/NN through/IN the/DT rather/RB tough/JJ textiles/NNS and/CC fibres/NNS that/WDT have/VBP made/VBN up/RP this/DT conciliation/NN tapestry/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP when/WRB entering/VBG the/DT conciliation/NN process/NN for/IN Culture/NNP 2000/CD ,/, having/VBG a/DT poet/NN to/TO lead/VB us/PRP in/IN our/PRP$ endeavours/NNS is/VBZ entirely/RB appropriate/JJ ./.

Again/RB ,/, because/IN these/DT conciliations/NNS are/VBP not/RB entirely/RB straight/JJ forward/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO thank/VB Vice-President/NNP Imbeni/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ exemplary/JJ negotiating/NN skills/NNS in/IN the/DT convoluted/JJ field/NN of/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN cultural/JJ expenditure/NN is/VBZ wisely/RB deployed/VBN and/CC given/VBN to/TO us/PRP in/IN our/PRP$ Community/NN ./.

The/DT fundamental/JJ question/NN ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP ,/, that/WDT faces/VBZ this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ :/: What/WP is/VBZ Europe/NNP ?/.

What/WP does/VBZ it/PRP mean/VB and/CC what/WP does/VBZ Europe/NNP give/VB us/PRP over/IN and/CC above/IN the/DT parameters/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ national/JJ boundaries/NNS ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP Culture/NNP 2000/CD represents/VBZ ./.

It/PRP represents/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN of/IN sustaining/VBG a/DT European/JJ identity/NN in/IN the/DT twenty-first/JJ century/NN ,/, an/DT identity/NN which/WDT eschews/VBZ the/DT echoes/NNS of/IN division/NN ,/, of/IN war/NN ,/, of/IN poverty/NN ,/, of/IN opportunity/NN ,/, of/IN poverty/NN dans/NNS la/FW realit脙/NNP 漏/NNP ./.

It/PRP promotes/VBZ mobility/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP opens/VBZ the/DT doors/NNS of/IN culture/NN to/TO the/DT socially/RB disadvantaged/JJ and/CC excluded/VBN ./.

My/PRP$ only/JJ regret/NN is/VBZ that/IN in/IN promoting/VBG this/DT programme/NN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB sufficient/JJ money/NN to/TO match/VB our/PRP$ aspirations/NNS and/CC ensure/VB our/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO deliver/VB ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP now/RB come/VBN to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ road/NN ./.

We/PRP now/RB have/VBP a/DT framework/NN programme/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ type/NN for/IN the/DT cultural/JJ sector/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT programme/NN makes/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO plan/VB our/PRP$ action/NN from/IN a/DT new/JJ perspective/NN and/CC to/TO work/VB to/TO promote/VB culture/NN in/IN a/DT more/RBR comprehensive/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB more/RBR thorough/JJ and/CC detailed/JJ manner/NN ./.

The/DT increased/VBN participation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP hope/VBP and/CC pray/VBP for/IN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB this/DT participation/NN to/TO be/VB as/RB extensive/JJ and/CC productive/JJ as/IN possible/JJ and/CC I/PRP undertake/VB to/TO work/VB to/TO ensure/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT five/CD years/NNS covered/VBN by/IN the/DT programme/NN it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT tangible/JJ reality/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP our/PRP$ European/JJ `/`` Culture/JJ 2000/NN '/'' programme/NN offers/VBZ ./.

It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB compete/VB with/IN the/DT cultural/JJ policies/NNS implemented/VBN in/IN the/DT various/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP therefore/RB that/IN extending/VBG and/CC enriching/VBG European/JJ citizens/NNS '/POS participation/NN in/IN culture/NN is/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ task/NN ,/, one/CD which/WDT justifies/VBZ the/DT efforts/NNS we/PRP make/VBP to/TO achieve/VB it/PRP ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT yardstick/NN against/IN which/WDT we/PRP must/MD measure/VB the/DT success/NN of/IN our/PRP$ programme/NN and/CC of/IN our/PRP$ Union/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT union/NN of/IN culture/NN ,/, civilisation/NN and/CC participation/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT living/VBG thing/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT foundation/NN ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP intend/VBP to/TO develop/VB ,/, and/CC I/PRP shall/MD take/VB the/DT following/JJ five/CD areas/NNS into/IN special/JJ consideration/NN :/: firstly/RB ,/, providing/VBG creative/JJ people/NNS with/IN opportunities/NNS of/IN an/DT innovative/JJ nature/NN to/TO allow/VB their/PRP$ talent/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT support/NN it/PRP deserves/VBZ in/IN our/PRP$ programme/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP reiterate/VBD my/PRP$ thanks/NNS to/TO Parliament/NNP for/IN its/PRP$ support/NN and/CC for/IN ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, having/VBG shown/VBN the/DT importance/NN it/PRP attaches/VBZ to/TO culture/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP can/MD also/RB thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN once/RB again/RB ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN 11/CD a.m./RB tomorrow/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- The/DT sitting/NN was/VBD closed/VBN at/IN 9.55/CD p.m./RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

End-of-life/NN vehicles/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, nine/CD million/CD cars/NNS are/VBP shredded/JJ and/CC scrapped/VBD every/DT year/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Even/RB though/IN they/PRP can/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB driven/VBN ,/, these/DT nine/CD million/CD cars/NNS may/MD still/RB be/VB traded/VBN and/CC moved/VBN across/IN borders/NNS ;/: and/CC not/RB just/RB intra-Community/NN borders/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB those/DT outside/IN the/DT Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB only/RB right/JJ that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD draw/VB up/RP Community/NNP rules/NNS on/IN how/WRB these/DT nine/CD million/CD vehicles/NNS every/DT year/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB recycled/VBN and/CC processed/VBN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT directive/NN has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ weaknesses/NNS that/IN we/PRP in/IN the/DT House/NNP should/MD work/VB on/RP to/TO produce/VB a/DT directive/NN which/WDT is/VBZ genuinely/RB ground-breaking/JJ ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB have/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN amendments/NNS ./.

I/PRP personally/RB believe/VBP that/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN the/DT directive/NN goes/VBZ beyond/IN its/PRP$ objective/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ for/IN classic/JJ cars/NNS to/TO be/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

Nor/CC do/VBP I/PRP think/VB that/IN motorcycles/NNS should/MD be/VB included/VBN ,/, as/IN the/DT distinctive/JJ culture/NN of/IN recycling/VBG within/IN the/DT motorcycle/NN industry/NN obviates/VBZ the/DT need/NN for/IN a/DT European/JJ directive/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP not/RB looking/VBG for/IN such/JJ rigidly/JJ high/JJ recycling/NN quotas/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO special-purpose/JJ vehicles/NNS either/RB ./.

I/PRP want/VBP special-purpose/JJ vehicles/NNS such/JJ as/IN ambulances/NNS to/TO have/VB high/JJ recovery/NN quotas/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ main/JJ concern/NN in/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT directive/NN solidly/RB regulates/VBZ the/DT matter/NN of/IN accountability/NN for/IN how/WRB a/DT car/NN is/VBZ disposed/VBN of/IN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT can/MD be/VB left/VBN as/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBN with/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ensuring/VBG the/DT appropriate/JJ collection/NN points/NNS for/IN draining/VBG cars/NNS ./.

This/DT will/MD involve/VB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, disposing/VBG of/IN more/JJR than/IN 32/CD million/CD lots/NNS of/IN used/JJ oil/NN ,/, removing/JJ break/NN fluid/NN ,/, etc./FW ./.

An/DT important/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ the/DT issue/NN of/IN what/WP to/TO do/VB with/IN used/JJ parts/NNS ./.

What/WP should/MD we/PRP do/VB with/IN the/DT shredded/JJ products/NNS ?/.

We/PRP should/MD not/RB overlook/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, although/IN quotas/NNS are/VBP an/DT important/JJ point/NN in/IN recycling/NN and/CC recovery/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP by/IN no/DT means/NN the/DT only/JJ point/NN ./.

Do/VB not/RB forget/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN cars/NNS ,/, 80/CD %/NN of/IN environmental/JJ impact/NN comes/VBZ through/IN driving/NN ,/, 1/CD %/NN through/IN recovery/NN and/CC 19/CD %/NN through/IN construction/NN ./.

Quotas/NNS are/VBZ not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, the/DT only/JJ parameter/NN in/IN the/DT matter/NN of/IN environmental/JJ compatibility/NN ,/, just/RB one/CD of/IN many/JJ ./.

Of/IN course/NN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO aim/VB high/JJ ,/, but/CC quotas/NNS must/MD not/RB become/VB an/DT end/NN in/IN themselves/PRP ./.

We/PRP must/MD understand/VB that/IN the/DT bigger/JJR picture/NN is/VBZ important/JJ when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT environmental/JJ impact/NN of/IN cars/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP far/RB keener/JJ to/TO see/VB us/PRP move/VB away/RP from/IN today/NN 's/POS car/NN ,/, weighing/VBG 1,400/CD kg/NN and/CC driving/VBG an/DT average/NN of/IN 200,000/CD km/NN ,/, to/TO a/DT future/JJ car/NN capable/JJ of/IN driving/VBG the/DT same/JJ distance/NN but/CC weighing/VBG just/RB 1,000/CD kg/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD at/IN least/JJS mean/VB 400/CD kg/CD times/NNS 200,000/CD km/CD less/RBR transportation/NN ./.

This/DT would/MD represent/VB real/JJ environmental/JJ progress/NN because/IN it/PRP would/MD lead/VB to/TO a/DT large/JJ reduction/NN in/IN CO2/NNP which/WDT ,/, if/IN I/PRP have/VBP rightly/RB understood/VBN the/DT Kyoto/NNP Protocol/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT important/JJ factor/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB consider/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN future/NN ,/, vehicles/NNS which/WDT clearly/RB and/CC effectively/RB use/VBP lightweight/JJ construction/NN methods/NNS will/MD produce/VB less/JJR CO2/NN and/CC should/MD receive/VB preferential/JJ treatment/NN in/IN their/PRP$ combustion/NN quotas/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB for/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ,/, but/CC for/IN you/PRP and/CC your/PRP$ staff/NN ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, to/TO decide/VB whether/IN these/DT lightweight/JJ construction/NN vehicles/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC there/EX is/VBZ also/RB talk/NN of/IN 3-litre/JJ vehicles/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- should/MD receive/VB preferential/JJ treatment/NN ./.

We/PRP think/VBP they/PRP should/MD ./.

May/NNP I/PRP say/VBP something/NN about/IN costs/NNS ./.

Some/DT say/VBP that/IN all/PDT the/DT costs/NNS should/MD be/VB borne/VBN by/IN the/DT manufacturers/NNS ;/: that/IN this/DT is/VBZ only/RB right/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT very/RB best/JJS interests/NNS of/IN the/DT consumer/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT can/MD be/VB seriously/RB questioned/VBN as/IN the/DT manufacturers/NNS will/MD pass/VB on/IN all/PDT the/DT costs/NNS to/TO consumers/NNS and/CC acquire/VB for/IN themselves/PRP a/DT state-sanctioned/JJ monopoly/NN on/IN recycling/VBG ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB warn/VB you/PRP against/IN consenting/VBG to/TO this/DT ./.

There/EX are/VBP amendments/NNS which/WDT propose/VBP splitting/VBG the/DT costs/NNS fifty-fifty/NN between/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN and/CC the/DT buyer/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ car/NN ./.

The/DT money/NN from/IN this/DT pool/NN ,/, system/NN ,/, or/CC however/RB you/PRP want/VBP to/TO picture/VB it/PRP ,/, would/MD mean/VB that/IN from/IN 2006/CD all/DT vehicles/NNS in/IN circulation/NN could/MD be/VB taken/VBN in/RP without/IN cost/NN to/TO the/DT last/JJ holder/NN ./.

This/DT too/RB is/VBZ a/DT particular/JJ desire/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ proposal/NN to/TO split/VB the/DT costs/NNS has/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ advantage/NN ,/, namely/RB that/IN we/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB an/DT immediate/JJ candidate/NN for/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP when/WRB the/DT directive/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN ./.

The/DT car/NN industry/NN is/VBZ concerned/VBN about/IN and/CC half/DT expecting/NN repercussions/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT serious/JJ problem/NN which/WDT we/PRP must/MD address/VB accordingly/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP propose/VBP splitting/VBG the/DT costs/NNS between/IN the/DT first/JJ holder/NN and/CC the/DT manufacturer/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN a/DT ban/NN on/IN certain/JJ materials/NNS :/: of/IN course/NN we/PRP need/VBP one/CD !/. ./.

A/DT car/NN has/VBZ dangerous/JJ components/NNS which/WDT we/PRP must/MD ban/VB long-term/JJ ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP a/DT pressure/NN instrument/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RP various/JJ proposals/NNS which/WDT are/VBP too/RB stringent/JJ and/CC we/PRP have/VBP come/VBN up/RP with/IN some/DT alternatives/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN sound/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN given/VBN more/JJR authority/NN ,/, so/CC let/VB us/PRP use/VB it/PRP !/. ./.

Let/VB us/PRP have/VBP the/DT courage/NN to/TO put/VB together/RP a/DT ground-breaking/JJ directive/NN ./.

A/DT directive/NN which/WDT we/PRP put/VBD together/RP just/RB for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN it/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB worthy/JJ of/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

I/PRP ask/VBP for/IN your/PRP$ support/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP almost/RB feel/VBP like/IN saying/NN ,/, ``/`` Phew/NNP ''/'' ,/, now/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP at/IN last/RB come/VBN to/TO the/DT second/JJ reading/NN on/IN this/DT directive/NN which/WDT has/VBZ given/VBN us/PRP so/RB much/JJ work/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT has/VBZ clearly/RB also/RB given/VBN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN work/NN to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB this/DT directive/NN to/TO be/VB at/IN all/DT satisfactory/JJ since/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB answer/VB the/DT real/JJ question/NN over/IN what/WP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB done/VBN with/IN vehicles/NNS which/WDT have/VBP already/RB been/VBN abandoned/VBN and/CC which/WDT ,/, today/NN ,/, can/MD only/RB be/VB removed/VBN at/IN local/JJ authority/NN expense/NN ,/, i.e./VBG the/DT taxpayers/NNS '/POS expense/NN ./.

The/DT principle/NN of/IN `/`` polluter/NN pays/NNS '/'' is/VBZ not/RB being/VBG applied/VBN ./.

Vehicles/NNPS already/RB abandoned/VBD have/VBP also/RB been/VBN abandoned/VBN by/IN Community/NNP legislation/NN ,/, in/IN that/WDT they/PRP are/VBP not/RB taken/VBN into/IN consideration/NN either/CC in/IN the/DT texts/NNS on/IN emissions/NNS or/CC in/IN this/DT text/NN on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

The/DT only/JJ merit/NN of/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP looks/VBZ to/TO the/DT future/NN ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, been/VBN possible/JJ to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN vehicles/NNS currently/RB being/VBG used/VBN but/CC which/WDT are/VBP already/RB old/JJ and/CC which/WDT cost/VBD far/RB more/RBR to/TO recycle/VB ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD be/VB fairly/RB confident/JJ for/IN the/DT future/NN because/IN we/PRP know/VBP the/DT efforts/NNS that/IN car/NN manufacturers/NNS are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO make/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO find/VB -LRB-/-LRB- a/SYM -RRB-/-RRB- materials/NNS that/WDT are/VBP easier/JJR to/TO recycle/VB and/CC -LRB-/-LRB- b/NN -RRB-/-RRB- to/TO set/VBD up/RP recycling/VBG industries/NNS ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO maintain/VB a/DT flexible/JJ approach/NN to/TO recycling/NN ,/, reuse/NN and/CC incineration/NN ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT new/JJ particularly/RB light/JJ materials/NNS are/VBP concerned/VBN which/WDT make/VBP it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO reduce/VB vehicle/NN consumption/NN and/CC therefore/RB emissions/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN of/IN compatibility/NN between/IN our/PRP$ directives/NNS on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS and/CC the/DT former/JJ directives/NNS ,/, including/VBG the/DT one/NN on/IN auto-oil/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP voted/VBD on/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ./.

We/PRP must/MD therefore/RB congratulate/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Protection/NNP ,/, on/IN having/VBG the/DT wisdom/NN ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB things/NNS perfectly/RB clear/JJ ,/, to/TO reintroduce/VB the/DT clause/NN making/VBG an/DT exception/NN of/IN the/DT vintage/JJ cars/NNS which/WDT are/VBP part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ industrial/JJ and/CC cultural/JJ heritage/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, let/VB me/PRP say/VBP that/IN this/DT directive/NN is/VBZ not/RB ambitious/JJ enough/RB to/TO solve/VB the/DT problems/NNS of/IN present/JJ car/NN numbers/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ rather/RB hypocritical/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT fate/NN reserved/VBN for/IN the/DT wrecks/NNS which/WDT still/RB clutter/VB our/PRP$ forests/NNS ,/, lakes/NNS and/CC gardens/NNS ./.

Once/RB again/RB ,/, the/DT principle/NN of/IN `/`` polluter/NN pays/NNS '/'' is/VBZ not/RB being/VBG applied/VBN ./.

The/DT taxpayer/NN is/VBZ still/RB footing/VBG the/DT bill/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, reading/VBG the/DT leaflets/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN distributed/VBN in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, one/PRP would/MD think/VB that/IN we/PRP were/VBD talking/VBG about/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ environmental/JJ catastrophe/NN or/CC the/DT death/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Neither/DT is/VBZ correct/JJ ./.

We/PRP simply/RB must/MD realise/VB that/IN the/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT table/NN is/VBZ a/DT sound/JJ directive/NN ./.

It/PRP means/VBZ ecological/JJ progress/NN for/IN Europe/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP can/MD be/VB proud/JJ of/IN ourselves/PRP if/IN we/PRP succeed/VBP in/IN enacting/VBG it/PRP and/CC setting/VBG it/PRP in/IN motion/NN ./.

All/PDT the/DT same/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ one/CD point/NN on/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP in/IN conflict/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT grand/JJ scheme/NN of/IN the/DT directive/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ perhaps/RB a/DT minor/JJ point/NN ,/, but/CC nevertheless/RB a/DT disputed/JJ one/NN ./.

It/PRP concerns/VBZ the/DT issue/NN of/IN recycling/VBG costs/NNS ./.

Here/RB we/PRP find/VBP ourselves/PRP fundamentally/RB at/IN odds/NNS with/IN last/JJ year/NN 's/POS debate/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP when/WRB freedom/NN from/IN costs/NNS for/IN the/DT last/JJ owner/NN and/CC the/DT issue/NN of/IN financing/NN were/VBD lumped/VBN together/RB and/CC a/DT question/NN mark/NN placed/VBD over/RP whether/IN the/DT last/JJ owner/NN should/MD really/RB be/VB free/JJ from/IN costs/NNS ./.

But/CC we/PRP also/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB aware/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ by/IN virtue/NN of/IN rational/JJ political/JJ stances/NNS ,/, and/CC flexibility/NN in/IN negotiations/NNS ,/, that/IN we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO find/VB solutions/NNS to/TO the/DT major/JJ disputes/NNS which/WDT have/VBP ultimately/RB led/VBN to/TO many/JJ tragedies/NNS in/IN history/NN ./.

The/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN Helsinki/NNP had/VBD the/DT courage/NN to/TO take/VB certain/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN various/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN these/DT decisions/NNS have/VBP already/RB recognised/VBN the/DT real/JJ value/NN of/IN these/DT opportunities/NNS which/WDT ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/VBD at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ speech/NN ,/, represent/VBP a/DT window/NN of/IN opportunity/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD not/RB achieve/VB concrete/JJ results/NNS during/IN this/DT stage/NN of/IN negotiations/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT delicate/JJ and/CC sensitive/JJ phase/NN ,/, by/IN exploiting/VBG tensions/NNS ./.

No/UH ,/, we/PRP should/MD continue/VB to/TO make/VB progress/NN by/IN working/VBG discreetly/RB to/TO support/VB the/DT special/JJ representative/NN of/IN the/DT Secretary-General/NNP of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS with/IN his/PRP$ remit/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN on/IN this/DT is/VBZ crystal/RB clear/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ worthwhile/JJ second-guessing/VBG particular/JJ phrases/NNS in/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ conclusions/NNS or/CC in/IN any/DT other/JJ statement/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB play/VB at/IN political/JJ correctness/NNS in/IN this/DT House/NNP :/: we/PRP are/VBP concerned/VBN with/IN fairness/NN at/IN international/JJ level/NN and/CC with/IN concrete/JJ statements/NNS on/IN this/DT issue/NN consistently/RB defined/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP over/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP has/VBZ also/RB followed/VBN carefully/RB ,/, attentively/JJ and/CC pragmatically/JJ ./.

We/PRP are/VBP not/RB trying/VBG to/TO deceive/VB anyone/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP in/IN no/DT way/NN trying/VBG to/TO use/VB practical/JJ solutions/NNS to/TO create/VB a/DT model/NN implying/VBG political/JJ recognition/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, over/IN time/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ clearly/RB demonstrated/VBN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB how/WRB it/PRP sees/VBZ this/DT issue/NN ./.

Decisions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN taken/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP with/IN a/DT great/JJ sense/NN of/IN responsibility/NN ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN Helsinki/NNP was/VBD very/RB clear/JJ in/IN this/DT respect/NN ./.

The/DT authorities/NNS of/IN the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Cyprus/NNP itself/PRP have/VBP clearly/RB recognised/VBN that/IN our/PRP$ relations/NNS with/IN them/PRP regarding/VBG their/PRP$ accession/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP have/VBP been/VBN positive/JJ ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT point/NN in/IN second-guessing/VBG or/CC trying/VBG to/TO second-guess/VB our/PRP$ intentions/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD be/VB more/RBR than/IN pleased/JJ to/TO elucidate/VB a/DT few/JJ points/NNS as/IN requested/VBD ./.

Malta/NNP ,/, Cyprus/NNP and/CC Turkey/NNP were/VBD not/RB provided/VBN for/IN at/IN this/DT stage/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Schroedter/NNP described/VBD this/DT as/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN ./.

She/PRP ought/MD perhaps/RB to/TO take/VB some/DT time/NN to/TO ask/VB the/DT erstwhile/JJ President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB a/DT stranger/NN to/TO you/PRP ,/, how/WRB this/DT presumed/VBN lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN has/VBZ come/VBN about/IN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT little/JJ to/TO do/VB with/IN this/DT too/RB ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB this/DT to/TO be/VB the/DT case/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT decision/NN was/VBD ,/, rather/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT special/JJ instrument/NN for/IN the/DT Eastern/NNP and/CC Central/NNP European/NNP States/NNPS which/WDT ,/, like/IN Malta/NNP and/CC Cyprus/NNP ,/, are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN the/DT accession/NN process/NN ,/, but/CC under/IN different/JJ conditions/NNS ./.

Hitherto/RB this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN out/RB of/IN the/DT question/NN of/IN course/NN ./.

By/IN way/NN of/IN clarification/NN :/: if/IN we/PRP transfer/VB it/PRP across/IN from/IN heading/VBG 4/CD to/TO heading/VBG 7/CD then/RB this/DT will/MD have/VB no/DT effect/NN on/IN the/DT overall/JJ balance/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP this/DT ,/, then/RB heading/VBG 7/CD would/MD be/VB increased/VBN accordingly/RB but/CC heading/VBG 4/CD would/MD be/VB decreased/VBN by/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN ./.

The/DT idea/NN that/WDT heading/VBG 7/CD could/MD be/VB added/VBN to/TO in/IN this/DT way/NN and/CC heading/VBG 4/CD left/VBN alone/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB workable/JJ ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ no/DT more/RBR able/JJ than/IN anyone/NN else/RB to/TO spend/VB money/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB got/VBN ,/, at/IN least/JJS not/RB until/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT printing/VBG machine/NN installed/VBN in/IN the/DT basement/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD use/VB to/TO print/VB euro/NN notes/NNS !/. ./.

As/IN for/IN the/DT peace/NN process/NN in/IN Cyprus/NNP and/CC how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ linked/VBN with/IN the/DT accession/NN negotiations/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD reiterate/VB that/IN there/EX has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN a/DT direct/JJ connection/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP have/VBP long/RB endeavoured/VBN to/TO encourage/VB the/DT two/CD communities/NNS in/IN Cyprus/NNP to/TO undertake/VB joint/JJ projects/NNS ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, this/DT has/VBZ proved/VBN unsuccessful/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN asked/VBN if/IN there/EX have/VBP been/VBN any/DT signs/NNS to/TO the/DT contrary/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Rothe/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD put/VB it/PRP this/DT way/NN :/: I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT distinct/JJ improvement/NN in/IN the/DT framework/NN conditions/NNS for/IN reaching/VBG agreements/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB confirmation/NN of/IN this/DT at/IN present/NN ,/, and/CC nor/CC do/VBP I/PRP expect/VB it/PRP ,/, since/IN we/PRP have/VBP not/RB yet/RB held/VBN direct/JJ talks/NNS ./.

These/DT will/MD take/VB place/NN at/IN a/DT later/JJ date/NN ./.

The/DT framework/NN conditions/NNS have/VBP changed/VBN in/IN that/WDT the/DT Helsinki/NNP decisions/NNS made/VBD a/DT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN things/NNS possible/JJ that/WDT were/VBD not/RB possible/JJ hitherto/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, in/IN that/WDT the/DT political/JJ strategies/NNS employed/VBN by/IN the/DT parties/NNS concerned/VBN have/VBP changed/VBN beyond/IN recognition/NN ./.

There/EX would/MD then/RB be/VB no/DT question/NN of/IN Cyprus/NNP acceding/VBG to/TO the/DT Union/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ firm/NN belief/NN that/IN ,/, since/IN Helsinki/NNP ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN far/RB greater/JJR incentive/NN to/TO link/VB the/DT accession/NN process/NN with/IN the/DT resolution/NN of/IN the/DT conflict/NN ./.

Indeed/RB that/DT was/VBD the/DT idea/NN behind/IN it/PRP ./.

After/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, Mrs/NNP Rothe/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB too/RB early/JJ to/TO deliver/VB a/DT verdict/NN on/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP no/DT grounds/NNS for/IN assuming/VBG that/IN the/DT new/JJ line/NN will/MD fail/VB ./.

As/IN yet/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP no/DT grounds/NNS for/IN saying/VBG that/IN we/PRP will/MD actually/RB succeed/VB ,/, but/CC one/CD thing/NN I/PRP can/MD say/VB quite/RB clearly/RB is/VBZ that/IN the/DT conditions/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN place/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO take/VB a/DT step/NN forwards/RB have/VBP improved/VBN considerably/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT Cyprus/NNP question/NN has/VBZ a/DT role/NN in/IN the/DT discussions/NNS with/IN Turkey/NNP ./.

I/PRP met/VBD the/DT Turkish/JJ Foreign/NNP Minister/NNP in/IN Brussels/NNP a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS ago/RB and/CC naturally/RB I/PRP asked/VBD if/IN Turkey/NNP could/MD take/VB a/DT positive/JJ and/CC constructive/JJ stance/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO this/DT issue/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD just/RB make/VB one/CD point/NN :/: we/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB 100/CD %/NN sure/JJ -/: I/PRP am/VBP not/RB at/IN any/DT rate/NN -/: that/IN one/PRP only/RB has/VBZ to/TO press/VB a/DT button/NN in/IN Ankara/NNP to/TO set/VB the/DT wheels/NNS in/IN motion/NN in/IN Cyprus/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB far/RB from/IN being/VBG that/RB simple/JJ ,/, rather/RB we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO make/VB concentrated/JJ efforts/NNS ,/, during/IN talks/NNS with/IN both/DT communities/NNS ,/, to/TO encourage/VB them/PRP to/TO reach/VB an/DT understanding/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP intend/VBP to/TO do/VB :/: the/DT necessary/JJ measures/NNS and/CC programmes/NNS are/VBP in/IN place/NN ./.

I/PRP must/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ to/TO you/PRP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP this/DT financial/JJ regulation/NN ,/, the/DT one/NN that/WDT has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO be/VB decided/VBN on/IN here/RB ,/, before/IN we/PRP can/MD even/RB get/VB started/VBD ./.

The/DT financial/JJ regulation/NN is/VBZ the/DT legal/JJ framework/NN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO tackle/VB the/DT priorities/NNS established/VBN under/IN the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT accession/NN partnerships/NNS with/IN Malta/NNP and/CC Cyprus/NNP ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB start/VB anything/NN while/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT regulation/NN in/IN place/NN ,/, because/IN I/PRP lack/VBP the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN for/IN doing/VBG so/RB ./.

If/IN the/DT lamented/JJ lack/NN of/IN coherence/NN should/MD happen/VB to/TO have/VB something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP am/VBP bound/VBN to/TO say/VB that/IN this/DT regulation/NN is/VBZ a/DT legal/JJ framework/NN and/CC nothing/NN more/RBR than/IN that/RB ./.

This/DT legal/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ fleshed/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT priorities/NNS set/VBN by/IN the/DT accession/NN partnerships/NNS that/WDT were/VBD adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP last/JJ year/NN and/CC are/VBP now/RB being/VBG implemented/VBN in/IN the/DT corresponding/JJ programmes/NNS and/CC project/NN management/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/DT ,/, although/IN many/JJ areas/NNS of/IN European/JJ policy/NN leave/VBP something/NN to/TO be/VB desired/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN coherence/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT instance/NN I/PRP would/MD claim/VB ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, that/IN we/PRP have/VBP developed/VBN a/DT very/RB clear/JJ ,/, transparent/JJ and/CC coherent/JJ policy/NN ./. ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- PT/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT issue/NN raised/VBD by/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN Elmar/NNP Brok/NNP will/MD be/VB considered/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN the/DT criticism/NN made/VBN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ presidency/NN is/VBZ not/RB appropriate/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, on/IN 24/CD January/NNP the/DT Council/NNP considered/VBD the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT accident/NN the/DT previous/JJ month/NN involving/VBG the/DT oil/NN tanker/NN Erika/NN ./.

At/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN the/DT strength/NN of/IN public/JJ feeling/NN about/IN the/DT disastrous/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN this/DT accident/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP made/VBD known/VBN its/PRP$ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS and/CC the/DT environmental/JJ protection/NN that/WDT should/MD go/VB hand/NN in/IN hand/NN with/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT Council/NNP was/VBD fully/RB aware/JJ of/IN issues/NNS of/IN this/DT kind/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO take/VB additional/JJ measures/NNS in/IN this/DT field/NN ./.

It/PRP emphasised/VBD the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP taking/VBG new/JJ measures/NNS within/IN a/DT Community/NNP framework/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ work/NN with/IN international/JJ organisations/NNS ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, as/IN currently/RB framed/VBN ,/, Community/NNP legislation/NN requires/VBZ port/NN authorities/NNS to/TO carry/VB out/IN inspections/NNS on/IN board/NN all/DT foreign/JJ vessels/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT flying/VBG flags/NNS of/IN convenience/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO detain/VB them/PRP if/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB comply/VB with/IN international/JJ standards/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT directive/NN dating/VBG from/IN 1995/CD on/IN this/DT subject/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT future/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP noted/VBD that/IN work/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD shortly/RB lead/VB to/TO the/DT publication/NN of/IN a/DT communication/NN on/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS and/CC of/IN new/JJ proposals/NNS to/TO strengthen/VB controls/NNS ,/, together/RB with/IN provisions/NNS on/IN the/DT qualifications/NNS of/IN inspecting/VBG agencies/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB plans/NNS for/IN a/DT requirement/NN to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT actual/JJ structure/NN of/IN oil/NN tankers/NNS visiting/VBG Community/NNP ports/NNS ./.

This/DT House/NNP will/NN of/IN course/NN also/RB be/VB invited/VBN to/TO give/VB its/PRP$ views/NNS on/IN these/DT proposals/NNS ,/, given/VBN that/IN these/DT are/VBP matters/NNS subject/JJ to/TO the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ considering/VBG this/DT question/NN ./.

The/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NNP comes/VBZ from/IN a/DT country/NN ,/, Portugal/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ directly/RB at/IN risk/NN from/IN just/RB this/DT type/NN of/IN situation/NN ./.

Does/VBZ the/DT President/NNP of/IN the/DT Council/NN not/RB think/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD stop/VB talking/VBG and/CC implement/VB tough/JJ measures/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN we/PRP now/RB have/VBP the/DT means/NN to/TO control/VB this/DT type/NN of/IN oil/NN tanker/NN on/IN the/DT high/JJ seas/NNS ?/.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT story/NN of/IN the/DT Erika/NNP seems/VBZ comical/JJ ./.

A/DT French-owned/JJ ship/NN ,/, under/IN a/DT Maltese/JJ flag/NN of/IN convenience/NN ,/, an/DT Indian/JJ crew/NN ,/, a/DT sea-worthiness/JJ certificate/NN issued/VBN by/IN Italy/NNP ,/, in/IN Sicily/NNP ,/, with/IN the/DT last/JJ inspection/NN carried/VBN out/RP in/IN Bulgaria/NNP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ./.

The/DT ship/NN was/VBD sinking/VBG and/CC the/DT captain/NN realised/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD sinking/VBG and/CC that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB even/RB going/VBG to/TO make/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT next/JJ port/NN ./.

This/DT kind/NN of/IN situation/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB allowed/VBN ./.

The/DT damage/NN to/TO your/PRP$ country/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO mine/NN ,/, Spain/NNP ,/, could/MD be/VB horrendous/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP Medina/NNP Ortega/NNP ,/, I/PRP naturally/RB share/VBP your/PRP$ concerns/NNS and/CC I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP that/IN a/DT coastal/JJ country/NN like/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, the/DT country/NN currently/RB holding/VBG the/DT presidency/NN ,/, is/VBZ naturally/RB very/RB concerned/JJ about/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT more/RBR so/RB as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB any/DT oil/NN tankers/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/VB within/IN the/DT existing/VBG legislative/JJ framework/NN ./.

That/DT legislative/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ the/DT 1995/CD directive/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT set/NN of/IN regulations/NNS with/IN a/DT degree/NN of/IN flexibility/NN which/WDT should/MD perhaps/RB be/VB implemented/VBN more/RBR rigorously/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT area/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/VB with/IN the/DT world/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, and/CC that/DT means/VBZ reacting/VBG in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT facts/NNS of/IN the/DT situation/NN ./.

In/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT seriousness/NN of/IN such/JJ situations/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD congratulate/VB ourselves/PRP on/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT authorities/NNS have/VBP at/IN least/JJS reacted/VBN and/CC undertaken/VBN to/TO examine/VB the/DT legislative/JJ provisions/NNS already/RB existing/VBG in/IN this/DT field/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ intentions/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN are/VBP positive/JJ ,/, as/IN it/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO reinforce/VB the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT 1995/CD directive/NN ./.

The/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ minded/JJ to/TO give/VB priority/NN to/TO this/DT area/NN ,/, within/IN the/DT Transport/NNP Council/NNP ,/, and/CC we/PRP intend/VBP to/TO follow/VB this/DT up/RP as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

We/PRP also/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO examine/VB this/DT issue/NN with/IN equal/JJ promptness/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ before/IN this/DT House/NNP under/IN the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN Kotka/NNP ,/, in/IN Finland/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ currently/RB a/DT vessel/NN carrying/VBG chemicals/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ sailing/VBG under/IN a/DT flag/NN of/IN convenience/NN ./.

The/DT vessel/NN is/VBZ anchored/VBN outside/IN the/DT port/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT condition/NN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN is/VBZ a/DT safety/NN hazard/NN for/IN the/DT port/NN and/CC the/DT surrounding/VBG areas/NNS ,/, and/CC because/IN it/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB inspected/VBN properly/RB ,/, as/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT one/NN who/WP will/MD pay/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Karamanou/NNP '/POS s/JJ question/NN is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB serious/JJ one/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD not/RB wish/VB to/TO conceal/VB that/DT fact/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ well/RB known/VBN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT clear/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT humanitarian/JJ aid/NN effort/NN being/VBG made/VBN by/IN the/DT international/JJ community/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN Mrs/NNP Karamanou/NNP is/VBZ aware/JJ that/IN ,/, because/RB of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN division/NN of/IN labour/NN between/IN the/DT international/JJ donors/NNS ,/, the/DT task/NN of/IN restoring/VBG health/NN care/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN entrusted/VBN to/TO the/DT World/NNP Health/NNP Organisation/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP ,/, do/VB you/PRP not/RB think/VB that/IN the/DT very/JJ fact/NN of/IN increased/VBN child/NN mortality/NN is/VBZ an/DT abomination/NN for/IN the/DT continent/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, a/DT shameful/JJ thing/NN ,/, which/WDT should/MD motivate/VB us/PRP all/DT ,/, so/CC that/IN the/DT aid/NN we/PRP provide/VBP becomes/VBZ more/RBR effective/JJ and/CC more/RBR generous/JJ ?/.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO widen/VB the/DT debate/NN and/CC include/VB the/DT situation/NN in/IN Mitrovica/NNP ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN medical/JJ aid/NN is/VBZ still/RB denied/VBN to/TO the/DT Albanian/NNP Kosovars/NNPS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB happening/VBG elsewhere/RB in/IN the/DT country/NN ,/, causing/VBG tension/NN between/IN the/DT Albanian/NNP Kosovars/NNPS and/CC Serbs/NNP ,/, making/VBG for/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB nobody/NN trusts/VBZ anybody/NN anymore/RB and/CC where/WRB Albanians/NNS do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO be/VB looked/VBN after/IN by/IN Serbs/NNP and/CC vice/RB versa/RB ./.

I/PRP understand/VBP very/RB well/RB what/WP you/PRP are/VBP saying/VBG and/CC you/PRP are/VBP right/JJ :/: the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD work/VB in/IN a/DT wider/JJR context/NN of/IN international/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Staes/NNP ,/, the/DT situation/NN in/IN Mitrovica/NNP is/VBZ well/RB known/VBN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB special/JJ situation/NN with/IN a/DT degree/NN of/IN inter-ethnic/JJ tension/NN which/WDT fortunately/RB is/VBZ not/RB matched/VBN with/IN such/JJ severity/NN in/IN others/NNS parts/NNS of/IN Kosovo/NNP ./.

The/DT situation/NN in/IN Mitrovica/NNP is/VBZ appalling/JJ ,/, and/CC involves/VBZ very/RB special/JJ tensions/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT measures/NNS taken/VBN over/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ hours/NNS to/TO create/VB safe/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN that/DT area/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

Since/IN then/RB the/DT Brussels/NNP landscape/NN has/VBZ changed/VBN beyond/IN recognition/NN ;/: a/DT new/JJ ,/, reinvigorated/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN elected/VBN and/CC a/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP confirmed/VBD in/IN office/NN ./.

The/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ already/RB taken/VBN important/JJ steps/NNS to/TO move/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO function/VB ./.

A/DT code/NN of/IN conduct/NN for/IN Commissioners/NNP and/CC their/PRP$ private/JJ offices/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN adopted/VBN ./.

In/IN a/DT symbolic/JJ but/CC significant/JJ gesture/NN Commissioners/NNP have/VBP voluntarily/RB renounced/VBD their/PRP$ entitlement/NN to/TO the/DT tax-free/JJ purchase/NN of/IN alcohol/NN ,/, tobacco/NN ,/, petrol/NN and/CC consumer/NN goods/NNS ./.

The/DT number/NN of/IN departments/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN reduced/VBN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, has/VBZ shown/VBN a/DT clear/JJ and/CC unprecedented/JJ commitment/NN to/TO change/NN and/CC for/IN this/DT they/PRP are/VBP to/TO be/VB congratulated/VBN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB this/DT ,/, action/NN is/VBZ required/VBN in/IN four/CD areas/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, financial/JJ management/NN and/CC control/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD be/VB improved/VBN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ problems/NNS is/VBZ the/DT lack/NN of/IN a/DT functioning/VBG system/NN of/IN financial/JJ control/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS DGs/NN must/MD be/VB made/VBN fully/RB responsible/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ expenditure/NN ,/, including/VBG financial/JJ control/NN ./.

A/DT new/JJ independent/JJ audit/NN system/NN service/NN must/MD be/VB set/VBN up/RP ./.

DGs/NNP must/MD publish/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ annual/JJ accounts/NNS so/RB as/RB to/TO enable/VB a/DT clear/JJ identification/NN of/IN problem/NN areas/NNS and/CC set/VB annual/JJ targets/NNS for/IN reducing/VBG fraud/NN and/CC irregularities/NNS ./.

In/IN return/NN for/IN this/DT greater/JJR degree/NN of/IN autonomy/NN ,/, managers/NNS must/MD be/VB made/VBN fully/RB and/CC personally/RB responsible/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ actions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN the/DT transition/NN to/TO such/PDT a/DT new/JJ system/NN will/MD take/VB time/NN ./.

Changes/NNS to/TO the/DT Financial/NNP Regulation/NNP will/MD be/VB required/VBN and/CC Parliament/NNP must/MD have/VB its/PRP$ say/NN on/IN those/DT changes/NNS ./.

But/CC while/IN the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN it/PRP respects/VBZ the/DT Treaty/NNP and/CC the/DT Financial/NNP Regulation/NNP in/IN the/DT transitional/JJ phase/NN ,/, this/DT must/MD not/RB be/VB an/DT excuse/NN for/IN inertia/NN ./.

Urgent/JJ change/NN is/VBZ required/VBN today/NN ./.

Second/LS ,/, the/DT fight/NN against/IN fraud/NN ,/, mismanagement/NN and/CC nepotism/NN must/MD be/VB strengthened/VBN ,/, firstly/RB by/IN creating/VBG a/DT culture/NN in/IN which/WDT they/PRP can/MD not/RB thrive/VB ./.

This/DT requires/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ example/NN to/TO be/VB set/VBN by/IN Commissioners/NNP and/CC senior/JJ staff/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN adequate/JJ training/NN and/CC secondly/NN ,/, by/IN reinforcing/VBG the/DT existing/VBG mechanisms/NNS for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN fraud/NN ./.

A/DT proposal/NN can/MD be/VB made/VBN ,/, a/DT proposal/NN should/MD be/VB made/VBN ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN Article/NNP 280/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, by/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN this/DT year/NN ./.

Third/LS ,/, standards/NNS in/IN European/JJ public/JJ life/NN must/MD be/VB upheld/VBN ./.

The/DT political/JJ crisis/NN which/WDT led/VBD to/TO the/DT downfall/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN clearly/RB demonstrated/VBD the/DT need/NN for/IN unambiguous/JJ and/CC enforceable/JJ rules/NNS of/IN conduct/NN ./.

A/DT number/NN of/IN codes/NNS have/VBP since/IN been/VBN introduced/VBN ./.

They/PRP must/MD be/VB assessed/VBN by/IN Parliament/NNP and/CC should/MD be/VB made/VBN legally/RB binding/JJ ./.

The/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS should/MD follow/VB the/DT example/NN of/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN countries/NNS ,/, most/RBS notably/RB the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP ,/, and/CC institute/VB a/DT committee/NN for/IN standards/NNS in/IN public/JJ life/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT mandate/NN to/TO give/VB advice/NN on/IN professional/JJ ethics/NNS and/CC rules/NNS of/IN conduct/NN in/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

Whistle-blowers/NNS who/WP act/VBP in/IN good/JJ faith/NN must/MD be/VB protected/VBN ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP announced/VBD new/JJ measures/NNS for/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN whistle-blowers/NNS ./.

They/PRP must/MD be/VB implemented/VBN without/IN delay/NN ./.

Although/IN such/JJ measures/NNS can/MD never/RB be/VB an/DT alternative/NN for/IN good/JJ management/NN ,/, they/PRP must/MD be/VB an/DT escape/NN valve/NN when/WRB something/NN goes/VBZ wrong/JJ ./.

Crucially/RB ,/, reforms/NNS must/MD not/RB be/VB limited/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP must/MD consider/VB itself/PRP the/DT need/NN for/IN improvements/NNS to/TO its/PRP$ internal/JJ rules/NNS ,/, administrative/JJ procedures/NNS and/CC management/NN practices/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS human/JJ resource/NN policy/NN must/MD be/VB modernised/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clearly/RB no/RB longer/RB suited/VBN to/TO the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN a/DT modern/JJ ,/, multinational/JJ organisation/NN ./.

The/DT social/JJ dialogue/NN has/VBZ often/RB acted/VBN as/IN a/DT brake/NNP on/IN reform/NN and/CC its/PRP$ overhaul/NN is/VBZ long/RB overdue/JJ ./.

A/DT career/NN with/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS must/MD become/VB more/RBR attractive/JJ ./.

Too/RB many/JJ young/JJ ,/, new/JJ officials/NNS are/VBP leaving/VBG their/PRP$ jobs/NNS after/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ./.

Merit/NNP must/MD be/VB recognised/VBN and/CC rewarded/VBN ,/, specific/JJ skills/NNS training/NN should/MD be/VB a/DT sine/JJ qua/NN non/NN for/IN promotion/NN to/TO a/DT higher/JJR grade/NN ./.

The/DT promotions/NNS procedure/NN must/MD be/VB made/VBN fairer/JJR and/CC more/RBR transparent/JJ ./.

Last/JJ but/CC not/RB least/JJS the/DT pay/NN and/CC benefits/NNS package/NN must/MD be/VB reviewed/VBN ./.

It/PRP must/MD become/VB more/RBR flexible/JJ and/CC more/RBR responsible/JJ to/TO labour/NN market/NN conditions/NNS ./.

Commissioner/NNP Kinnock/NNP will/MD ,/, tomorrow/NN ,/, present/VB his/PRP$ communication/NN on/IN reform/NN ./.

This/DT communication/NN must/MD contain/VB a/DT clear/JJ timetable/NN ./.

With/IN a/DT new/JJ Commission/NN and/CC a/DT new/JJ Parliament/NNP up/RB and/CC running/VBG the/DT momentum/NN for/IN reform/NN is/VBZ now/RB as/RB strong/JJ as/IN it/PRP ever/RB has/VBZ been/VBN and/CC probably/RB ever/RB will/MD be/VB ./.

Enlargement/NNP of/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT few/JJ years/NNS away/RB ./.

Now/RB is/VBZ the/DT time/NN for/IN Europe/NNP to/TO put/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN ;/: to/TO instil/VB in/IN its/PRP$ institutions/NNS -/: as/IN the/DT independent/JJ experts/NNS might/MD have/VB said/VBD -/: a/DT sense/NN of/IN responsibility/NN ./.

In/IN June/NNP of/IN last/JJ year/NN Europe/NNP 's/POS voters/NNS gave/VBD a/DT clear/JJ signal/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP fed/VBN up/RP with/IN endless/JJ stories/NNS about/IN mismanagement/NN and/CC nepotism/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT very/RB simple/JJ way/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN those/DT stories/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP get/VB rid/JJ of/IN mismanagement/NN and/CC nepotism/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO be/VB misunderstood/VBN -/: I/PRP sincerely/RB hope/VBP this/DT does/VBZ not/RB happen/VB -/: and/CC I/PRP should/MD therefore/RB like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP am/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, in/IN favour/NN of/IN combating/VBG fraud/NN and/CC firmly/RB support/VB the/DT appropriate/JJ ,/, necessary/JJ reforms/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT straightforward/JJ issue/NN and/CC calls/NNS for/IN a/DT much/RB more/JJR wide-ranging/JJ analysis/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP shall/MD restrict/VB myself/PRP to/TO raising/VBG only/RB a/DT few/JJ points/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB people/NNS more/RBR aware/JJ ,/, if/IN possible/JJ ,/, of/IN what/WP we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN ./.

All/PDT the/DT experts/NNS can/MD provide/VB information/NN and/CC news/NN ,/, formulate/VB opinions/NNS and/CC give/VB advice/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, they/PRP have/VBP no/DT political/JJ or/CC elective/JJ responsibility/NN ,/, and/CC rightly/RB so/RB ./.

I/PRP nevertheless/RB believe/VBP that/IN politicians/NNS should/MD look/VB into/IN what/WP can/MD be/VB gleaned/VBN from/IN an/DT expert/NN report/NN and/CC what/WP can/MD not/RB be/VB taken/VBN en/IN masse/NN in/IN a/DT spirit/NN which/WDT ,/, on/IN some/DT occasions/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP felt/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN and/CC still/RB feel/VBP to/TO be/VB self-destructive/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB as/RB important/JJ for/IN no-one/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO or/CC have/VB to/TO refuse/VB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP or/CC its/PRP$ committees/NNS any/DT documentation/NN ./.

Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP must/MD possess/VB the/DT qualities/NNS of/IN morality/NN ,/, discipline/NN and/CC discretion/NN over/IN delegated/JJ issues/NNS innately/RB ,/, and/CC these/DT certainly/RB can/MD not/RB be/VB imposed/VBN on/IN them/PRP by/IN anyone/NN else/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT European/JJ legal/JJ system/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN a/DT different/JJ legal/JJ system/NN exists/VBZ in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

We/PRP run/VBP the/DT risk/NN of/IN delegating/VBG issues/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT same/JJ offences/NNS which/WDT will/MD then/RB be/VB punished/VBN in/IN different/JJ ways/NNS ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN an/DT investigation/NN system/NN should/MD be/VB introduced/VBN ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP also/RB absolutely/RB convinced/VBN that/IN we/PRP must/MD recognise/VB the/DT right/JJ to/TO equal/JJ respect/NN for/IN dignity/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT equal/JJ need/NN for/IN the/DT right/NN to/TO a/DT defence/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP opposed/VBN to/TO European/JJ Community/NNP officials/NNS being/VBG accused/VBN of/IN criminal/JJ acts/NNS at/IN the/DT drop/NN of/IN a/DT hat/NN :/: whistle-blowing/NN is/VBZ a/DT method/NN that/WDT has/VBZ no/DT place/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ millennium/NN ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Parliament/NNP must/MD introduce/VB a/DT principle/NN of/IN democracy/NN :/: we/PRP must/MD implement/VB reforms/NNS which/WDT allow/VBP Parliament/NNP to/TO grow/VB and/CC expand/VB its/PRP$ powers/NNS ,/, not/RB go/VB into/IN reverse/NN ./.

This/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT van/NNP Hulten/NNP report/NN brings/VBZ to/TO a/DT close/JJ one/NN of/IN the/DT most/RBS traumatic/JJ periods/NNS for/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS since/IN their/PRP$ creation/NN in/IN 1957/CD ./.

Those/DT of/IN us/PRP involved/VBN in/IN these/DT historic/JJ events/NNS are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ that/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT upheaval/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN caused/VBN had/VBD we/PRP not/RB acted/VBN with/IN parliamentary/JJ power/NN to/TO press/VB for/IN changes/NNS in/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP operated/VBD ./.

Remember/VB that/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP ,/, absent/JJ again/RB this/DT evening/NN from/IN our/PRP$ debate/NN ,/, approved/VBD the/DT 1997/CD discharge/NN -/: not/RB the/DT 1996/CD -/: on/IN the/DT very/JJ day/NN the/DT Commission/NNP itself/PRP resigned/VBD on/IN 15/CD March/NNP ./.

Now/RB we/PRP come/VBP to/TO the/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Experts/NNS which/WDT we/PRP already/RB had/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO welcome/VB and/CC briefly/RB debate/NN last/JJ September/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ greatest/JJS concern/NN in/IN the/DT EPP/NNP is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN public/JJ confidence/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ restored/VBN ./.

Further/JJ steps/NNS to/TO build/VB a/DT strong/JJ Europe/NNP will/MD be/VB to/TO no/DT avail/NN if/IN the/DT European/JJ peoples/NNS perceive/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT adequate/JJ system/NN of/IN democratic/JJ accountability/NN for/IN over-zealous/JJ officials/NNS ./.

Under/IN no/DT circumstances/NNS will/NN we/PRP concede/VBP ground/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP won/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ months/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP believe/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN openness/NN and/CC transparency/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB concerned/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT flurry/NN of/IN Commission/NNP announcements/NNS in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS by/IN Commissioner/NNP Kinnock/NNP suggesting/VBG policy/NN proposals/NNS of/IN various/JJ kinds/NNS to/TO be/VB put/VBN in/IN a/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP shortly/RB ./.

While/IN conveying/VBG a/DT desire/NN to/TO proceed/VB rapidly/RB ,/, it/PRP also/RB gives/VBZ the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ in/IN transmission/NN rather/RB than/IN listening/VBG mode/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ concern/NN is/VBZ strengthened/VBN if/IN the/DT rumour/NN reported/VBD a/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/IN is/VBZ true/JJ -/: namely/RB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO limit/VB severely/RB the/DT access/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO information/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT causes/NNS of/IN the/DT downfall/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

Have/VBP the/DT lessons/NNS not/RB been/VBN learnt/VBN ?/.

The/DT knowledge/NN that/IN the/DT framework/NN relations/NNS between/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP still/RB remain/VBP to/TO be/VB negotiated/VBN led/VBD to/TO our/PRP$ disagreement/NN with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN when/WRB we/PRP debated/VBN his/PRP$ report/NN in/IN committee/NN ./.

We/PRP could/MD ,/, in/IN no/DT way/NN ,/, agree/VB with/IN his/PRP$ view/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB demeaning/JJ for/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO set/VB out/RP detailed/JJ instructions/NNS as/RB to/TO what/WP we/PRP wanted/VBD the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO take/VB up/RP in/IN its/PRP$ reform/NN package/NN ./.

The/DT less/RBR precise/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP in/IN our/PRP$ resolutions/NNS ,/, the/DT more/JJR room/NN it/PRP gives/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC your/PRP$ former/JJ colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT Council/NNP to/TO do/VB what/WP they/PRP like/VBP ./.

We/PRP will/MD be/VB vigilant/VBN over/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS to/TO ensure/VB the/DT reforms/NNS now/RB being/VBG suggested/VBN are/VBP fully/RB implemented/VBN and/CC will/MD support/VB efforts/NNS made/VBN to/TO modernise/VB institutions/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, equally/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD not/RB hesitate/VB to/TO withdraw/VB our/PRP$ support/NN financially/RB or/CC otherwise/RB should/MD steps/RB be/VB taken/VBN which/WDT do/VBP not/RB correspond/VB to/TO the/DT openness/NN promised/VBN by/IN Commission/NNP President/NNP Romano/NNP Prodi/NNP prior/RB to/TO his/PRP$ nomination/NN ./.

Let/VB us/PRP hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD avoid/VB institutional/JJ upheavals/NNS by/IN having/VBG an/DT ongoing/JJ dialogue/NN which/WDT assumes/VBZ from/IN the/DT outset/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP will/MD be/VB an/DT equal/JJ partner/NN in/IN deciding/VBG the/DT outcome/NN of/IN Commission/NNP reform/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP must/MD start/VB by/IN apologising/VBG that/IN I/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB nearly/RB as/RB dramatic/JJ as/IN Mr/NNP Elles/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ presentation/NN ./.

Can/MD I/PRP first/RB thank/VB Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP for/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ report/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN wrong/JJ for/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO have/VB put/VBN in/IN willy/RB nilly/JJ every/DT single/JJ recommendation/NN that/WDT came/VBD from/IN an/DT external/JJ body/NN because/IN Parliament/NNP should/MD have/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ opinion/NN on/IN these/DT issues/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ for/IN us/PRP to/TO have/VB a/DT focused/JJ report/NN which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP has/VBZ produced/VBN ./.

Can/MD I/PRP invite/VB Mr/NNP Elles/NNP not/RB to/TO put/VB the/DT cart/NN before/IN the/DT horse/NN ./.

Yes/UH ,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN things/NNS were/VBD lost/VBN by/IN the/DT Socialists/NNPS but/CC they/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN won/VBN in/IN plenary/NN yet/RB ,/, and/CC may/MD I/PRP warn/VBP him/PRP that/IN may/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN tomorrow/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Commissioner/NNP Kinnock/NNP for/IN all/PDT his/PRP$ efforts/NNS so/RB far/RB ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN clear/JJ that/IN his/PRP$ commitment/NN has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO produce/VB a/DT radical/JJ change/NN ./.

Central/NNP to/TO this/DT is/VBZ the/DT attempt/NN to/TO produce/VB and/CC engender/VB responsibility/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN this/DT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB developed/VBN at/IN all/DT levels/NNS and/CC it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO recognise/VB the/DT needs/NNS of/IN each/DT level/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO see/VB a/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT Financial/NNP Regulation/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO stop/VB people/NNS passing/VBG the/DT buck/NN from/IN one/CD to/TO another/DT ./.

Where/WRB failure/NN is/VBZ occurring/VBG within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO hold/VB people/NNS responsible/JJ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB assured/VBN that/IN consistent/JJ under-performance/NN must/MD lead/VB to/TO dismissal/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ natural/JJ elsewhere/RB but/CC it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB an/DT extremely/RB radical/JJ suggestion/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ put/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB continue/VB with/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB incompetence/NN ,/, mismanagement/NN and/CC fraud/NN are/VBP costing/VBG the/DT European/JJ taxpayers/NNS money/NN and/CC providing/VBG them/PRP with/IN a/DT poor/JJ service/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB you/PRP one/CD example/NN of/IN this/DT ./.

In/IN the/DT 1998/CD Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS report/NN an/DT exchange/NN rate/NN miscalculation/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO Italian/JJ wine/NN cost/VBD the/DT taxpayers/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP GBP/NNP 8/CD to/TO 10/CD million/CD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN is/VBZ not/RB acceptable/JJ ./.

What/WP happened/VBD to/TO the/DT person/NN who/WP was/VBD responsible/JJ for/IN that/DT miscalculation/NN ?/.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT system/NN which/WDT provides/VBZ incentives/NNS and/CC promotion/NN and/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO see/VB this/DT promotion/NN based/VBN on/IN merit/NN ./.

We/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT officials/NNS within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP are/VBP extremely/RB hard-working/JJ ./.

But/CC we/PRP also/RB recognise/VBP that/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT practices/NNS are/VBP outdated/VBN ./.

We/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO reading/VBG the/DT full/JJ Commission/NNP proposal/NN on/IN reform/NN and/CC we/PRP look/VBP forward/RP to/TO working/VBG out/RP the/DT detail/NN alongside/IN the/DT Commission/NNP because/IN ,/, unlike/IN what/WP Mr/NNP Elles/NNP has/VBZ just/RB said/VBN ,/, the/DT Commissioner/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT commitment/NN to/TO discuss/VB it/PRP with/IN Parliament/NNP between/IN now/RB and/CC 1/CD March/NNP ./.

We/PRP also/RB need/VBP to/TO recognise/VB that/IN people/NNS who/WP live/VBP in/IN glasshouses/NNS should/MD not/RB throw/VB stones/NNS ./.

The/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP has/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB been/VBN clean/JJ in/IN its/PRP$ approach/NN to/TO things/NNS throughout/IN its/PRP$ history/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT long/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB before/IN we/PRP are/VBP perfect/JJ ourselves/PRP ./.

Our/PRP$ own/JJ staff/NN policy/NN is/VBZ outdated/VBN ./.

Some/DT of/IN our/PRP$ working/VBG practices/NNS need/VBP radical/JJ reform/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP will/MD be/VB hanging/VBG onto/IN the/DT coattails/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN this/DT reform/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP recognise/VBP the/DT proposals/NNS on/IN activity-based/JJ budgeting/NN ./.

We/PRP recognise/VBP that/IN means/VBZ discipline/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN Commission/NNP officials/NNS and/CC we/PRP recognise/VBP also/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT responsibility/NN within/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN discipline/NN when/WRB we/PRP talk/VBP about/IN negative/JJ priorities/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, can/NN I/NN say/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO work/VB on/IN its/PRP$ relationships/NNS with/IN the/DT public/NN ./.

European/JJ taxpayers/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB re-assured/JJ ./.

The/DT fate/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, of/IN the/DT whole/JJ European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, rests/VBZ on/IN delivery/NN of/IN this/DT reform/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT key/JJ issue/NN ,/, delivery/NN of/IN these/DT proposals/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO start/VB by/IN extending/VBG my/PRP$ compliments/NNS to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ,/, on/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ report/NN ./.

I/PRP very/RB much/RB admire/VBP him/PRP for/IN keeping/VBG his/PRP$ spirits/NNS up/RP at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD inundated/VBN with/IN so/RB many/JJ amendments/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP submitted/VBN an/DT amendment/NN to/TO this/DT effect/NN ./.

From/IN the/DT many/JJ points/NNS made/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP in/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO highlight/VB a/DT few/JJ ,/, not/RB necessarily/RB in/IN order/NN of/IN importance/NN but/CC just/RB randomly/RB ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD pay/VB much/RB more/JJR attention/NN to/TO the/DT proper/JJ storage/NN of/IN documents/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ records/NNS leave/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO be/VB desired/JJ ./.

We/PRP noticed/VBD this/DT when/WRB we/PRP had/VBD to/TO investigate/VB the/DT Flechard/NNP affair/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, as/IN it/PRP happens/VBZ ,/, has/VBZ still/RB not/RB been/VBN sorted/VBN out/RP ./.

Curiously/RB ,/, very/RB important/JJ documents/NNS had/VBD gone/VBN missing/VBG from/IN the/DT cabinets/NNS ,/, even/RB from/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT President/NNP and/CC of/IN various/JJ Directorates-General/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ clearly/RB something/NN which/WDT should/MD not/RB happen/VB ./.

If/IN Parliament/NNP want/VBP to/TO carry/VB out/RP proper/JJ inspections/NNS ,/, these/DT documents/NNS must/MD be/VB available/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO know/VB what/WP the/DT Commission/NNP intends/VBZ to/TO do/VB to/TO improve/VB this/DT situation/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB a/DT few/JJ words/NNS about/IN ex/FW post/VB financial/JJ control/NN ./.

This/DT has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN partly/RB dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN the/DT van/NNP Hulten/NNP report/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB useful/JJ if/IN we/PRP were/VBD to/TO give/VB report/NN figures/NNS per/IN category/NN and/CC per/IN sector/NN on/IN how/WRB the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ implemented/VBN ./.

The/DT general/JJ impression/NN at/IN present/NN is/VBZ that/IN anything/NN budget-related/NN within/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ bad/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN ,/, over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP noticed/VBN an/DT upward/JJ trend/NN in/IN agriculture/NN and/CC a/DT downward/JJ one/NN in/IN structural/JJ expenditure/NN ./.

Is/VBZ this/DT possible/JJ ?/.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO suggest/VB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP that/IN it/PRP prescribe/VBP a/DT deadline/NN by/IN which/WDT the/DT reforms/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP ./.

If/IN we/PRP admit/VBP new/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS then/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO put/VB our/PRP$ own/JJ House/NN in/IN order/NN first/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ./.

Here/RB improvements/NNS should/MD be/VB made/VBN ./.

Only/RB in/IN certain/JJ countries/NNS ,/, Germany/NNP for/IN example/NN ,/, is/VBZ there/RB specialised/JJ jurisdiction/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT promising/JJ avenue/NN to/TO explore/VB ,/, but/CC we/PRP must/MD also/RB explore/VB others/NNS ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO overstate/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN this/DT reform/NN ./.

It/PRP transcends/VBZ competition/NN ,/, it/PRP transcends/VBZ the/DT cohesion/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN it/PRP profoundly/RB affects/VBZ the/DT meaning/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN ,/, the/DT meaning/NN of/IN the/DT legitimacy/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP relying/VBG on/IN this/DT interinstitutional/JJ dialogue/NN to/TO put/VB the/DT finishing/VBG touches/NNS to/TO a/DT reform/NN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP all/RB hoping/VBG for/IN and/CC which/WDT we/PRP believe/VBP will/MD lead/VB us/PRP to/TO a/DT successful/JJ conclusion/NN under/IN your/PRP$ direction/NN and/CC with/IN our/PRP$ cooperation/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP heartily/RB congratulate/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT entire/JJ European/NNP Parliament/NNP for/IN the/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN interest/NN shown/VBN in/IN competition-related/JJ subjects/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT joint/JJ debate/NN fully/RB bears/VBZ this/DT out/RP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN some/DT very/RB thorough/JJ observations/NNS which/WDT both/DT concern/NN the/DT philosophy/NN of/IN economic/JJ policy/NN and/CC are/VBP important/JJ for/IN the/DT institutional/JJ order/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ common/JJ aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO reform/VB and/CC strengthen/VB competition/NN policy/NN ,/, a/DT pillar/NN of/IN the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN and/CC of/IN European/JJ construction/NN ./.

The/DT guiding/VBG thread/NN running/VBG through/IN all/PDT the/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN competition/NN policy/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP shall/MD have/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO address/VB together/RB ,/, aims/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB more/RBR effective/JJ protection/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, reduce/VB the/DT bureaucratic/JJ burden/NN weighing/VBG down/RP businesses/NNS and/CC take/VB decision-making/JJ processes/NNS closer/RBR to/TO the/DT European/JJ people/NNS ./.

I/PRP ,/, personally/RB ,/, would/MD sincerely/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ commitment/NN in/IN examining/VBG the/DT dossier/NN on/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP and/CC for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO divide/VB the/DT considerations/NNS raised/VBN during/IN this/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT von/NNP Wogau/NNP report/NN into/IN four/CD groups/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB these/DT considerations/NNS to/TO be/VB criticisms/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, but/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, fundamental/JJ contributions/NNS ,/, since/IN justified/JJ concerns/NNS have/VBP been/VBN expressed/VBN that/IN we/PRP both/DT want/VBP to/TO overcome/VB ./.

The/DT groups/NNS are/VBP :/: the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT rules/NNS ,/, the/DT risk/NN of/IN renationalisation/NN ,/, consistent/JJ application/NN of/IN the/DT rules/NNS and/CC legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD take/VB these/DT very/RB quickly/RB one/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN ./.

Efficiency/RB :/: I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN this/DT reform/NN will/MD strengthen/VB the/DT protection/NN of/IN competition/NN within/IN the/DT single/JJ market/NN rather/RB than/IN weaken/VB it/PRP ./.

Of/IN course/NN we/PRP have/VBP pondered/VBN this/DT issue/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP still/RB studying/VBG it/PRP extremely/RB carefully/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ also/RB thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT concerns/NNS you/PRP have/VBP voiced/VBN ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, I/PRP honestly/RB do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN this/DT fear/NN is/VBZ justified/JJ ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN accords/VBZ the/DT Commission/NNP a/DT central/JJ role/NN in/IN establishing/VBG guidelines/NNS on/IN competition/NN policy/NN ./.

The/DT reform/NN does/VBZ not/RB entail/VB any/DT reduction/NN in/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ activities/NNS ,/, but/CC requires/VBZ them/PRP to/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ dossiers/NNS ./.

The/DT reform/NN will/MD lead/VB to/TO a/DT gradual/JJ development/NN -/: I/PRP stress/VBP this/DT because/IN I/PRP was/VBD particularly/RB taken/VBN with/IN this/DT term/NN ,/, used/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Randzio-Plath/NNP ,/, and/CC ,/, moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP fully/RB agree/VBP with/IN it/PRP -/: of/IN European/JJ competition/NN culture/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, the/DT reform/NN will/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT various/JJ national/JJ competition/NN cultures/NNS being/VBG transplanted/VBN and/CC taking/VBG root/NN in/IN the/DT European/JJ competition/NN culture/NN -/: where/WRB today/NN various/JJ small/JJ plants/NNS thrive/VBP ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB not/RB all/DT the/DT same/JJ ./.

The/DT fifteen/CD sets/NNS of/IN national/JJ provisions/NNS will/MD gradually/RB be/VB abandoned/VBN ,/, permitting/VBG greater/JJR use/NN of/IN Community/NNP law/NN ,/, which/WDT a/DT higher/JJR number/NN of/IN protagonists/NNS will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO apply/VB ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN this/DT is/VBZ communitisation/NN ,/, not/RB renationalisation/JJ ,/, of/IN competition/NN law/NN ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN consistent/JJ application/NN :/: the/DT risk/NN of/IN inconsistent/JJ application/NN of/IN competition/NN rules/NNS must/MD be/VB borne/VBN in/IN mind/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN it/PRP should/MD be/VB exaggerated/JJ ./.

As/IN with/IN many/JJ other/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, Articles/CD 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC 82/CD have/VBP ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, been/VBN applied/VBN for/IN decades/NNS by/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC judges/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB feel/VB that/IN this/DT has/VBZ created/VBN serious/JJ problems/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT directly/RB applicable/JJ exception/NN system/NN ,/, consistency/NN will/MD depend/VB firstly/RB on/IN the/DT degree/NN of/IN clarity/NN of/IN the/DT material/NN rules/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP will/MD make/VB every/DT effort/NN to/TO define/VB the/DT legislative/JJ framework/NN ,/, both/DT through/IN general/JJ provisions/NNS and/CC through/IN its/PRP$ decision-making/JJ practice/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO set/VB efficient/JJ mechanisms/NNS in/IN place/NN to/TO prevent/VB disputes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP sets/VBZ out/RP mechanisms/NNS for/IN information/NN and/CC consultation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB something/NN about/IN the/DT excellent/JJ idea/NN put/VBN forward/RB by/IN Mrs/NNP Riis-J脙啪rgensen/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Huhne/NNP of/IN monitoring/NN implementation/NN ./.

This/DT then/RB is/VBZ the/DT idea/NN of/IN monitoring/NN implementation/NN ./.

I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN I/PRP find/VBP this/DT a/DT very/RB good/JJ idea/NN that/IN we/PRP will/MD probably/RB take/VB up/RP ./.

Though/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT high/JJ respect/NN for/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN national/JJ competition/NN authorities/NNS and/CC so/RB on/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ evident/JJ that/IN we/PRP will/MD watch/VB very/RB carefully/RB how/WRB EC/NNP law/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN by/IN national/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC courts/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO keep/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO withdraw/VB a/DT case/NN from/IN a/DT national/JJ competition/NN authority/NN in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN incorrect/JJ application/NN ./.

This/DT goes/VBZ at/IN least/JJS some/DT way/NN towards/IN alleviating/VBG your/PRP$ concerns/NNS ,/, Mrs/NNP Peijs/NNP ./.

Concerning/VBG Mr/NNP Evans/NNP '/POS point/NN regarding/VBG the/DT implications/NNS for/IN businesses/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN the/DT cost-benefit/JJ analysis/NN should/MD be/VB seriously/RB conducted/VBN ./.

The/DT purpose/NN of/IN publishing/VBG the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, to/TO collect/VB comments/NNS from/IN businesses/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN from/IN other/JJ sources/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP received/VBN many/JJ excellent/JJ observations/NNS and/CC contributions/NNS which/WDT give/VBP us/PRP the/DT material/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT cost-benefit/JJ assessment/NN for/IN business/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD examine/VB all/PDT that/DT material/NN carefully/RB before/IN making/VBG a/DT legislative/JJ proposal/NN for/IN a/DT new/JJ regulation/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD point/NN about/IN the/DT impact/NN for/IN firms/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ of/IN great/JJ importance/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD raised/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Thyssen/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Peijs/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Palacio/NNP Vallelersundi/NNP :/: the/DT issue/NN of/IN SMEs/NNP ./.

Many/JJ speakers/NNS have/VBP underlined/VBD this/DT ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ paying/VBG particular/JJ attention/NN to/TO legal/JJ certainty/NN for/IN SMEs/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG a/DT system/NN which/WDT considerably/RB improves/VBZ legal/JJ certainty/NN for/IN SMEs/NNP ./.

Is/VBZ this/DT simply/RB a/DT political/JJ gesture/NN ?/.

In/IN the/DT system/NN we/PRP propose/VBP reforming/VBG our/PRP$ substantive/JJ rules/NNS in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN most/JJS SMEs/NNPS will/MD be/VB covered/VBN by/IN block/NN exemption/NN regulations/NNS ,/, as/RB in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN vertical/JJ restraints/NNS ./.

Most/JJS SMEs/NNPS have/VBP in/IN fact/NN less/JJR than/IN 30/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN share/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP a/DT de/FW minimis/NN notice/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ a/DT declaration/NN that/IN since/IN SMEs/NNP are/VBP not/RB involved/VBN in/IN market/NN dominance/NN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB normally/RB subject/JJ to/TO the/DT strict/JJ prohibition/NN under/IN Article/NNP 81/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 1/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT fourth/JJ group/NN is/VBZ legal/JJ certainty/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Evans/NNP ,/, legal/JJ certainty/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN -/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO acknowledge/VB this/DT -/: important/JJ for/IN businesses/NNS ,/, not/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT legal/JJ professions/NNS ,/, although/IN the/DT latter/NN do/VBP play/VB an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- FR/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- Mrs/NNP Thyssen/NNP also/RB referred/VBD to/TO the/DT matter/NN of/IN legal/JJ privilege/NN for/IN company/NN lawyers/NNS ./.

Let/VB me/PRP simply/RB remind/VB you/PRP that/IN the/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP pronounced/VBD a/DT ruling/NN on/IN this/DT in/IN 1982/CD ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP better/RBR than/IN I/PRP ./.

This/DT ruling/NN remains/VBZ valid/JJ and/CC there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO justify/VB any/DT reconsideration/NN thereof/RB ./.

The/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP requires/VBZ only/RB a/DT single/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN to/TO be/VB re-examined/JJ :/: the/DT exchange/NN of/IN confidential/JJ information/NN ./.

The/DT guarantees/NNS which/WDT companies/NNS must/MD be/VB given/VBN are/VBP currently/RB under/IN discussion/NN ./.

-LRB-/-LRB- IT/PRP -RRB-/-RRB- I/PRP shall/MD now/RB quickly/RB turn/VB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP '/POS s/VBZ report/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB him/PRP sincerely/RB for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN his/PRP$ work/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT broad/JJ endorsement/NN given/VBN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NNP XXVIIIth/NNP Annual/NNP Report/NNP on/IN Competition/NNP Policy/NNP ./.

We/PRP share/VBP the/DT same/JJ basic/JJ views/NNS but/CC the/DT Rapkay/NNP report/NN lays/VBZ emphasis/NN on/IN several/JJ points/NNS that/IN we/PRP shall/MD need/VB to/TO consider/VB very/RB carefully/RB ./.

I/PRP will/MD mention/VB only/RB two/CD ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB brief/JJ ./.

The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ greater/JJR transparency/RB ./.

Parliament/NNP knows/VBZ how/WRB important/JJ we/PRP all/RB consider/VB the/DT question/NN of/IN transparency/NN in/IN competition/NN policy/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP did/VBD right/JJ from/IN the/DT moment/NN I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$ hearing/NN ,/, on/IN 1/CD September/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS ./.

Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB you/PRP just/RB as/RB warmly/RB for/IN your/PRP$ report/NN on/IN the/DT seventh/JJ survey/NN on/IN State/NNP aid/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

I/PRP will/MD not/RB talk/VB about/IN codecision/NN here/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT certainly/RB does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB I/PRP do/VBP not/RB consider/VB it/PRP important/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ major/JJ institutional/JJ implications/NNS which/WDT obviously/RB go/VBP beyond/IN the/DT specific/JJ area/NN of/IN competition/NN ;/: I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB not/RB qualified/VBN to/TO give/VB an/DT opinion/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT matter/NN for/IN the/DT broader/JJR context/NN of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO your/PRP$ suggestions/NNS ,/, Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP ,/, you/PRP already/RB know/VBP that/IN my/PRP$ staff/NN ,/, who/WP ,/, although/IN short-handed/JJ as/IN usual/JJ ,/, are/VBP fortunately/RB highly/RB qualified/VBN ,/, are/VBP working/VBG hard/RB to/TO produce/VB the/DT register/NN of/IN State/NNP aids/NNS and/CC the/DT State/NNP aids/NNS `/`` scoreboard/JJ '/'' ./.

I/PRP am/VBP awaiting/VBG with/IN great/JJ interest/NN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT eighth/JJ survey/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT scheduled/JJ timeframe/NN ,/, should/MD be/VB being/VBG drawn/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT staff/NN now/RB ,/, in/IN January/NNP ,/, and/CC for/IN adoption/NN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN March/NNP 2000/CD ,/, to/TO see/VB whether/IN the/DT latest/JJS trends/NNS are/VBP confirmed/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP Jonckheer/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Thyssen/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Gemelli/NNP raised/VBD the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN preparation/NN of/IN the/DT candidate/NN countries/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN competition/NN in/IN general/JJ and/CC of/IN State/NNP aid/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB say/VB very/RB briefly/NN ,/, that/IN we/PRP are/VBP actively/RB working/VBG with/IN them/PRP on/IN a/DT practical/JJ level/NN :/: they/PRP are/VBP making/VBG preparations/NNS ,/, they/PRP now/RB all/RB have/VBP competition/NN laws/NNS and/CC are/VBP setting/VBG up/RP the/DT relevant/JJ authorities/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD also/RB say/VB ,/, in/IN respect/NN of/IN your/PRP$ concerns/NNS on/IN energy/NN and/CC especially/RB on/IN the/DT environment/NN -/: which/WDT ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP share/VBP -/: that/IN we/PRP are/VBP concluding/VBG the/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT organisation/NN of/IN environmental/JJ State/NN aid/NN ./.

In/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN State/NNP aid/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO take/VB up/RP one/CD of/IN the/DT points/NNS raised/VBN by/IN Mrs/NNP Riis-J脙啪rgensen/NNP ,/, among/IN others/NNS regarding/VBG repayment/NN of/IN illegal/JJ aid/NN ./.

In/IN April/NNP 1999/CD ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP adopted/VBD new/JJ Rules/NNS of/IN Procedure/NNP which/WDT introduced/VBD specific/JJ rules/NNS on/IN repayment/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP can/MD assure/VB you/PRP of/IN this/DT -/: you/PRP will/MD see/VB just/RB how/WRB seriously/RB we/PRP mean/VBP to/TO take/VB these/DT rules/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP Langen/NNP warmly/RB for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, although/IN geared/CD more/RBR towards/IN a/DT specific/JJ sector/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT valuable/JJ contribution/NN ./.

In/IN respect/NN of/IN future/JJ provisions/NNS on/IN aid/NN for/IN the/DT steel/NN sector/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD come/VB into/IN force/NN in/IN July/NNP 2002/CD ,/, we/PRP will/MD ensure/VB that/IN strict/JJ discipline/NN continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB applied/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT industry/NN itself/PRP now/RB agrees/VBZ on/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN this/DT ./.

When/WRB we/PRP have/VBP finalised/VBN our/PRP$ proposal/NN on/IN the/DT new/JJ rules/NNS and/CC decided/VBN on/IN the/DT most/RBS suitable/JJ legal/JJ form/NN ,/, I/PRP will/MD be/VB happy/JJ to/TO present/VB our/PRP$ viewpoint/NN to/TO you/PRP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP especially/RB grateful/JJ for/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP will/MD continue/VB the/DT interinstitutional/JJ dialogue/NN opened/VBN with/IN the/DT Committee/NNP for/IN Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, and/CC ,/, at/IN a/DT more/RBR general/JJ level/NN ,/, with/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, I/PRP liked/VBD your/PRP$ term/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Palacio/NNP Vallelersundi/NNP :/: we/PRP must/MD all/RB pull/VB together/RB ,/, preferably/RB in/IN the/DT same/JJ direction/NN ./.

Competition/NN is/VBZ not/RB an/DT end/NN in/IN itself/PRP ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Rapkay/NNP rightly/RB pointed/VBD out/RP ,/, but/CC it/PRP plays/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB important/JJ role/NN in/IN European/JJ integration/NN ./.

As/IN Mr/NNP von/NNP Wogau/NNP said/VBD at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT debate/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN competition/NN is/VBZ not/RB an/DT abstract/JJ concept/NN :/: it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT public/JJ interest/NN and/CC forms/NNS the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT social/JJ market/NN economy/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN competition/NN policy/NN will/MD play/VB a/DT valuable/JJ social/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN economic/JJ ,/, role/NN in/IN the/DT European/JJ integration/NN process/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP Monti/NNP ./.

The/DT joint/JJ debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 12/CD p.m./RB Protection/NNP under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP 's/POS financial/JJ interests/NNS ./.

The/DT next/JJ item/NN is/VBZ the/DT report/NN -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0002/JJ //NNP 2000/CD -RRB-/-RRB- by/IN Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ,/, containing/VBG Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ recommendations/NNS to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN introducing/VBG protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, year/NN after/IN year/NN we/PRP learn/VBP ,/, mainly/RB from/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Auditors/NNS '/POS test/NN reports/NNS ,/, that/IN money/NN is/VBZ lost/VBN to/TO the/DT budget/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP on/IN account/NN of/IN misdemeanours/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN wastage/NN ,/, mismanagement/NN ,/, and/CC irregularities/NNS to/TO suspected/VBN blatant/JJ fraud/NN ./.

For/IN some/DT time/NN now/RB ,/, these/DT abuses/NNS have/VBP meant/VBN that/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN called/VBN upon/RB to/TO initiate/VB measures/NNS that/WDT should/MD serve/VB to/TO protect/VB the/DT European/JJ taxpayer/NN '/POS s/JJ money/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, when/WRB all/DT is/VBZ said/VBN and/CC done/VBN ,/, is/VBZ what/WP sustains/VBZ the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ budget/NN ./.

Particular/JJ attention/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO combating/VBG fraud/NN ,/, to/TO detecting/VBG it/PRP ,/, punishing/VBG those/DT guilty/JJ of/IN it/PRP and/CC preventing/VBG it/PRP from/IN happening/VBG ./.

Creating/VBG UCLAF/NNP by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT Task/NNP Force/NNP and/CC setting/VBG up/RP the/DT anti-fraud/JJ office/NN OLAF/NN were/VBD important/JJ steps/NNS ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT regulation/NN on/IN protecting/VBG the/DT financial/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT Community/NNP and/CC on/IN local/JJ monitoring/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP can/MD only/RB impose/VB sanctions/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN pertaining/VBG to/TO administrative/JJ law/NN when/WRB cases/NNS are/VBP exposed/VBN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, efforts/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO ask/VB for/IN improperly/RB obtained/VBD money/NN to/TO be/VB returned/VBN only/RB had/VBD limited/VBN success/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ for/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO undertake/VB criminal/JJ measures/NNS ./.

Since/IN there/EX is/VBZ often/RB overlap/VBG between/IN the/DT two/CD legal/JJ angles/NNS and/CC cross-border/JJ violations/NNS against/IN the/DT Union/NNP budget/NN are/VBP on/IN the/DT increase/NN -/: they/PRP are/VBP also/RB committed/VBN by/IN those/DT involved/VBN in/IN organised/JJ crime/NN -/: it/PRP is/VBZ unclear/JJ as/RB to/TO where/WRB the/DT responsibility/NN lies/VBZ amongst/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Then/RB there/EX are/VBP differences/NNS between/IN the/DT national/JJ legal/JJ requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT individual/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, together/RB with/IN protracted/JJ or/CC even/RB unfulfilled/JJ requests/NNS for/IN mutual/JJ assistance/NN in/IN law/NN enforcement/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ more/JJR ,/, the/DT agreement/NN on/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN financial/JJ interests/NNS and/CC the/DT two/CD subsequent/JJ protocols/NNS signed/VBN by/IN the/DT European/JJ Council/NN in/IN 1995/CD did/VBD nothing/NN to/TO change/VB this/DT ./.

For/IN it/PRP to/TO enter/VB into/IN force/NN ,/, it/PRP must/MD be/VB ratified/VBN by/IN all/DT 15/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

After/IN five/CD years/NNS only/RB four/CD have/VBP done/VBN so/RB ./.

This/DT state/NN of/IN deadlock/NN ,/, which/WDT threatens/VBZ to/TO undermine/VB the/DT credibility/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, has/VBZ inspired/VBN Parliament/NNP to/TO initiate/VB the/DT setting-up/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT intention/NN whatsoever/RB to/TO create/VB a/DT transnational/JJ criminal/JJ law/NN and/CC judicial/JJ authority/NN ,/, rather/RB the/DT aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO equip/VB the/DT Union/NNP with/IN specific/JJ instruments/NNS for/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN its/PRP$ financial/JJ interests/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ whilst/RB upholding/VBG the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP giving/VBG new/JJ life/NN to/TO this/DT idea/NN with/IN this/DT report/NN and/CC call/NN upon/IN the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO present/VB legislative/JJ proposals/NNS that/WDT will/MD enable/VB this/DT goal/NN to/TO be/VB realised/VBN ./.

The/DT concerns/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, as/IN articulated/VBD in/IN its/PRP$ position/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Citizens/NNP '/POS Freedoms/NNPS and/CC Rights/NNPS ,/, Justice/NNP and/CC Home/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, will/MD also/RB be/VB taken/VBN full/JJ account/NN of/IN in/IN this/DT process/NN ./.

We/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB two/CD recommendations/NNS arising/VBG from/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN OLAF/NNP and/CC which/WDT should/MD safeguard/VB its/PRP$ operational/JJ and/CC legal/JJ efficiency/NN ,/, transparency/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT protection/NN of/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN individuals/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP need/VBP -/: and/CC this/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ first/JJ recommendation/NN -/: a/DT legislative/JJ act/NN that/WDT includes/VBZ those/DT offences/VBZ which/WDT are/VBP to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN which/WDT main/JJ principles/NNS are/VBP firmly/RB established/VBN ./.

I/PRP support/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN deadline/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP being/VBG 30/CD September/NNP in/IN a/DT proposed/VBN amendment/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ recommendation/NN relates/VBZ to/TO criminal/JJ proceedings/NNS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ought/MD -/: and/CC I/PRP have/VBP also/RB amended/VBD this/DT deadline/NN to/TO 31/CD May/NNP 2000/CD -/: to/TO propose/VB a/DT legislative/JJ act/NN on/IN the/DT establishment/NN of/IN an/DT independent/JJ body/NN which/WDT has/VBZ institutional/JJ links/NNS with/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, for/IN coordinating/VBG and/CC supervising/VBG the/DT legal/JJ investigative/JJ body/NN OLAF/NN ./.

The/DT existing/VBG monitoring/NN committee/NN can/MD only/RB monitor/VB the/DT independence/NN of/IN the/DT Director/NNP of/IN the/DT agency/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN this/DT influencing/VBG the/DT administration/NN of/IN justice/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT Court/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP is/VBZ to/TO monitor/VB the/DT legality/NN of/IN the/DT legislative/JJ acts/NNS ./.

Further/JJ support/NN for/IN this/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ also/RB to/TO be/VB found/VBN in/IN the/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT so-called/JJ Five/CD Wise/NNP Men/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Barnier/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Vitorino/NNP and/CC several/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP equally/RB receptive/JJ to/TO the/DT idea/NN ./.

I/PRP call/VBP upon/IN you/PRP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP adopted/VBD with/IN a/DT large/JJ majority/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD set/VB another/DT example/NN here/RB ,/, to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ taking/VBG action/NN to/TO prevent/VB mismanagement/NN and/CC in/IN particular/JJ ,/, fraud/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO mete/VB out/RP punishment/NN where/WRB necessary/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO take/VB the/DT floor/NN in/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN this/DT report/NN and/CC I/PRP congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT report/NN for/IN which/WDT cooperation/NN between/IN committees/NNS has/VBZ worked/VBN very/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT result/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP received/VBN today/NN ,/, is/VBZ moderate/JJ and/CC thoughtful/JJ in/IN a/DT very/RB delicate/JJ area/NN ./.

This/DT moderation/NN and/CC thoughtfulness/NNS is/VBZ particularly/RB necessary/JJ in/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN Article/NNP 280/CD -LRB-/-LRB- 4/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

If/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO give/VB a/DT prize/NN for/IN the/DT article/NN which/WDT was/VBD most/RBS difficult/JJ to/TO understand/VB ,/, least/RBS clear/JJ and/CC most/RBS confused/VBN -/: however/RB you/PRP like/VBP to/TO put/VB it/PRP -/: the/DT competition/NN would/MD be/VB very/RB hard/RB fought/VBN ./.

The/DT Treaty/NNP is/VBZ a/DT collection/NN of/IN complex/JJ articles/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, this/DT one/NN would/MD undoubtedly/RB be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT firm/NN favourites/NNS to/TO win/VB such/PDT a/DT prize/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT especially/RB delicate/JJ issue/NN because/IN it/PRP deals/VBZ with/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS ,/, as/IN Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP has/VBZ explained/VBN very/RB well/RB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ -/: and/CC this/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT steadfast/JJ champion/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN -/: of/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO protect/VB the/DT financial/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT Community/NNP ./.

But/CC be/VB careful/JJ ./.

The/DT conclusions/NNS of/IN the/DT Theato/NNP report/NN safeguard/VB them/PRP perfectly/RB ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ capacity/NN as/IN president/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Legal/NNP Affairs/NNPS and/CC the/DT Internal/NNP Market/NNP ,/, and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, as/IN an/DT MEP/NNP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN a/DT large/JJ majority/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP will/MD support/VB this/DT report/NN and/CC that/IN it/PRP will/MD be/VB well/RB implemented/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT ,/, as/IN Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP said/VBD ,/, is/VBZ a/DT critical/JJ report/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT report/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT own-initiative/JJ report/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB we/PRP were/VBD very/RB keen/JJ to/TO bring/VB this/DT forward/RB was/VBD because/IN ,/, whether/IN we/PRP like/VBP it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ a/DT reputation/NN for/IN fraud/NN and/CC mismanagement/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ sometimes/RB exaggerated/JJ but/CC there/RB it/PRP is/VBZ ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB something/NN about/IN it/PRP ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT measures/NNS we/PRP have/VBP put/VBN in/IN place/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN have/VBP not/RB been/VBN honoured/VBN by/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS -/: and/CC let/VB us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN implementing/VBG about/RB 80/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP budget/NN ./.

A/DT lot/NN of/IN them/PRP have/VBP not/RB signed/VBN up/RP to/TO or/CC not/RB ratified/VBD the/DT Convention/NN on/IN the/DT Protection/NNP of/IN Financial/NNP Interests/NNPS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB it/PRP was/VBD clear/JJ that/IN something/NN more/RBR radical/JJ needed/VBD to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB this/DT responsibility/NN seriously/RB ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO prosecute/VB people/NNS who/WP commit/VBP fraud/NN against/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

The/DT question/NN is/VBZ :/: who/WP prosecutes/VBZ ?/.

That/DT is/VBZ where/WRB we/PRP really/RB get/VBP into/IN difficulty/NN ./.

Whose/WP$ responsibility/NN is/VBZ it/PRP when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN a/DT body/NN that/WDT crosses/VBZ so/RB many/JJ frontiers/NNS ?/.

We/PRP need/VBP also/RB to/TO be/VB sensitive/JJ to/TO the/DT concerns/NNS of/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT proposal/NN to/TO set/VB up/RP a/DT European/JJ public/JJ prosecutor/NN service/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB sensitive/JJ one/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ that/IN an/DT all-out/JJ federal/JJ approach/NN and/CC a/DT situation/NN where/WRB a/DT European/JJ judicial/JJ authority/NN takes/VBZ precedence/NN over/IN the/DT national/JJ judicial/JJ authorities/NNS is/VBZ a/DT step/NN too/RB far/RB for/IN some/DT people/NNS ./.

But/CC the/DT discussion/NN needs/VBZ to/TO begin/VB and/CC we/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB calling/VBG on/IN the/DT IGC/NNP to/TO start/VB discussions/NNS ./.

Of/IN most/JJS importance/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT guardian/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO deal/VB with/IN people/NNS who/WP work/VBP within/IN the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP institutions/NNS ./.

Patently/RB we/PRP have/VBP here/RB an/DT instrument/NN that/WDT is/VBZ appropriate/JJ for/IN the/DT policies/NNS which/WDT we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO implement/VB ./.

I/PRP would/MD stress/VB the/DT LIFE-NATURE/NN strand/VBN in/IN particular/JJ ./.

And/CC ,/, for/IN want/VBP of/IN appropriations/NNS ,/, we/PRP lose/VBP this/DT legitimacy/NN and/CC allow/VB the/DT idea/NN that/IN these/DT European/JJ directives/NNS of/IN ours/PRP are/VBP not/RB reasonable/JJ and/CC are/VBP not/RB applicable/JJ to/TO develop/VB ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP these/DT comitology/JJ debates/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO most/JJS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ programmes/NNS and/CC instruments/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/DT in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN -/: and/CC the/DT experiences/NNS we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN tend/VBP to/TO show/VB this/DT -/: that/IN reconciling/VBG opinions/NNS on/IN comitology/NN is/VBZ rather/RB easier/JJR than/IN reconciling/VBG opinions/NNS on/IN the/DT budget/NN ./.

Let/VB me/PRP point/VBP out/RP that/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ asking/VBG for/IN 850/CD million/CD ecus/NNS in/IN appropriations/NNS ,/, not/RB a/DT vast/JJ sum/NN in/IN the/DT Community/NNP budget/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT current/JJ proposals/NNS are/VBP for/IN 613/CD million/CD ecus/NNS ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP ,/, at/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, that/IN for/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ application/NN of/IN LIFE/NNP ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, there/EX would/MD be/VB some/DT way/NN for/IN the/DT Union/NNP to/TO make/VB a/DT significant/JJ budgetary/JJ gesture/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ plenty/RB of/IN time/NN to/TO formulate/VB its/PRP$ ideas/NNS and/CC that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ submitting/VBG its/PRP$ proposals/NNS to/TO us/PRP only/RB a/DT few/JJ months/NNS before/IN the/DT fateful/JJ date/NN ./.

As/IN for/IN us/PRP ,/, we/PRP our/PRP$ bound/VBN by/IN the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT texts/NNS :/: a/DT maximum/NN of/IN four/CD months/NNS ./.

We/PRP meet/VBP our/PRP$ deadlines/NNS and/CC afterwards/RB we/PRP are/VBP told/VBN that/IN we/PRP should/MD hold/VB on/RP and/CC that/IN in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB reasonable/JJ we/PRP must/MD go/VB along/RP with/IN the/DT position/NN of/IN the/DT others/NNS ,/, because/IN in/IN the/DT codecision/NN procedure/NN there/EX is/VBZ just/RB not/RB enough/JJ time/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, on/IN this/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, the/DT budget/NN issue/NN is/VBZ a/DT central/JJ one/NN and/CC Parliament/NNP can/MD not/RB yield/VB to/TO the/DT blackmail/NN which/WDT requires/VBZ it/PRP to/TO be/VB the/DT only/RB reasonable/JJ party/NN in/IN the/DT deal/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP in/IN open/JJ disagreement/NN on/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT choices/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP will/MD refer/VB to/TO this/DT later/RB on/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ equally/RB true/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP should/MD begin/VB by/IN saying/VBG that/IN this/DT regulation/NN is/VBZ better/RBR than/IN those/DT covering/VBG LIFE/NNP I/NNP and/CC LIFE/NNP II/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ better/RBR firstly/JJ because/IN the/DT framework/NN proposal/NN made/VBD LIFE/VB I/PRP more/RBR rigorous/JJ ,/, more/RBR transparent/JJ and/CC more/RBR rational/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT aims/NNS that/IN LIFE-Environment/NNP must/MD achieve/VB ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN has/VBZ for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN introduced/VBN upgrading/VBG and/CC planning/VBG for/IN coastal/JJ areas/NNS as/IN one/CD of/IN LIFE-Environment/NNP '/POS s/JJ priorities/NNS is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB positive/JJ step/NN ./.

In/IN spite/NN of/IN all/PDT its/PRP$ virtues/NNS though/RB ,/, LIFE/NNP III/NNP '/POS s/JJ regulation/NN fails/VBZ in/IN what/WP is/VBZ obviously/RB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ aspect/NN of/IN determining/VBG a/DT financial/JJ instrument/NN '/POS s/JJ impact/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ its/PRP$ budget/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC the/DT Council/NNP to/TO know/VB that/IN we/PRP will/MD not/RB give/VB up/RP trying/VBG to/TO provide/VB LIFE/NNP with/IN the/DT budget/NN it/PRP deserves/VBZ and/CC which/WDT best/RB guarantees/VBZ the/DT environmental/JJ results/NNS that/IN we/PRP are/VBP seeking/VBG to/TO achieve/VB with/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN instrument/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP four/CD very/RB straightforward/JJ arguments/NNS which/WDT we/PRP feel/VBP justify/VB our/PRP$ choice/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, LIFE/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/RB direct/JJ financial/JJ instrument/NN which/WDT is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO promote/VB environmental/JJ policy/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT other/JJ such/JJ policy/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, LIFE/NNP is/VBZ an/DT instrument/NN that/WDT has/VBZ already/RB produced/VBN good/JJ results/NNS ,/, and/CC has/VBZ enabled/VBN innovative/JJ methods/NNS and/CC techniques/NNS to/TO be/VB developed/VBN and/CC has/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ rate/NN of/IN implementation/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT LIFE/NNP budget/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reduced/VBN in/IN real/JJ terms/NNS has/VBZ not/RB kept/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT enormous/JJ dynamism/NN and/CC creativity/NN of/IN demand/NN ./.

Fourthly/RB ,/, as/IN Parliament/NNP ascribes/VBZ so/RB much/JJ value/NN to/TO LIFE/VB ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ allocated/VBN ever-greater/JJ appropriations/NNS to/TO this/DT project/NN in/IN its/PRP$ annual/JJ budget/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN approving/VBG the/DT proposal/NN put/VBN forward/RB by/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP would/MD represent/VB an/DT unacceptable/JJ reversal/NN of/IN this/DT trend/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ concern/NN does/VBZ not/RB centre/RB purely/RB on/IN the/DT budgetary/JJ issue/NN ,/, however/RB ./.

Climate/NN change/NN and/CC water/NN policy/NN are/VBP subjects/NNS that/WDT are/VBP of/IN great/JJ concern/NN to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN and/CC which/WDT have/VBP deserved/VBD considerable/JJ attention/NN from/IN this/DT House/NNP ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB feel/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ that/IN as/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 5/CD and/CC 6/CD seek/VBP to/TO establish/VB as/IN objectives/NNS which/WDT LIFE-Environment/NNP should/MD achieve/VB a/DT plan/NN for/IN the/DT sustainable/JJ management/NN of/IN ground/NN water/NN and/CC surface/VB water/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN reducing/VBG greenhouse/NN gases/NNS ,/, they/PRP should/MD be/VB adopted/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, LIFE/RB is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/NNP most/RBS important/JJ instrument/NN and/CC indeed/RB its/PRP$ only/RB financial/JJ instrument/NN dedicated/VBN exclusively/RB to/TO the/DT environment/NN ./.

That/DT explains/VBZ why/WRB this/DT instrument/NN must/MD live/VB up/RP to/TO our/PRP$ ambitions/NNS ,/, ambitions/NNS for/IN which/WDT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT price/NN ./.

Obviously/RB ,/, the/DT basic/JJ item/NN for/IN discussion/NN with/IN the/DT Council/NNP will/MD be/VB the/DT allocation/NN for/IN LIFE/NNP III/NNP ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN stipulates/VBZ a/DT total/JJ appropriation/NN of/IN EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD for/IN the/DT period/NN 2000-2004/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

The/DT Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/NNP ,/, Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP is/VBZ in/IN favour/NN of/IN increasing/VBG this/DT amount/NN to/TO EUR/$ 850/CD million/CD ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB support/VBP Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP '/POS s/JJ amendment/NN which/WDT observes/VBZ that/IN the/DT allocation/NN for/IN LIFE/NNP was/VBD not/RB increased/VBN when/WRB the/DT Union/NNP was/VBD last/JJ enlarged/NNS ,/, without/IN even/RB mentioning/VBG the/DT next/JJ batch/NN of/IN new/JJ arrivals/NNS ./.

The/DT amount/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP asking/VBG for/IN is/VBZ no/DT great/JJ mountain/NN of/IN useless/JJ expenditure/NN ./.

Quite/PDT the/DT opposite/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB fairly/RB modest/JJ in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT requirements/NNS to/TO be/VB funded/VBN ./.

A/DT drop/NN in/IN the/DT ocean/NN ,/, I/PRP might/MD say/VB ,/, in/IN comparison/NN with/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ structural/JJ policies/NNS ./.

The/DT environment/NN is/VBZ still/RB the/DT poor/JJ relation/NN in/IN the/DT European/JJ budget/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ primarily/RB an/DT investment/NN ./.

An/DT investment/NN in/IN natural/JJ resources/NNS ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN employment/NN ,/, since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN demonstrated/VBN that/IN an/DT active/JJ environmental/JJ policy/NN generated/VBD new/JJ jobs/NNS ,/, as/IN shown/VBN particularly/RB by/IN the/DT great/JJ success/NN of/IN LIFE/NNP ,/, a/DT success/NN with/IN NGOs/NNP ,/, businesses/NNS ,/, local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC third/JJ countries/NNS ./.

More/JJR than/IN one/CD third/NN of/IN the/DT 8,500/CD requests/NNS received/VBD meet/VB the/DT required/VBN conditions/NNS and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN possible/JJ to/TO cofinance/VB approximately/RB 1,300/CD projects/NNS between/IN 1992/CD and/CC 1998/CD ./.

A/DT success/NN which/WDT Parliament/NNP wishes/VBZ and/CC intends/VBZ to/TO see/VB perpetuated/VBD ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP also/RB support/VB amendment/NN 14/CD outlining/VBG the/DT fourth/JJ phase/NN of/IN the/DT LIFE/NNP project/NN ./.

In/IN matters/NNS of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, investment/NN and/CC ambition/NN come/VBP in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN forms/NNS ,/, and/CC indeed/RB must/MD come/VB in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN forms/NNS in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT future/NN of/IN generations/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP probably/RB going/VBG to/TO repeat/VB things/NNS my/PRP$ fellow/JJ Members/NNS have/VBP said/VBD but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, the/DT thing/NN is/VBZ to/TO repeat/VB over/RP and/CC over/RP what/WP we/PRP think/VBP of/IN LIFE/NNP ./.

I/PRP shall/MD therefore/RB reiterate/VB that/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN has/VBZ already/RB said/VBN quite/RB clearly/RB ,/, LIFE/NNP is/VBZ the/DT only/RB specific/JJ financial/JJ instrument/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ policy/NN on/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

This/DT instrument/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB essential/JJ since/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ the/DT impetus/NN for/IN truly/RB innovative/JJ actions/NNS in/IN favour/NN of/IN nature/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, which/WDT are/VBP adopted/VBN and/CC expanded/VBN upon/RP by/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

This/DT financial/JJ instrument/NN is/VBZ ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, deliberately/RB democratic/JJ since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ accessible/JJ to/TO both/DT governmental/JJ and/CC non-governmental/JJ organisations/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/JJ ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD urge/VB you/PRP not/RB to/TO vote/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP no/DT appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN LIFE/NNP ./.

Through/IN the/DT associations/NNS ,/, then/RB ,/, LIFE/NNP is/VBZ a/DT facility/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBN by/IN the/DT European/JJ citizen/NN directly/RB ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN actions/NNS in/IN the/DT interest/NN of/IN the/DT community/NN ./.

Several/JJ million/CD NGO/NNP members/NNS -/: millions/NNS ,/, I/PRP say/VBP -/: recognise/VBP in/IN LIFE/NNP the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/VBN determination/NN to/TO build/VB up/RP an/DT ambitious/JJ policy/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN our/PRP$ natural/JJ heritage/NN ./.

I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN those/DT who/WP run/VBP down/RP this/DT policy/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ States/NNPS bear/VBP the/DT responsibility/NN for/IN obstructing/VBG European/JJ nature/NN conservation/NN policies/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT pity/NN because/IN everyone/NN within/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP knows/VBZ that/IN LIFE/NNP is/VBZ a/DT financial/JJ instrument/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO carry/VB out/RP the/DT projects/NNS submitted/VBN by/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, a/DT good/NN many/DT of/IN which/WDT are/VBP turned/VBN down/RP due/JJ to/TO lack/NN of/IN funds/NNS ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/DT ,/, to/TO date/NN ,/, LIFE/VBP amounts/NNS to/TO only/RB EUR/$ 100/CD million/CD per/IN annum/NN ,/, i.e./VBP scarcely/RB 0.1/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

For/IN the/DT record/NN ,/, the/DT budget/NN for/IN agriculture/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT real/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, amounts/VBZ ,/, as/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP ,/, to/TO EUR/$ 37/CD billion/CD ./.

The/DT first/JJ sustainable/JJ development/NN projects/NNS are/VBP unquestionably/RB those/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT European/JJ Union/NNP environmental/JJ programme/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT a/DT considerable/JJ amount/NN -LRB-/-LRB- EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD -RRB-/-RRB- has/VBZ been/VBN allocated/VBN ,/, gives/VBZ rise/NN to/TO many/JJ questions/NNS regarding/VBG the/DT proper/JJ use/NN of/IN public/JJ funds/NNS ./.

A/DT financial/JJ instrument/NN of/IN this/DT order/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB transparent/JJ and/CC effective/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN for/IN the/DT following/VBG reasons/NNS :/: poorly/RB defined/JJ selection/NN criteria/NNS ,/, dubious/JJ uncoordinated/JJ operations/NNS ,/, assessments/RB not/RB made/VBN public/NN and/CC the/DT lack/NN of/IN any/DT assessment/NN policy/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP therefore/RB proposing/VBG to/TO amend/VB the/DT regulations/NNS as/IN follows/VBZ ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, to/TO reserve/VB the/DT acquisitions/NNS made/VBD thanks/NNS to/TO LIFE/JJ funds/NNS exclusively/RB to/TO public/JJ bodies/NNS ,/, subsequently/RB ,/, following/VBG invitation/NN to/TO tender/NN ,/, to/TO entrust/VB the/DT management/NN of/IN these/DT sites/NNS to/TO authorised/JJ nature/NN conservation/NN associations/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT continuity/NN of/IN the/DT ownership/NN of/IN the/DT acquisitions/NNS ,/, since/IN private/JJ law/NN associations/NNS may/MD disappear/VB or/CC resell/VB acquisitions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ shocking/JJ in/IN philosophical/JJ terms/NNS and/CC dubious/JJ in/IN legal/JJ terms/NNS for/IN 100/CD %/NN public/JJ money/NN to/TO be/VB used/VBN to/TO build/VB up/RP a/DT heritage/NN of/IN private/JJ land/NN ownership/NN ,/, even/RB under/IN cover/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, to/TO define/VB the/DT criteria/NNS for/IN the/DT eligibility/NN and/CC allocation/NN of/IN LIFE/JJ funds/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO rule/VB our/PRP$ any/DT suspicions/NNS of/IN clientelism/NN or/CC ostracism/NN ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, to/TO make/VB prior/JJ coordination/NN with/IN the/DT users/NNS and/CC communities/NNS concerned/VBD a/DT prerequisite/NN ./.

The/DT silt/NN was/VBD in/IN fact/NN shifted/VBN 3/CD kilometres/NNS ,/, at/IN a/DT cost/NN of/IN FF/NNP 6/CD million/CD ,/, the/DT cure/NN being/VBG worse/JJR than/IN the/DT disease/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT consequence/NN that/WDT was/VBD foreseeable/JJ and/CC actually/RB predicted/VBN by/IN the/DT parties/NNS involved/VBN with/IN the/DT site/NN ./.

Result/NN :/: a/DT court/NN action/NN and/CC repair/NN costs/NNS greater/JJR than/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT programme/NN itself/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN that/IN we/PRP want/VBP to/TO avoid/VB ./.

Four/NNP ,/, to/TO include/VB representatives/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP in/IN the/DT monitoring/NN committee/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS one/PRP Member/VBZ per/IN political/JJ group/NN ./.

What/WP could/MD be/VB fairer/JJR than/IN for/IN Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO monitor/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS they/PRP voted/VBD for/IN ?/.

Fifthly/RB ,/, to/TO publish/VB an/DT annual/JJ scientific/JJ ,/, technical/JJ and/CC financial/JJ assessment/NN of/IN LIFE/JJ operations/NNS carried/VBD out/RP ./.

Six/CD ,/, to/TO carry/VB out/RP proper/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT programmes/NNS on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN ./.

Here/RB ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP putting/VBG forward/RP here/RB a/DT practical/JJ proposal/NN ,/, a/DT common/JJ sense/NN proposal/NN ,/, easy/JJ to/TO implement/VB ,/, likely/RB to/TO limit/VB local/JJ conflicts/NNS and/CC to/TO vindicate/VB the/DT proper/JJ use/NN of/IN public/JJ monies/NNS ,/, before/IN increasing/VBG the/DT LIFE/JJ budget/NN line/NN by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN 40/CD %/NN !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD firstly/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN the/DT report/NN she/PRP has/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP ,/, and/CC also/RB the/DT Commission/NNP -/: why/WRB not/RB ?/.

-/: because/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, this/DT position/NN ,/, generally/RB improves/VBZ on/IN the/DT texts/NNS in/IN force/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP contains/VBZ more/RBR acceptable/JJ systematics/NNS and/CC is/VBZ clearer/JJR and/CC more/RBR transparent/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT services/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, since/IN the/DT evaluation/NN ,/, control/NN and/CC monitoring/NN of/IN the/DT LIFE/NNP programme/NN provide/VBP a/DT reasonable/JJ guarantee/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT selection/NN and/CC execution/NN of/IN projects/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO insist/VB on/IN certain/JJ points/NNS ./.

Firstly/NNP ,/, its/PRP$ continuity/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB questioning/VBG ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT financial/JJ contributions/NNS ./.

Sadly/RB ,/, only/RB 7.2/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT projects/NNS requested/VBD receive/VB funds/NNS ./.

Of/IN the/DT EUR/$ 1/CD 919/CD million/CD requested/CD ,/, only/RB EUR/$ 784/CD million/CD have/VBP been/VBN granted/VBN ./.

Now/RB the/DT financial/JJ statement/NN shows/VBZ only/RB EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD to/TO cover/VB more/JJR countries/NNS and/CC competences/VBZ ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ proposed/VBD EUR/$ 850/CD million/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT document/NN repeats/VBZ the/DT initial/JJ proposal/NN of/IN EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD ./.

Commissioner/RB ,/, our/PRP$ environmental/JJ commitments/NNS are/VBP increasing/VBG in/IN all/DT areas/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT only/RB financial/JJ instrument/NN exclusively/RB dedicated/VBN to/TO the/DT environment/NN is/VBZ decreasing/VBG ./.

Is/VBZ this/DT not/RB a/DT contradiction/NN ?/.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB demand/VB from/IN others/NNS what/WP we/PRP are/VBP not/RB prepared/JJ to/TO give/VB ourselves/PRP ?/.

Why/WRB do/VBP we/PRP all/RB go/VB on/RP about/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC are/VBP then/RB not/RB prepared/VBN to/TO pay/VB for/IN it/PRP amongst/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC rather/RB expect/VB the/DT usual/JJ people/NNS ,/, the/DT ones/NNS who/WP live/VBP there/RB all/DT year/NN ,/, to/TO pay/VB for/IN it/PRP and/CC maintain/VB it/PRP ?/.

Commissioner/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB consistent/JJ ./.

The/DT cost/NN of/IN maintaining/VBG the/DT environment/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP all/DT enjoy/VBP ,/, must/MD be/VB met/VBN by/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT LIFE/NNP programme/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/RB financial/JJ instrument/NN aimed/VBN exclusively/RB at/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC whose/WP$ projects/NNS have/VBP generally/RB been/VBN effective/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, LIFE/RB has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT principal/JJ instrument/NN available/JJ to/TO the/DT Community/NNP since/IN 1992/CD for/IN supporting/VBG and/CC developing/VBG environmental/JJ policy/NN ,/, both/DT within/IN the/DT Community/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT surrounding/VBG third/JJ countries/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT experience/NN gained/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ eight/CD years/NNS ,/, an/DT attempt/NN is/VBZ being/VBG made/VBN to/TO increase/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN action/NN on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ development/NN phase/NN of/IN that/DT financial/JJ instrument/NN ./.

The/DT funding/NN of/IN activities/NNS for/IN the/DT implementation/NN ,/, adaptation/NN and/CC development/NN of/IN Community/NNP policy/NN in/IN the/DT environment/NN sector/NN and/CC the/DT incorporation/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN other/JJ policies/NNS ,/, particularly/RB ones/NNS that/WDT contribute/VBP towards/IN sustainable/JJ development/NN ,/, are/VBP central/JJ elements/NNS of/IN the/DT regulation/NN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO vote/VB upon/RB ./.

An/DT important/JJ element/NN of/IN LIFE-Nature/NNP ,/, which/WDT mainly/RB concerns/VBZ the/DT realisation/NN of/IN the/DT Natura/NNP 2000/CD network/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT introduction/NN of/IN a/DT multinational/JJ approach/NN to/TO formulating/VBG plans/NNS for/IN international/JJ projects/NNS and/CC activities/NNS ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO avoid/VB the/DT fragmentation/NN of/IN biotopes/NNS and/CC to/TO offer/VB better/JJR protection/NN of/IN biodiversity/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT second/JJ ,/, LIFE-Environment/JJ strand/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR concerned/VBN with/IN projects/NNS involving/VBG small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS and/CC local/JJ government/NN agencies/NNS ,/, the/DT incorporation/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN other/JJ policies/NNS is/VBZ expressed/VBN very/RB clearly/RB indeed/RB ./.

As/IN regards/VBZ the/DT financing/VBG package/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN LIFE/NNP over/IN the/DT next/JJ five/CD years/NNS ,/, I/PRP wholeheartedly/RB support/VBP the/DT increase/NN from/IN EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD to/TO EUR/$ 850/CD million/CD proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP ./.

Unless/IN the/DT necessary/JJ means/NNS are/VBP secured/VBN to/TO pursue/VB environmental/JJ protection/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT point/NN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN in/IN continuing/VBG to/TO raise/VB the/DT environmental/JJ awareness/NN achieved/VBN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN in/IN incorporating/VBG the/DT environmental/JJ dimension/NN in/IN other/JJ policies/NNS ./.

Besides/IN ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB remain/VB indifferent/JJ towards/IN the/DT increased/VBN challenges/NNS in/IN areas/NNS around/IN the/DT Union/NNP or/CC towards/IN addressing/VBG very/RB acute/JJ environmental/JJ protection/NN problems/NNS in/IN the/DT applicant/NN countries/NNS ./.

What/WP has/VBZ happened/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ days/NNS with/IN the/DT pollution/NN of/IN the/DT Danube/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ tributary/NN has/VBZ been/VBN instructive/JJ ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, I/PRP consider/VBP that/IN support/NN for/IN environmental/JJ action/NN under/IN the/DT LIFE/JJ financial/JJ instrument/NN will/MD help/VB to/TO further/JJ Community/NNP policy/NN in/IN the/DT environmental/JJ sector/NN and/CC can/MD contribute/VB substantially/RB to/TO fulfilling/VBG the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ mission/NN of/IN achieving/VBG a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN and/CC improvement/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO begin/VB by/IN congratulating/NNP Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP on/IN her/PRP$ sensitive/JJ approach/NN towards/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, ably/RB demonstrated/VBD in/IN the/DT two/CD reports/NNS we/PRP have/VBP discussed/VBN this/DT evening/NN ./.

Two/CD minutes/NNS is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB long/JJ enough/RB to/TO deal/VB with/IN such/PDT an/DT important/JJ topic/NN ./.

So/IN I/PRP will/MD simply/RB appeal/VB to/TO the/DT Commissioner/NNP to/TO undertake/VB full/JJ responsibility/NN for/IN such/PDT an/DT important/JJ issue/NN ./.

For/IN five/CD years/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN in/IN a/DT regional/JJ organisation/NN ,/, which/WDT assuredly/RB does/VBZ not/RB have/VB Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ broad/JJ perspective/NN ./.

The/DT environment/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT parlous/JJ state/NN ./.

Like/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN previous/JJ speakers/NNS ,/, I/PRP ,/, too/RB ,/, wish/VBP to/TO consider/VB the/DT economic/JJ problem/NN and/CC the/DT problem/NN of/IN finding/VBG funding/NN for/IN projects/NNS ,/, which/WDT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN ,/, should/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN into/IN the/DT pubic/JJ domain/NN ./.

As/IN regards/JJ funding/NN ,/, EUR/$ 613/CD million/CD is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

Even/RB EUR/$ 850/CD million/CD is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN August/NNP 1999/CD ,/, I/PRP took/VBD part/NN in/IN a/DT meeting/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN the/DT Environment/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRP was/VBD said/VBN that/IN EUR/$ 2/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC ITL/NNP 4/CD 000/CD billion/CD ,/, should/MD go/VB towards/IN eliminating/VBG or/CC ,/, at/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, reducing/VBG smoking/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT environment/NN constitutes/VBZ a/DT far/RB bigger/JJR and/CC more/RBR serious/JJ problem/NN than/IN smoking/NN ./.

EUR/$ 850/CD million/CD -/: assuming/VBG that/IN such/PDT a/DT figure/NN is/VBZ actually/RB agreed/VBN -/: believe/VBP me/PRP ,/, is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ ,/, in/IN practical/JJ terms/NNS ,/, to/TO allow/VB any/DT type/NN of/IN project/NN to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP ./.

In/IN many/JJ areas/NNS the/DT parks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP a/DT fundamental/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT LIFE/NNP programme/NN have/VBP been/VBN established/VBN ./.

But/CC creating/VBG parks/NNS with/IN very/RB limited/VBN financial/JJ resources/NNS ,/, without/IN any/DT system/NN of/IN signs/NNS is/VBZ inefficient/JJ and/CC ineffectual/JJ ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB ask/VB Parliament/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO give/VB the/DT matter/NN their/PRP$ full/JJ attention/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, ever/RB since/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN 1999/CD ,/, discussions/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN place/NN between/IN the/DT institutions/NNS on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN regulation/NN for/IN a/DT third/JJ stage/NN for/IN the/DT instrument/NN for/IN the/DT environment/NN known/VBN as/IN LIFE/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD again/RB thank/VB the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Lienemann/NNP for/IN the/DT good/JJ and/CC constructive/JJ co-operation/NN we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, I/PRP can/MD confirm/VB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP wholly/RB or/CC in/IN principle/NN approves/VBZ nine/CD of/IN the/DT fourteen/CD amendments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP welcomes/VBZ ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 1/CD ,/, 2/CD ,/, 7/CD ,/, 8/CD ,/, 9/CD ,/, 10/CD ,/, 11/CD and/CC 13/CD ,/, which/WDT apply/VBP to/TO the/DT Committee/NNP procedures/NNS ./.

In/IN these/DT cases/NNS ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ fully/RB taken/VBN account/NN of/IN the/DT objections/NNS which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP had/VBD to/TO the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP can/MD ,/, in/IN principle/NN ,/, also/RB approve/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 4/CD which/WDT ought/MD ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO be/VB introduced/VBN into/IN another/DT place/NN in/IN the/DT text/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO Amendments/NNP Nos/JJ 5/CD and/CC 6/CD ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN projects/NNS for/IN the/DT sustainable/JJ exploitation/NN of/IN groundwater/NN and/CC surface/NN water/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN projects/NNS for/IN reducing/VBG forms/NNS of/IN air/NN pollution/NN which/WDT contribute/VBP to/TO the/DT greenhouse/NN effect/NN ,/, are/VBP to/TO a/DT large/JJ degree/NN covered/VBN by/IN LIFE/NNP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP nonetheless/RB considers/VBZ that/IN ,/, if/IN this/DT is/VBZ stated/VBN separately/RB ,/, then/RB that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO go/VB against/IN the/DT original/JJ decision/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT proposal/NN focus/NN on/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ priority/NN areas/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT risk/NN of/IN overlap/VBG with/IN other/JJ Community/NNP programmes/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Fifth/NNP Framework/NNP Programme/NNP for/IN Research/NNP ,/, Technical/NNP Development/NNP and/CC Demonstration/NNP ./.

The/DT present/JJ programme/NN '/POS s/JJ key/JJ measures/NNS -/: water/NN quality/NN ,/, tomorrow/NN '/POS s/JJ city/NN and/CC innovative/JJ products/NNS and/CC processes/NNS -/: to/TO a/DT certain/JJ degree/NN cover/VBP the/DT same/JJ questions/NNS ./.

Where/WRB the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT confidence/NN shown/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP ./.

Amendment/NNP No/NNP 12/CD requires/VBZ a/DT larger/JJR budget/NN than/IN that/DT stated/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP also/RB convinced/VBN that/IN LIFE/NNP has/VBZ great/JJ potential/NN ./.

This/DT instrument/NN could/MD finance/VB good/JJ projects/NNS with/IN a/DT higher/JJR amount/NN of/IN money/NN than/IN that/DT quoted/VBN in/IN the/DT proposed/VBN budget/NN ./.

The/DT amount/NN quoted/VBN in/IN Amendment/NNP No/DT 12/CD does/VBZ not/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, tally/NN with/IN the/DT budget/NN set/VBD on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP also/RB to/TO add/VB that/DT ,/, if/IN the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ increased/VBN ,/, greater/JJR demands/NNS are/VBP obviously/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB made/VBN upon/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN the/DT Environment/NNP if/IN an/DT increased/VBN number/NN of/IN projects/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB dealt/VBN with/IN ./.

Account/NNP will/MD also/RB have/VB to/TO be/VB taken/VBN of/IN other/JJ programmes/NNS where/WRB decisions/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB made/VBN within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT joint/JJ decision-making/JJ procedure/NN ./.

At/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ keeping/VBG to/TO the/DT amount/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO Amendment/NNP No/NNP 3/NNP ,/, which/WDT we/PRP did/VBD not/RB approve/VB at/IN first/JJ reading/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO emphasise/VB that/IN each/DT programme/NN has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ objectives/NNS ,/, conditions/NNS under/IN which/WDT it/PRP may/MD be/VB applied/VBN for/IN and/CC costs/NNS which/WDT make/VBP it/PRP eligible/JJ for/IN aid/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB meaningless/JJ ,/, and/CC often/RB impossible/JJ ,/, directly/RB to/TO transfer/VB projects/NNS from/IN LIFE/NNP to/TO other/JJ instruments/NNS ./.

If/IN other/JJ sources/NNS of/IN finance/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB investigated/VBN for/IN each/DT project/NN ,/, more/JJR resources/NNS would/MD ,/, moreover/RB ,/, be/VB required/VBN than/IN are/VBP available/JJ in/IN the/DT present/JJ situation/NN ./.

Now/RB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ to/TO consider/VB carefully/RB what/WP resources/NNS are/VBP required/VBN for/IN each/DT activity/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT example/NN of/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN activity/NN we/PRP ought/MD to/TO avoid/VB :/: one/CD that/WDT is/VBZ inessential/JJ but/CC demanding/VBG in/IN terms/NNS of/IN resources/NNS ./.

Nor/CC can/MD the/DT Commission/NNP approve/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 14/CD ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ contrary/JJ to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ right/NN of/IN initiative/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT discussion/NN concerning/VBG the/DT deadline/NN ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT final/JJ date/NN for/IN beginning/VBG to/TO implement/VB LIFE/NNP -/: 31/CD March/NNP 2000/CD ,/, as/IN set/NN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN -/: must/MD now/RB be/VB moved/VBN forward/RB ./.

The/DT date/NN will/MD be/VB fixed/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT present/JJ regulation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN adopted/VBN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO repeat/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP convinced/VBN that/IN LIFE/NNP will/MD be/VB an/DT effective/JJ instrument/NN in/IN support/NN of/IN development/NN and/CC the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ environmental/JJ policy/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP has/VBZ contributed/VBN greatly/RB to/TO improving/VBG this/DT instrument/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD therefore/RB get/VB straight/RB back/RB to/TO work/VB on/IN this/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP ,/, although/IN in/IN order/NN to/TO finish/VB it/PRP ,/, we/PRP shall/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB for/IN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP will/MD therefore/RB not/RB be/VB ready/JJ until/IN spring/NN 2001/CD ./.

It/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT philosophical/JJ Paper/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT practical/JJ Paper/NN ,/, full/JJ of/IN focused/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

We/PRP -/: the/DT Commission/NNP -/: are/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO know/VB that/IN we/PRP must/MD have/VB a/DT total/JJ rethink/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP shall/MD therefore/RB do/VB two/CD things/NNS :/: we/PRP are/VBP ,/, and/CC will/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB ,/, fully/RB committed/VBN to/TO internal/JJ reform/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP shall/MD rethink/VB our/PRP$ policies/NNS in/IN detail/NN ./.

I/PRP have/VBP asked/VBN all/PDT the/DT Commissioners/NNS -/: and/CC I/PRP shall/MD ask/VB them/PRP once/RB again/RB in/IN a/DT still/RB more/JJR analytical/JJ way/NN -/: to/TO pinpoint/VB all/PDT the/DT activities/NNS that/IN we/PRP can/MD forgo/VB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP must/MD define/VB what/WP its/PRP$ fundamental/JJ activities/NNS are/VBP ,/, what/WP it/PRP must/MD concentrate/VB on/RP and/CC shed/VB its/PRP$ non-essential/JJ activities/NNS ,/, thereby/RB freeing/VBG up/RP new/JJ resources/NNS and/CC ensuring/VBG a/DT more/RBR correct/JJ and/CC co-operative/JJ relationship/NN with/IN individual/JJ countries/NNS ,/, regions/NNS and/CC local/JJ communities/NNS ./.

As/IN for/IN internal/JJ reform/NN ,/, you/PRP well/RB know/VBP how/WRB committed/VBD my/PRP$ Commission/NN has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO this/DT since/IN day/NN one/CD ./.

Providing/VBG aid/NN rapidly/RB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, saves/VBZ human/JJ lives/NNS ;/: in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS providing/VBG it/PRP late/RB is/VBZ worse/JJR than/IN not/RB providing/VBG it/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.

When/WRB I/PRP speak/VBP about/IN external/JJ aid/NN ,/, my/PRP$ thoughts/NNS immediately/RB turn/VBP to/TO the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ cause/NN for/IN hope/NN thanks/NNS to/TO the/DT commitment/NN of/IN our/PRP$ workers/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN ,/, an/DT extraordinary/JJ commitment/NN given/VBN our/PRP$ organisational/JJ problems/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ element/NN that/IN we/PRP must/MD help/VB to/TO bring/VB to/TO the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

We/PRP must/MD increase/VB our/PRP$ efficiency/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD reopen/VB the/DT Danube/NNP to/TO boats/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ contradictory/NN to/TO offer/VB aid/NN to/TO Romania/NNP and/CC Bulgaria/NNP yet/RB leave/VBP these/DT countries/NNS unable/JJ to/TO harness/VB their/PRP$ greatest/JJS resource/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD decontaminate/VB the/DT river/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ days/NNS the/DT Commissioner/NNP responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT environment/NN will/MD be/VB putting/VBG forward/RP specific/JJ plans/NNS to/TO monitor/VB this/DT serious/JJ problem/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP done/VBN a/DT lot/NN in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS :/: the/DT new/JJ European/NNP Reconstruction/NNP Agency/NNP for/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, the/DT Balkans/NNP Task/NNP Force/NNP and/CC new/JJ regulations/NNS to/TO speed/VB up/RP procedures/NNS ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, we/PRP definitely/RB have/VBP to/TO do/VB more/JJR ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB do/VB this/DT ,/, we/PRP shall/MD have/VB failed/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ duty/NN ./.

Remember/VB that/IN the/DT Marshall/NNP Plan/NNP was/VBD not/RB effective/JJ simply/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT scale/NN of/IN its/PRP$ resources/NNS :/: it/PRP was/VBD even/RB more/RBR effective/JJ because/IN it/PRP made/VBD us/PRP Europeans/NNPS work/VBP together/RB towards/IN a/DT new/JJ horizon/NN ;/: it/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP a/DT fresh/JJ outlook/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ politics/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ economy/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB for/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

Europe/NNP must/MD prove/VB -/: in/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN -/: its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO extend/VB the/DT area/NN of/IN security/NN ,/, peace/NN and/CC freedom/NN and/CC its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO take/VB a/DT leading/VBG role/NN on/IN the/DT international/JJ stage/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP clearly/RB ,/, once/RB again/RB ,/, returning/VBG to/TO enlargement/NN ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB put/VBN into/IN practice/NN in/IN tandem/NN with/IN the/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN security/NN ,/, peace/NN and/CC freedom/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP made/VBN many/JJ promises/NNS in/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP shall/MD succeed/VB in/IN keeping/VBG our/PRP$ promises/NNS even/RB though/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB delicate/JJ path/NN to/TO tread/VB ./.

There/EX will/MD be/VB friendship/NN ,/, calm/NN ,/, openness/NN but/CC also/RB a/DT certain/JJ strictness/NNS in/IN the/DT enlargement/JJ process/NN ./.

I/PRP repeat/VB :/: we/PRP must/MD reassure/VB public/JJ opinion/NN in/IN those/DT countries/NNS that/WDT wish/VBP to/TO join/VB but/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO provide/VB public/JJ opinion/NN in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS with/IN even/RB greater/JJR reassurance/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS do/VBP not/RB stop/VB at/IN enlargement/NN ,/, or/CC at/IN the/DT Balkans/NNPS ./.

In/IN recent/JJ times/NNS ,/, Africa/NNP has/VBZ raised/VBN hopes/NNS and/CC has/VBZ received/VBN offers/NNS of/IN help/NN ,/, but/CC nothing/NN tangible/JJ has/VBZ yet/RB been/VBN achieved/VBN ./.

In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS in/IN Africa/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP not/RB seen/VBN a/DT shift/NN from/IN totalitarian/NN regimes/NNS to/TO democracy/NN ,/, but/CC quite/RB the/DT contrary/NN -/: a/DT shift/NN from/IN democracy/NN to/TO totalitarian/NN regimes/NNS ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO provide/VB alternative/JJ answers/NNS ,/, otherwise/RB episodes/NNS such/JJ as/IN those/DT seen/VBN in/IN Seattle/NNP will/MD be/VB repeated/VBN over/RP and/CC over/RP and/CC will/MD come/VB to/TO hamper/VB one/CD of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ positive/JJ roles/NNS in/IN history/NN ./.

We/PRP should/MD remember/VB that/IN we/PRP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, are/VBP a/DT union/NN of/IN minorities/NNS :/: we/PRP are/VBP all/PDT a/DT minority/NN within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP already/RB talked/VBN about/IN the/DT economy/NN :/: we/PRP well/RB know/VBP which/WDT basic/JJ ingredients/NNS will/MD set/VB Europe/NNP on/IN the/DT path/NN towards/IN a/DT lasting/JJ recovery/NN which/WDT will/MD in/IN turn/NN create/VB more/JJR jobs/NNS ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN four/CD years/NNS for/IN us/PRP to/TO be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO hold/VB a/DT summit/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB take/VBP the/DT uncompromising/VBG view/NN that/IN we/PRP must/MD maintain/VB a/DT resolute/JJ and/CC consistent/JJ stability/NN pact/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP structural/JJ reforms/NNS in/IN the/DT European/JJ economy/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT I/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO welcome/VB the/DT presentation/NN of/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT first/JJ ever/RB debate/VB on/RP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ programme/NN for/IN government/NN -/: the/DT word/NN President/NNP Prodi/NNP is/VBZ so/RB fond/JJ of/IN ;/: as/IN I/PRP am/VBP -/: for/IN the/DT whole/JJ legislature/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ welcome/JJ because/IN it/PRP explains/VBZ ,/, to/TO our/PRP$ fellow/JJ citizens/NNS ,/, what/WP we/PRP are/VBP intending/VBG to/TO do/VB and/CC what/WP we/PRP are/VBP already/RB doing/VBG ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB express/VB our/PRP$ regret/NN at/IN the/DT current/JJ situation/NN and/CC try/VB to/TO improve/VB on/IN it/PRP for/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN almost/RB eleven/CD months/NNS -/: President/NNP Prodi/NNP was/VBD nominated/VBN at/IN the/DT Berlin/NNP Summit/NNP in/IN March/NNP last/JJ year/NN -/: to/TO establish/VB a/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB entirely/RB President/NNP Prodi/NNP '/POS s/JJ fault/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP recovering/VBG from/IN a/DT crisis/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ for/IN the/DT investiture/NN of/IN the/DT next/JJ Commission/NNP to/TO coincide/VB with/IN the/DT presentation/NN of/IN a/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP breaking/VBG new/JJ ground/NN and/CC doing/VBG so/RB in/IN complex/JJ circumstances/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP need/VBP here/RB is/VBZ good/JJ government/NN ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ./.

Since/IN we/PRP are/VBP recovering/VBG from/IN a/DT very/RB complex/JJ crisis/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD try/VB to/TO enhance/VB our/PRP$ institutions/NNS and/CC give/VB them/PRP substance/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB the/DT House/NNP of/IN something/NN which/WDT we/PRP often/RB forget/VB ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ that/IN the/DT investiture/NN of/IN the/DT Prodi/NNP Commission/NNP ,/, last/JJ September/NNP ,/, received/VBD wide/JJ support/NN ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT demonstrates/VBZ that/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN us/PRP are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN progress/NN and/CC in/IN favour/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN ,/, within/IN this/DT broad/JJ consensus/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD some/DT Groups/NNS which/WDT said/VBD that/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP should/MD form/VB an/DT opposition/NN to/TO the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB this/DT which/WDT ,/, in/IN a/DT sense/NN ,/, is/VBZ hindering/VBG the/DT important/JJ process/NN of/IN developing/VBG codecision/NN within/IN the/DT legislative/JJ programme/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pointing/VBG this/DT out/RP because/IN I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ support/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP also/RB has/VBZ to/TO lead/VB to/TO continuity/NN in/IN the/DT work/NN carried/VBN out/RP throughout/IN the/DT legislature/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG the/DT birth/NN of/IN a/DT political/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, which/WDT entails/VBZ a/DT collection/NN of/IN shared/VBN values/NNS which/WDT we/PRP all/RB agree/VB upon/RP ,/, and/CC a/DT European/NNP Union/NNP at/IN the/DT service/NN of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS ./.

I/PRP have/VBP absolutely/RB no/DT doubt/NN about/IN this/DT and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ point/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP should/MD remain/VB aware/JJ and/CC watch/VB our/PRP$ language/NN ./.

Last/JJ week/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ Minister/NNP for/IN Finance/NNP of/IN the/DT Austrian/JJ coalition/NN described/VBD the/DT Austrian/JJ Parliament/NNP as/IN a/DT farce/NN and/CC a/DT theatre/NN ./.

Those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP have/VBP had/VBN to/TO live/VB under/IN a/DT dictatorship/NN know/VBP of/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN dictatorships/NNS with/IN cardboard/NN governments/NNS ./.

There/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT democracy/NN without/IN a/DT living/VBG parliament/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN language/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB dangerous/JJ and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO condemn/VB it/PRP here/RB and/CC now/RB ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT four/CD great/JJ priorities/NNS which/WDT President/NNP Prodi/NNP systematically/RB refers/VBZ to/TO and/CC with/IN regard/NN to/TO his/PRP$ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT challenges/NNS facing/VBG us/PRP ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP very/RB much/JJ in/IN agreement/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD point/VB out/RP to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP that/WDT ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN the/DT Socialist/NNP Group/NNP is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, there/RB has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT change/NN of/IN priorities/NNS ./.

When/WRB speaking/VBG of/IN the/DT commitment/NN to/TO full/JJ employment/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN ,/, these/DT days/NNS ,/, full/JJ employment/NN does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB what/WP it/PRP meant/VBD in/IN the/DT era/NN of/IN Beveridge/NNP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT Second/NNP World/NNP War/NNP ,/, that/DT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, employment/NN for/IN the/DT male/JJ head/NN of/IN the/DT household/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD argue/VB for/IN equality/NN of/IN the/DT sexes/NNS ,/, the/DT famous/JJ `/`` gender/NN mainstreaming/NN '/'' ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT least/JJS developed/JJ questions/NNS in/IN the/DT Prodi/NNP Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ programme/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ prioritising/VBG sex/NN equality/NN ,/, the/DT adaptation/NN of/IN the/DT social/JJ model/NN and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, an/DT unequivocal/JJ fight/NN against/IN populism/NN whenever/WRB our/PRP$ economic/JJ and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN is/VBZ under/IN threat/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ objective/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO pursue/VB ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN I/PRP would/MD also/RB add/VB another/DT element/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ economic/JJ government/NN ,/, given/VBN the/DT single/JJ currency/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT is/VBZ inescapable/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ another/DT question/NN on/IN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP must/MD make/VB progress/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT ambitious/JJ objectives/NNS and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBZ important/JJ step/NN of/IN adopting/VBG this/DT broadening/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN negotiation/NN and/CC integration/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB -/: and/CC my/PRP$ Group/NNP would/MD like/VB -/: more/JJR clarification/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT revision/NN of/IN Agenda/NNP 2000/CD ./.

Does/NNP the/DT Commission/NNP think/VB that/IN there/EX will/MD be/VB never/RB be/VB any/DT revision/NN ?/.

The/DT issue/NN of/IN taxation/NN also/RB seems/VBZ to/TO us/PRP to/TO be/VB absolutely/RB essential/JJ ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO governance/NN in/IN general/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP might/MD be/VB worth/JJ thinking/VBG in/IN theoretical/JJ terms/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO remind/VB you/PRP of/IN one/CD thing/NN :/: it/PRP is/VBZ dangerous/JJ to/TO rethink/VB the/DT entire/JJ governance/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP from/IN here/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD be/VB clearly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP capable/JJ of/IN defining/VBG what/WP our/PRP$ area/NN of/IN governance/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN would/MD be/VB very/RB positive/JJ ./.

In/IN all/DT other/JJ areas/NNS ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN subsidiarity/NN is/VBZ also/RB relevant/JJ to/TO this/DT discussion/NN ./.

Not/RB only/JJ should/MD the/DT Commission/NNP discuss/VB this/DT ,/, but/CC also/RB our/PRP$ states/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ parliaments/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ civil/JJ society/NN ./.

Madam/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO refer/VB briefly/RB to/TO the/DT last/JJ objective/NN ,/, which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO us/PRP to/TO be/VB absolutely/RB fundamental/JJ :/: the/DT stabilisation/NN of/IN the/DT continent/NN and/CC the/DT strengthening/NN of/IN the/DT Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.

So/RB who/WP will/MD pay/VB for/IN the/DT vehicles/NNS which/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB disposed/VBN of/IN ?/.

For/IN us/PRP this/DT is/VBZ straightforward/JJ :/: in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN new/JJ vehicles/NNS it/PRP should/MD be/VB the/DT manufacturer/NN since/IN this/DT will/MD also/RB compel/VB manufacturers/NNS to/TO design/VB and/CC build/VB recyclable/JJ cars/NNS ./.

And/CC what/WP about/IN vehicles/NNS which/WDT are/VBP already/RB on/IN the/DT road/NN ?/.

Such/JJ distortions/NNS in/IN competition/NN are/VBP not/RB about/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN ;/: they/PRP simply/RB affect/VB investment/NN potential/NN and/CC the/DT jobs/NNS of/IN those/DT building/NN cars/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, for/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS we/PRP propose/VBP setting/VBG up/RP a/DT fund/NN to/TO cover/VB the/DT costs/NNS of/IN recycling/VBG end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN freedom/NN from/IN costs/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD understand/VB it/PRP when/WRB colleagues/NNS from/IN countries/NNS which/WDT do/VBP not/RB build/VB cars/NNS advocate/NN that/IN manufacturers/NNS should/MD pay/VB the/DT full/JJ whack/NN and/CC that/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB interested/JJ in/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN distortions/NNS in/IN competition/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO setting/VBG aside/RP funds/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD ask/VB these/DT colleagues/NNS to/TO show/VB solidarity/NN with/IN the/DT more/JJR than/IN 2/CD million/CD people/NNS who/WP make/VBP a/DT living/NN from/IN building/NN cars/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, so/RB that/IN these/DT jobs/NNS can/MD be/VB secured/VBN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN stringent/JJ environmental/JJ requirements/NNS ,/, as/IN you/PRP know/VBP from/IN the/DT auto-oil/JJ programme/NN and/CC the/DT debate/NN on/IN exhaust/JJ emissions/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB the/DT same/JJ for/IN everyone/NN !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP need/VBP this/DT directive/NN ./.

Firstly/JJ ,/, because/IN it/PRP clearly/RB stipulates/VBZ the/DT environmental/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, because/IN it/PRP can/MD promote/VB recycling/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ important/JJ ./.

Thirdly/RB ,/, because/IN it/PRP sets/VBZ out/RP a/DT clear/JJ procedure/NN to/TO combat/VB pollution/NN caused/VBD by/IN heavy/JJ metals/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ also/RB an/DT important/JJ point/NN ./.

The/DT directive/NN affords/VBZ a/DT European/JJ framework/NN ,/, also/RB to/TO Member/NNP States/NNPS who/WP already/RB have/VBP systems/NNS in/IN place/NN and/CC who/WP wish/VBP to/TO continue/VB to/TO use/VB these/DT ./.

So/RB ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO keep/VB the/DT recycling/VBG percentages/NNS at/IN their/PRP$ present/JJ level/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, provide/VB the/DT necessary/JJ incentive/NN for/IN technological/JJ innovation/NN and/CC for/IN identifying/VBG ways/NNS of/IN dealing/VBG with/IN materials/NNS that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB as/RB yet/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO dispose/VB of/IN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO retain/VB the/DT details/NNS as/IN they/PRP are/VBP included/VBN in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

As/IN from/IN 2006/CD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, all/DT vehicles/NNS should/MD be/VB handed/VBN in/IN at/IN no/DT cost/NN to/TO their/PRP$ last/JJ owners/NNS ./.

Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ most/RBS definitely/RB an/DT essential/JJ point/NN which/WDT should/MD not/RB be/VB changed/VBN in/IN any/DT way/NN ./.

Is/VBZ this/DT too/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT burden/NN ?/.

There/EX is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, one/CD thing/NN we/PRP should/MD not/RB overlook/VB ./.

The/DT directive/NN applies/VBZ to/TO complete/VB cars/NNS ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB cars/NNS with/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT essential/JJ components/NNS missing/VBG ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT experts/NNS ,/, few/JJ of/IN these/DT complete/JJ cars/NNS are/VBP of/IN no/DT value/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, recycling/NN and/CC the/DT re-use/NN of/IN components/NNS form/VBP part/NN of/IN a/DT sector/NN which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB loss-making/JJ ./.

Quite/RB the/DT reverse/NN ,/, in/IN fact/NN ./.

At/IN present/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ raft/NN of/IN companies/NNS which/WDT make/VBP a/DT living/VBG out/RP of/IN them/PRP ,/, and/CC a/DT decent/JJ one/NN at/IN that/DT ./.

This/DT directive/NN encourages/VBZ the/DT whole/NN of/IN this/DT sector/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT sector/NN which/WDT comprises/VBZ small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS ./.

Since/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, transport/NN costs/NNS are/VBP high/JJ ,/, a/DT system/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB introduced/VBN which/WDT will/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB much/RB decentralised/JJ ,/, because/IN transporting/VBG an/DT end-of-life/JJ vehicle/NN over/IN a/DT distance/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN 100/CD km/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT profitable/JJ activity/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN that/IN this/DT directive/NN does/VBZ not/RB need/VB to/TO apply/VB to/TO historic/JJ vehicles/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP ought/MD to/TO add/VB this/DT provision/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP ,/, therefore/RB ,/, that/IN vintage/JJ cars/NNS ought/MD to/TO be/VB exempt/JJ ./.

Also/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ thing/NN that/IN we/PRP should/MD clearly/RB lay/VB the/DT burden/NN of/IN responsibility/NN with/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ principle/NN which/WDT we/PRP must/MD uphold/VB ./.

As/IN manufacturers/NNS are/VBP responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT design/NN ,/, they/PRP can/MD give/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN consideration/NN to/TO the/DT environment/NN at/IN the/DT conception/NN phase/NN ./.

We/PRP must/MD also/RB insist/VB that/IN the/DT cost/NN is/VBZ borne/VBN wholly/RB or/CC largely/RB by/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN ,/, as/IN stipulated/VBD in/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

I/PRP find/VBP this/DT a/DT well-balanced/JJ formula/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB preclude/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ things/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO retain/VB it/PRP ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB our/PRP$ group/NN will/MD remain/VB as/RB close/RB to/TO the/DT common/JJ position/NN as/RB possible/JJ and/CC will/MD not/RB alter/VB its/PRP$ essence/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, we/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ how/WRB difficult/JJ it/PRP was/VBD within/IN the/DT Council/NNP to/TO bring/VB this/DT common/JJ position/NN about/RB ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB difficult/JJ balancing/NN act/NN to/TO reach/VB this/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB jeopardise/VB that/DT common/JJ position/NN ,/, because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT directive/NN which/WDT we/PRP desperately/RB need/VBP for/IN environmental/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO support/VB this/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ group/NN will/MD ,/, at/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, do/VB this/DT as/RB far/RB as/RB possible/JJ -/: for/IN environmental/JJ reasons/NNS and/CC because/IN we/PRP have/VBP this/DT directive/NN which/WDT is/VBZ well-balanced/JJ and/CC encompasses/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN issues/NNS and/CC difficulties/NNS including/VBG ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT costs/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB distributed/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB an/DT important/JJ decision/NN today/NN ./.

Does/NNP this/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP support/VB the/DT ecological/JJ principle/NN of/IN manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB that/IN cars/NNS ,/, once/IN they/PRP have/VBP reached/VBN the/DT end/NN of/IN their/PRP$ lives/NNS ,/, are/VBP the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN manufacturer/NN ?/.

No/NNP ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT Christian/NNP Democrats/NNPS in/IN Amendment/NNP No./NNP 38/CD :/: car/NN manufacturers/NNS and/CC car/NN drivers/NNS should/MD split/VB the/DT cost/NN 50/50/CD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ evident/JJ from/IN the/DT packaging/NN directive/NN in/IN which/WDT this/DT 50/50/CD compromise/NN is/VBZ included/VBN that/IN this/DT does/VBZ not/RB work/VB ./.

Packaging/NNP still/RB accounts/VBZ for/IN a/DT mountain/NN of/IN rubbish/JJ in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC is/VBZ a/DT burden/NN upon/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT socialists/NNS under/IN the/DT direction/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Bernd/NNP Lange/NNP say/VBP :/: yes/UH ,/, we/PRP approve/VBP of/IN this/DT principle/NN but/CC we/PRP need/VBP not/RB implement/VB it/PRP until/IN 2010/CD or/CC 2012/CD according/VBG to/TO Amendment/NNP No/NNP 45/CD ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN stipulates/VBZ 2006/CD ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT group/NN of/IN the/DT Greens/NNP ,/, this/DT gives/VBZ the/DT car/NN industry/NN ample/JJ time/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT necessary/JJ preparations/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB urge/VB my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS not/RB to/TO support/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 38/CD of/IN the/DT Christian/NNP Democrats/NNPS and/CC Amendment/NNP No/NNP 45/CD of/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT socialists/NNS ./.

If/IN car/NN manufacturers/NNS need/VBP to/TO bear/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN recycling/VBG their/PRP$ cars/NNS ,/, they/PRP will/MD design/VB these/DT cars/NNS in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN they/PRP can/MD be/VB re-used/VBN more/RBR easily/RB and/CC more/RBR cheaply/RB ./.

The/DT problem/NN of/IN plastic/NN and/CC PVC/NN will/MD then/RB no/RB longer/RB exist/VB in/IN cars/NNS and/CC these/DT products/NNS will/MD be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN plant-based/JJ bioplastic/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ ultimately/RB cheaper/JJR ,/, also/RB for/IN the/DT consumer/NN ./.

For/IN twenty/CD years/NNS ,/, the/DT majority/NN within/IN Parliament/NNP has/VBZ attempted/VBN to/TO make/VB European/JJ environmental/JJ policy/NN greener/JJR ./.

Today/NN ,/, this/DT green/JJ position/NN is/VBZ being/VBG threatened/VBN under/IN pressure/NN from/IN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT German/JJ and/CC French/JJ car/NN industries/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP urge/VBP you/PRP to/TO vote/VB against/IN Amendments/NNP Nos/NNP 38/CD and/CC 45/CD ./.

We/PRP ,/, the/DT Green/NNP Group/NNP ,/, by/IN and/CC large/JJ support/VBP the/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT waste/NN from/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS is/VBZ one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ really/RB major/JJ environmental/JJ problems/NNS in/IN terms/NNS both/DT of/IN the/DT quantity/NN of/IN waste/NN and/CC of/IN emissions/NNS of/IN environmentally/RB hazardous/JJ substances/NNS ./.

We/PRP in/IN the/DT Confederal/NNP Group/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP United/NNP Left/Nordic/NNP Green/NNP Left/NNP therefore/RB want/VBP as/IN comprehensive/JJ and/CC consistent/JJ a/DT set/NN of/IN regulations/NNS as/IN is/VBZ humanly/RB possible/JJ in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

With/IN this/DT directive/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT chance/NN to/TO take/VB a/DT big/JJ step/NN forward/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT presupposes/VBZ that/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN is/VBZ not/RB torn/VBN to/TO shreds/NNS and/CC weakened/VBN in/IN Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ reading/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.

If/IN they/PRP were/VBD adopted/VBN ,/, many/JJ of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN tabled/VBN would/MD considerably/RB weaken/VB the/DT directive/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN in/IN certain/JJ countries/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN in/IN Germany/NNP ,/, went/VBD in/IN for/IN some/DT pretty/RB tough/JJ lobbying/NN before/IN the/DT present/JJ directive/NN was/VBD adopted/VBN ./.

For/IN ourselves/PRP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ that/IN the/DT following/JJ principles/NNS should/MD apply/VB ./.

The/DT polluter/NN should/MD pay/VB ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT manufacturer/NN which/WDT should/MD take/VB full/JJ responsibility/NN ,/, financial/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN otherwise/JJ ,/, for/IN recycling/VBG vehicles/NNS ./.

There/EX must/MD be/VB rules/NNS governing/VBG existing/JJ vehicles/NNS too/RB ./.

Where/WRB this/DT aspect/NN is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, we/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB any/DT weakening/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN regarding/VBG the/DT date/NN from/IN which/WDT the/DT regulations/NNS are/VBP to/TO come/VB into/IN force/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD vote/VB against/IN any/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT run/VBP counter/RB to/TO these/DT considerations/NNS ./.

If/IN those/DT amendments/NNS were/VBD adopted/VBN which/WDT would/MD considerably/RB weaken/VB the/DT directive/NN ,/, this/DT would/MD be/VB very/RB detrimental/JJ ,/, not/RB only/JJ from/IN an/DT environmental/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN but/CC also/RB for/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ credibility/NN on/IN environmental/JJ issues/NNS ./.

Reference/NNP was/VBD made/VBN earlier/RBR on/IN in/IN the/DT debate/NN to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN some/DT thought/VBD should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO the/DT millions/NNS of/IN people/NNS who/WP work/VBP in/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN in/IN various/JJ countries/NNS and/CC to/TO those/DT countries/NNS which/WDT have/VBP large/JJ car/NN industries/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, Sweden/NNP ./.

I/PRP was/VBD myself/VBG a/DT car/NN worker/NN before/IN I/PRP was/VBD elected/VBN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP I/PRP am/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ members/NNS of/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP to/TO have/VB stood/VBN beside/IN a/DT production/NN line/NN and/CC assembled/VBN cars/NNS ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN very/RB tough/JJ demands/NNS should/MD be/VB made/VBN of/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN ./.

These/DT would/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, be/VB to/TO the/DT advantage/NN of/IN modern/JJ ,/, progressive/JJ car/NN manufacturers/NNS who/WP think/VBP in/IN environmentally/RB friendly/JJ terms/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB this/DT type/NN of/IN car/NN industry/NN which/WDT we/PRP should/MD be/VB encouraging/VBG in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ that/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN is/VBZ now/RB a/DT priority/NN for/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, as/IN indeed/RB it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN abandoned/VBN cars/NNS represent/VBP a/DT serious/JJ threat/NN to/TO the/DT visual/JJ and/CC physical/JJ environment/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ citizens/NNS expect/VBP us/PRP in/IN this/DT regard/NN to/TO protect/VB their/PRP$ interests/NNS ./.

Each/DT year/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP between/IN 8/CD and/CC 9/CD million/CD vehicles/NNS scrapped/VBN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

This/DT in/IN itself/PRP generates/VBZ a/DT large/JJ amount/NN of/IN waste/NN ./.

Car/NN manufacturers/NNS ,/, the/DT suppliers/NNS of/IN materials/NNS and/CC equipment/NN manufacturers/NNS must/MD make/VB an/DT effort/NN to/TO limit/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN hazardous/JJ substances/NNS and/CC therefore/RB must/MD ensure/VB at/IN the/DT design/NN stage/NN that/IN recycled/JJ materials/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN the/DT manufacture/NN of/IN cars/NNS ./.

We/PRP know/VBP that/IN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS there/EX are/VBP authorised/VBN treatment/NN centres/NNS in/IN place/NN to/TO collect/VB end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS and/CC this/DT process/NN should/MD be/VB extended/VBN across/IN the/DT length/NN and/CC breadth/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

From/IN an/DT Irish/JJ perspective/NN ,/, I/PRP know/VBP that/IN the/DT Irish/JJ Department/NNP of/IN the/DT Environment/NNP is/VBZ already/RB having/VBG consultations/NNS with/IN motor/NN industry/NN representatives/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN appropriate/JJ collection/NN centres/NNS are/VBP put/VBN in/IN place/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

I/PRP see/VBP no/DT reason/NN why/WRB licensing/NN arrangements/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB organised/VBN across/IN Europe/NNP for/IN collection/NN centres/NNS to/TO scrap/VB the/DT 8/CD to/TO 9/CD million/CD vehicles/NNS which/WDT are/VBP disposed/VBN of/IN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP on/IN an/DT annual/JJ basis/NN ./.

Car/NN manufacturers/NNS will/MD have/VB to/TO provide/VB information/NN on/IN the/DT rate/NN of/IN re-use/NN ,/, recycling/NN and/CC recovery/NN of/IN used/JJ cars/NNS which/WDT will/MD be/VB achieved/VBN in/IN the/DT coming/VBG years/NNS ./.

In/IN accordance/NN with/IN new/JJ provisions/NNS included/VBN in/IN the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP all/DT the/DT 370/CD million/CD consumers/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP have/VBP a/DT right/NN to/TO consumer-related/JJ information/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP EU/NNP consumers/NNS will/MD support/VB those/DT car/NN manufacturers/NNS that/WDT incorporate/VB the/DT most/RBS environmentally-friendly/JJ practices/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/VBG year/NN ./.

My/PRP$ final/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT regulations/NNS and/CC the/DT legislation/NN must/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT special/JJ position/NN of/IN the/DT vintage/JJ car/NN sector/NN throughout/IN the/DT European/NNP Community/NNP because/RB of/IN its/PRP$ role/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO the/DT social/JJ sector/NN and/CC its/PRP$ environmental/JJ and/CC economic/JJ considerations/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT directive/NN on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS is/VBZ certainly/RB a/DT milestone/NN in/IN the/DT improvement/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

I/PRP also/RB think/VBP that/IN a/DT great/JJ effort/NN has/VBZ been/VBN made/VBN to/TO arrive/VB at/IN intelligent/JJ recycling/NN of/IN materials/NNS ,/, a/DT reduction/NN of/IN polluting/VBG waste/NN and/CC the/DT promotion/NN of/IN technological/JJ innovation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT regard/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB on/IN the/DT right/JJ track/NN ,/, but/CC as/IN some/DT Members/NNS have/VBP already/RB stressed/VBN ,/, the/DT real/JJ issue/NN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN that/IN manufacturers/NNS '/POS responsibility/NN will/MD become/VB a/DT shared/VBN responsibility/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP to/TO conduct/VB a/DT serious/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

These/DT worthwhile/JJ amendments/NNS are/VBP the/DT outcome/NN of/IN this/DT ;/: I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO arrive/VB at/IN a/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT problem/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, to/TO reconcile/VB environmental/JJ requirements/NNS with/IN market/NN and/CC labour/NN requirements/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT directive/NN deals/NNS with/IN the/DT comparatively/RB small/JJ but/CC growing/JJ problem/NN of/IN abandoned/VBN cars/NNS and/CC the/DT question/NN of/IN a/DT more/RBR structured/JJ disposal/NN of/IN all/DT cars/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN their/PRP$ life/NN ./.

To/TO that/DT extent/NN ,/, it/PRP might/MD be/VB thought/VBN desirable/JJ ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN urgent/JJ necessity/NN ./.

The/DT key/JJ questions/NNS now/RB are/VBP who/WP pays/VBZ the/DT EUR/$ 262/CD per/IN car/NN for/IN the/DT 9/CD million/CD cars/NNS that/WDT are/VBP disposed/VBN of/IN each/DT year/NN ?/.

Who/WP pays/VBZ for/IN the/DT collection/NN ,/, the/DT dismantling/NN ,/, the/DT disposal/NN and/CC so/RB on/RB ?/.

And/CC should/MD the/DT directive/NN be/VB retrospective/JJ to/TO cover/VB every/DT car/NN that/WDT has/VBZ ever/RB been/VBN made/VBN ?/.

The/DT proposal/NN from/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, the/DT common/JJ position/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN manufacturers/NNS should/MD pay/VB the/DT lot/NN ./.

That/DT would/MD mean/VB billions/NNS of/IN pounds/NNS or/CC euros/NNS for/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT major/JJ companies/NNS in/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

That/DT cost/NN would/MD inevitably/RB be/VB passed/VBN on/IN to/TO the/DT price/NN and/CC hence/RB to/TO the/DT buyers/NNS of/IN new/JJ cars/NNS ./.

Because/IN European/JJ car/NN manufactures/VBZ have/VB been/VBN operating/VBG here/RB for/IN many/JJ ,/, many/RB more/JJR decades/NNS than/IN companies/NNS from/IN Japan/NNP ,/, Korea/NNP and/CC elsewhere/NNP ,/, that/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT much/RB greater/JJR burden/NN on/IN the/DT older/JJR European/JJ companies/NNS and/CC a/DT competitive/JJ gift/NN to/TO their/PRP$ competitors/NNS from/IN elsewhere/RB ./.

I/PRP commend/VBD Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Lange/NNP and/CC others/NNS who/WP have/VBP sought/VBN from/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT party/NN divide/VBP a/DT compromise/NN based/VBN on/IN shared/VBN costs/NNS ./.

I/PRP also/RB commend/VBD to/TO you/PRP the/DT amendment/NN standing/VBG in/IN my/PRP$ name/NN and/CC colleagues/NNS from/IN Germany/NNP ,/, Italy/NNP ,/, Ireland/NNP ,/, Spain/NNP ,/, Sweden/NNP and/CC Britain/NNP ,/, to/TO remove/VB the/DT retrospective/NN nature/NN of/IN this/DT measure/NN ./.

Retrospective/JJ law/NN is/VBZ bad/JJ law/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ unfair/JJ law/NN and/CC often/RB it/PRP is/VBZ unworkable/JJ law/NN ./.

Most/JJS democratic/JJ parliaments/NNS in/IN the/DT free/JJ world/NN reject/VBP it/PRP on/IN principle/NN unless/IN there/EX is/VBZ overwhelming/JJ public/JJ interest/NN ,/, which/WDT clearly/RB there/RB is/VBZ not/RB in/IN this/DT case/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP have/VBP called/VBN for/IN a/DT roll-call/JJ vote/NN on/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP can/MD see/VB who/WP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO vote/VB for/IN a/DT retrospection/NN which/WDT is/VBZ of/IN doubtful/JJ legality/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB a/DT costly/JJ burden/NN to/TO every/DT future/JJ car/NN buyer/NN and/CC a/DT devastating/JJ blow/NN for/IN the/DT European/JJ car/NN industry/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, once/RB again/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO briefly/RB outline/VB the/DT economic/JJ issues/NNS involved/VBN in/IN this/DT directive/NN ,/, and/CC reaffirm/VB my/PRP$ support/NN for/IN the/DT amendments/NNS tabled/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Bernd/NNP Lange/NNP ./.

These/DT amendments/NNS actually/RB have/VBP the/DT advantage/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO stress/VB this/DT -/: of/IN reconciling/VBG environmental/JJ constraints/NNS and/CC economic/JJ imperatives/NNS ./.

The/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ position/NN was/VBD to/TO say/VB that/IN car/NN manufacturers/NNS should/MD bear/VB all/DT ,/, or/CC a/DT significant/JJ part/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT costs/NNS of/IN recovery/NN and/CC recycling/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Lange/NNP so/RB rightly/RB said/VBD ,/, this/DT solution/NN is/VBZ totally/RB unfair/JJ to/TO European/JJ car/NN manufacturers/NNS ./.

This/DT solution/NN is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ because/IN these/DT car/NN manufacturers/NNS have/VBP not/RB had/VBN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO build/VB the/DT environmental/JJ demands/NNS we/PRP are/VBP making/VBG of/IN them/PRP today/NN into/IN their/PRP$ manufacturing/VBG procedures/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ manufacturing/VBG costs/NNS ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN puts/VBZ European/JJ car/NN manufacturers/NNS in/IN a/DT disadvantageous/JJ position/NN in/IN relation/NN to/TO manufacturers/NNS which/WDT have/VBP just/RB come/VBN to/TO the/DT European/JJ market/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB here/RB to/TO defend/VB a/DT particular/JJ national/JJ interest/NN or/CC a/DT particular/JJ industrial/JJ lobby/NN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP here/RB to/TO build/VB a/DT Europe/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ competitive/JJ on/IN the/DT world/NN market/NN and/CC to/TO safeguard/VB jobs/NNS in/IN economic/JJ sectors/NNS where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP actually/RB competitive/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN directive/NN on/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS before/IN us/PRP today/NN aims/VBZ firstly/JJ to/TO guarantee/VB a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN in/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT proper/JJ operation/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN in/IN this/DT sector/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP would/MD all/RB agree/VB on/IN that/DT ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD that/WDT ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT stumbling/VBG blocks/NNS concerns/VBZ Article/NNP 12/CD ,/, i.e./CD the/DT date/NN on/IN which/WDT the/DT directive/NN will/MD come/VB into/IN force/NN ./.

The/DT credibility/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP as/IN a/DT champion/NN of/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN is/VBZ at/IN stake/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB shameful/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT least/JJS if/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP were/VBD to/TO draw/VB back/RP from/IN the/DT professions/NNS the/DT governments/NNS of/IN the/DT 14/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP have/VBP been/VBN making/VBG concerning/VBG manufacturer/NN responsibility/NN and/CC environmental/JJ protection/NN !/. ./.

The/DT intention/NN of/IN Florenz/NNP and/CC Lange/NNP in/IN their/PRP$ amendments/NNS is/VBZ obvious/JJ :/: to/TO sabotage/VB the/DT directive/NN !/. ./.

The/DT proposed/VBN shared/JJ responsibility/NN would/MD undermine/VB the/DT polluter/NN pays/VBZ principle/NN and/CC detract/VB from/IN product/NN innovation/NN ./.

In/IN setting/VBG up/RP numerous/JJ hurdles/NNS their/PRP$ sole/JJ aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO hamper/VB an/DT efficient/JJ ecological/JJ material/NN flow/NN policy/NN and/CC by/IN going/VBG down/RP the/DT road/NN of/IN type/NN approvals/NNS they/PRP seek/VBP to/TO delay/VB the/DT implementation/NN of/IN the/DT directives/NNS by/IN 12/CD years/NNS or/CC more/JJR ./.

This/DT is/VBZ totally/RB unacceptable/JJ ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB appeal/VBP to/TO the/DT German/JJ delegates/NNS in/IN particular/JJ to/TO prevent/VB major/JJ political/JJ damage/NN occurring/VBG today/NN !/. ./.

The/DT red-green/JJ federal/JJ government/NN has/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB covered/VBN itself/PRP with/IN glory/NN in/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT End-of-life/NNP Vehicles/NNPS Directive/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT directive/NN has/VBZ been/VBN under/IN discussion/NN since/IN 1997/CD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ high/JJ time/NN that/IN we/PRP reached/VBD an/DT agreement/NN ./.

Since/IN I/PRP more/RBR or/CC less/RBR share/VBP the/DT views/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Sj脙/NNP 露/NNP stedt/NNP and/CC the/DT representative/NN of/IN the/DT Greens/NNS ,/, Mr/NNP de/IN Roo/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO use/VB the/DT two/CD minutes/NNS allotted/VBN to/TO me/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP will/MD highlight/VB just/RB two/CD issues/NNS ./.

Firstly/NNP ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ perhaps/RB the/DT basic/JJ point/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN ,/, the/DT idea/NN ,/, which/WDT goes/VBZ hand/NN in/IN hand/NN with/IN recycling/NN and/CC the/DT use/NN of/IN waste/NN ,/, that/IN we/PRP should/MD use/VB materials/NNS which/WDT will/MD subsequently/RB cause/VB less/JJR pollution/NN ./.

Another/DT point/NN is/VBZ that/IN waste/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB incinerated/VBN or/CC crushed/VBN ,/, not/RB only/JJ in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN lead/NN ,/, cadmium/NN and/CC mercury/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN waste/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ PVC/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ currently/RB discussing/VBG this/DT issue/NN in/IN another/DT context/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN a/DT judicial/JJ inquiry/NN into/IN the/DT accusations/NNS against/IN NATO/NNP ,/, what/WP will/MD be/VB done/VBN in/IN respect/NN of/IN the/DT High/NNP Representative/NNP for/IN the/DT CFSP/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD NATO/NNP Secretary-General/NNP during/IN the/DT crisis/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP '/POS question/NN naturally/RB gives/VBZ us/PRP food/NN for/IN thought/NN on/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN issues/NNS ./.

The/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ already/RB ,/, on/IN various/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, stated/VBN its/PRP$ conviction/NN that/IN the/DT severe/JJ measures/NNS taken/VBN by/IN NATO/NNP were/VBD both/DT necessary/JJ and/CC justified/JJ to/TO deal/VB with/IN extremist/JJ and/CC irresponsible/JJ actions/NNS involving/VBG clear/JJ violations/NNS of/IN the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS Security/NNP Council/NN resolutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP aware/JJ that/IN there/EX may/MD be/VB different/JJ views/NNS about/IN NATO/NNP '/POS s/JJ action/NN and/CC the/DT legitimacy/NN of/IN that/DT action/NN ./.

Everyone/NN is/VBZ free/JJ to/TO hold/VB such/JJ views/NNS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, the/DT various/JJ parliamentary/JJ groups/NNS had/VBD differing/VBG views/NNS on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

That/DT was/VBD how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ position/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ in/IN that/IN it/PRP considers/VBZ that/IN the/DT objective/NN of/IN the/DT air/NN campaign/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT North/NNP Atlantic/NNP Treaty/NNP Organisation/NNP in/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Republic/NNP of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP was/VBD to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT humanitarian/JJ disaster/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP caused/VBN by/IN the/DT Belgrade/NNP regime/NN ./.

This/DT objective/NN was/VBD fully/RB and/CC formally/RB expressed/VBD in/IN the/DT statement/NN adopted/VBN by/IN the/DT General/NNP Affairs/NNPS Council/NNP in/IN Luxembourg/NNP on/IN 8/CD April/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ ,/, Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP ,/, that/IN ,/, during/IN her/PRP$ recent/JJ visit/NN to/TO NATO/NNP headquarters/NNS ,/, Prosecutor/NNP Del/NNP Ponte/NNP stressed/VBD that/IN the/DT International/NNP Tribunal/NNP was/VBD obliged/VBN to/TO examine/VB all/DT accusations/NNS presented/VBN to/TO it/PRP ,/, including/VBG those/DT made/VBN against/IN NATO/NNP ,/, in/IN particular/JJ by/IN pacifist/NN groups/NNS from/IN Canada/NNP ./.

This/DT compulsory/JJ examination/NN was/VBD to/TO be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN line/NN with/IN accusations/NNS submitted/VBN ./.

All/DT information/NN received/VBN during/IN the/DT past/JJ six/CD months/NNS ,/, either/DT from/IN individuals/NNS or/CC from/IN groups/NNS requesting/VBG an/DT investigation/NN of/IN NATO/NNP '/POS s/JJ actions/NNS during/IN the/DT Kosovo/NNP conflict/NN ,/, have/VBP been/VBN recorded/VBN by/IN the/DT Prosecutor/NNP ./.

Any/DT other/JJ information/NN will/MD of/IN course/NN be/VB analysed/VBN by/IN the/DT Prosecutor/NN ,/, who/WP will/MD in/IN due/JJ course/NN decide/VB whether/IN or/CC not/RB there/EX is/VBZ cause/NN for/IN action/NN ./.

Until/IN that/DT time/NN Prosecutor/NNP Del/NNP Ponte/NNP has/VBZ decided/VBN not/RB to/TO examine/VB any/DT of/IN the/DT accusations/NNS of/IN criminality/NN made/VBN against/IN NATO/NNP ./.

I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT President-in-Office/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN him/PRP that/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN NATO/NNP '/POS s/JJ intervention/NN was/VBD to/TO stop/VB a/DT humanitarian/JJ disaster/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT humanitarian/JJ disaster/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP today/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT hell/NN of/IN Milosevic/NNP ,/, followed/VBN by/IN the/DT hell/NN of/IN the/DT KLA/NNP and/CC the/DT NATO/NNP forces/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT President-in-Office/NN has/VBZ noticed/VBN ,/, almost/RB half/PDT the/DT questions/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN to/TO answer/VB today/NN relate/VBP to/TO Kosovo/NNP ./.

Despite/IN this/DT ,/, he/PRP too/RB accepted/VBD that/IN the/DT inquisition/NN procedure/NN of/IN the/DT War/NNP Crimes/NNP Tribunal/NNP against/IN NATO/NNP after/IN applications/NNS by/IN Canadian/JJ and/CC other/JJ pacifist/NN organisations/NNS is/VBZ an/DT open/JJ question/NN ./.

Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP ,/, if/IN an/DT action/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN should/MD be/VB brought/VBN against/IN NATO/NNP and/CC if/IN this/DT action/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB brought/VBN against/IN Mr/NNP Javier/NNP Solana/NNP personally/RB ,/, we/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO bear/VB in/IN mind/NN that/IN Mr/NNP Javier/NNP Solana/NNP held/VBD one/CD post/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN and/CC is/VBZ holding/VBG a/DT different/JJ one/NN today/NN ./.

The/DT duties/NNS that/IN he/PRP exercises/VBZ today/NN have/VBP nothing/NN whatsoever/RB to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT duties/NNS that/IN he/PRP exercised/VBD during/IN his/PRP$ time/NN as/IN Secretary-General/NNP of/IN NATO/NNP ./.

In/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN any/DT corresponding/JJ indication/NN from/IN any/DT international/JJ judicial/JJ body/NN which/WDT could/MD justify/VB any/DT personal/JJ accusation/NN against/IN Mr/NNP Javier/NNP Solana/NNP -/: and/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT sign/NN of/IN this/DT whatsoever/RB -/: the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD not/RB of/IN course/NN make/VB any/DT statement/NN at/IN all/DT on/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP Mr/NNP Alavanos/NNP is/VBZ getting/VBG NATO/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Milosevic/NNP mixed/VBN up/RP ./.

Mr/NNP Milosevic/NNP should/MD be/VB appearing/VBG before/IN the/DT war/NN crimes/NNS tribunal/NN and/CC we/PRP should/MD be/VB awarding/VBG NATO/NNP the/DT Sakharov/NNP prize/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP have/VBP a/DT quite/RB different/JJ question/NN for/IN the/DT Council/NNP ./.

How/WRB do/VBP matters/NNS stand/VB in/IN Kosovo/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT rebuilding/NN of/IN the/DT administration/NN ,/, the/DT judiciary/NN and/CC ,/, most/RBS importantly/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT police/NN force/NN ?/.

You/PRP mentioned/VBD before/RB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP on/IN the/DT brink/NN of/IN catastrophe/NN there/RB and/CC nothing/NN is/VBZ being/VBG done/VBN ./.

Rapid/NNP action/NN is/VBZ called/VBN for/IN !/NNP ./.

First/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT priorities/NNS you/PRP have/VBP identified/VBN concerning/VBG personal/JJ responsibility/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Posselt/NNP ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT judicial/JJ structure/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, we/PRP have/VBP already/RB heard/VBN Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP ,/, on/IN various/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, describe/VB the/DT enormous/JJ difficulties/NNS he/PRP is/VBZ experiencing/VBG in/IN setting/VBG up/RP administrative/JJ machinery/NN and/CC a/DT judicial/JJ structure/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, the/DT first/JJ steps/NNS were/VBD taken/VBN some/DT months/NNS ago/IN ./.

We/PRP are/VBP all/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS ,/, and/CC particularly/RB the/DT financial/JJ difficulties/NNS ,/, that/IN Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP is/VBZ facing/VBG in/IN setting/VBG up/RP this/DT administrative/JJ machinery/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT special/JJ difficulty/NN involved/VBN in/IN recruiting/NN police/NNS so/RB as/RB to/TO ensure/VB day-to-day/JJ public/JJ safety/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT responsibility/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP takes/VBZ very/RB seriously/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Posselt/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO mention/VB that/IN ,/, at/IN the/DT General/NNP Affairs/NNPS Council/NNP held/VBN on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, this/DT issue/NN was/VBD repeatedly/RB stressed/VBN when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD discussing/VBG Kosovo/NNP ./.

Statements/NNS were/VBD made/VBN and/CC pressure/NN was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO bear/VB on/IN the/DT various/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS who/WP have/VBP undertaken/VBN to/TO make/VB police/NN resources/NNS available/JJ to/TO honour/VB their/PRP$ commitments/NNS ./.

Some/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP taking/VBG refuge/NN in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP provided/VBN military/JJ forces/NNS and/CC that/IN they/PRP can/MD not/RB send/VB the/DT police/NN forces/NNS ,/, to/TO which/WDT they/PRP committed/VBD themselves/PRP ,/, as/RB quickly/RB as/IN they/PRP would/MD like/VB ./.

We/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB very/RB much/RB aware/JJ that/IN this/DT factor/NN is/VBZ seriously/RB compromising/VBG Mr/NNP Kouchner/NNP '/POS s/JJ work/NN and/CC the/DT normalisation/NN of/IN administrative/JJ structures/NNS in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, especially/RB as/IN regards/VBZ judicial/JJ structures/NNS and/CC police/NNS cover/VB ./.

So/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB see/VB eye/NN to/TO eye/NN on/IN how/WRB we/PRP view/VBP certain/JJ targets/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, and/CC as/RB everyone/NN recognised/VBD during/IN the/DT military/JJ action/NN in/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, there/EX were/VBD civilian/JJ sectors/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ infrastructural/JJ sectors/NNS directly/RB affecting/VBG the/DT general/JJ public/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB inhabited/JJ areas/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD directly/RB affected/VBN by/IN NATO/NNP air/NN attacks/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ generally/RB recognised/VBN and/CC this/DT happens/VBZ in/IN all/DT wars/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT Kosovo/NNP war/NN was/VBD not/RB a/DT clean/JJ war/NN ,/, nor/CC a/DT model/NN war/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT war/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT art/NN of/IN the/DT possible/JJ ./.

And/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT necessary/JJ war/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB only/RB about/RB what/WP was/VBD possible/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO an/DT absolutely/RB unacceptable/JJ form/NN of/IN aggression/NN which/WDT was/VBD utterly/RB rejected/VBN by/IN the/DT entire/JJ international/JJ community/NN ./.

Destabilisation/NNP began/VBD around/RP ten/CD years/NNS ago/RB with/IN the/DT break-up/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP played/VBD a/DT decisive/JJ part/NN ./.

Yugoslavia/NNP '/POS s/JJ crime/NN was/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT only/RB Balkan/JJ country/NN that/WDT did/VBD not/RB ask/VB to/TO become/VB a/DT member/NN either/CC of/IN NATO/NNP or/CC of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

So/IN whatever/WDT remained/VBD standing/VBG after/IN the/DT air/NN attacks/NNS is/VBZ now/RB being/VBG destroyed/VBN by/IN the/DT supposedly/RB disarmed/JJ KLA/NN ,/, under/IN the/DT very/JJ nose/NN of/IN KFOR/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ role/NN as/IN an/DT occupying/JJ force/NN is/VBZ becoming/VBG increasingly/RB apparent/JJ ./.

Every/DT day/NN ,/, new/JJ crimes/NNS come/VBP to/TO light/VB against/IN non-Albanian/JJ speakers/NNS and/CC against/IN the/DT cultural/JJ heritage/NN of/IN Kosovo/NNP ,/, and/CC there/EX are/VBP hundreds/NNS of/IN violations/NNS of/IN the/DT UN/NNP '/POS s/NNP Resolution/NNP 1244/NNP ./.

I/PRP respect/VB your/PRP$ understanding/NN and/CC knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT Balkan/JJ region/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Alyssandrakis/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP difficult/JJ ,/, quite/RB frankly/RB ,/, to/TO understand/VB how/WRB respecting/VBG the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN the/DT region/NN can/MD ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN political/JJ stability/NN ,/, be/VB a/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT problem/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT democratic/JJ stability/NN of/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, it/PRP could/MD perhaps/RB be/VB said/VBN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT break-up/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP that/WDT caused/VBD the/DT current/JJ situation/NN ,/, but/CC let/VBD us/PRP not/RB get/VB involved/VBN in/IN interpreting/VBG an/DT international/JJ development/NN ./.

The/DT division/NN of/IN Yugoslavia/NNP is/VBZ probably/RB a/DT historical/JJ fact/NN that/IN we/PRP shall/MD have/VB to/TO accept/VB ,/, regardless/RB of/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS that/WDT may/MD have/VB been/VBN made/VBN along/IN the/DT way/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB feel/VB that/IN withdrawing/VBG international/JJ forces/NNS now/RB would/MD be/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN solution/NN ./.

Quite/PDT the/DT contrary/JJ ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT solution/NN leading/VBG to/TO calamity/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/RB disappointed/JJ with/IN the/DT answer/NN given/VBN by/IN the/DT President-in-Office/NN to/TO my/PRP$ colleague/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ ,/, if/IN we/PRP stress/VBP that/IN Europe/NNP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN values/NNS ,/, that/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB go/VB down/RP the/DT road/NN of/IN saying/VBG that/IN means/NNS justify/VB ends/NNS ./.

If/IN civilian/JJ targets/NNS were/VBD targeted/VBN and/CC destroyed/VBN ,/, killing/VBG civilians/NNS is/VBZ illegal/JJ by/IN anyone/NN 's/POS standards/NNS ./.

It/PRP should/MD not/RB be/VB defended/VBN even/RB by/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP deeply/RB deplore/VBP the/DT Milosevic/JJ regime/NN ./.

That/DT ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB my/PRP$ question/NN ./.

Mr/NNP MacCormick/NNP ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO answer/VB your/PRP$ comments/NNS ./.

I/PRP did/VBD not/RB defend/VB attacks/NNS on/IN civilians/NNS ./.

What/WP is/VBZ a/DT legitimate/JJ target/NN is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT grey/JJ area/NN ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB making/VBG value/NN judgements/NNS about/IN specific/JJ actions/NNS ./.

We/PRP agree/VBP with/IN the/DT general/JJ view/NN of/IN NATO/NNP '/POS s/JJ action/NN ./.

In/IN spite/NN of/IN everything/NN ,/, all/PDT this/DT represents/VBZ only/RB one/CD of/IN many/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN highly/RB pernicious/JJ action/NN perpetrated/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Milosevic/NNP on/IN Yugoslavian/NNP society/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ of/IN course/NN inevitably/RB concerned/VBN about/IN this/DT situation/NN ./.

What/WP are/VBP the/DT Council/NNP 's/POS views/NNS on/IN incorporating/VBG the/DT Charter/NNP into/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN European/NNP Union/NNP ?/.

I/PRP thank/VBP the/DT President-in-Office/NN for/IN the/DT concerns/NNS and/CC certainties/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ expressed/VBN about/IN the/DT progress/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN ./.

You/PRP will/MD understand/VB ,/, Mr/NNP President-in-Office/NNP ,/, that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT point/NN to/TO my/PRP$ question/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ body/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP and/CC the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP ,/, men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, want/VBP to/TO know/VB how/WRB it/PRP views/VBZ the/DT democratic/JJ and/CC social/JJ model/NN of/IN Europe/NNP in/IN the/DT twenty-first/JJ century/NN ./.

As/IN a/DT supplementary/JJ question/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO ask/VB you/PRP whether/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, you/PRP have/VBP made/VBN provision/NN for/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN children/NNS ,/, as/RB such/JJ ,/, to/TO be/VB included/VBN in/IN future/JJ deliberations/NNS and/CC the/DT rights/NNS to/TO be/VB incorporated/VBN in/IN the/DT Charter/NNP ./.

As/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, Mrs/NNP Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou/VBZ ,/, we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN control/NN of/IN the/DT procedure/NN for/IN drawing/VBG up/RP the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

This/DT procedure/NN falls/VBZ within/IN the/DT competence/NN of/IN the/DT members/NNS of/IN the/DT group/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT matter/NN will/MD only/RB be/VB submitted/VBN to/TO the/DT Council/NNP if/IN and/CC when/WRB consensus/NN is/VBZ reached/VBN on/IN the/DT terms/NNS of/IN this/DT charter/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD nevertheless/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT rights/NNS of/IN the/DT child/NN ,/, that/IN we/PRP consider/VBP this/DT to/TO be/VB an/DT extremely/RB topical/JJ issue/NN ,/, particularly/RB for/IN the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Europe/NNP and/CC in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN relevant/JJ international/JJ texts/NNS to/TO which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP signed/VBN up/RP ./.

This/DT matter/NN should/MD form/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

This/DT will/MD certainly/RB be/VB the/DT guideline/NN that/IN my/PRP$ government/NN for/IN one/CD will/MD advocate/NN for/IN the/DT Charter/NNP of/IN Fundamental/JJ Rights/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB whether/IN these/DT proposals/NNS will/MD meet/VB with/IN a/DT favourable/JJ reception/NN or/CC not/RB ./.

I/PRP presume/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT particularly/RB controversial/JJ matter/NN and/CC we/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD simply/RB involve/VB bringing/VBG together/RP the/DT currently/RB agreed/VBN corpus/NN of/IN rights/NNS ,/, which/WDT even/RB the/DT most/RBS elementary/JJ justice/NN would/MD suggest/VB should/MD be/VB included/VBN in/IN the/DT charter/NN and/CC be/VB shared/VBN by/IN the/DT Union/NNP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD remind/VB Members/NNS that/IN ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT guidelines/NNS for/IN these/DT sittings/NNS ,/, questions/NNS must/MD be/VB concise/JJ and/CC be/VB worded/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN which/WDT will/MD allow/VB a/DT brief/JJ answer/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN the/DT President-in-Office/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO answer/VB everything/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP must/MD ensure/VB that/IN this/DT sitting/VBG consists/VBZ of/IN questions/NNS and/CC answers/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ one/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ consequence/NN of/IN cooperation/NN within/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ now/RB a/DT natural/JJ consequence/NN to/TO move/VB on/RP to/TO social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS ./.

These/DT areas/NNS are/VBP mutually/RB dependent/JJ upon/IN one/CD another/DT ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, social/JJ security/NN is/VBZ a/DT factor/NN of/IN production/NN ./.

Social/NNP security/NN systems/NNS differ/VBP from/IN one/CD EU/NNP country/NN to/TO another/DT ./.

This/DT is/VBZ largely/RB due/JJ to/TO historical/JJ factors/NNS ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB faced/VBN with/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN common/JJ challenges/NNS ,/, however/RB ;/: demographic/JJ development/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ to/TO do/VB not/RB only/JJ with/IN the/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN elderly/JJ people/NNS but/CC also/RB with/IN the/DT lower/JJR birth/NN rate/NN ./.

Equality/NNP has/VBZ no/DT pillar/NN of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./.

We/PRP expect/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO present/VB this/DT as/IN part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ proposal/NN for/IN a/DT social/JJ action/NN programme/NN ./.

Social/NNP convergence/NNP is/VBZ also/RB needed/VBN before/IN the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP ,/, partly/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT social/JJ model/NN and/CC partly/RB to/TO combat/VB the/DT risk/NN of/IN social/JJ dumping/NNS ./.

I/PRP shall/MD also/RB reject/VB those/DT amendments/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN tabled/VBN by/IN the/DT Technical/NNP Group/NNP of/IN Independent/JJ Members/NNS ,/, because/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB that/IN these/DT add/VBP anything/NN to/TO the/DT report/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN will/MD applaud/VB Amendment/NNP No/NNP 14/CD from/IN the/DT group/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Liberal/NNP ,/, Democrat/NNP and/CC Reform/NNP Party/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP this/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ one/NN ./.

Certainly/RB ,/, it/PRP resembles/VBZ Amendment/NNP No/NNP 1/CD ,/, but/CC Amendment/NNP No/NNP 14/CD is/VBZ better/JJR ./.

Finally/RB ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB concerned/VBN with/IN cooperation/NN on/IN trade/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT union/NN for/IN employment/NN and/CC social/JJ justice/NN ./.

In/IN creating/VBG a/DT citizens/NNS '/POS Europe/NNP ,/, social/JJ policy/NN has/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB ./.

By/IN means/NNS of/IN this/DT report/NN ,/, Parliament/NNP wishes/VBZ to/TO make/VB its/PRP$ contribution/NN to/TO reinforcing/VBG the/DT social/JJ dimension/NN of/IN European/JJ society/NN ./.

We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT Council/NNP and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD take/VB this/DT contribution/NN seriously/RB and/CC include/VB it/PRP in/IN future/JJ social/JJ policy/NN ./.

The/DT Lisbon/NNP Summit/NNP will/MD provide/VB an/DT excellent/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO present/VB a/DT strategy/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP ,/, very/RB warmly/JJ on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN on/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN which/WDT is/VBZ now/RB under/IN discussion/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT capacity/NN of/IN coordinator/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ People/NNS '/POS s/NNP Party/NNP in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Employment/NNP and/CC Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB pleased/JJ with/IN the/DT compromise/NN which/WDT was/VBD reached/VBN and/CC which/WDT Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP put/VBD so/RB much/JJ effort/NN into/IN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP also/RB delighted/JJ that/IN he/PRP based/VBD the/DT report/NN on/IN a/DT report/NN which/WDT was/VBD written/VBN by/IN myself/PRP as/IN rapporteur/NN under/IN the/DT previous/JJ Parliament/NNP and/CC has/VBZ partly/RB followed/VBN the/DT gist/NN of/IN this/DT old/JJ report/NN ./.

The/DT goal/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ notification/NN of/IN June/NNP 1999/CD ,/, on/IN which/WDT the/DT Andersson/NNP report/NN is/VBZ based/VBN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO reinforce/VB cooperation/NN between/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT EU/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ./.

Key/NNP sub-goals/NNS are/VBP :/: promoting/VBG employment/NN and/CC ensuring/VBG that/IN work/NN secures/VBZ a/DT fixed/VBN income/NN ;/: secondly/NN ,/, safeguarding/VBG old-age/JJ pensions/NNS and/CC making/VBG these/DT affordable/JJ ;/: thirdly/RB ,/, promoting/VBG social/JJ integration/NN and/CC fourthly/NN ,/, guaranteeing/VBG affordable/JJ ,/, first-rate/JJ health/NN protection/NN ./.

Gender-related/JJ aspects/NNS must/MD feature/VB prominently/RB in/IN all/PDT these/DT goals/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN congratulations/NNS are/VBP also/RB in/IN order/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP with/IN regard/NN to/TO this/DT notification/NN ,/, for/IN these/DT four/CD points/NNS are/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, to/TO a/DT very/RB large/JJ number/NN of/IN EU/NNP citizens/NNS extremely/RB important/JJ -/: if/IN not/RB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ points/NNS which/WDT merit/NN further/RBR thought/VBD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ communication/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ strategic/JJ document/NN for/IN bringing/VBG about/IN European/JJ social/JJ convergence/NN ./.

Macro-economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, employment/NN policy/NN and/CC social/JJ policy/NN all/RB affect/VB each/DT other/JJ and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB they/PRP should/MD be/VB brought/VBN more/RBR closely/RB together/RB ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ recognised/VBN this/DT interrelatedness/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ our/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO bring/VB about/IN an/DT integrated/JJ social/JJ strategy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, underpinned/VBN by/IN a/DT sound/JJ macro-economic/JJ strategy/NN and/CC a/DT sound/JJ employment/NN strategy/NN ./.

These/DT aspects/NNS are/VBP very/RB much/RB interconnected/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, surprising/JJ that/IN this/DT topic/NN has/VBZ ,/, to/TO date/NN ,/, not/RB been/VBN incorporated/VBN in/IN a/DT strategy/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ notification/NN constitutes/VBZ a/DT break-through/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN ./.

It/PRP brings/VBZ me/PRP great/JJ joy/NN to/TO witness/NN that/IN the/DT Council/NNP now/RB seems/VBZ to/TO accept/VB this/DT break-through/NN and/CC also/RB wants/VBZ to/TO bring/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT fore/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, not/RB get/VB overly/RB excited/JJ about/IN it/PRP ./.

It/PRP marks/VBZ the/DT beginning/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, of/IN a/DT process/NN ./.

Some/DT people/NNS have/VBP wondered/VBD whether/IN our/PRP$ demands/NNS are/VBP too/RB low/JJ or/CC whether/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB more/JJR dialogue/NN ./.

But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB significant/JJ for/IN the/DT process/NN to/TO be/VB set/VBN in/IN motion/NN ./.

The/DT issues/NNS involved/VBN are/VBP extremely/RB important/JJ but/CC the/DT systems/NNS in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP are/VBP quite/RB different/JJ from/IN one/CD another/DT ./.

The/DT challenges/NNS are/VBP different/JJ ./.

The/DT levels/NNS of/IN employment/NN are/VBP different/JJ and/CC this/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ to/TO set/VB the/DT ball/NN rolling/VBG gently/RB but/RB to/TO make/VB steady/JJ progress/NN nonetheless/RB ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO meet/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN huge/JJ challenges/NNS ./.

The/DT majority/NN within/IN my/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN something/NN like/IN this/DT needs/VBZ to/TO happen/VB ./.

The/DT funny/JJ thing/NN about/IN the/DT Andersson/NNP report/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB get/VB bogged/VBD down/IN with/IN too/RB many/JJ details/NNS of/IN how/WRB everything/NN should/MD take/VB shape/NN ;/: from/IN this/DT perspective/NN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT pie-in-the-sky/NN report/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT report/NN which/WDT tries/VBZ to/TO give/VB direction/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, one/CD or/CC two/CD aspects/NNS about/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP doubts/VBZ as/IN to/TO whether/IN or/CC not/RB we/PRP are/VBP being/VBG too/RB specific/JJ ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN MEPs/NNP will/MD make/VB reference/NN to/TO this/DT ./.

But/CC that/DT does/VBZ not/RB take/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT report/NN '/POS s/JJ importance/NN mainly/RB lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP developing/VBG a/DT strategy/NN and/CC that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ chance/NN that/IN it/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT significant/JJ contribution/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD to/TO be/VB adopted/VBN in/IN Lisbon/NNP in/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, Lisbon/NNP will/MD turn/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT success/NN ./.

If/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB adopted/VBN ,/, Lisbon/NNP will/MD not/RB add/VB much/RB to/TO what/WP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN said/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN this/DT is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, the/DT report/NN ,/, albeit/VBG a/DT component/NN ,/, may/MD well/RB be/VB the/DT key/JJ component/NN of/IN Lisbon/NNP ,/, because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB innovative/JJ ,/, while/IN many/JJ other/JJ things/NNS are/VBP merely/RB a/DT rumination/NN of/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN before/RB ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP am/VBP indebted/JJ to/TO the/DT rapporteur/NN and/CC the/DT Committee/NNP for/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Europe/NNP ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, will/MD make/VB a/DT step/NN forward/RB ,/, taking/VBG into/IN account/NN subsidiarity/NN ,/, for/IN without/IN subsidiarity/NN ,/, this/DT would/MD not/RB be/VB possible/JJ ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, like/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ MEP/NN ,/, Bartho/NNP Pronk/NNP ,/, please/VB allow/VB me/PRP to/TO thank/VB the/DT Commission/NNP for/IN this/DT communication/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, to/TO congratulate/VB our/PRP$ rapporteur/NN for/IN the/DT work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ put/VBN into/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT report/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR controversial/JJ within/IN Parliament/NNP does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ lost/VBN any/DT of/IN its/PRP$ crucial/JJ importance/NN ./.

There/EX have/VBP been/VBN times/NNS within/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP when/WRB such/JJ discussions/NNS on/IN social/JJ security/NN were/VBD actually/RB quite/RB awkward/JJ ./.

Within/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, it/PRP speaks/VBZ for/IN itself/PRP that/IN social/JJ protection/NN forms/VBZ an/DT important/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT social/JJ cohesion/NN and/CC should/MD thus/RB also/RB be/VB added/VBN to/TO the/DT agenda/NN in/IN Lisbon/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ pleased/JJ that/IN the/DT Social/NNP Affairs/NNPS Council/NNP gave/VBD the/DT go-ahead/NN for/IN a/DT better/JJR cooperation/NN strategy/NN as/RB early/RB on/IN as/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ year/NN and/CC that/IN ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT group/NN of/IN high-ranking/JJ officials/NNS has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN commissioned/VBN to/TO submit/VB to/TO the/DT Council/NNP an/DT initial/JJ report/NN by/IN June/NNP 2000/CD ./.

However/RB ,/, we/PRP ,/, the/DT Parliament/NNP and/CC ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT group/NN of/IN the/DT Social/NNP Democrats/NNPS ,/, want/VBP Lisbon/NNP to/TO go/VB one/CD step/NN further/RBR now/RB ./.

We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT course/NN of/IN action/NN is/VBZ ambitious/JJ ,/, yet/CC achievable/JJ ./.

Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN harmonisation/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN is/VBZ not/RB viable/JJ at/IN European/JJ level/NN ./.

But/CC this/DT new/JJ course/NN of/IN action/NN is/VBZ very/RB exciting/JJ ./.

The/DT employment/NN strategy/NN has/VBZ proved/VBN that/IN it/PRP can/MD function/VB well/RB and/CC social/JJ convergence/NN is/VBZ also/RB necessary/JJ ,/, for/IN our/PRP$ social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS are/VBP facing/VBG the/DT same/JJ challenges/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN an/DT EMU/NNP era/NN ,/, social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS would/MD otherwise/RB threaten/VB to/TO fall/VB prey/NN to/TO social/JJ competition/NN ./.

But/CC let/VB me/PRP make/VB one/CD thing/NN clear/JJ on/IN behalf/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN :/: social/JJ convergence/NN strategies/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB an/DT alternative/NN to/TO social/JJ legislation/NN ./.

They/PRP can/MD merely/RB serve/VB as/IN an/DT extremely/RB useful/JJ complement/NN to/TO what/WP we/PRP are/VBP developing/VBG and/CC expecting/VBG from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ legislation/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN it/PRP also/RB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN if/IN ,/, moreover/RB ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP tried/VBD to/TO convince/VB the/DT Council/NNP to/TO substantiate/VB the/DT common/JJ strategy/NN as/RB early/RB on/IN as/RB in/IN Lisbon/NNP and/CC to/TO launch/VB an/DT annual/JJ procedure/NN to/TO reduce/VB poverty/NN levels/NNS no/RB later/RB than/IN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN 2001/CD ./.

I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ about/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP supports/VBZ my/PRP$ group/NN '/POS s/JJ idea/NN and/CC we/PRP hope/VBP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, that/IN we/PRP can/MD also/RB count/VB on/IN your/PRP$ support/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP urge/VBP the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, both/DT sides/NNS of/IN industry/NN and/CC social/JJ NGOs/NNS to/TO be/VB closely/RB involved/VBN in/IN this/DT process/NN ./.

The/DT success/NN of/IN this/DT strategy/NN hinges/VBZ on/IN a/DT broad/JJ and/CC democratic/JJ base/NN and/CC we/PRP hope/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD count/VB on/IN your/PRP$ support/NN ./.

We/PRP now/RB already/RB have/VBP major/JJ social/JJ problems/NNS and/CC major/JJ social/JJ costs/NNS to/TO find/VB from/IN the/DT public/JJ budgets/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN for/IN many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

If/IN reforms/NNS are/VBP not/RB got/VBN under/IN way/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP in/IN danger/NN of/IN eroding/VBG the/DT economic/JJ basis/NN of/IN social/JJ policy/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT strong/JJ and/CC competitive/JJ economy/NN is/VBZ now/RB undoubtedly/RB the/DT most/RBS secure/JJ basis/NN for/IN effective/JJ social/JJ security/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB only/RB reasonable/JJ to/TO put/VB these/DT subjects/NNS on/IN the/DT agenda/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT debate/NN about/IN coordination/NN of/IN social/JJ policy/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP ,/, we/PRP often/RB use/VBP the/DT expression/NN social/JJ convergence/JJ ./.

As/IN liberals/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD support/VB this/DT concept/NN when/WRB it/PRP means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP in/IN the/DT EU/NNP are/VBP to/TO establish/VB broad/JJ common/JJ objectives/NNS with/IN which/WDT the/DT individual/JJ countries/NNS then/RB seek/VBP to/TO comply/VB by/IN means/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ national/JJ social/JJ policies/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, about/RB harmonisation/NN but/CC about/RB common/JJ objectives/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT EU/NNP countries/NNS have/VBP different/JJ ways/NNS of/IN organising/VBG social/JJ policy/NN ./.

National/NNP policy/NN is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, subject/JJ to/TO a/DT number/NN of/IN common/JJ parameters/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN minimum/JJ social/JJ entitlements/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP established/VBN by/IN treaty/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ in/IN regard/NN to/TO guaranteeing/VBG the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN labour/NN without/IN loss/NN of/IN social/JJ entitlements/NNS ./.

It/PRP applies/VBZ to/TO the/DT fact/NN of/IN our/PRP$ having/VBG to/TO coordinate/VB our/PRP$ economies/NNS ;/: and/CC it/PRP applies/VBZ in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN economic/JJ cooperation/NN ./.

So/IN coordination/NN and/CC cooperation/NN are/VBP facts/NNS of/IN life/NN ./.

But/CC convergence/NN should/MD be/VB about/IN goals/NNS ,/, not/RB means/VBZ ./.

I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ,/, Jan/NNP Andersson/NNP ,/, for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN and/CC for/IN his/PRP$ very/RB constructive/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT attempt/NN to/TO reconcile/VB different/JJ positions/NNS and/CC to/TO secure/VB support/NN for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD support/VB the/DT report/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ points/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB completely/RB to/TO my/PRP$ taste/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sceptical/JJ about/IN the/DT detailed/JJ regulations/NNS that/WDT might/MD result/VB from/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/NN having/VBG to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT scope/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN child/NN care/NN and/CC care/NN of/IN the/DT elderly/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP sceptical/JJ about/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN a/DT common/JJ poverty/NN threshold/NN ./.

Dialogue/NNP and/CC the/DT coordination/NN of/IN social/JJ policy/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB commended/VBN ,/, but/CC we/PRP should/MD not/RB lump/VB all/DT nations/NNS together/RB as/RB if/IN they/PRP were/VBD the/DT same/JJ ./.

There/EX should/MD be/VB room/NN for/IN a/DT multiplicity/NN of/IN solutions/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT strategy/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN out/RP here/RB on/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ security/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO point/VB out/RP some/DT positive/JJ things/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN raise/VB some/DT questions/NNS that/WDT have/VBP come/VBN up/RP for/IN me/PRP ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP positive/JJ about/IN the/DT movement/NN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB gradually/RB taking/VBG place/NN in/IN the/DT dossier/NN ./.

This/DT seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN and/CC useful/JJ ./.

I/PRP also/RB feel/VBP positive/JJ about/IN the/DT essence/NN of/IN the/DT communication/NN ,/, namely/RB the/DT strategic/JJ approach/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB hope/VBP that/IN the/DT four/CD objectives/NNS which/WDT are/VBP mentioned/VBN in/IN it/PRP can/MD reasonably/RB be/VB achieved/VBN ./.

We/PRP nonetheless/RB foresee/VBP two/CD problems/NNS for/IN which/WDT solutions/NNS will/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB found/VBN ./.

The/DT first/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ that/DT concerning/VBG the/DT downward/JJ adjustment/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, we/PRP hope/VBP ,/, will/MD be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN high-level/JJ convergence/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD illustrate/VB this/DT with/IN examples/NNS from/IN a/DT study/NN which/WDT was/VBD carried/VBN out/RP recently/RB by/IN the/DT Dutch/JJ trade/NN union/NN movement/NN into/IN social/JJ security/NN reforms/NNS within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

It/PRP appears/VBZ from/IN this/DT study/NN that/IN adjustments/NNS are/VBP rife/JJ but/CC most/JJS of/IN these/DT adjustments/NNS ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN them/PRP ,/, appear/VBP to/TO be/VB downward/JJ adjustments/NNS ,/, the/DT remainder/NN being/VBG improvements/NNS ./.

The/DT lion/NN '/POS s/JJ share/NN of/IN these/DT adjustments/NNS pertains/VBZ to/TO pension/NN plans/NNS :/: eleven/JJ restrictions/NNS and/CC two/CD improvements/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN unemployment/NN benefits/NNS ,/, we/PRP came/VBD across/IN six/CD restrictions/NNS and/CC five/CD improvements/NNS ./.

The/DT reasons/NNS for/IN adjustments/NNS are/VBP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, to/TO improve/VB employment/NN ,/, reduce/VB social/JJ security/NN expenditure/NN ,/, but/CC are/VBP also/RB due/JJ to/TO policy/NN competition/NN and/CC EMU/NN criteria/NNS ./.

Policy/NNP competition/NN mainly/RB occurs/VBZ in/IN the/DT northern/JJ countries/NNS ./.

The/DT highest/JJS level/NN of/IN stability/NN and/CC even/RB improvement/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN can/MD be/VB found/VBN in/IN the/DT southern/JJ countries/NNS ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, both/DT sides/NNS of/IN industry/NN only/RB have/VBP a/DT limited/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN the/DT process/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO write/VB home/NN about/IN and/CC means/VBZ that/IN the/DT convergence/JJ strategy/NN must/MD focus/VB on/IN the/DT best/JJS approaches/NNS ./.

To/TO use/VB a/DT figure/NN of/IN speech/NN ,/, cappuccino/NN is/VBZ not/RB always/RB good/JJ for/IN us/PRP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD ,/, in/IN turn/NN ,/, like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB both/PDT the/DT Commission/NN ,/, for/IN making/VBG another/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT convergence/JJ process/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO social/JJ security/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT rapporteur/NN for/IN the/DT sound/NN report/VBP he/PRP has/VBZ compiled/VBN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ policy/NN encompasses/VBZ social/JJ policy/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO economic/JJ and/CC employment/NN policy/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, social/JJ policy/NN has/VBZ remained/VBN limited/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN set-up/NN and/CC resources/NNS ./.

But/CC under/IN the/DT influence/NN of/IN the/DT free/JJ movement/NN of/IN employees/NNS ,/, of/IN the/DT internal/JJ market/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT euro/NN ,/, the/DT labour/NN markets/NNS are/VBP actually/RB beginning/VBG to/TO become/VB integrated/JJ ./.

Judging/VBG from/IN the/DT discussions/NNS held/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ five/CD or/CC six/CD months/NNS ,/, this/DT could/MD well/RB be/VB the/DT case/NN ./.

We/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN 1995/CD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD agreed/VBN that/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS should/MD be/VB given/VBN better/JJR protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS failed/VBD to/TO cooperate/VB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ just/RB a/DT political/JJ fact/NN about/IN which/WDT little/RB can/MD be/VB done/VBN at/IN present/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ now/RB possible/JJ ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN Article/NNP 280/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP will/MD take/VB new/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO suggest/VB to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP that/IN it/PRP do/VBP this/DT at/IN the/DT earliest/JJS opportunity/NN ./.

Unlike/IN the/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN ,/, who/WP has/VBZ now/RB disappeared/VBN ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN is/VBZ strongly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ colleague/NN Jan-Kees/NNP Wiebenga/NNP ,/, will/MD undoubtedly/RB take/VB this/DT point/NN further/RBR because/IN he/PRP has/VBZ already/RB published/VBN a/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT same/JJ subject/NN matter/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP what/WP we/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ ,/, at/IN European/JJ level/NN ,/, to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN exact/JJ definitions/NNS of/IN fraud/NN and/CC irregularity/NN as/RB quickly/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

I/PRP myself/PRP have/VBP been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT committee/NN of/IN inquiry/NN on/IN transit/NN traffic/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ problems/NNS in/IN this/DT area/NN was/VBD that/IN if/IN you/PRP do/VBP something/NN wrong/RB ,/, especially/RB when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO revenue/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, then/RB this/DT will/MD be/VB termed/VBN an/DT irregularity/NN in/IN one/CD country/NN and/CC a/DT crime/NN in/IN another/DT ./.

This/DT ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR permissible/NN ,/, certainly/RB not/RB at/IN the/DT moment/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB one/CD general/JJ point/NN on/IN politics/NNS ./.

Whatever/WDT we/PRP may/MD say/VB about/IN the/DT European/JJ elections/NNS ,/, the/DT low/JJ turnout/NN is/VBZ a/DT fact/NN ./.

We/PRP can/MD improve/VB on/IN this/DT by/IN punishing/VBG crime/NN in/IN Europe/NNP quickly/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT must/MD be/VB done/VBN at/IN European/JJ level/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP too/RB would/MD like/VB to/TO thank/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN may/MD help/VB to/TO restore/VB confidence/NN in/IN European/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN is/VBZ something/NN we/PRP are/VBP all/DT desperately/RB in/IN need/NN of/IN ,/, bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN the/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT last/JJ European/JJ elections/NNS and/CC of/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN turnout/NN ./.

Yet/CC ,/, every/DT year/NN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT same/JJ problem/NN ./.

The/DT Court/NNP of/IN Auditors/NNS publishes/VBZ its/PRP$ report/NN ,/, which/WDT criticises/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS on/IN account/NN of/IN various/JJ incidences/NNS of/IN fraud/NN ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS have/VBP not/RB had/VBN sufficient/JJ means/NNS at/IN their/PRP$ disposal/NN to/TO take/VB vigorous/JJ action/NN here/RB ,/, to/TO ensure/VB that/IN implementation/NN actually/RB takes/VBZ place/NN and/CC that/IN matters/NNS are/VBP remedied/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB this/DT process/NN that/WDT undermines/VBZ confidence/NN every/DT year/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN and/CC her/PRP$ proposal/NN can/MD help/VB to/TO reverse/VB this/DT very/JJ process/NN and/CC to/TO make/VB clear/JJ that/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS take/VBP steps/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN European/JJ money/NN is/VBZ employed/VBN in/IN a/DT targeted/JJ manner/NN and/CC that/IN no/DT fraud/NN is/VBZ perpetrated/VBN here/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ that/IN after/IN the/DT first/JJ step/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN taken/VBN ,/, i.e./VBZ forming/VBG OLAF/NNP from/IN UCLAF/NNP -/: an/DT independent/JJ institution/NN -/: we/PRP now/RB take/VB the/DT second/JJ step/NN and/CC create/VB a/DT legal/JJ framework/NN for/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, in/IN order/NN that/IN OLAF/NNP too/RB might/MD operate/VB within/IN a/DT secure/JJ legal/JJ framework/NN ./.

We/PRP will/MD need/VB the/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP for/IN this/DT ,/, which/WDT will/MD see/VB to/TO it/PRP that/IN there/EX are/VBP clear/JJ legal/JJ guarantees/NNS ,/, also/RB for/IN suspects/NNS ./.

Having/VBG said/VBD all/DT that/WDT ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN unfortunately/RB ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB voting/VBG for/IN your/PRP$ report/NN as/IN a/DT united/VBN front/NN ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN the/DT debate/NN will/MD convince/VB a/DT few/JJ more/JJR people/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, people/NNS still/RB have/VBP too/RB many/JJ misgivings/NNS to/TO the/DT effect/NN that/IN this/DT will/MD be/VB the/DT kind/NN of/IN European/JJ institution/NN that/WDT undermines/VBZ subsidiarity/RB ./.

But/CC I/PRP will/MD do/VB what/WP I/PRP can/MD to/TO see/VB that/IN Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN receives/VBZ more/JJR support/NN ./.

The/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP and/CC the/DT definition/NN of/IN offences/NNS common/JJ to/TO all/DT countries/NNS of/IN the/DT Union/NNP is/VBZ doubtless/RB a/DT good/JJ idea/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO consider/VB putting/VBG this/DT into/IN practice/NN without/IN having/VBG first/RB introduced/VBN a/DT European/JJ legal/JJ system/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN criminal/JJ law/NN ,/, the/DT area/NN where/WRB resistance/NN that/IN national/JJ States/NNPS put/VBD up/RP to/TO communitisation/NN is/VBZ ,/, and/CC will/MD be/VB ,/, fierce/JJ ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ unthinkable/JJ that/IN we/PRP could/MD put/VB in/IN place/NN substantial/JJ and/CC procedural/JJ legal/JJ regulations/NNS solely/RB for/IN one/CD sector/NN -/: that/DT of/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN financial/JJ interests/NNS -/: without/IN first/RB having/VBG created/VBN a/DT European/JJ legal/JJ system/NN ./.

Reading/VBG the/DT precise/JJ and/CC comprehensive/JJ explanations/NNS in/IN the/DT Theato/NNP report/NN makes/VBZ you/PRP realise/VBP just/RB how/WRB many/JJ problems/NNS still/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB resolved/VBN and/CC what/WP these/DT problems/NNS are/VBP ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, this/DT idea/NN must/MD be/VB encouraged/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PRP will/MD doubtless/RB be/VB during/IN this/DT attempt/NN to/TO protect/VB financial/JJ interests/NNS that/IN we/PRP realise/VBP that/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO include/VB a/DT Community/NNP corpus/NN iuris/NNS in/IN the/DT Treaties/NNPS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN we/PRP support/VBP the/DT Theato/NNP report/NN ;/: I/PRP nevertheless/RB think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT subject/NN that/WDT should/MD be/VB included/VBN on/IN the/DT IGC/NNP agenda/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT protection/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS proposes/VBZ centralising/VBG criminal/JJ proceedings/NNS by/IN initially/RB creating/VBG a/DT European/JJ Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP ./.

This/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ radically/RB opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT spirit/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ system/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT criminal/JJ law/NN and/CC criminal/JJ proceedings/NNS that/WDT lie/VBP at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ legal/JJ systems/NNS must/MD come/VB under/IN the/DT sovereignty/NN of/IN each/DT nation/NN and/CC lie/VB within/IN the/DT exclusive/JJ competence/NN of/IN each/DT state/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, aims/VBZ in/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN to/TO confine/VB the/DT national/JJ states/NNS to/TO a/DT subordinate/JJ role/NN in/IN these/DT matters/NNS ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, this/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ liable/JJ to/TO set/VB off/RP a/DT chain/NN reaction/NN of/IN totally/RB unforeseen/JJ reforms/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO the/DT Theato/NNP report/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP is/VBZ needed/VBN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO better/RBR support/VB the/DT inquiries/NNS of/IN the/DT anti-fraud/JJ office/NN ,/, OLAF/NNP ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP see/VBP from/IN the/DT van/NNP Hulten/NNP report/NN under/IN discussion/NN today/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP should/MD in/IN turn/NN be/VB supervised/VBN by/IN a/DT European/JJ Union/NNP court/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, a/DT small/JJ European/JJ reform/NN may/MD hide/VB a/DT medium-sized/JJ one/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT medium-sized/JJ one/NN may/MD hide/VB a/DT large/JJ one/NN ./.

Not/RB to/TO mention/VB that/IN the/DT large/JJ one/NN may/MD hide/VB a/DT gigantic/JJ one/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT very/RB next/JJ thing/NN we/PRP will/MD see/VB is/VBZ a/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT European/JJ criminal/JJ law/NN and/CC then/RB ,/, why/WRB not/RB a/DT European/NNP Minister/NNP of/IN Justice/NNP ,/, supervised/VBD by/IN an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT powers/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ?/.

I/PRP therefore/RB feel/VBP we/PRP must/MD carefully/RB consider/VB the/DT balance/NN of/IN power/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP in/IN danger/NN of/IN upsetting/VBG if/IN we/PRP put/VBD forward/RP this/DT type/NN of/IN reform/NN ,/, which/WDT appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB quite/RB specific/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT final/JJ analysis/NN ,/, we/PRP feel/VBP that/IN proposals/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP demonstrate/VBP an/DT inability/NN to/TO conceive/VB of/IN a/DT Europe/NNP in/IN anything/NN other/JJ than/IN a/DT centralised/JJ and/CC hierarchical/JJ form/NN ,/, organised/VBN around/IN a/DT superstate/NN ./.

The/DT Union/NNP for/IN a/DT Europe/NNP of/IN Nations/NNP Group/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, wishes/VBZ to/TO see/VB a/DT polycentric/JJ Europe/NNP with/IN nations/NNS linked/VBN in/IN a/DT network/NN ./.

And/CC such/PDT a/DT network/NN could/MD take/VB the/DT form/NN of/IN improved/VBN coordination/NN between/IN national/JJ public/JJ prosecution/NN authorities/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT creation/NN ,/, if/IN necessary/JJ ,/, of/IN national/JJ teams/NNS specialising/VBG in/IN offences/NNS involving/VBG Community/NNP finances/NNS ./.

So/IN the/DT legal/JJ framework/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, is/VBZ already/RB in/IN place/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ fine/JJ ,/, in/IN principle/NN ./.

It/PRP need/VBP only/RB be/VB fine-tuned/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP is/VBZ proposing/VBG institutional/JJ revolution/NN for/IN a/DT twofold/JJ reason/NN ./.

Public/NNP opinion/NN ,/, although/IN indifferent/JJ to/TO 20/CD million/CD unemployed/NNS and/CC thousands/NNS of/IN mad/JJ cows/NNS ,/, is/VBZ now/RB supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB worried/VBN about/IN the/DT fraud/NN endangering/VBG financial/JJ interests/NNS and/CC these/DT two/CD reasons/NNS are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO justify/VB a/DT twofold/JJ solution/NN :/: a/DT European/JJ criminal/JJ code/NN with/IN crimes/NNS against/IN the/DT Community/NNP and/CC a/DT European/JJ Prosecutor-General/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP probably/RB forgot/VBD to/TO include/VB a/DT European/JJ prison/NN now/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT FBI/NNP ,/, the/DT European/JJ police/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN OLAF/NNP ./.

And/CC indeed/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT twofold/JJ shift/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT classic/JJ Eurofederalist/NN ideological/JJ shift/NN ,/, a/DT single/JJ market/NN ,/, a/DT single/JJ VAT/NN ,/, a/DT single/JJ diplomatic/JJ service/NN ,/, a/DT single/JJ army/NN and/CC now/RB a/DT single/JJ criminal/JJ code/NN and/CC a/DT single/JJ public/JJ prosecutor/NN ./.

Next/RB we/PRP have/VBP the/DT Puritan/NNP shift/NN :/: the/DT Teutonic/NNP Europe/NNP of/IN the/DT North/NNP ,/, the/DT Europe/NNP of/IN the/DT Lutherans/NNPS ,/, Calvinists/NNPS and/CC Quakers/NNPS ,/, wishes/VBZ to/TO inflict/VB its/PRP$ moral/JJ order/NN on/IN us/PRP ./.

Basically/RB ,/, the/DT more/JJR we/PRP lose/VBP our/PRP$ grip/NN on/IN morals/NNS ,/, the/DT more/JJR we/PRP tighten/VBP our/PRP$ grip/NN on/IN our/PRP$ wallet/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN there/EX to/TO be/VB effective/JJ protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, more/RBR so/RB these/DT days/NNS than/IN there/EX used/VBD to/TO be/VB ./.

The/DT fraud/NN and/CC corruption/NN scandals/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN have/VBP had/VBN a/DT profoundly/RB damaging/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT confidence/NN of/IN Europe/NNP '/POS s/JJ citizens/NNS ./.

The/DT credibility/NN of/IN the/DT efforts/NNS we/PRP make/VBP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP to/TO employ/VB our/PRP$ finances/NNS properly/RB stands/VBZ and/CC falls/VBZ with/IN the/DT efforts/NNS we/PRP make/VBP to/TO deal/VB with/IN such/JJ scandals/NNS and/CC prevent/VB them/PRP from/IN arising/VBG in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB just/RB mean/VB administrative/JJ changes/NNS but/CC also/RB structural/JJ changes/NNS ;/: in/IN other/JJ words/NNS we/PRP must/MD create/VB instruments/NNS which/WDT are/VBP actually/RB capable/JJ of/IN affording/VBG protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN ./.

The/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP 2000/CD will/MD provide/VB the/DT appropriate/JJ forum/NN for/IN discussing/VBG this/DT ./.

Now/RB it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, possible/JJ to/TO take/VB the/DT view/NN that/IN criminal/JJ law/NN and/CC criminal/JJ proceedings/NNS law/NN are/VBP intrinsically/JJ matters/NNS pertaining/VBG to/TO the/DT law/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB unthinkable/JJ that/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB governed/VBN by/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN subsidiarity/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN I/PRP myself/RB am/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT advocates/NNS of/IN this/DT principle/NN and/CC one/CD of/IN those/DT who/WP oppose/VBP any/DT further/JJ extension/NN of/IN competences/NNS at/IN European/JJ level/NN ./.

When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT demands/NNS made/VBN on/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP agenda/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT call/NN for/IN there/RB to/TO be/VB clear/JJ delimitation/NN of/IN competences/NNS that/WDT should/MD take/VB centre/NN stage/NN ./.

The/DT compatibility/NN with/IN the/DT various/JJ national/JJ systems/NNS of/IN law/NN ,/, as/IN confirmed/VBD by/IN experts/NNS ,/, shows/VBZ that/IN criminal/JJ law/NN is/VBZ another/DT area/NN where/WRB Europe/NNP has/VBZ a/DT great/JJ deal/NN in/IN common/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN where/WRB the/DT significance/NN of/IN the/DT offences/NNS we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN discussing/VBG here/RB is/VBZ concerned/JJ ./.

Taking/VBG these/DT aspects/NNS into/IN account/NN ,/, I/PRP consider/VBP it/PRP appropriate/JJ that/IN we/PRP create/VBP a/DT framework/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, as/RB proposed/VBN ,/, and/CC I/PRP also/RB consider/VBP it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO the/DT further/JJ development/NN of/IN OLAF/NNP ./.

Mr/VBG President/NNP ,/, will/MD a/DT European/JJ Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP be/VB able/JJ to/TO abolish/VB football/NN fraud/NN involving/VBG EU/NNP funds/NNS ?/.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB so/RB ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN using/VBG the/DT existing/VBG tools/NNS ./.

An/DT alternative/NN to/TO the/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP could/MD be/VB Eurojust/NNP ,/, as/IN proposed/VBN at/IN the/DT last/JJ Summit/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP is/VBZ structured/JJ ,/, Eurojust/NNP should/MD correspond/VB to/TO Europol/NNP and/CC support/VB investigations/NNS into/IN crimes/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB such/JJ practical/JJ cooperation/NN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN ./.

OLAF/NNP ,/, Europol/NNP and/CC the/DT Treaty/NNP on/IN Extradition/NNP and/CC Mutual/NNP Assistance/NNP in/IN Criminal/JJ Matters/NNS should/MD be/VB used/VBN fully/RB and/CC ,/, when/WRB the/DT Fraud/NNP Convention/NNP from/IN 1995/CD is/VBZ at/IN long/RB last/RB ratified/VBN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, we/PRP can/MD also/RB achieve/VB a/DT lot/NN with/IN this/DT ./.

I/PRP nonetheless/RB agree/VBP with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB unacceptable/JJ that/IN most/JJS Member/JJ States/NNPS should/MD still/RB not/RB have/VB ratified/VBN this/DT Agreement/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB too/RB bad/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP can/MD well/RB understand/VB why/WRB people/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG impatient/JJ and/CC demanding/VBG that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT common/JJ European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/'' s/VBZ Office/NNP instead/RB ./.

However/RB ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB quite/RB a/DT mammoth/JJ task/NN to/TO establish/VB such/PDT an/DT Office/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, only/RB the/DT most/RBS serious/JJ crimes/NNS which/WDT would/MD have/VB consequences/NNS under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN ./.

Ninety/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN cases/NNS would/MD be/VB disciplinary/JJ matters/NNS concerning/VBG negligence/NN or/CC incompetence/NN ./.

Instead/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN proper/JJ internal/JJ control/NN and/CC the/DT ability/NN to/TO sack/NN people/NNS more/RBR easily/RB ./.

We/PRP should/MD alter/VB the/DT staff/NN regulations/NNS and/CC disciplinary/JJ procedures/NNS and/CC ,/, especially/RB ,/, change/VB our/PRP$ practice/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, Article/NNP 52/CD of/IN the/DT staff/NN regulations/NNS concerning/VBG dismissal/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN gross/JJ negligence/NN is/VBZ never/RB used/VBN ./.

Should/MD we/PRP not/RB make/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN cleaning/VBG up/RP our/PRP$ own/JJ act/NN and/CC putting/VBG our/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN before/IN we/PRP plunge/VBP into/IN constructing/VBG grand/JJ new/JJ institutions/NNS !/. ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP all/DT want/VBP to/TO do/VB something/NN about/IN combating/VBG European/JJ fraud/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT question/NN is/VBZ now/RB :/: is/VBZ the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP doing/VBG anything/NN about/IN it/PRP as/RB well/RB ?/.

The/DT answer/NN to/TO this/DT is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP know/VBP very/RB little/JJ about/IN this/DT ./.

The/DT Tampere/NNP Summit/NNP was/VBD about/IN combating/VBG crime/NN ./.

Everyone/NN was/VBD supposedly/RB pleased/JJ about/IN it/PRP but/CC ,/, in/IN reality/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP made/VBN little/JJ progress/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT European/NNP anti-fraud/JJ legislation/NN in/IN force/NN because/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, as/IN was/VBD stated/VBN before/RB ,/, have/VBP not/RB ratified/VBN the/DT treaty/NN texts/NNS submitted/VBN ./.

So/IN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB done/VBN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

And/CC what/WP exactly/RB should/MD be/VB done/VBN ?/.

Two/CD things/NNS ,/, and/CC Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN clearly/RB spells/VBZ these/DT out/RP ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT same/JJ penalty/NN clauses/NNS regarding/VBG European/JJ fraud/NN must/MD apply/VB in/IN all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

So/RB ,/, unification/NN in/IN this/DT small/JJ area/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO be/VB afraid/JJ of/IN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN scaremongering/VBG going/VBG on/RP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, something/NN very/RB positive/JJ ./.

Just/RB like/VB Europol/NNP ./.

Europol/NNP ,/, involving/VBG police/NN cooperation/NN ,/, does/VBZ not/RB rank/VB above/IN the/DT national/JJ police/NN forces/NNS ,/, but/CC is/VBZ there/RB for/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN exchanging/JJ information/NN between/IN police/NN forces/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB the/DT task/NN which/WDT a/DT small/JJ ,/, limited/JJ ,/, European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP '/POS s/NNP Office/NNP should/MD carry/VB out/RP ,/, not/RB just/RB at/IN the/DT criminal/JJ investigation/NN stage/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB at/IN the/DT prosecution/NN stage/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP supports/VBZ this/DT ./.

The/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Wise/NNP Men/NNPS supports/VBZ this/DT ./.

I/PRP urge/VBP the/DT Council/NNP of/IN Ministers/NNP and/CC the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP to/TO do/VB the/DT same/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN corpus/NN juris/NNS ./.

I/PRP would/MD very/RB much/RB like/VB to/TO support/VB what/WP Mrs/NNP Morgan/NNP said/VBD on/IN this/DT issue/NN ./.

Corpus/NNP juris/NNS is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT was/VBD set/VBN up/RP without/IN any/DT kind/NN of/IN public/JJ debate/NN or/CC public/JJ participation/NN ./.

The/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP on/IN the/DT continental/JJ inquisitorial/JJ model/NN with/IN overriding/VBG jurisdiction/NN throughout/IN EU/NNP territories/NNS would/MD have/VB a/DT major/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT traditional/JJ systems/NNS both/DT in/IN Ireland/NNP and/CC the/DT UK/NNP ./.

The/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ criminal/JJ code/NN and/CC the/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP is/VBZ something/NN which/WDT Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP a/DT right/NN to/TO be/VB informed/VBN about/IN ./.

Indeed/RB when/WRB the/DT plan/NN was/VBD initially/RB drawn/VBN up/RP they/PRP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB restricted/VBN to/TO cases/NNS of/IN fraud/NN against/IN the/DT EU/NNP budget/NN ./.

We/PRP need/VBP a/DT public/JJ debate/NN on/IN this/DT ./.

We/PRP need/VBP the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT citizens/NNS in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO be/VB properly/RB informed/VBN ./.

The/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT threat/NN to/TO the/DT traditional/JJ legal/JJ system/NN in/IN Ireland/NNP and/CC the/DT UK/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN ./.

There/EX needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB much/RB more/RBR openness/JJ and/CC transparency/JJ on/IN this/DT issue/NN than/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO date/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unacceptable/JJ that/IN something/NN like/IN this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN foisted/VBN on/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS of/IN the/DT EU/NNP without/IN any/DT proper/JJ public/JJ debate/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Italian/JJ Radical/CD Members/NNS ,/, I/PRP abstained/VBD on/IN this/DT text/NN in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ,/, because/IN I/PRP share/VBP the/DT concerns/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN voiced/VBN ,/, in/IN such/PDT an/DT authoritative/JJ way/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT representative/NN of/IN another/DT legal/JJ culture/NN which/WDT is/VBZ certainly/RB important/JJ :/: common/JJ law/NN ./.

With/IN this/DT text/NN we/PRP are/VBP undoubtedly/RB forcing/VBG the/DT issue/NN ,/, since/IN we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP points/NNS that/WDT must/MD be/VB resolved/VBN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN Community/NNP fraud/NN to/TO be/VB curbed/VBN ,/, to/TO be/VB crushed/VBN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT our/PRP$ committee/NN intends/VBZ to/TO see/VB this/DT text/NN through/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT drive/NN and/CC stubborn/JJ desire/NN of/IN its/PRP$ Chair/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP ,/, will/MD not/RB be/VB without/IN its/PRP$ critics/NNS ./.

Another/DT major/JJ criticism/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN concerns/VBZ secondary/JJ law/NN ./.

Article/NNP 280/CD of/IN the/DT Treaty/NNP allows/VBZ the/DT Council/NNP to/TO pinpoint/VB the/DT appropriate/JJ instruments/NNS to/TO curb/VB fraud/NN ./.

We/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO express/VB our/PRP$ perplexity/NN as/IN regards/VBZ these/DT points/NNS by/IN abstaining/VBG in/IN committee/NN ./.

We/PRP find/VBP ourselves/PRP dealing/VBG with/IN some/DT very/RB serious/JJ events/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN the/DT past/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT norm/NN ./.

I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN we/PRP must/MD clearly/RB safeguard/VB the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ interests/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ image/NN and/CC its/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN taxpayers/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP an/DT indispensable/JJ and/CC essential/JJ part/NN of/IN Community/NNP life/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN safeguarding/VBG common/JJ interests/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO establish/VB better/JJR links/NNS with/IN legal/JJ systems/NNS within/IN the/DT individual/JJ States/NNPS ./.

In/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP faced/VBN with/IN the/DT most/RBS sensitive/JJ issue/NN :/: what/WDT role/NN would/MD a/DT European/JJ Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP play/VB in/IN relations/NNS with/IN the/DT individual/JJ national/JJ communities/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ domestic/JJ legal/JJ systems/NNS ?/.

This/DT issue/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB explored/VBN further/RBR in/IN both/DT cultural/JJ and/CC practical/JJ terms/NNS ./.

Today/NN ,/, we/PRP run/VBP the/DT risk/NN of/IN adding/VBG a/DT new/JJ institution/NN to/TO the/DT already/RB numerous/VBN and/CC varied/VBN institutions/NNS which/WDT exist/VBP within/IN each/DT country/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP would/MD very/RB much/RB just/RB like/VB to/TO add/VB to/TO two/CD particular/JJ points/NNS ./.

Sometimes/RB it/PRP is/VBZ worthy/JJ of/IN satire/NN and/CC merits/NNS discussion/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP digress/VBZ ./.

The/DT point/NN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO make/VB relates/VBZ to/TO Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN as/IN far/RB as/RB the/DT judicial/JJ difficulties/NNS are/VBP concerned/VBN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP facing/VBG here/RB -/: and/CC the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP evidently/RB has/VBZ only/RB very/RB limited/VBN room/NN for/IN manoeuvre/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO making/VBG these/DT offences/JJ litigable/NN as/IN European/JJ criminal/JJ offences/NNS -/: we/PRP have/VBP become/VBN embroiled/VBN in/IN legalities/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO Recommendations/NNP 1/CD and/CC 2/CD ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT longer/JJR mention/NN of/IN a/DT European/NNP Public/NNP Prosecutor/NNP ,/, rather/RB ,/, for/IN legal/JJ reasons/NNS it/PRP has/VBZ now/RB become/VBN an/DT independent/JJ ,/, European/JJ authority/NN ,/, or/CC ``/`` body/NN ''/'' to/TO quote/VB Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP ./.

We/PRP obviously/RB have/VBP difficulties/NNS there/RB with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ worth/JJ a/DT compliment/NN although/IN I/PRP regret/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, that/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB expound/VB it/PRP in/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ mother/NN tongue/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT report/NN which/WDT came/VBD about/RP with/IN difficulty/NN and/CC may/MD well/RB be/VB too/RB late/JJ ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ mainly/RB down/IN to/TO the/DT wrangling/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD major/JJ groups/NNS within/IN our/PRP$ Committee/NN on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP ./.

Let/VB us/PRP be/VB honest/JJ ./.

The/DT second/JJ report/NN of/IN the/DT Wise/NNP Men/NNPS arrived/VBD in/IN September/NNP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP now/RB four/CD months/NNS down/RB the/DT line/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN inundated/VBN with/IN amendments/NNS ,/, more/JJR than/IN 100/CD amendments/NNS in/IN the/DT first/JJ round/NN ./.

He/PRP went/VBD back/RP to/TO work/VB ,/, rewrote/VBD his/PRP$ report/NN and/CC took/VBD into/IN account/NN the/DT very/RB many/JJ suggestions/NNS ,/, but/CC had/VBD to/TO face/VB nearly/RB another/DT 100/CD amendments/NNS in/IN the/DT second/JJ round/NN ./.

My/PRP$ fear/NN is/VBZ that/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT has/VBZ contributed/VBN to/TO a/DT report/NN which/WDT is/VBZ too/RB detailed/JJ ,/, too/RB extensive/JJ and/CC too/RB late/JJ ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN informed/VBN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ approved/VBN a/DT report/NN -/: today/NN of/IN all/DT days/NNS -/: on/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP which/WDT will/MD be/VB distributed/VBN for/IN further/JJ consultation/NN to/TO the/DT various/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC also/RB to/TO our/PRP$ Parliament/NNP ,/, I/PRP hope/VBP ./.

Might/NNP Mr/NNP Kinnock/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO throw/VB some/DT light/NN on/IN the/DT matter/NN this/DT evening/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ,/, my/PRP$ Group/NNP of/IN the/DT Greens/NNS and/CC regionalists/NNS will/MD support/VB the/DT attempts/NNS in/IN tomorrow/NN afternoon/NN '/'' s/VBZ plenary/RB meeting/VBG to/TO embellish/VB this/DT report/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ no/DT sense/NN to/TO copy/VB the/DT many/JJ sound/JJ recommendations/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Wise/NNP Men/NNPS word/NN for/IN word/NN in/IN your/PRP$ report/NN ./.

So/RB tomorrow/NN ,/, if/IN we/PRP vote/VB against/IN some/DT amendments/NNS or/CC against/IN specific/JJ paragraphs/NNS ,/, this/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB on/IN account/NN of/IN their/PRP$ content/NN but/CC rather/RB to/TO render/NN your/PRP$ report/NN as/IN a/DT whole/JJ more/JJR readable/NN ./.

In/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB clear/JJ that/IN my/PRP$ group/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, fully/RB backs/VBZ the/DT recommendations/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Wise/NNP Men/NNPS ./.

In/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT document/NN which/WDT was/VBD approved/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP today/NN ./.

I/PRP also/RB look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP which/WDT will/MD be/VB available/JJ in/IN February/NNP ./.

I/PRP have/VBP to/TO inform/VB you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, that/IN both/PDT the/DT report/NN of/IN the/DT Wise/NNP Men/NNPS and/CC that/DT of/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP will/MD become/VB gauges/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ group/NN ,/, gauges/VBZ which/WDT should/MD make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ to/TO us/PRP whether/IN we/PRP can/MD have/VB confidence/NN in/IN the/DT Prodi/NNP Commission/NNP or/CC not/RB ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO end/VB on/IN the/DT following/JJ point/NN ./.

Just/RB as/IN the/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN food/NN safety/NN was/VBD approved/VBN last/JJ week/NN and/CC released/VBN to/TO public/JJ opinion/NN with/IN a/DT clear/JJ deadline/NN stated/VBN ,/, we/PRP would/MD request/VB the/DT same/JJ in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT new/JJ White/NNP Paper/NNP on/IN the/DT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN this/DT ,/, as/IN public/JJ opinion/NN is/VBZ looking/VBG for/IN change/NN and/CC ,/, in/IN any/DT event/NN ,/, my/PRP$ group/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT clear/JJ change/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2002/CD ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT report/NN is/VBZ positive/JJ but/CC ,/, actually/RB ,/, we/PRP need/VBP more/RBR than/IN this/DT ./.

Fraud/NNP ,/, mismanagement/NN and/CC nepotism/NN do/VBP not/RB come/VB from/IN nowhere/RB ./.

They/PRP are/VBP most/RBS likely/JJ to/TO occur/VB if/IN there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ democratic/JJ control/NN on/IN cash/NN flow/NN ./.

Via/IN the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS ,/, a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ budget/NN is/VBZ being/VBG pumped/VBN around/IN the/DT system/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ only/RB useful/JJ as/RB long/RB as/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT sense/NN of/IN solidarity/NN where/WRB rich/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS contribute/VBP to/TO both/CC the/DT revenue/NN and/CC development/NN of/IN poorer/NNP Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

But/CC there/EX is/VBZ also/RB funding/VBG which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG pumped/VBN via/IN Brussels/NNP back/RB to/TO the/DT same/JJ rich/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Districts/NNS and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS consider/VBP this/DT as/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ money/NN but/CC they/PRP can/MD only/RB get/VB their/PRP$ hands/NNS on/IN this/DT by/IN investing/VBG vast/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN money/NN and/CC manpower/NN in/IN lobbying/VBG and/CC negotiating/VBG ./.

After/IN each/DT incident/NN of/IN improper/JJ use/NN of/IN this/DT money/NN ,/, and/CC certainly/RB after/IN fraud/NN ,/, the/DT call/NN for/IN stricter/JJR control/NN is/VBZ more/RBR pronounced/JJ ./.

Even/RB the/DT strictest/JJ control/NN can/MD not/RB solve/VB this/DT problem/NN ./.

It/PRP will/MD ,/, at/IN best/JJS ,/, lead/VB to/TO more/JJR bureaucracy/NN and/CC less/JJR room/NN for/IN local/JJ democracy/NN and/CC for/IN people/NNS to/TO get/VB involved/VBN in/IN choosing/VBG and/CC developing/VBG projects/NNS ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB preferable/JJ if/IN national/JJ governments/NNS channelled/VBD this/DT money/NN directly/RB to/TO their/PRP$ local/JJ governments/NNS without/IN a/DT European/JJ detour/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT next/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO think/VB about/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN replacing/VBG structural/JJ funds/NNS by/IN an/DT equalisation/NN fund/NN which/WDT is/VBZ limited/VBN to/TO budgetary/JJ aid/NN for/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS or/CC their/PRP$ constituent/JJ regions/NNS with/IN a/DT low/JJ income/NN per/IN capita/NN of/IN the/DT population/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO achieve/VB less/JJR fraud/NN ,/, less/JJR overheads/NNS ,/, more/JJR transparency/NN and/CC more/JJR democracy/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, a/DT year/NN has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB passed/VBN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ already/RB clear/JJ that/IN Parliament/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT first/JJ and/CC second/JJ reports/NNS differently/RB ./.

Trade/NNP union/NN representatives/NNS sit/VBP on/IN the/DT Disciplinary/NNP Board/NNP and/CC the/DT Staff/NNP Regulations/NNPS Committee/NNP ,/, thereby/RB making/VBG it/PRP impossible/JJ to/TO remove/VB disloyal/JJ officials/NNS and/CC preserving/VBG the/DT Staff/NNP Regulations/NNPS in/IN their/PRP$ fossilised/JJ state/NN ./.

Incomprehensibly/RB ,/, trade/NN union/NN representatives/NNS are/VBP also/RB members/NNS of/IN committees/NNS on/IN competition/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB surprised/JJ if/IN union/NN members/NNS were/VBD already/RB members/NNS of/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, thereby/RB placing/VBG this/DT institution/NN which/WDT should/MD ,/, at/IN least/JJS formally/RB ,/, guarantee/VB its/PRP$ impartiality/NN ,/, at/IN great/JJ risk/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB understand/VBP why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP meeting/VBG at/IN this/DT time/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ usually/RB set/VBN aside/RP for/IN other/JJ activities/NNS and/CC not/RB for/IN debates/NNS ,/, discussions/NNS and/CC the/DT exchange/NN of/IN information/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO putting/VBG its/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP is/VBZ in/IN a/DT Catch-22/NN situation/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ enormous/JJ pressure/NN of/IN expectation/NN following/VBG the/DT events/NNS that/WDT led/VBN to/TO the/DT resignation/NN of/IN the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP ./.

I/PRP sometimes/RB have/VBP the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT more/RBR radical/JJ the/DT proposals/NNS made/VBD here/RB in/IN this/DT Chamber/NNP sound/NN ,/, the/DT more/RBR applause/JJ they/PRP receive/VBP ./.

There/EX again/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB possible/JJ to/TO change/VB situations/NNS once/RB and/CC for/IN all/DT with/IN a/DT few/JJ strokes/NNS of/IN the/DT pen/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT problems/NNS begin/VBP as/RB soon/RB as/IN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO start/VB talking/VBG about/IN implementation/NN and/CC getting/VBG down/RP to/TO brass/NN tacks/NNS ./.

This/DT may/MD explain/VB why/WRB we/PRP experienced/VBD more/JJR difficulties/NNS than/IN anticipated/JJ in/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP as/IN regards/VBZ this/DT issue/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT outcome/NN is/VBZ now/RB on/IN the/DT table/NN and/CC there/RB for/IN all/DT to/TO see/VB ,/, and/CC I/PRP would/MD expressly/RB like/VB to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP for/IN the/DT work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN on/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

Provided/IN this/DT report/NN is/VBZ not/RB watered-down/JJ yet/RB again/RB by/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN amendments/NNS ,/, it/PRP will/MD afford/VB us/PRP the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO make/VB clear/JJ and/CC unambiguous/JJ demands/NNS of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN crucial/JJ points/NNS ./.

Allow/VB me/PRP to/TO start/VB with/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ demand/NN ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB financial/JJ control/NN to/TO be/VB abolished/VBN ./.

The/DT financial/JJ controller/NN should/MD still/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO make/VB checks/NNS before/IN funding/NN commitments/NNS or/CC payments/NNS are/VBP made/VBN ,/, not/RB in/IN every/DT case/NN ,/, but/CC wherever/WRB uncertainties/NNS or/CC risks/NNS arise/VBP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ sending/VBG out/IN the/DT wrong/JJ signals/NNS here/RB ,/, by/IN renaming/VBG the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Financial/NNP Control/NNP as/IN the/DT Directorate-General/NN for/IN Audits/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.

It/PRP may/MD well/RB be/VB easy/JJ enough/RB to/TO change/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ organisation/NN chart/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT different/JJ matter/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO the/DT legal/JJ texts/NNS ,/, particularly/RB those/DT relating/VBG to/TO budgetary/JJ discipline/NN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB exact/JJ figures/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ budgetary/JJ discipline/NN and/CC the/DT associated/VBN implementing/JJ provisions/NNS apply/VBP to/TO almost/RB 100/CD different/JJ areas/NNS of/IN responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ controller/NN ,/, to/TO his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ independence/NN and/CC the/DT tasks/NNS assigned/VBN to/TO this/DT office/NN ./.

This/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB ignored/VBN or/CC evaded/VBN ,/, certainly/RB not/RB on/IN account/NN of/IN soft/JJ law/NN ,/, as/IN was/VBD once/RB suggested/VBN at/IN a/DT meeting/NN of/IN our/PRP$ Committee/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN that/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN makes/VBZ the/DT connection/NN between/IN all/DT three/CD areas/NNS and/CC also/RB makes/VBZ it/PRP clear/JJ as/IN to/TO where/WRB the/DT crucial/JJ shortcomings/NNS lie/VBP ,/, which/WDT must/MD be/VB tackled/VBN ./.

A/DT few/JJ salient/NN points/NNS :/: the/DT disciplinary/JJ procedures/NNS are/VBP not/RB taking/VBG effect/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO calling/VBG officials/NNS to/TO account/VB for/IN their/PRP$ misdemeanours/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT of/IN a/DT financial/JJ nature/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ grey/JJ area/NN and/CC a/DT great/JJ lack/NN of/IN clarity/NN where/WRB criminal/JJ sanctions/NNS are/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB in/IN this/DT area/NN that/IN the/DT announcements/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP are/VBP rather/RB vague/JJ ./.

I/PRP can/MD only/RB emphasise/VB that/IN these/DT are/VBP the/DT really/RB hard/JJ nuts/NNS that/WDT finally/RB need/VBP to/TO be/VB cracked/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, firstly/RB I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO extend/VB my/PRP$ heartfelt/JJ congratulations/NNS to/TO my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ feeling/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ from/IN our/PRP$ delegation/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, entitled/VBN to/TO feel/VB a/DT little/RB proud/JJ of/IN him/PRP ./.

I/PRP would/MD in/IN any/DT case/NN like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB him/PRP on/IN his/PRP$ report/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ resignation/NN has/VBZ also/RB created/VBN a/DT culture/NN of/IN fear/NN amongst/IN many/JJ officials/NNS within/IN the/DT hierarchy/NN and/CC large/JJ bureaucracy/NN ./.

The/DT call/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT cultural/JJ U-turn/NN and/CC embrace/VB a/DT culture/NN of/IN responsibility/NN seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP a/DT very/RB fundamental/JJ one/NN ./.

A/DT lack/NN of/IN responsibility/NN ,/, too/RB much/RB ex/FW ante/FW ,/, not/RB enough/RB ex/RBR post/JJ and/CC ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, far/RB too/RB little/JJ in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN a/DT culture/NN of/IN real/JJ effective/JJ spending/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB marvellous/JJ if/IN this/DT report/NN were/VBD to/TO give/VB the/DT green/JJ light/NN to/TO result-oriented/JJ spending/NN of/IN this/DT kind/NN ,/, with/IN all/PDT the/DT work/NN organised/VBN on/IN that/DT basis/NN ./.

When/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ first/JJ draft/NN report/NN soon/RB becomes/VBZ the/DT official/JJ report/NN on/IN 1/CD March/NNP ,/, I/PRP very/RB much/RB hope/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ input/NN here/RB will/MD help/VB ensure/VB that/IN we/PRP will/MD actually/RB witness/VB this/DT change/NN ./.

Without/IN any/DT doubt/NN ,/, this/DT will/MD then/RB be/VB a/DT service/NN ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, to/TO the/DT European/JJ public/NN and/CC ,/, by/IN means/NNS of/IN the/DT results/NNS we/PRP produce/VBP ,/, we/PRP will/MD also/RB regain/VB and/CC re-acquire/VB something/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBP ostensibly/RB lost/VBN over/IN the/DT past/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS support/NN we/PRP can/MD give/VB to/TO European/JJ democracy/NN ./.

If/IN ,/, in/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD move/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT culture/NN of/IN the/DT fifties/NNS and/CC cross/VB over/RP into/IN the/DT next/JJ century/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP witnessing/VBG a/DT very/RB special/JJ moment/NN indeed/RB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, first/JJ of/IN all/DT ,/, congratulations/VBZ to/TO Michiel/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ report/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD a/DT baptism/NN of/IN fire/NN but/CC we/PRP have/VBP a/DT saying/NN in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS appropriate/JJ for/IN this/DT occasion/NN :/: in/RB at/IN the/DT deep/JJ end/NN and/CC you/PRP will/MD swim/VB in/IN no/DT time/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP two/CD points/NNS which/WDT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, deserve/VBP special/JJ attention/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT ELDR/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT Commissioners/NNPS '/POS individual/JJ responsibility/NN ./.

This/DT must/MD be/VB regulated/VBN during/IN the/DT IGC/NNP ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, as/IN already/RB mentioned/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ colleague/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Mulder/NNP ,/, the/DT ELDR/NN is/VBZ of/IN the/DT opinion/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP should/MD also/RB be/VB investigated/VBN by/IN independent/JJ experts/NNS ./.

This/DT will/MD contribute/VB hugely/RB towards/IN re-establishing/VBG the/DT confidence/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ citizens/NNS in/IN this/DT institution/NN ./.

We/PRP at/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT credible/JJ counterpart/NN to/TO this/DT reformed/NNP Commission/NNP as/RB long/RB as/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB search/VB our/PRP$ hearts/NNS and/CC put/VB our/PRP$ own/JJ House/NN in/IN order/NN as/RB well/RB ./.

Only/RB when/WRB all/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS are/VBP reformed/VBN will/NN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT open/JJ ,/, democratic/JJ and/CC decisive/JJ Europe/NNP which/WDT our/PRP$ citizens/NNS now/RB finally/RB deserve/VBP ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP also/RB wish/VBP to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP on/IN this/DT first/JJ piece/NN of/IN work/NN which/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ presenting/VBG to/TO the/DT House/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD serve/VB ,/, amongst/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, to/TO make/VB his/PRP$ second/JJ report/NN more/RBR flexible/JJ and/CC for/IN him/PRP to/TO step/VB up/RP efforts/NNS to/TO find/VB a/DT consensus/NN amongst/IN the/DT groups/NNS ./.

At/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, there/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT delay/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN reforming/VBG the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, demanded/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP has/VBZ often/RB heard/VBN the/DT desire/NN to/TO reform/VB the/DT Commission/NNP expressed/VBN ,/, even/RB by/IN its/PRP$ Presidents/NNS ./.

It/PRP now/RB appears/VBZ that/IN this/DT desire/NN is/VBZ more/RBR serious/JJ ./.

After/IN the/DT resignation/NN of/IN a/DT Commission/NNP and/CC after/IN a/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Experts/NNS has/VBZ listed/VBN an/DT almost/RB endless/JJ number/NN of/IN deficiencies/NNS ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ sense/NN that/IN Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP should/MD have/VB promised/VBN ,/, on/IN 14/CD September/NNP ,/, to/TO present/VB this/DT Parliament/NNP with/IN a/DT complete/JJ plan/NN for/IN reform/NN by/IN February/NNP ./.

This/DT Parliament/NNP anxiously/RB awaits/VBZ this/DT complete/JJ reform/NN programme/NN ./.

The/DT report/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP debating/VBG today/NN intends/VBZ to/TO give/VB political/JJ force/NN to/TO many/JJ of/IN the/DT recommendations/NNS of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP of/IN Experts/NNS commissioned/VBN by/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD act/VB anyway/RB ,/, that/IN he/PRP preferred/VBD to/TO get/VB things/NNS right/RB ,/, but/CC that/IN fear/NN of/IN not/RB getting/VBG things/NNS right/RB would/MD not/RB prevent/VB him/PRP from/IN acting/VBG ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB ask/VBP that/IN his/PRP$ programme/NN be/VB a/DT bold/JJ one/NN and/CC ,/, if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP can/MD assure/VB him/PRP that/IN he/PRP will/MD have/VB the/DT support/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP in/IN the/DT reform/NN process/NN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT strong/JJ Commission/NN ,/, which/WDT can/MD act/VB in/IN an/DT independent/JJ and/CC neutral/JJ manner/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN political/JJ sense/NN ./.

Commissioners/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB considered/VBN senior/JJ officials/NNS but/CC rather/RB politicians/NNS in/IN office/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT report/NN allows/VBZ them/PRP to/TO be/VB members/NNS of/IN political/JJ parties/NNS and/CC to/TO be/VB members/NNS of/IN political/JJ bodies/NNS affiliated/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ parties/NNS ./.

Perhaps/RB the/DT reference/NN to/TO the/DT posts/NNS is/VBZ imprecise/JJ ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB your/PRP$ exact/JJ view/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ clear/JJ that/IN we/PRP want/VBP Commissioners/NNP who/WP are/VBP politically/RB strong/JJ and/CC politically/RB committed/VBN ./.

We/PRP want/VBP a/DT structure/NN which/WDT allows/VBZ every/DT Euro/NNP to/TO be/VB spent/VBN effectively/RB ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ accounts/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB happening/VBG at/IN present/JJ ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, we/PRP ask/VBP Mr/NNP Prodi/NNP to/TO present/VB us/PRP with/IN a/DT bold/JJ programme/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP will/MD find/VB that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ problems/NNS with/IN those/DT bodies/NNS who/WP feel/VBP that/IN their/PRP$ status/NN quo/NN is/VBZ under/IN threat/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB with/IN this/DT Parliament/NNP ,/, which/WDT expects/VBZ profound/JJ and/CC daring/JJ changes/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT Santer/NNP Commission/NNP came/VBD to/TO grief/VB because/IN financial/JJ control/NN failed/VBD all/DT down/IN the/DT line/NN ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT future/NN of/IN this/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP will/MD depend/VB in/IN no/DT small/JJ measure/NN on/IN the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT reforms/NNS are/VBP swiftly/RB undertaken/VBN here/RB and/CC financial/JJ control/NN is/VBZ back/RB in/IN working/VBG order/NN ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ only/JJ to/TO be/VB welcomed/VBN ./.

What/WP I/PRP do/VBP not/RB understand/VB is/VBZ why/WRB this/DT has/VBZ to/TO come/VB at/IN a/DT price/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, of/IN having/VBG to/TO dispense/VB with/IN independent/JJ -/: and/CC I/PRP stress/JJ ,/, independent/JJ -/: prior/JJ approval/NN ./.

Up/IN until/IN now/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ payments/NNS could/MD only/RB be/VB made/VBN when/WRB the/DT authorising/VBG officer/NN signed/VBD the/DT appropriate/JJ order/NN and/CC the/DT financial/JJ controller/NN gave/VBD his/PRP$ approval/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT visa/NN ./.

And/CC so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT ``/`` two/CD key/NN ''/'' principle/NN that/WDT applies/VBZ here/RB ./.

A/DT single/JJ key/NN is/VBZ to/TO suffice/VB in/IN future/NN ./.

The/DT financial/JJ controller/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB to/TO make/VB advance/NN checks/NNS ,/, if/IN all/DT goes/VBZ to/TO plan/VB as/IN regards/VBZ the/DT reforms/NNS currently/RB under/IN discussion/NN within/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

If/IN you/PRP will/MD pardon/VB me/PRP for/IN saying/VBG so/RB ,/, Mr/NNP Kinnock/NNP ,/, what/WP you/PRP are/VBP proposing/VBG is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ like/IN abolishing/VBG the/DT police/NN because/IN they/PRP were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO prevent/VB crimes/NNS ./.

What/WP we/PRP really/RB need/VBP to/TO focus/VB on/RP ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ making/VBG the/DT checks/NNS more/RBR effective/JJ ./.

This/DT could/MD be/VB achieved/VBN by/IN no/RB longer/RB insisting/VBG ,/, in/IN future/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT financial/JJ controllers/NNS furnish/VB every/DT single/JJ payment/NN transaction/NN with/IN their/PRP$ approval/NN stamp/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB those/DT who/WP feel/VBP the/DT need/NN to/TO control/VB everything/NN that/WDT end/VBP up/RP controlling/VBG nothing/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, in/IN future/NN ,/, prior/JJ approval/NN should/MD take/VB place/NN in/IN a/DT targeted/JJ manner/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, only/RB in/IN cases/NNS of/IN uncertainty/NN or/CC risk/NN ./.

The/DT officials/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN financial/JJ control/NN should/MD be/VB deployed/VBN on/IN a/DT decentralised/JJ basis/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, in/IN the/DT operational/JJ Directorates-General/NN ,/, amongst/IN those/DT of/IN their/PRP$ colleagues/NNS that/WDT spend/VBP the/DT money/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP immediately/RB available/JJ when/WRB problems/NNS arise/VBP and/CC so/RB as/RB to/TO render/VB the/DT checks/NNS less/RBR ponderous/JJ and/CC time-consuming/JJ ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT financial/JJ controllers/NNS must/MD work/VB independently/RB ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT crucial/JJ difference/NN between/IN our/PRP$ plans/NNS and/CC those/DT of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ,/, when/WRB it/PRP talks/VBZ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN decentralisation/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ obviously/RB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/VBN intention/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT financial/JJ control/NN officials/NNS subordinate/JJ to/TO the/DT individual/JJ Directorates-General/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB what/WP we/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB ./.

Surely/RB we/PRP have/VBP learnt/VBN this/DT much/RB from/IN the/DT events/NNS surrounding/VBG the/DT Leonardo/NNP affair/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT internal/JJ examiners/NNS in/IN the/DT relevant/JJ Directorate-General/NN issued/VBD warnings/NNS ,/, but/CC these/DT were/VBD neither/CC heeded/JJ nor/CC passed/VBN on/RP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, independence/NN is/VBZ prerequisite/JJ for/IN effective/JJ checks/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ the/DT position/NN which/WDT a/DT clear/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Budgetary/NNP Control/NNP subscribes/VBZ to/TO ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ Commission/NNP has/VBZ now/RB declared/VBN itself/PRP in/IN favour/NN of/IN follow-up/NN checks/NNS having/VBG this/DT independence/NN ,/, and/CC so/IN would/MD it/PRP not/RB make/VB sense/NN for/IN a/DT system/NN of/IN prior/JJ approval/NN to/TO enjoy/VB such/JJ independence/NN as/RB well/RB ?/.

I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP should/MD set/VB the/DT seal/NN on/IN this/DT point/NN at/IN tomorrow/NN '/POS s/JJ vote/NN ./.

Mrs/NNP Theato/NNP has/VBZ already/RB expressed/VBN as/IN much/RB and/CC I/PRP am/VBP only/RB too/RB willing/JJ to/TO support/VB her/PRP in/IN this/DT regard/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, a/DT couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ago/IN ,/, the/DT previous/JJ Commission/NNP tried/VBD once/RB and/CC for/IN all/DT to/TO tackle/VB rigid/JJ and/CC obsolescent/NN structures/NNS ./.

This/DT led/VBD to/TO strikes/NNS and/CC smear/NN campaigns/NNS by/IN intransigent/JJ trade/NN unions/NNS ,/, whereupon/VB the/DT proposals/NNS were/VBD abandoned/VBN and/CC replaced/VBN by/IN a/DT wishy-washy/JJ compromise/NN ./.

This/DT was/VBD stupid/JJ of/IN the/DT old/JJ Commission/NNP ,/, and/CC Parliament/NNP was/VBD of/IN no/DT help/NN on/IN that/DT occasion/NN ./.

When/WRB I/PRP read/VBP Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP '/POS s/JJ passage/NN about/IN personnel/JJ policy/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP afraid/JJ that/IN Parliament/NNP may/MD again/RB be/VB failing/VBG to/TO tackle/VB the/DT crucial/JJ issues/NNS and/CC just/RB spouting/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN hot/JJ air/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP too/RB many/JJ rights/NNS ,/, too/RB many/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC too/RB little/JJ room/NN for/IN leadership/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT backbone/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT teeth/NNS ./.

Where/WRB is/VBZ the/DT beef/NN ?/.

And/CC I/PRP would/MD also/RB say/VB this/DT to/TO you/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP :/: please/UH ,/, deliver/VB the/DT beef/NN even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ British/JJ ./.

Romano/NNP Prodi/NNP promised/VBD a/DT revolution/NN ./.

You/PRP have/VBP said/VBD some/DT powerful/JJ and/CC worthwhile/JJ things/NNS yourself/PRP ,/, but/CC take/VB care/NN now/RB that/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB dodge/VBP the/DT crucial/JJ issues/NNS ,/, the/DT ones/NNS where/WRB it/PRP hurts/VBZ !/. ./.

Sort/VB out/RP the/DT tangle/NN of/IN staff/NN allowances/NNS ./.

Stand/VB firm/NN on/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN mobility/NN ,/, not/RB as/IN a/DT right/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP says/VBZ here/RB in/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT management/NN tool/NN ./.

Ensure/VB too/RB ,/, that/DT training/NN becomes/VBZ a/DT management/NN tool/NN ./.

Do/VBP not/RB listen/VB to/TO the/DT report/NN '/POS s/JJ demands/NNS that/IN temporary/JJ staff/NN should/MD have/VB their/PRP$ employment/NN confirmed/VBD ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT posts/NNS which/WDT should/MD possibly/RB be/VB made/VBN permanent/JJ and/CC not/RB necessarily/RB those/DT employed/VBN on/IN a/DT temporary/JJ basis/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT Bureau/NNP until/IN six/CD months/NNS ago/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD urge/VB you/PRP to/TO address/VB this/DT issue/NN in/IN the/DT Bureau/NNP so/RB that/IN we/PRP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP at/IN least/JJS comply/VB ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ administration/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT demands/NNS we/PRP are/VBP making/VBG on/IN others/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP not/RB done/VBN this/DT so/RB far/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT is/VBZ something/NN you/PRP ought/MD to/TO be/VB instrumental/JJ in/IN changing/VBG ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP want/VBP to/TO thank/VB Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ report/NN and/CC to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP voted/VBD for/IN it/PRP ./.

So/IN I/PRP refer/VBP to/TO the/DT things/NNS I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB agree/VB with/IN the/DT paragraphs/NNS in/IN relation/NN to/TO Parliament/NNP ./.

This/DT report/NN is/VBZ about/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ a/DT separate/JJ subject/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN for/IN us/PRP to/TO bring/VB Parliament/NNP into/IN the/DT discussion/NN on/IN the/DT Commission/NNP ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO that/DT ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT question/NN of/IN duty-free/JJ ./.

That/DT was/VBD a/DT stick/NN used/VBN to/TO beat/VB the/DT Commission/NNP by/IN the/DT duty-free/JJ lobbies/NNS who/WP resented/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP abolished/VBD duty-free/JJ in/IN airports/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB worthy/JJ of/IN being/VBG brought/VBN into/IN this/DT report/NN either/RB ./.

I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN previous/JJ speakers/NNS who/WP have/VBP said/VBD that/IN the/DT polluter/NN should/MD pay/VB ,/, and/CC this/DT proposal/NN expresses/VBZ that/DT idea/NN very/RB well/RB ./.

Producers/NNS must/MD pay/VB -/: although/IN we/PRP all/DT know/VBP that/IN the/DT consumer/NN will/MD ultimately/RB suffer/VB the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN this/DT -/: and/CC they/PRP must/MD take/VB responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT costs/NNS before/IN 2006/CD ,/, as/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS propose/VBP ./.

We/PRP are/VBP more/RBR in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT amendment/NN proposed/VBN at/IN first/JJ reading/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ to/TO set/VB percentages/NNS and/CC a/DT date/NN for/IN vehicles/NNS to/TO be/VB composed/VBN of/IN recyclable/JJ materials/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT proposal/NN relies/VBZ on/IN very/RB long/JJ deadlines/NNS ./.

Lastly/RB ,/, Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP should/MD favour/VB the/DT creation/NN of/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ businesses/NNS which/WDT ,/, if/IN subject/JJ to/TO rigorous/JJ approval/NN and/CC duly/RB authorised/JJ ,/, can/MD promote/VB the/DT creation/NN of/IN jobs/NNS in/IN this/DT very/RB important/JJ area/NN ,/, preventing/VBG the/DT emergence/NN of/IN monopolies/NNS by/IN large/JJ companies/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, today/NN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP must/MD face/VB up/RP to/TO real/JJ responsibilities/NNS ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO work/VB out/RP what/WP we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT millions/NNS of/IN vehicles/NNS we/PRP abandon/VBP each/DT year/NN ./.

In/IN some/DT of/IN our/PRP$ Member/JJ States/NNPS ,/, voluntary/JJ environmental/JJ agreements/NNS have/VBP already/RB been/VBN signed/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN our/PRP$ ditches/NN ,/, canals/NNS and/CC fields/NNS are/VBP not/RB filled/VBN with/IN these/DT ugly/JJ and/CC dangerous/JJ wrecks/NNS ,/, inhabited/VBN occasionally/RB by/IN an/DT alarmed/JJ farmyard/JJ chicken/NN ./.

I/PRP come/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, from/IN a/DT country/NN that/WDT is/VBZ proud/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ car/NN industry/NN and/CC of/IN its/PRP$ commercial/JJ success/NN both/DT in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC in/IN third/JJ countries/NNS ./.

I/PRP can/MD gauge/VB its/PRP$ importance/NN for/IN my/PRP$ country/NN '/POS s/JJ international/JJ reputation/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP of/IN the/DT proactive/JJ attitude/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ car/NN manufacturing/NN industry/NN which/WDT has/VBZ set/VBN up/RP an/DT extensive/JJ research/NN programme/NN to/TO outline/VB a/DT national/JJ information/NN system/NN for/IN dismantling/VBG end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

I/PRP am/VBP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS the/DT Council/NNP experienced/VBD in/IN finding/VBG a/DT compromise/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB ,/, today/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD be/VB understanding/VBG alchemists/NNS ,/, concerned/VBN for/IN our/PRP$ environment/NN ./.

This/DT will/MD either/RB be/VB the/DT century/NN of/IN waste/NN management/NN or/CC it/PRP will/MD not/RB ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, the/DT principle/NN of/IN `/`` polluter/NN pays/NNS '/'' must/MD be/VB applied/VBN ./.

The/DT car/NN industry/NN ,/, increasingly/RB more/RBR respectful/JJ of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, has/VBZ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ ,/, anticipated/VBN this/DT kind/NN of/IN increasing/VBG awareness/NN ./.

Indeed/RB it/PRP is/VBZ accepting/VBG its/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, however/RB ,/, who/WP will/MD have/VB to/TO implement/VB this/DT directive/NN ,/, and/CC let/VB us/PRP beware/VB of/IN going/VBG into/IN too/RB much/JJ detail/NN because/IN the/DT industrial/JJ traditions/NNS ,/, the/DT demolition/NN and/CC crushing/VBG sectors/NNS vary/VBP according/VBG to/TO whether/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN Italy/NNP or/CC in/IN Finland/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP opposed/VBN to/TO making/VBG the/DT car/NN owners/NNS liable/JJ ./.

The/DT men/NNS and/CC women/NNS on/IN the/DT move/NN throughout/IN Europe/NNP pay/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ car/NN and/CC their/PRP$ catalytic/JJ converter/NN ,/, pay/VBP their/PRP$ national/JJ taxes/NNS and/CC the/DT tax/NN on/IN fuel/NN and/CC are/VBP therefore/RB already/RB paying/VBG a/DT high/JJ price/NN for/IN their/PRP$ magnificent/JJ machine/NN and/CC their/PRP$ freedom/NN of/IN movement/NN ./.

It/PRP would/MD certainly/RB be/VB unwise/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ Members/NNS in/IN the/DT major/JJ groups/NNS of/IN the/DT federalist/JJ tendency/NN to/TO seek/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP unpopular/JJ in/IN this/DT way/NN by/IN creating/VBG a/DT liability/NN shared/VBN between/IN the/DT owner/NN and/CC the/DT manufacturer/NN ./.

How/WRB ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, can/MD a/DT fund/NN be/VB created/VBN which/WDT will/MD pay/VB for/IN vehicle/NN recycling/NN and/CC manage/VB operations/NNS within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Who/WP is/VBZ to/TO pay/VB for/IN recycling/VBG the/DT car/NN I/PRP bought/VBD in/IN France/NNP if/IN I/PRP register/VBP it/PRP in/IN Belgium/NNP ?/.

Which/WDT national/JJ fund/NN will/MD pay/VB for/IN my/PRP$ end-of-life/JJ vehicle/NN ?/.

Let/VB us/PRP beware/VB ,/, too/RB ,/, of/IN worrying/VBG the/DT world/NN of/IN business/NN with/IN the/DT legal/JJ uncertainty/NN of/IN an/DT unacceptable/JJ retroactive/JJ application/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB our/PRP$ intention/NN to/TO start/VB a/DT punitive/JJ legislative/JJ campaign/NN here/RB today/NN ,/, but/CC to/TO continue/VB on/IN our/PRP$ present/JJ course/NN ,/, advocating/VBG sustainable/JJ development/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, spearheaded/VBN by/IN environment/NN committees/NNS ,/, does/VBZ its/PRP$ very/RB best/RB to/TO make/VB a/DT critical/JJ assessment/NN of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS submitted/VBN by/IN the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP or/CC the/DT Council/NNP ,/, so/RB as/RB to/TO improve/VB on/IN them/PRP from/IN an/DT environmental/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, a/DT sound/JJ common/JJ position/NN submitted/VBN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP is/VBZ in/IN danger/NN of/IN being/VBG changed/VBN for/IN the/DT worse/JJR from/IN an/DT environmental/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

Every/DT year/NN ,/, we/PRP discard/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN cars/NNS which/WDT contain/VBP many/JJ dangerous/JJ substances/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO prevent/VB waste/NN materials/NNS ./.

We/PRP should/MD also/RB aim/VB for/IN minimum/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN heavy/JJ metals/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN of/IN other/JJ dangerous/JJ substances/NNS and/CC materials/NNS ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, car/NN manufacturers/NNS need/VBP to/TO produce/VB and/CC build/VB these/DT cars/NNS in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN as/RB to/TO facilitate/VB simple/JJ dismantling/NN and/CC re-use/NN ./.

What/WP is/VBZ left/VBN of/IN the/DT stripped/JJ vehicle/NN also/RB requires/VBZ to/TO be/VB processed/VBN adequately/RB ./.

These/DT days/NNS ,/, the/DT complete/JJ dismantling/VBG of/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS is/VBZ economically/RB viable/JJ ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP move/VBP away/RP from/IN shredding/VBG ./.

The/DT prescribed/JJ objectives/NNS are/VBP most/RBS certainly/RB viable/JJ and/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ,/, a/DT value/NN of/IN 86/CD %/NN recycling/VBG has/VBZ now/RB already/RB been/VBN achieved/VBN ./.

The/DT best/JJS way/NN of/IN achieving/VBG proper/JJ collection/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT last/JJ holder/NN and/or/NN owner/NN can/MD deliver/VB the/DT car/NN to/TO an/DT authorised/JJ treatment/NN facility/NN without/IN any/DT cost/NN ./.

The/DT processing/NN cost/NN can/MD then/RB be/VB incorporated/VBN in/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN new/JJ cars/NNS ./.

The/DT proposals/NNS made/VBD by/IN a/DT few/JJ MEPs/NNP impact/NN greatly/RB on/IN this/DT system/NN ./.

The/DT so-called/JJ shared/VBN liability/NN is/VBZ very/RB cumbersome/JJ and/CC does/VBZ not/RB stimulate/VB innovation/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN delivering/VBG cars/NNS to/TO treatment/NN facilities/NNS without/IN any/DT cost/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN ,/, it/PRP will/MD also/RB transpire/VB that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN processing/NN will/MD come/VB down/RP considerably/RB ./.

Finally/RB ,/, this/DT directive/NN should/MD enter/VB into/IN force/NN at/IN the/DT earliest/JJS opportunity/NN ./.

A/DT laborious/NNS conciliation/NN procedure/NN would/MD entail/VB an/DT unnecessary/JJ delay/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.

Why/WRB can/MD not/RB we/PRP just/RB be/VB satisfied/VBN with/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN currently/RB tabled/VBN ?/.

If/IN we/PRP are/VBP ,/, then/RB all/DT that/WDT remains/VBZ for/IN us/PRP to/TO do/VB is/VBZ to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT Council/NN on/IN the/DT result/NN achieved/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP hold/VBP Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP in/IN high/JJ esteem/NN ./.

He/PRP has/VBZ delivered/VBN excellent/JJ work/NN under/IN pressure/NN both/DT from/IN his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS and/CC from/IN the/DT car/NN industry/NN ./.

Add/VB to/TO this/DT the/DT fact/NN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD to/TO do/VB this/DT from/IN his/PRP$ green/JJ approach/NN and/CC ,/, against/IN that/DT background/NN ,/, find/VB a/DT compromise/NN ./.

That/DT was/VBD not/RB easy/JJ ./.

Overall/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB dissatisfied/VBN with/IN the/DT present/JJ common/JJ position/NN and/CC certainly/RB not/RB with/IN the/DT philosophy/NN underlying/VBG that/DT common/JJ position/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO comment/VB on/IN two/CD things/NNS ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, vintage/JJ cars/NNS and/CC motorbikes/NNS ./.

These/DT should/MD indeed/RB be/VB excluded/VBN from/IN the/DT directive/NN ./.

Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT controversial/JJ question/VBP as/RB to/TO who/WP bears/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN for/IN taking/VBG back/RP cars/NNS ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO alter/VB the/DT text/NN of/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN in/IN any/DT way/NN ./.

The/DT manufacturer/NN is/VBZ and/CC should/MD be/VB liable/JJ and/CC the/DT last/JJ holder/NN and/or/NN owner/NN must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO hand/VB back/RP the/DT car/NN without/IN any/DT cost/NN ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ too/RB much/RB initial/JJ hesitation/NN ./.

The/DT car/NN lobby/NN has/VBZ led/VBN too/RB many/JJ people/NNS up/IN the/DT garden/NN path/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO mention/VB that/IN experience/NN has/VBZ nonetheless/RB taught/VBN us/PRP that/IN the/DT processing/NN cost/NN is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN passed/VBN on/RP ./.

These/DT costs/NNS are/VBP not/RB very/RB high/JJ ./.

In/IN the/DT Member/NNP State/NNP where/WRB I/PRP come/VBP from/IN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/RB 150/CD Guilders/NNS per/IN car/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP charge/VBP this/DT from/IN day/NN one/CD ,/, you/PRP can/MD process/VB the/DT old/JJ cars/NNS straight/RB away/RB ./.

A/DT very/RB large/JJ industry/NN might/MD then/RB emerge/VB which/WDT would/MD ensure/VB that/IN scrapyards/NNS ,/, which/WDT used/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT common/JJ feature/NN in/IN our/PRP$ Member/JJ States/NNPS ,/, would/MD then/RB disappear/VB ./.

I/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO make/VB any/DT changes/NNS to/TO this/DT particular/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT compromise/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN if/IN we/PRP were/VBD to/TO approve/VB the/DT present/JJ legislation/NN together/RB as/RB soon/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ positive/JJ because/IN ,/, in/IN that/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT nine/CD million/CD cars/NNS which/WDT are/VBP introduced/VBN each/DT year/NN onto/IN European/JJ roads/NNS will/MD actually/RB be/VB processed/VBN appropriately/RB ,/, and/CC this/DT will/MD benefit/VB us/PRP all/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT present/JJ directive/NN is/VBZ important/JJ in/IN so/RB far/RB as/IN it/PRP helps/VBZ prevent/VB our/PRP$ being/VBG faced/VBN with/IN hazardous/JJ waste/NN from/IN end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS and/CC in/IN so/RB far/RB as/IN it/PRP promotes/VBZ the/DT re-use/NN and/CC recycling/NN of/IN materials/NNS from/IN scrapped/JJ cars/NNS ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ crucial/JJ for/IN the/DT environment/NN that/IN the/DT ban/NN on/IN using/VBG poisonous/JJ heavy/JJ metals/NNS should/MD be/VB fully/RB implemented/VBN and/CC that/IN we/PRP should/MD not/RB reduce/VB manufacturers/NNS '/POS liability/NN ./.

If/IN we/PRP do/VBP reduce/VB it/PRP ,/, we/PRP remove/VB from/IN manufacturers/NNS the/DT incentive/NN to/TO design/VB and/CC produce/VB cars/NNS which/WDT give/VBP rise/NN to/TO less/JJR waste/NN ./.

If/IN these/DT amendments/NNS are/VBP adopted/VBN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN we/PRP shall/MD cause/VB Parliament/NNP seriously/RB to/TO lose/VB credibility/NN on/IN environmental/JJ issues/NNS ./.

So/IN far/RB ,/, we/PRP here/RB in/IN Parliament/NNP have/VBP been/VBN positive/JJ catalysts/NNS for/IN environmental/JJ protection/NN but/CC now/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT amendments/NNS proposed/VBD by/IN Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Lange/NNP are/VBP adopted/VBN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP to/TO become/VB a/DT negative/JJ factor/NN for/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

What/WP is/VBZ more/JJR ,/, if/IN we/PRP reduce/VB manufacturers/NNS '/POS liability/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, this/DT will/MD also/RB have/VB serious/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN subsequent/JJ matters/NNS in/IN other/JJ areas/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN the/DT forthcoming/JJ directive/NN on/IN scrap/NN from/IN computers/NNS and/CC other/JJ electronic/JJ equipment/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD therefore/RB recommend/VB to/TO Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP that/IN we/PRP cut/VBD across/IN party/NN lines/NNS and/CC vote/VB against/IN all/PDT the/DT amendments/NNS to/TO the/DT common/JJ position/NN which/WDT would/MD weaken/VB environmental/JJ standards/NNS and/CC reduce/VB manufacturers/NNS '/POS liability/NN ./.

We/PRP shall/MD then/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB an/DT environmentally/RB respectable/JJ result/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, this/DT excellent/JJ directive/NN will/MD end/VB the/DT dumping/NN of/IN old/JJ cars/NNS ,/, encourage/VB recycling/NN ,/, and/CC above/IN all/DT encourage/VB manufacturers/NNS to/TO design/VB cars/NNS which/WDT can/MD easily/RB be/VB recycled/VBN ./.

Now/RB who/WP should/MD pay/VB the/DT costs/NNS ?/.

Whatever/WDT system/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN ,/, ultimately/RB the/DT cost/NN will/MD be/VB passed/VBN on/IN to/TO the/DT consumer/NN ./.

The/DT best/JJS way/NN of/IN achieving/VBG our/PRP$ environmental/JJ objectives/NNS is/VBZ to/TO make/VB the/DT manufacturers/NNS our/PRP$ instrument/NN both/DT for/IN collecting/VBG the/DT money/NN and/CC for/IN disposing/VBG and/CC recycling/VBG of/IN the/DT cars/NNS ./.

The/DT manufacturers/NNS have/VBP tricked/VBN Mr/NNP Florenz/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Lange/NNP into/IN tabling/VBG amendments/NNS here/RB which/WDT seriously/RB weaken/VBP these/DT proposals/NNS ./.

Do/VB not/RB be/VB fooled/VBN by/IN the/DT car/NN manufacturers/NNS !/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP want/VBP the/DT full/JJ benefits/NNS of/IN this/DT directive/NN use/VBP your/PRP$ vote/NN to/TO throw/VB out/RP these/DT amendments/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, this/DT debate/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT technical/JJ debate/NN ,/, contrary/JJ to/TO what/WP we/PRP may/MD think/VB ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN eminently/RB political/JJ ./.

Yesterday/NN we/PRP honoured/VBD our/PRP$ institution/NN with/IN a/DT political/JJ debate/NN ./.

Today/NN ,/, if/IN 314/JJ Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP yield/VB to/TO the/DT strength/NN of/IN the/DT lobbying/NN of/IN some/DT car/NN manufacturers/NNS ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB doing/VBG ourselves/PRP dishonour/JJ ./.

We/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB this/DT ./.

It/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT precedent/NN which/WDT would/MD open/VB the/DT door/NN to/TO all/DT sorts/NNS of/IN pressure/NN in/IN many/JJ other/JJ areas/NNS ./.

It/PRP would/MD also/RB be/VB the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP would/MD be/VB weakening/VBG a/DT Council/NNP position/NN ,/, whereas/IN usually/RB we/PRP are/VBP complaining/VBG that/IN their/PRP$ position/NN is/VBZ not/RB strong/JJ enough/RB ./.

The/DT free/JJ recovery/NN system/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, for/IN old/JJ vehicles/NNS and/CC raising/VBG the/DT percentage/NN to/TO be/VB recycled/VBN will/MD increase/VB recycling/VBG activities/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN jobs/NNS this/DT generates/VBZ accordingly/RB ./.

Thus/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT consumer/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT new/JJ jobs/NNS to/TO be/VB created/VBN in/IN recycling/NN ,/, the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ position/NN definitely/RB must/MD not/RB be/VB amended/VBN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, as/IN it/PRP stands/VBZ ,/, perfectly/RB acceptable/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, like/IN so/RB many/JJ others/NNS here/RB today/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ measure/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT useful/JJ measure/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD which/WDT we/PRP all/DT need/VBP ./.

Most/JJS of/IN the/DT technical/JJ issues/NNS have/VBP been/VBN resolved/VBN ./.

There/EX are/VBP some/DT details/NNS to/TO be/VB finalised/VBN but/CC most/JJS of/IN the/DT technical/JJ issues/NNS have/VBP been/VBN resolved/VBN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP arrived/VBN at/IN the/DT final/JJ question/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT first/JJ reading/NN debate/NN it/PRP was/VBD only/RB the/DT Economic/NNP and/CC Monetary/NNP Affairs/NNPS Committee/NNP which/WDT asked/VBD this/DT question/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD only/RB myself/PRP as/IN the/DT draftsman/NN of/IN the/DT opinion/NN of/IN that/DT committee/NN who/WP posed/VBD that/DT question/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP ./.

That/DT is/VBZ quite/RB simply/RB :/: Who/WP pays/VBZ ?/.

The/DT Council/NNP common/JJ position/NN reached/VBD a/DT reasonable/JJ compromise/NN in/IN that/WDT the/DT manufacturers/NNS should/MD pay/VB a/DT significant/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN ,/, not/RB all/DT of/IN it/PRP as/IN Mr/NNP Bowis/NNPS has/VBZ mistakenly/RB said/VBN ./.

In/IN fact/NN perhaps/RB as/IN little/RB ,/, the/DT lawyers/NNS tell/VBP us/PRP ,/, as/IN 20/CD %/NN or/CC one-fifth/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB unreasonable/JJ ./.

They/PRP have/VBP paid/VBN already/RB ./.

Why/WRB should/MD the/DT very/RB same/JJ people/NNS as/IN taxpayers/NNS or/CC as/IN future/JJ car/NN buyers/NNS ,/, pay/VB again/RB to/TO dispose/VB of/IN the/DT vehicle/NN that/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN has/VBZ made/VBN the/DT profit/NN from/IN ?/.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB that/DT ./.

There/EX are/VBP amendments/NNS here/RB today/NN that/IN are/VBP proposing/VBG that/IN should/MD be/VB the/DT case/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB it/PRP and/CC I/PRP will/MD not/RB vote/VB for/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT responsibility/NN for/IN these/DT cars/NNS lies/VBZ with/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT manufacturer/NN who/WP has/VBZ to/TO provide/VB the/DT infrastructure/NN and/CC provide/VB a/DT reasonable/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN disposal/NN ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN does/VBZ not/RB preclude/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN contributions/NNS being/VBG made/VBN by/IN government/NN ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ a/DT reasonable/JJ compromise/NN ./.

Some/DT of/IN the/DT amendments/NNS today/NN are/VBP totally/RB unreasonable/JJ in/IN that/IN they/PRP take/VBP away/RB completely/RB the/DT responsibility/NN from/IN the/DT car/NN manufacturer/NN of/IN paying/VBG a/DT little/RB if/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN disposal/NN of/IN cars/NNS on/IN the/DT road/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD not/RB accept/VB that/DT and/CC on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT taxpayers/NNS and/CC the/DT consumers/NNS of/IN Europe/NNP I/PRP am/VBP voting/VBG against/IN those/DT amendments/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ agreement/NN that/IN we/PRP must/MD give/VB some/DT thought/NN as/RB to/TO how/WRB we/PRP in/IN Europe/NNP will/MD properly/RB deal/VB with/IN end-of-life/JJ cars/NNS ,/, although/IN in/IN this/DT instance/NN the/DT Council/NNP has/VBZ not/RB provided/VBN a/DT model/NN for/IN a/DT suitable/JJ European/JJ environment/NN policy/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ disgraceful/JJ the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT German/NNP Presidency/NNP handled/VBD this/DT matter/NN ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, Herr/NNP Trittin/NNP ,/, the/DT Environment/NNP Minister/NNP ,/, was/VBD not/RB in/IN tune/NN with/IN his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT Cabinet/NNP ,/, then/RB Chancellor/NNP Schr脙/NNP 露/NNP der/NNP blundered/VBD in/IN like/IN a/DT bull/NN in/IN a/DT china/NN shop/NN ,/, having/VBG no/DT expert/NN knowledge/NN of/IN this/DT process/NN ./.

Mind/VBN you/PRP ,/, even/RB the/DT Resolution/NNP of/IN the/DT Finnish/JJ Council/NNP Presidency/NNP in/IN June/NNP was/VBD not/RB the/DT best/JJS result/NN that/WDT could/MD have/VB been/VBN done/VBN achieved/VBN ./.

There/EX are/VBP certain/JJ weaknesses/NNS ,/, the/DT greatest/JJS of/IN which/WDT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN not/RB enough/JJ consideration/NN is/VBZ being/VBG given/VBN to/TO the/DT situation/NN of/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS ;/: after/IN all/DT ,/, the/DT car/NN industry/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN just/RB large/JJ companies/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN supply/NN that/IN small/JJ business/NN plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN and/CC we/PRP must/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO also/RB take/VB account/NN of/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN those/DT employed/VBN in/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS ./.

For/IN there/EX are/VBP considerably/RB more/JJR than/IN two/CD million/CD people/NNS employed/VBN in/IN this/DT sector/NN ./.

The/DT plight/NN of/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS is/VBZ also/RB addressed/VBN by/IN numerous/JJ amendments/NNS from/IN the/DT Committee/NNP on/IN the/DT Environment/NN ,/, Public/NNP Health/NNP and/CC Consumer/NNP Policy/NNP and/CC also/RB the/DT amendments/NNS in/IN question/NN from/IN our/PRP$ group/NN to/TO Article/NNP 5/CD concerning/VBG costs/NNS ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ also/RB no/DT great/JJ shakes/NN from/IN an/DT environmental/JJ viewpoint/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP must/MD support/VB an/DT amendment/NN which/WDT at/IN least/JJS permits/VBZ exceptions/NNS in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN particularly/RB economical/JJ cars/NNS ./.

The/DT objections/NNS of/IN the/DT industry/NN in/IN this/DT matter/NN are/VBP certainly/RB not/RB without/IN foundation/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT arguments/NNS of/IN the/DT plastics/NNS and/CC car/NN industries/NNS would/MD be/VB more/RBR persuasive/JJ if/IN a/DT commitment/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO reducing/VBG CO2/CD levels/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP in/IN other/JJ sectors/NNS besides/IN these/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP indeed/RB now/RB in/IN a/DT very/RB rare/JJ situation/NN :/: those/DT who/WP wish/VBP to/TO uphold/VB environmental/JJ values/NNS will/MD take/VB the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT Council/NNP in/IN their/PRP$ common/JJ position/NN ./.

In/IN contrast/NN to/TO what/WP the/DT previous/JJ speaker/NN said/VBD ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB I/PRP am/VBP really/RB proud/JJ that/IN a/DT common/JJ position/NN was/VBD achieved/VBN during/IN the/DT Finnish/JJ Presidency/NNP to/TO uphold/VB environmental/JJ values/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PRP slide/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT common/JJ position/NN and/CC try/VB to/TO divide/VB the/DT recycling/VBG costs/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB creating/VBG a/DT loophole/NN :/: we/PRP will/MD not/RB have/VB created/VBN a/DT rational/JJ ,/, clear/JJ system/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT division/NN of/IN responsibilities/NNS is/VBZ in/IN order/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, the/DT manufacturer/NN must/MD take/VB the/DT greatest/JJS share/NN of/IN the/DT responsibility/NN ./.

Only/RB then/RB will/MD we/PRP find/VB an/DT adequate/JJ solution/NN to/TO the/DT problem/NN ,/, taking/VBG into/IN consideration/NN the/DT fact/NN too/RB that/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN should/MD be/VB encouraged/VBD to/TO make/VB vehicles/NNS whose/WP$ parts/NNS can/MD be/VB recycled/VBN at/IN the/DT smallest/JJS possible/JJ cost/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP two/CD issues/NNS of/IN principle/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ draft/NN directive/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ concerns/VBZ the/DT manufacturer/NN '/POS s/JJ unrestricted/JJ liability/NN to/TO take/VB back/RP end-of-life/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ the/DT risk/NN of/IN creating/VBG a/DT monopoly/NN within/IN the/DT car/NN dismantling/VBG trade/NN ./.

This/DT particularly/RB applies/VBZ in/IN areas/NNS within/IN the/DT EU/NNP where/WRB distances/NNS are/VBP great/JJ and/CC where/WRB a/DT lot/NN of/IN small/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN dismantling/VBG vehicles/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, quite/RB apart/RB from/IN the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN concerned/VBN ,/, the/DT EU/NNP '/POS s/JJ directives/NNS should/MD not/RB treat/VB small/JJ companies/NNS within/IN the/DT Union/NNP unfairly/RB ./.

Unrestricted/JJ liability/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN manufacturers/NNS would/MD also/RB be/VB in/IN danger/NN of/IN creating/VBG a/DT situation/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT market/NN for/IN used/JJ car/NN parts/NNS disappears/VBZ ,/, for/IN manufacturers/NNS would/MD have/VB a/DT greater/JJR responsibility/NN to/TO sell/VB new/JJ parts/NNS ./.

Yet/CC the/DT trade/NN in/IN used/JJ car/NN parts/NNS is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, especially/RB for/IN those/DT who/WP collect/VB and/CC renovate/VB older/JJR vehicles/NNS ./.

The/DT principle/NN of/IN unrestricted/JJ liability/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN manufacturers/NNS is/VBZ also/RB dubious/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT principles/NNS governing/VBG the/DT market/NN economy/NN ./.

It/PRP should/MD be/VB possible/JJ for/IN changes/NNS to/TO be/VB made/VBN to/TO companies/NNS and/CC for/IN the/DT latter/NN to/TO be/VB sold/VBN and/CC wound/VB up/RP ./.

They/PRP should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO establish/VB themselves/PRP in/IN new/JJ markets/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO leave/VB old/JJ markets/NNS ./.

To/TO bind/NN manufacturers/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN a/DT liability/NN which/WDT can/MD extend/VB very/RB far/RB back/RB in/IN time/NN ill/JJ accords/NNS with/IN a/DT flexible/JJ market/NN economy/NN designed/VBD to/TO promote/VB development/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ principle/NN in/IN the/DT Council/NNP '/POS s/JJ common/JJ position/NN is/VBZ the/DT retroactive/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT draft/NN directive/NN ./.

It/PRP conflicts/VBD with/IN established/JJ economic/JJ and/CC legal/JJ principles/NNS retroactively/RB to/TO impose/VB upon/IN a/DT manufacturer/NN financial/JJ liability/NN for/IN its/PRP$ product/NN ./.

To/TO do/VB so/RB also/RB changes/VBZ the/DT owner/NN '/POS s/JJ liability/NN retroactively/RB ./.

Over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, a/DT consumer/NN may/MD have/VB altered/VBN the/DT product/NN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN ways/NNS ./.

Every/DT country/NN within/IN the/DT EU/NNP now/RB has/VBZ rules/NNS governing/VBG the/DT scrapping/NN of/IN cars/NNS ./.

Some/DT may/MD be/VB better/JJR than/IN others/NNS ,/, and/CC some/DT worse/JJR ./.

In/IN anticipation/NN of/IN this/DT EU/JJ directive/NN '/'' s/VBZ being/VBG implemented/VBN ,/, EU/NNP countries/NNS ought/MD however/RB to/TO be/VB individually/RB liable/JJ for/IN scrapping/VBG vehicles/NNS in/IN the/DT best/JJS way/NN possible/JJ so/RB that/IN the/DT retroactive/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT EU/NNP legislation/NN is/VBZ not/RB applied/VBN ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB conflict/NN with/IN a/DT financing/NN model/NN involving/VBG the/DT building/NN up/RP of/IN funds/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, everyone/NN agrees/VBZ with/IN the/DT obvious/JJ environmental/JJ and/CC industrial/JJ importance/NN of/IN the/DT instrument/NN in/IN question/NN ./.

The/DT common/JJ position/NN offers/VBZ an/DT acceptable/JJ compromise/NN but/CC its/PRP$ rather/RB delicate/JJ and/CC precarious/JJ nature/NN somewhat/RB restricts/VBZ the/DT opportunities/NNS for/IN improvement/NN ,/, and/CC puts/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ directive/NN at/IN risk/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB maintain/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP can/MD not/RB force/VB the/DT issue/NN and/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB paradoxical/JJ for/IN it/PRP to/TO do/VB so/RB in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN redefining/VBG the/DT environmental/JJ scope/NN of/IN the/DT instrument/NN ./.

Cross-border/JJ workers/NNS ,/, employees/NNS on/IN secondment/NN and/CC migrating/NN employees/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN job-seekers/NNS ,/, students/NNS on/IN placement/NN and/CC other/JJ students/NNS ,/, experience/VBP hindrances/NNS in/IN exercising/VBG the/DT right/NN of/IN free/JJ movement/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO a/DT lack/NN of/IN coordination/NN and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN convergence/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT same/JJ phenomenon/NN occurs/VBZ in/IN tax/NN law/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO combat/VB distortion/NN of/IN competition/NN and/CC prevent/VB dumping/VBG ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, developed/VBD a/DT well-balanced/JJ approach/NN which/WDT steers/VBZ a/DT midcourse/NN between/IN harmonisation/NN and/CC non-intervention/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, binding/JJ and/CC enforceable/JJ rules/NNS apply/VBP to/TO equal/VB pay/NN or/CC additional/JJ old-age/JJ pensions/NNS and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, programmes/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO offer/VB incentives/NNS with/IN regard/NN to/TO non-discrimination/JJ or/CC social/JJ exclusion/NN ./.

Based/VBN on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN recommendations/NNS ,/, reports/NNS and/CC communications/NNS ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ made/VBN another/DT step/NN in/IN the/DT convergence/JJ process/NN by/IN setting/VBG out/RP objectives/NNS and/CC by/IN setting/VBG up/RP a/DT working/VBG party/NN of/IN high-ranking/JJ officials/NNS ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, expansion/NN ,/, globalisation/NN ,/, a/DT sharp/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT ageing/JJ population/NN ,/, individualisation/NN and/CC changes/NNS in/IN family/NN situations/NNS render/VBP such/JJ reorganisation/NN inevitable/JJ ./.

Denying/VBG that/IN such/JJ shifts/NNS take/VBP place/NN is/VBZ tantamount/JJ to/TO surrendering/VBG social/JJ protection/NN ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO eurosceptics/NNS and/CC nationalists/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN social/JJ protection/NN within/IN the/DT boundaries/NNS of/IN a/DT Member/NNP State/NNP is/VBZ not/RB social/JJ and/CC offers/VBZ no/DT protection/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, if/IN social/JJ protection/NN were/VBD to/TO be/VB phased/VBN out/RP as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN competition/NN ,/, this/DT would/MD also/RB harm/VB social/JJ protection/NN as/IN a/DT production/NN factor/NN ./.

And/CC less/RBR social/JJ protection/NN means/VBZ less/JJR purchasing/NN power/NN ,/, fewer/JJR healthy/JJ employees/NNS and/CC fewer/JJR happy/JJ employees/NNS ./.

In/IN respect/NN of/IN the/DT super-Europeans/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN European/JJ social/JJ protection/NN is/VBZ neither/DT attainable/JJ nor/CC desirable/JJ ./.

The/DT discrepancies/NNS between/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP too/RB immense/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN provisions/NNS ,/, rightful/JJ claimants/NNS ,/, revenue/NN or/CC benefits/NNS ,/, etc./NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ thus/RB impossible/JJ to/TO bring/VB all/DT States/NNPS into/IN line/NN ./.

The/DT path/NN which/WDT the/DT Commission/NNP is/VBZ walking/VBG is/VBZ ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, obvious/JJ ./.

It/PRP has/VBZ the/DT advantage/NN of/IN clarity/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP can/MD collect/VB data/NNS and/CC exchange/NN experiences/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO agree/VB on/IN objectives/NNS and/CC finely/RB tune/VBP solid/JJ ,/, comparative/JJ indicators/NNS and/CC put/VB forward/RP recommendations/NNS ./.

I/PRP endorse/VBP this/DT view/NN ./.

I/PRP will/MD give/VB my/PRP$ support/NN to/TO the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Lisbon/NNP will/MD take/VB us/PRP a/DT step/NN forward/RB in/IN this/DT matter/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN contains/VBZ a/DT lot/NN that/WDT is/VBZ of/IN interest/NN ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, what/WP is/VBZ most/RBS interesting/JJ is/VBZ that/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, which/WDT purports/VBZ to/TO be/VB concerned/VBN with/IN a/DT combined/VBN strategy/NN for/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ policy/NN ,/, instead/RB proposes/VBZ an/DT extension/NN of/IN traditional/JJ social/JJ policy/NN and/CC more/JJR supranationalism/NN in/IN the/DT social/JJ sphere/NN ./.

Social/NNP policy/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB renewed/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO reduce/VB unemployment/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

Even/RB though/IN the/DT socialists/NNS ,/, now/RB that/IN there/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ social/JJ democratic/JJ governments/NNS ,/, talk/VBP much/RB less/JJR about/IN unemployment/NN than/IN they/PRP used/VBD to/TO ,/, the/DT unemployment/NN in/IN question/NN is/VBZ still/RB high/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT in/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT trade/NN boom/NN ./.

Something/NN must/MD be/VB done/VBN so/RB that/IN unemployment/NN does/VBZ not/RB turn/VB the/DT so-called/JJ European/JJ model/NN into/IN a/DT parody/NN ./.

Social/NNP policy/NN must/MD facilitate/VB employment/NN ,/, creating/VBG incentives/NNS for/IN employers/NNS and/CC employees/NNS to/TO ,/, respectively/RB ,/, provide/VB and/CC accept/VB jobs/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN demands/VBZ social/JJ convergence/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB that/IN systems/NNS should/MD be/VB increasingly/RB standardised/VBN within/IN and/CC throughout/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP also/RB wants/VBZ to/TO see/VB efficient/JJ and/CC ambitious/JJ tax/NN coordination/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB supranationalism/NN in/IN the/DT fiscal/JJ sphere/NN ./.

The/DT EU/NNP should/MD also/RB ,/, on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN a/DT uniform/JJ definition/NN of/IN poverty/NN thresholds/NNS ,/, table/VB recommendations/NNS concerning/VBG what/WP is/VBZ called/VBN the/DT minimum/JJ acceptable/JJ subsistence/NN level/NN in/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

The/DT EU/NNP should/MD devise/VB guidelines/NNS governing/VBG the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT job/NN opportunities/NNS which/WDT are/VBP to/TO be/VB created/VBN ,/, whatever/WDT that/DT may/MD mean/VB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB possible/JJ to/TO reduce/VB unemployment/NN with/IN all/PDT these/DT additional/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC forms/NNS of/IN interference/NN ./.

Those/DT structural/JJ problems/NNS which/WDT make/VBP unemployment/NN higher/RBR in/IN Europe/NNP than/IN in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS will/MD become/VB even/RB greater/JJR ./.

There/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN at/IN all/DT for/IN supranationalism/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ most/RBS especially/RB important/JJ not/RB to/TO create/VB unnecessary/JJ problems/NNS before/IN the/DT enlargement/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP thinks/VBZ that/IN the/DT less/RBR wealthy/JJ Eastern/NNP countries/NNS should/MD be/VB reminded/VBN that/IN social/JJ convergence/NN is/VBZ to/TO apply/VB to/TO them/PRP too/RB ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN these/DT countries/NNS ,/, impoverished/VBN within/IN a/DT Communist/JJ economic/JJ system/NN ,/, can/MD not/RB cope/VB with/IN a/DT social/JJ policy/NN like/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Sweden/NNP '/POS s./NN Talk/NN of/IN minimum/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC poverty/NN thresholds/NNS is/VBZ meaningless/JJ to/TO the/DT present/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC unreasonable/JJ as/RB far/RB as/RB less/RBR wealthy/JJ applicant/NNP States/NNPS are/VBP concerned/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, as/IN others/NNS have/VBP done/VBN ,/, I/PRP should/MD also/RB like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP for/IN the/DT report/NN he/PRP has/VBZ produced/VBN ./.

I/PRP also/RB welcome/VBP the/DT Commission/NNP 's/POS communication/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD slow/JJ in/IN coming/VBG but/CC well/RB worth/IN waiting/VBG for/IN ./.

It/PRP could/MD be/VB a/DT landmark/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT social/JJ Europe/NNP ,/, providing/VBG we/PRP take/VB it/PRP seriously/RB and/CC do/VBP not/RB allow/VB individual/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS to/TO baulk/VB at/IN the/DT steps/NNS that/WDT must/MD be/VB taken/VBN to/TO implement/VB it/PRP ./.

We/PRP can/MD ,/, and/CC must/MD ,/, take/VB the/DT unique/JJ European/JJ social/JJ model/NN we/PRP have/VBP and/CC reform/VB it/PRP to/TO fit/VB the/DT twenty-first/JJ century/NN ,/, a/DT century/NN which/WDT is/VBZ globalising/VBG fast/RB ./.

I/PRP am/VBP afraid/JJ the/DT proposals/NNS that/WDT are/VBP being/VBG put/VBN forward/RB by/IN Mr/NNP Herman/NNP Schmid/NNP will/MD not/RB deal/VB with/IN that/DT globalising/VBG world/NN ./.

To/TO be/VB successful/JJ we/PRP have/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN our/PRP$ economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, our/PRP$ employment/NN policy/NN and/CC our/PRP$ social/JJ protection/NN policy/NN in/IN its/PRP$ broadest/JJS sense/NN ,/, are/VBP integrated/JJ and/CC that/IN we/PRP deal/VBP with/IN them/PRP as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP to/TO ensure/VB that/IN our/PRP$ ECOFIN/NN ministers/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ employment/NN ministers/NNS acknowledge/VBP that/IN social/JJ affairs/NNS ministers/NNS have/VBP a/DT contribution/NN to/TO make/VB to/TO the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT society/NN in/IN Europe/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ creative/JJ ,/, has/VBZ initiative/NN and/CC which/WDT will/MD provide/VB a/DT high/JJ quality/NN of/IN life/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN our/PRP$ citizens/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ not/RB an/DT option/NN for/IN us/PRP any/DT more/RBR ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT imperative/NN ./.

European/JJ citizens/NNS will/MD not/RB settle/VB for/IN any/DT less/JJR than/IN a/DT quality/NN of/IN life/NN which/WDT befits/VBZ them/PRP as/IN human/JJ beings/NNS ./.

We/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB the/DT US/NNP model/NN -/: a/DT model/NN which/WDT has/VBZ spectacularly/RB failed/VBN to/TO create/VB the/DT employment/NN that/WDT is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO provide/VB a/DT decent/JJ quality/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

What/WP it/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN is/VBZ increase/VB dramatically/RB the/DT number/NN of/IN working/VBG poor/JJ in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ not/RB what/WP we/PRP want/VBP to/TO do/VB in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

We/PRP have/VBP the/DT traditions/NNS of/IN solidarity/NN in/IN Europe/NNP and/CC we/PRP have/VBP the/DT experience/NN of/IN a/DT better/JJR way/NN of/IN doing/VBG things/NNS ./.

But/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO grasp/VB the/DT tools/NNS to/TO do/VB that/DT ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB urge/VBP that/IN we/PRP not/RB only/RB implement/VB the/DT high-level/JJ group/NN as/RB proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Commission/NNP but/CC also/RB go/VB further/RBR and/CC have/VB a/DT Luxembourg-type/JJ process/NN so/RB that/IN we/PRP have/VBP an/DT integrated/VBN approach/NN to/TO this/DT issue/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT social/JJ areas/NNS to/TO which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ought/MD to/TO pay/VB much/RB more/JJR attention/NN ./.

Macroeconomic/JJ policies/NNS ,/, the/DT stability/NN pact/NN and/CC the/DT criteria/NNS for/IN nominal/JJ convergence/NN have/VBP put/VBN a/DT brake/NN on/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN which/WDT would/MD improve/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN people/NNS '/POS s/JJ lives/NNS ,/, specifically/RB by/IN means/NNS of/IN a/DT significant/JJ increase/NN in/IN pensions/NNS and/CC pension/NN schemes/NNS ,/, particularly/RB of/IN the/DT minimum/JJ pensions/NNS ,/, and/CC through/IN fighting/VBG social/JJ exclusion/NN ./.

This/DT situation/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB serious/JJ in/IN countries/NNS such/JJ as/IN Portugal/NNP where/WRB the/DT minimum/JJ pensions/NNS and/CC pension/NN schemes/NNS are/VBP barely/RB more/JJR than/IN half/PDT of/IN the/DT minimum/JJ national/JJ wage/NN which/WDT in/IN turn/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT lowest/JJS in/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT Commission/NNP does/VBZ not/RB accept/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO amend/VB its/PRP$ macroeconomic/JJ policies/NNS to/TO create/VB more/JJR jobs/NNS of/IN quality/NN ,/, with/IN employee/NN rights/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ basis/NN for/IN maintaining/VBG and/CC modernising/VBG a/DT solid/JJ ,/, public/JJ social/JJ protection/NN system/NN ,/, we/PRP harbour/VBP serious/JJ doubts/NNS as/IN to/TO its/PRP$ position/NN ./.

Although/IN the/DT Andersson/NNP report/NN has/VBZ gathered/VBN some/DT positive/JJ proposals/NNS ,/, including/VBG some/DT that/IN we/PRP put/VBD forward/RP ourselves/PRP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP still/RB critical/JJ of/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT bases/NNS for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ proposal/NN and/CC we/PRP still/RB have/VBP concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT strategy/NN for/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ previous/JJ life/NN I/PRP ran/VBD two/CD manufacturing/VBG businesses/NNS ,/, one/CD in/IN the/DT United/NNP Kingdom/NNP and/CC one/CD in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS ./.

As/IN the/DT UK/NNP business/NN grew/VBD ,/, we/PRP invested/VBD in/IN more/JJR people/NNS ,/, as/IN the/DT Dutch/JJ business/NN grew/VBD we/PRP invested/VBD in/IN more/JJR machinery/NN ./.

The/DT simple/JJ reason/NN for/IN this/DT was/VBD that/IN social/JJ costs/NNS in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNPS were/VBD just/RB too/RB high/JJ in/IN comparison/NN ./.

I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ Commission/NNP document/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO see/VB people/NNS priced/VBN out/RP of/IN jobs/NNS because/IN social/JJ protection/NN costs/NNS become/VBP unrealistically/RB high/JJ ./.

That/DT is/VBZ why/WRB in/IN committee/NN I/PRP proposed/VBD some/DT form/NN of/IN business/NN impact/NN assessment/NN ,/, so/CC that/IN costs/NNS and/CC risks/NNS to/TO jobs/NNS could/MD be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT EPP-DE/NNP Group/NNP supported/VBD this/DT amendment/NN ./.

But/CC I/PRP must/MD record/VB that/IN other/JJ groups/NNS ,/, led/VBN by/IN the/DT PSE/NNP Group/NNP ,/, guided/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ countryman/NN ,/, Stephen/NNP Hughes/NNP ,/, voted/VBD this/DT out/RP ./.

I/PRP accept/VBP that/IN Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP 's/POS report/NN is/VBZ very/RB well-intentioned/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP respect/VB him/PRP for/IN the/DT work/NN he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN ,/, but/CC in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN the/DT way/NN the/DT report/NN defines/VBZ and/CC promotes/VBZ social/JJ convergence/NN would/MD drive/VB social/JJ costs/NNS higher/RBR throughout/IN the/DT EU/NNP ./.

This/DT would/MD put/VB more/JJR jobs/NNS at/IN risk/NN and/CC also/RB put/VBN at/IN risk/NN the/DT credibility/NN of/IN this/DT House/NNP by/IN showing/VBG how/WRB remote/JJ we/PRP are/VBP from/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB urge/VBP this/DT House/NNP to/TO reject/VB the/DT full/JJ report/NN and/CC let/VB the/DT original/JJ Commission/NNP proposal/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD very/RB well-balanced/JJ ,/, stand/VBP unamended/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO vote/VB for/IN this/DT report/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD actually/RB place/VB social/JJ issues/NNS at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Social/NNP rights/NNS should/MD determine/VB economic/JJ choices/NNS ,/, and/CC not/RB the/DT other/JJ way/NN around/RB ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO social/JJ protection/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP opposed/VBN to/TO schemes/NNS copied/VBN from/IN the/DT Luxembourg/NNP process/NN which/WDT run/VBP counter/RB to/TO this/DT rationale/NN :/: broad/JJ economic/JJ guidelines/NNS ,/, then/RB convergence/JJ criteria/NNS and/CC ,/, finally/RB ,/, social/JJ issues/NNS ,/, dealt/VBD with/IN as/IN the/DT last/JJ resort/NN ./.

The/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD proclaim/VB one/CD general/JJ principle/NN ,/, to/TO wit/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT social/JJ rights/NNS acquired/VBN in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS may/MD not/RB be/VB restricted/VBN ./.

Any/DT Community/NNP intervention/NN should/MD aim/VB to/TO complement/VB and/CC to/TO harmonise/VB existing/VBG guarantees/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT highest/JJS common/JJ denominator/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO strengthen/VB the/DT funding/NN of/IN social/JJ security/NN systems/NNS ,/, we/PRP need/VBP a/DT policy/NN of/IN general/JJ wage/NN increase/NN ,/, the/DT establishment/NN of/IN a/DT minimum/JJ legal/JJ wage/NN in/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO fight/VB poverty/NN ,/, entitlement/NN to/TO an/DT income/NN and/CC to/TO employment/NN are/VBP inalienable/JJ rights/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO avoid/VB health/NN being/VBG treated/VBN in/IN any/DT way/NN as/IN a/DT commodity/NN ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP should/MD declare/VB itself/PRP clearly/RB opposed/VBN to/TO pension/NN funds/NNS and/CC to/TO a/DT situation/NN where/WRB private/JJ insurance/NN companies/NNS have/VBP access/NN to/TO the/DT health/NN system/NN ./.

I/PRP sincerely/RB hope/VBP ,/, in/IN conclusion/NN ,/, that/IN social/JJ Europe/NNP can/MD not/RB be/VB satisfied/VBN with/IN mere/JJ words/NNS and/CC pious/JJ hopes/NNS ./.

For/IN millions/NNS of/IN people/NNS the/DT situation/NN is/VBZ too/RB tragic/JJ for/IN that/DT ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, the/DT aim/NN of/IN developing/VBG a/DT coordinated/JJ strategy/NN for/IN modernising/VBG social/JJ protection/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP is/VBZ certainly/RB an/DT admirable/JJ one/NN ./.

Just/RB as/IN the/DT launching/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ convergence/NN strategy/NN on/IN employment/NN and/CC labour/NN market/NN policies/NNS at/IN the/DT Luxembourg/NNP Summit/NNP was/VBD commendable/JJ ./.

The/DT labour/NN market/NN and/CC social/JJ protection/NN are/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, two/CD sides/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ coin/NN ,/, that/WDT require/VBP harmonised/JJ policies/NNS and/CC rules/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT labour/NN market/VBP functions/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN certain/JJ levels/NNS of/IN employment/NN ,/, flexibility/NN and/CC salary/NN discipline/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ for/IN the/DT welfare/NN state/NN and/CC social/JJ protection/NN not/RB to/TO function/VB ,/, and/CC vice/RB versa/RB ./.

Until/IN recently/RB ,/, the/DT European/JJ countries/NNS fixed/VBD ,/, it/PRP could/MD be/VB said/VBN in/IN an/DT autarkic/JJ way/NN ,/, the/DT rules/NNS governing/VBG the/DT functioning/VBG and/CC financing/VBG of/IN the/DT two/CD markets/NNS ./.

Budgetary/CD and/CC exchange/NN rate/NN policies/NNS were/VBD responsible/JJ for/IN maintaining/VBG internal/JJ and/CC external/JJ stability/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT Maastricht/NNP Treaty/NNP and/CC the/DT single/JJ currency/NN ,/, budgetary/JJ discipline/NN became/VBD tighter/JJR and/CC recourse/NN to/TO devaluation/NN ceased/VBN as/IN a/DT means/NN of/IN endeavouring/VBG to/TO restore/VB marginal/JJ competitiveness/NN ./.

The/DT structural/JJ and/CC economic/JJ differences/NNS of/IN the/DT various/JJ countries/NNS can/MD not/RB ,/, therefore/RB ,/, be/VB rebalanced/VBN through/IN budget/NN deficits/NNS and/CC trade/NN ./.

And/CC therein/RB lies/VBZ the/DT paradox/NN ./.

Political/NNP and/CC monetary/JJ convergence/NN in/IN Europe/NNP unavoidably/RB entails/VBZ convergence/NN of/IN the/DT respective/JJ rules/NNS of/IN the/DT game/NN in/IN the/DT labour/NN market/NN and/CC welfare/NN systems/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT single/JJ currency/NN and/CC the/DT absence/NN of/IN labour/NN mobility/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN of/IN a/DT redistributive/JJ fiscal/JJ policy/NN ,/, force/VBP us/PRP into/IN a/DT situation/NN of/IN non-convergence/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN salaries/NNS and/CC welfare/NN ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO compensate/VB for/IN the/DT differences/NNS in/IN marginal/JJ productivity/NN at/IN national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ levels/NNS ./.

Hypocrisy/JJ and/CC fine-sounding/JJ words/NNS such/JJ as/IN convergence/NN ,/, benchmarking/NN ,/, modernisation/JJ and/CC concerted/JJ action/NN are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO extricate/VB us/PRP from/IN those/DT contradictions/NNS ./.

That/DT is/VBZ something/NN we/PRP would/MD do/VB well/RB to/TO recognise/VB ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, unlike/IN several/JJ of/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP spoken/VBN in/IN today/NN '/POS s/JJ debate/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP inclined/JJ to/TO endorse/VB the/DT Andersson/NNP report/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS for/IN this/DT being/VBG that/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB clear/JJ differences/NNS between/IN the/DT report/NN and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ communications/NNS ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP referring/VBG to/TO the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT report/NN -/: and/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN this/DT -/: defends/VBZ the/DT European/JJ social/JJ model/NN '/POS s/JJ approach/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ one/CD based/VBN on/IN solidarity/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD certainly/RB see/VB that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ its/PRP$ shortcomings/NNS in/IN failing/VBG to/TO undertake/VB a/DT sufficiently/RB rigorous/JJ analysis/NN of/IN macroeconomic/JJ policy/NN within/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ this/DT policy/NN which/WDT stands/VBZ in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN the/DT aforementioned/JJ solidarity-based/JJ revival/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ social/JJ state/NN ,/, model/NN ./.

All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, though/RB ,/, I/PRP deem/VBP this/DT report/NN to/TO be/VB worthwhile/JJ ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN the/DT floor/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO reaffirm/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN the/DT modernisation/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ much/RB more/RBR then/RB simply/RB one/CD more/JJR step/NN in/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN Europe/NNP ./.

This/DT message/NN is/VBZ contained/VBN in/IN the/DT excellent/JJ report/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP ./.

Europe/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ,/, although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB strong/JJ in/IN economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ terms/NNS ,/, will/MD remain/VB shaky/JJ ,/, weak/JJ and/CC limited/JJ ,/, perhaps/RB inadequate/JJ ,/, if/IN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO strengthen/VB it/PRP from/IN a/DT social/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT latter/NN means/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN of/IN employment/NN for/IN those/DT who/WP require/VBP it/PRP ,/, but/CC also/RB decisive/JJ action/NN in/IN support/NN of/IN the/DT socially/RB disadvantaged/JJ ./.

Bearing/VBG in/IN mind/NN that/IN everybody/NN has/VBZ the/DT right/JJ to/TO social/JJ protection/NN and/CC a/DT minimum/JJ guaranteed/JJ social/JJ income/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN we/PRP must/MD not/RB forget/VB about/IN those/DT people/NNS who/WP were/VBD not/RB born/VBN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

Let/VB us/PRP not/RB forget/VB that/IN ,/, in/IN 1999/CD ,/, 717,000/JJ people/NNS came/VBD here/RB to/TO compensate/VB for/IN our/PRP$ low/JJ birth/NN rate/NN ./.

In/IN social/JJ terms/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB absolutely/RB essential/JJ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP an/DT immigration/NN policy/NN with/IN a/DT social/JJ conscience/NN ,/, as/IN President/NNP Gutierres/NNP recently/RB stated/VBD in/IN Spain/NNP ./.

We/PRP must/MD be/VB very/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT situation/NN of/IN those/DT people/NNS whose/WP$ prospects/NNS of/IN finding/NN work/NN are/VBP threatened/VBN or/CC reduced/VBN by/IN economic/JJ changes/NNS ,/, mergers/NNS ,/, take-overs/NNS ,/, new/JJ technologies/NNS etc./FW ./.

What/WP is/VBZ required/VBN here/RB is/VBZ a/DT training/NN policy/NN to/TO qualify/VB and/CC prepare/VB people/NNS for/IN new/JJ jobs/NNS ,/, for/IN those/DT who/WP already/RB have/VBP a/DT job/NN and/CC for/IN those/DT who/WP need/VBP a/DT second/JJ opportunity/NN ,/, because/IN sometimes/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT title/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN states/NNS ,/, the/DT postman/NN always/RB rings/VBN twice/RB ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ humble/JJ opinion/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN all/DT European/JJ ,/, national/JJ and/CC regional/JJ governments/NNS to/TO ensure/VB that/IN he/PRP rings/VBZ on/IN more/JJR than/IN one/CD occasion/NN ./.

It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP ,/, Commissioner/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ the/DT responsibility/NN to/TO promote/VB and/CC coordinate/VB these/DT opportunities/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO congratulate/VB Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP on/IN his/PRP$ really/RB excellent/JJ work/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/WRB there/EX is/VBZ broader/JJR agreement/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP also/RB thank/VBP the/DT Members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP involved/VBN for/IN their/PRP$ contribution/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT number/NN of/IN comments/NNS about/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBN ./.

First/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD stress/VB that/IN the/DT debate/NN about/IN social/JJ protection/NN issues/NNS began/VBD several/JJ years/NNS ago/RB among/IN the/DT European/JJ bodies/NNS and/CC since/IN 1995/CD there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT first/JJ statement/NN entitled/VBN :/: ``/`` The/DT future/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ''/'' and/CC there/EX have/VBP been/VBN statements/NNS from/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP ,/, those/DT of/IN Mrs/NNP Weiler/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Pronk/NNP ./.

Today/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT statement/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Andersson/NNP ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP have/VBP made/VBN considerable/JJ progress/NN since/IN we/PRP are/VBP now/RB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT modernisation/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP must/MD bear/VB in/IN mind/NN the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN by/IN virtue/NN of/IN which/WDT the/DT European/NNP Commission/NNP can/MD operate/VB ./.

The/DT next/JJ point/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT specific/JJ action/NN we/PRP have/VBP undertaken/VBN ./.

As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT high-level/JJ group/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN set/VBN up/RP by/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP ,/, which/WDT will/MD present/VB its/PRP$ first/JJ report/NN to/TO the/DT Summit/NNP Conference/NNP in/IN June/NNP ./.

The/DT Portuguese/NNP Presidency/NNP has/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN two/CD things/NNS :/: sustainable/JJ pension/NN systems/NNS and/CC social/JJ accession/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT proposal/NN for/IN a/DT corresponding/JJ group/NN at/IN Parliamentary/NNP level/NN is/VBZ very/RB positive/JJ and/CC can/MD contribute/VB towards/IN our/PRP$ progress/NN to/TO the/DT next/JJ step/NN after/IN approval/NN of/IN the/DT said/VBN high-level/JJ group/NN ./.

Concerning/VBG some/DT remarks/NNS about/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN systems/NNS ,/, the/DT cost/NN of/IN social/JJ protection/NN and/CC the/DT part/NN played/VBD by/IN those/DT systems/NNS in/IN the/DT competitiveness/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, I/PRP should/MD like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN in/IN Europe/NNP policies/NNS strive/VBP to/TO combine/VB competitiveness/NN and/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP must/MD take/VB due/JJ note/NN of/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN competitiveness/NN ,/, but/CC social/JJ protection/NN too/RB must/MD be/VB planned/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP a/DT factor/NN of/IN economic/JJ growth/NN and/CC employment/NN ./.

I/PRP think/VBP the/DT statement/NN '/POS s/JJ content/NN makes/VBZ this/DT clear/JJ ./.

Ladies/NNP and/CC gentlemen/NNS ,/, the/DT aim/NN is/VBZ that/DT in/IN the/DT next/JJ year/NN ,/, and/CC after/IN a/DT unanimous/JJ decision/NN by/IN the/DT Council/NNP ,/, we/PRP should/MD progress/VB to/TO a/DT first/JJ level/NN of/IN coordination/NN ,/, exchange/NN of/IN views/NNS ,/, listing/NN of/IN social/JJ problems/NNS and/CC creation/NN of/IN a/DT data/NN base/NN for/IN the/DT better/JJR coordination/NN of/IN policies/NNS ./.

As/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT speakers/NNS have/VBP said/VBD ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP a/DT first/JJ important/JJ step/NN has/VBZ been/VBN taken/VBN ./.

Already/RB at/IN the/DT Intergovernmental/NNP Conference/NNP ,/, social/JJ policy/NN issues/NNS are/VBP being/VBG addressed/VBN more/RBR broadly/RB and/CC I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP are/VBP in/IN a/DT new/JJ phase/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT social/JJ policy/NN will/MD ,/, to/TO a/DT large/JJ extent/NN ,/, become/VB a/DT European/JJ policy/NN ./.

Thank/VB you/PRP ,/, Mrs/NNP Diamantopoulou/NNP ./.

The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ closed/JJ ./.

The/DT vote/NN will/MD take/VB place/NN tomorrow/NN at/IN 11.30/CD a.m./NN WIPO/NN treaty/NN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, we/PRP are/VBP now/RB taking/VBG a/DT stance/NN on/IN an/DT important/JJ issue/NN ,/, an/DT international/JJ agreement/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD influence/VB the/DT prospects/NNS for/IN prosperity/NN of/IN many/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

In/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN ,/, Sweden/NNP ,/, one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ biggest/JJS export/NN industries/NNS is/VBZ affected/JJ ,/, namely/RB the/DT music/NN and/CC sound/JJ recording/VBG industry/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN artists/NNS '/POS entitlement/NN to/TO copyright/NN or/CC to/TO protection/NN for/IN their/PRP$ artistic/JJ products/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN the/DT WCT/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- World/NNP Copyright/NNP Treaty/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC the/DT WPPT/NN -LRB-/-LRB- World/NNP Performance/NNP and/CC Phonograms/NNP Treaty/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Without/IN protection/NN under/IN intellectual/JJ property/NN law/NN ,/, creativity/NN is/VBZ inhibited/JJ and/CC financial/JJ incentives/NNS obstructed/VBN ./.

Forgeries/NNS are/VBP big/JJ business/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ estimated/VBN that/WDT ,/, in/IN Europe/NNP alone/RB ,/, income/NN of/IN EUR/$ 4.5/CD billion/CD is/VBZ lost/VBN because/RB of/IN piracy/NN ./.

The/DT problem/NN affects/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN jobs/NNS in/IN the/DT entertainment/NN industry/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ an/DT historic/JJ agreement/NN because/IN the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ the/DT contracting/NN party/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT EU/NNP ,/, but/CC only/RB the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ,/, which/WDT belong/VBP to/TO the/DT organisation/NN ./.

There/EX exists/VBZ a/DT special/JJ clause/NN which/WDT requires/VBZ Parliament/NNP '/POS s/JJ assent/NN in/IN two/CD cases/NNS ./.

With/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT present/JJ agreement/NN ,/, both/PDT these/DT conditions/NNS are/VBP fulfilled/VBN ./.

A/DT new/JJ institution/NN is/VBZ being/VBG created/VBN ,/, an/DT assembly/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ,/, will/MD monitor/VB the/DT agreement/NN and/CC its/PRP$ consequences/NNS ./.

The/DT agreement/NN also/RB concerns/VBZ questions/NNS dealt/VBN with/IN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT co-decision-making/JJ procedure/NN ./.

Parliament/NNP must/MD therefore/RB give/VB its/PRP$ assent/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT agreement/NN concerns/VBZ its/PRP$ sphere/NN of/IN competence/NN ./.

The/DT future/NN will/MD show/VB whether/IN it/PRP is/VBZ right/JJ ,/, by/IN means/NNS of/IN this/DT new/JJ parliamentary/JJ assembly/NN ,/, to/TO reduce/VB the/DT Commission/NNP '/POS s/JJ powers/NNS regarding/VBG these/DT issues/NNS ./.

Parliament/NNP can/MD not/RB ,/, in/IN any/DT case/NN ,/, at/IN present/NN do/VB anything/NN about/IN the/DT matter/NN ./.

The/DT agreement/NN complements/VBZ the/DT Berne/NNP Convention/NNP in/IN regard/NN to/TO literary/JJ works/NNS ./.

It/PRP creates/VBZ international/JJ legal/JJ protection/NN in/IN connection/NN with/IN distribution/NN ,/, sale/NN ,/, rental/JJ ,/, public/JJ reproduction/NN and/CC the/DT making/NN available/JJ of/IN works/NNS ./.

Nothing/NN has/VBZ changed/VBN there/RB ./.

As/IN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN the/DT case/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP offences/NNS that/WDT transcend/VBD European/JJ offences/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, or/CC at/IN least/JJS there/EX is/VBZ the/DT potential/NN for/IN them/PRP to/TO do/VB so/RB ,/, and/CC these/DT might/MD include/VB money-laundering/NN ,/, receiving/VBG stolen/VBN goods/NNS ,/, and/CC forming/VBG a/DT criminal/JJ organisation/NN ./.

As/RB far/RB as/IN that/DT is/VBZ concerned/JJ ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP there/EX are/VBP judicial/JJ uncertainties/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB overcome/VBN ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, for/IN years/NNS ,/, Parliament/NNP has/VBZ called/VBN for/IN specific/JJ and/CC uniform/JJ protection/NN under/IN criminal/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS ./.

Frustration/NNP inevitably/RB sets/VBZ in/IN when/WRB we/PRP see/VBP the/DT weakness/NN of/IN the/DT Convention/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC of/IN the/DT protocols/NNS relating/NNP to/TO this/DT protection/NN -RRB-/-RRB- which/WDT ,/, five/CD years/NNS after/IN being/VBG signed/VBN ,/, has/VBZ still/RB not/RB been/VBN ratified/VBN and/CC has/VBZ still/RB not/RB come/VBN into/IN force/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, more/JJR pro-active/JJ attempts/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB operating/VBG ,/, have/VBP not/RB allayed/VBN legitimate/JJ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT system/NN of/IN guarantees/NNS for/IN individual/JJ rights/NNS ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN they/PRP call/VBP for/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN an/DT independent/JJ body/NN to/TO coordinate/VB and/CC monitor/VB the/DT thoroughness/NNS of/IN investigations/NNS by/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, without/IN harming/VBG the/DT administration/NN of/IN justice/NN by/IN each/DT Member/NNP State/NNP and/CC under/IN the/DT supervision/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ Court/NN of/IN Justice/NNP ./.

We/PRP should/MD approve/VB this/DT report/NN because/IN it/PRP highlights/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO maintain/VB efficient/JJ legal/JJ control/NN over/IN our/PRP$ institutions/NNS ,/, by/IN protecting/VBG the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ system/NN with/IN a/DT substantive/JJ and/CC procedural/JJ European/JJ law/NN which/WDT is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN maintaining/VBG the/DT credibility/NN of/IN the/DT Community/NNP '/POS s/JJ economic/JJ life/NN ./.

Nevertheless/RB ,/, it/PRP raises/VBZ some/DT very/RB basic/JJ questions/NNS ./.

Is/VBZ there/EX currently/RB a/DT sufficient/JJ legal/JJ basis/NN for/IN justifying/NNP ,/, in/IN legal/JJ terms/NNS ,/, the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT specifically/RB Community-wide/JJ criminal/JJ law/NN which/WDT ,/, although/IN it/PRP might/MD be/VB called/VBN subsidiary/NN ,/, will/MD always/RB clash/VB with/IN the/DT practice/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN certain/JJ areas/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT traditional/JJ ,/, separate/JJ criminal/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS ?/.

Surely/RB these/DT subjects/NNS will/MD be/VB of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS relevance/NN to/TO a/DT revision/NN of/IN the/DT treaties/NNS which/WDT will/MD contribute/VB to/TO the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN freedom/NN ,/, security/NN and/CC justice/NN ?/.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, the/DT EU/NNP is/VBZ now/RB exposed/VBN to/TO tough/JJ scrutiny/NN ./.

Confidence/NN in/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN seriously/RB damaged/VBN ./.

To/TO remedy/VB this/DT ,/, vigorous/JJ efforts/NNS are/VBP required/VBN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB welcome/VBP increased/VBN resources/NNS for/IN OLAF/NNP so/RB that/IN we/PRP can/MD investigate/VB any/DT suspicions/NNS more/RBR efficiently/RB ./.

At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, we/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN those/DT who/WP commit/VBP crimes/NNS against/IN the/DT EU/NNP must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO be/VB held/VBN accountable/JJ in/IN an/DT effective/JJ way/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ that/IN the/DT convention/NN for/IN protecting/VBG the/DT Union/NNP '/POS s/JJ financial/JJ interests/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN put/VBN into/IN effect/NN in/IN so/RB few/JJ Member/NNP States/NNPS ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB think/VBP it/PRP only/RB right/RB that/IN the/DT Commission/NNP should/MD have/VB the/DT task/NN of/IN tabling/VBG proposals/NNS entailing/VBG the/DT further/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT already/RB existing/VBG legal/JJ framework/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB convinced/VBN that/IN making/VBG the/DT process/NN more/RBR efficient/JJ in/IN this/DT way/NN requires/VBZ common/JJ European/JJ legislation/NN or/CC centralisation/NN of/IN the/DT fight/NN against/IN crime/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT present/JJ situation/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP therefore/RB sceptical/JJ about/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT European/JJ prosecutor/NN ,/, which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ scarcely/RB possible/JJ to/TO implement/VB within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ treaty/NN ./.

We/PRP have/VBP more/JJR confidence/NN in/IN Eurojust/NNP ,/, where/WRB prosecutors/NNS from/IN the/DT individual/JJ nations/NNS cooperate/VBP ./.

The/DT major/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN no/DT measures/NNS are/VBP being/VBG taken/VBN against/IN crimes/NNS committed/VBN against/IN the/DT Union/NNP but/CC ,/, rather/RB ,/, that/IN these/DT are/VBP committed/VBN so/RB often/RB and/CC far/RB too/RB seldom/RB discovered/VBN ./.

The/DT challenge/NN for/IN the/DT Commission/NNP and/CC for/IN ourselves/PRP is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO find/VB the/DT right/JJ mix/NN ./.

The/DT mismanagement/NN and/CC examples/NNS of/IN fraud/NN which/WDT occur/VBP ought/MD not/RB to/TO lead/VB to/TO our/PRP$ ending/NN up/RB in/IN an/DT old-fashioned/JJ hierarchical/JJ bureaucracy/NN which/WDT ,/, through/IN an/DT exaggerated/JJ supervision/NN of/IN detail/NN ,/, prevents/VBZ the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT modern/JJ administration/NN ./.

We/PRP therefore/RB welcome/VBP the/DT aggressive/JJ approach/NN of/IN Mr/NNP van/NNP Hulten/NNP '/POS s/JJ report/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ idea/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB that/IN each/DT administration/NN takes/VBZ responsibility/NN for/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ supervision/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ experience/NN of/IN modern/JJ administration/NN tells/VBZ us/PRP that/IN openness/NN ,/, decentralisation/NN of/IN responsibility/NN and/CC qualified/JJ evaluation/NN are/VBP often/RB as/RB effective/JJ as/IN detailed/JJ bureaucratic/JJ supervision/NN ./.

The/DT major/JJ challenge/NN is/VBZ ,/, therefore/RB ,/, to/TO create/VB a/DT modern/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ administration/NN without/IN compromising/VBG on/IN supervision/NN and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN ./.

This/DT requires/VBZ staff/NN training/NN ,/, more/JJR modern/JJ recruitment/NN methods/NNS and/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, openness/NN and/CC public/JJ control/NN ./.

Being/VBG able/JJ to/TO scrutinise/VB the/DT administration/NN effectively/RB is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS protection/NN against/IN irregularities/NNS ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, rapporteur/NN ,/, restoring/VBG the/DT confidence/NN of/IN the/DT citizens/NNS in/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN the/DT European/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC in/IN European/JJ politics/NNS is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ tasks/NNS we/PRP have/VBP before/IN us/PRP ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN its/PRP$ commitment/NN to/TO this/DT task/NN and/CC the/DT draft/NN for/IN the/DT overall/JJ package/NN of/IN internal/JJ reforms/NNS documents/VBZ this/DT ./.

Parliament/NNP is/VBZ committed/VBN to/TO this/DT task/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN this/DT report/NN bears/VBZ impressive/JJ witness/NN to/TO ./.

On/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP I/PRP am/VBP able/JJ to/TO congratulate/VB the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN having/VBG again/RB addressed/VBN the/DT genuinely/RB difficult/JJ question/NN as/RB to/TO what/WP we/PRP can/MD do/VB ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN creating/VBG legal/JJ bases/NNS and/CC effecting/VBG institutional/JJ change/NN ,/, to/TO step/VB up/RP the/DT fight/NN against/IN fraud/NN perpetrated/VBN against/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP ./.

On/IN ratifying/VBG the/DT Amsterdam/NNP Treaty/NNP ,/, all/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS stated/VBD that/IN they/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO accord/VB combating/JJ fraud/NN against/IN the/DT financial/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP the/DT same/JJ priority/NN as/IN combating/VBG fraud/NN to/TO their/PRP$ own/JJ detriment/NN ./.

Yet/CC as/IN things/NNS stand/VBP ,/, only/RB the/DT first/JJ four/CD Member/NNP States/NNPS have/VBP ratified/VBN the/DT agreement/NN concluded/VBN in/IN 1995/CD ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP wholeheartedly/NN agrees/VBZ with/IN the/DT rapporteur/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ an/DT unacceptable/JJ situation/NN ./.

OLAF/NNP ,/, the/DT European/NNP anti-fraud/JJ office/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ instruments/NNS the/DT Commission/NNP has/VBZ for/IN fulfilling/VBG its/PRP$ obligation/NN to/TO combat/VB fraud/NN ./.

Accordingly/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP refused/VBD to/TO put/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN both/DT European/JJ banks/NNS ,/, the/DT ECB/NNP and/CC the/DT EIB/NNP ,/, contested/VBD the/DT right/NN of/IN OLAF/NNP to/TO include/VB these/DT two/CD institutions/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ investigations/NNS ,/, citing/VBG their/PRP$ independent/JJ status/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Commission/NNP resolved/VBN on/IN raising/VBG a/DT complaint/NN against/IN these/DT two/CD banks/NNS at/IN its/PRP$ last/JJ meeting/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Parliament/NNP approves/VBZ this/DT step/NN ./.

The/DT second/JJ recommendation/NN in/IN this/DT report/NN relates/VBZ to/TO assessing/VBG the/DT legitimacy/NN of/IN the/DT investigative/JJ measures/NNS undertaken/VBN by/IN OLAF/NNP in/IN the/DT various/JJ European/JJ institutions/NNS ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN the/DT monitoring/VBG committee/NN for/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD set/VBN up/RP at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, to/TO safeguard/VB the/DT independence/NN of/IN OLAF/NNP ,/, however/RB it/PRP can/MD not/RB undertake/VB the/DT action/NN mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN of/IN monitoring/VBG internal/JJ investigative/JJ activities/NNS conducted/VBN by/IN OLAF/NNP ./.

I/PRP am/VBP fully/RB in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT monitoring/NN committee/NN and/CC the/DT rapporteur/NN on/IN this/DT point/NN ./.

In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT loophole/NN here/RB which/WDT must/MD be/VB filled/VBN and/CC I/PRP will/MD examine/VB the/DT solution/NN advocated/VBN in/IN the/DT report/NN in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN moving/VBG things/NNS on/IN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN I/PRP would/MD ask/VB though/RB :/: I/PRP believe/VBP we/PRP must/MD prevent/VB the/DT debate/NN on/IN extending/VBG the/DT legal/JJ basis/NN for/IN OLAF/NNP from/IN leading/VBG to/TO the/DT misconception/NN that/IN OLAF/NNP does/VBZ not/RB now/RB have/VB enough/JJ authority/NN ./.

These/DT are/VBP both/DT about/IN voting/NN ./.

Is/VBZ it/PRP not/RB the/DT case/NN that/WDT on/IN votes/NNS other/JJ than/IN roll-call/JJ votes/NNS ,/, the/DT vote/NN should/MD take/VB place/NN initially/RB by/IN show/NN of/IN hands/NNS and/CC only/RB then/RB ,/, if/IN there/EX is/VBZ some/DT doubt/NN ,/, should/MD we/PRP utilise/VB the/DT electronic/JJ voting/NN system/NN ?/.

I/PRP put/VBD the/DT matter/NN to/TO a/DT vote/NN by/IN a/DT show/NN of/IN hands/NNS because/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT groups/NNS had/VBD requested/VBN voting/VBG by/IN roll/NN call/NN ./.

I/PRP was/VBD wondering/VBG whether/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT correct/JJ procedure/NN ./.

I/PRP know/VBP it/PRP takes/VBZ longer/RBR ,/, but/CC should/MD we/PRP not/RB always/RB have/VB a/DT show/NN of/IN hands/NNS first/RB ?/.

In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT transportation/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS nationally/RB and/CC internationally/RB has/VBZ increased/VBN considerably/RB ,/, increasing/VBG the/DT risk/NN of/IN accidents/NNS ./.

Some/DT of/IN these/DT risks/NNS were/VBD due/JJ to/TO an/DT inadequate/JJ awareness/NN of/IN the/DT risks/NNS inherent/JJ in/IN such/JJ transportation/NN ./.

It/PRP therefore/RB proved/VBD necessary/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN establishing/VBG the/DT internal/JJ market/NN ,/, to/TO adopt/VB some/DT measures/NNS intended/VBN to/TO ensure/VB better/JJR risk/NN prevention/NN ./.

Directive/NNP 96/35/EC/CD was/VBD a/DT response/NN to/TO this/DT requirement/NN ./.

Firms/NNS involved/VBN in/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS and/CC in/IN the/DT loading/NN and/CC unloading/VBG operations/NNS related/VBN to/TO such/JJ transportation/NN have/VBP been/VBN obliged/VBN ,/, quite/RB rightly/RB ,/, to/TO comply/VB with/IN regulations/NNS regarding/VBG risk/NN prevention/NN ,/, whether/IN road/NN ,/, rail/NN or/CC inland/NN waterway/NN transport/NN is/VBZ involved/VBN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO facilitate/VB achieving/VBG this/DT objective/NN ,/, Directive/NNP 96/35/EC/CD provided/VBD for/IN the/DT appointment/NN of/IN safety/NN advisers/NNS for/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS who/WP would/MD have/VB appropriate/JJ professional/JJ training/NN ./.

While/IN this/DT represented/VBD significant/JJ progress/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT lack/NN of/IN specific/JJ terms/NNS governing/VBG the/DT harmonisation/NN of/IN examination/NN requirements/NNS proved/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT problem/NN ./.

It/PRP therefore/RB seemed/VBD essential/JJ to/TO make/VB good/JJ this/DT omission/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB the/DT standardised/JJ ,/, high-level/JJ training/NN of/IN safety/NN advisers/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO avoid/VB any/DT disparities/NNS between/IN the/DT costs/NNS of/IN training/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT concomitant/JJ effect/NN on/IN competition/NN between/IN the/DT firms/NNS of/IN different/JJ Member/NNP Sates/NNPS ./.

The/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN seeks/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT training/NN of/IN safety/NN advisers/NNS is/VBZ standardised/VBN ./.

It/PRP outlines/VBZ the/DT minimum/JJ content/NN of/IN examinations/NNS and/CC defines/VBZ the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT authorising/VBG body/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT requirements/NNS demanded/VBN of/IN the/DT examining/JJ bodies/NNS ./.

Koch/NNP Report/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0104/JJ //NNP 1999/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Last/JJ October/NNP I/PRP expressed/VBD my/PRP$ views/NNS on/IN the/DT Hatzidakis/NNP report/NN on/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN rail/NN ./.

The/DT views/NNS I/PRP shall/MD express/VB today/NN are/VBP not/RB far/RB removed/VBN from/IN those/DT I/PRP had/VBD then/RB ./.

Essentially/RB ,/, my/PRP$ opinion/NN is/VBZ as/IN follows/VBZ :/: I/PRP deplore/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, in/IN a/DT field/NN as/RB crucial/JJ as/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS ,/, we/PRP keep/VBP putting/VBG off/RP the/DT adoption/NN of/IN harmonised/JJ standards/NNS to/TO the/DT detriment/NN of/IN human/JJ beings/NNS and/CC the/DT environment/NN ./.

I/PRP shall/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN a/DT directive/NN on/IN the/DT approximation/NN of/IN Member/NNP State/NNP legislation/NN on/IN the/DT transport/NN of/IN dangerous/JJ goods/NNS by/IN road/NN came/VBD into/IN force/NN on/IN 1/CD January/NNP 1997/CD ./.

This/DT included/VBD a/DT number/NN of/IN interim/JJ conditions/NNS valid/JJ until/IN 1/CD January/NNP 1999/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT time/NN when/WRB we/PRP should/MD have/VB expressed/VBN our/PRP$ opinion/NN of/IN the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT derogations/NNS ./.

The/DT CEN/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN unable/JJ to/TO complete/VB its/PRP$ work/NN in/IN the/DT time/NN allotted/NN ./.

Consequently/RB ,/, the/DT Commission/NNP proposal/NN under/IN discussion/NN today/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO amend/VB the/DT directive/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO provide/VB a/DT short-term/JJ solution/NN to/TO these/DT problems/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN to/TO put/VB an/DT end/NN to/TO the/DT transitional/JJ arrangements/NNS ,/, as/IN should/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT case/NN !/. ./.

This/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP happened/VBD in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN transport/NN of/IN such/JJ goods/NNS by/IN rail/NN ,/, except/IN for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT time/NN limit/NN had/VBD been/VBN decided/VBN ./.

Right/RB now/RB we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB the/DT slightest/JJS idea/NN as/IN to/TO when/WRB the/DT CEN/NNP will/MD be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO put/VB forward/RP practical/JJ proposals/NNS ./.

Until/IN then/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ really/RB no/DT point/NN in/IN Member/NNP States/NNPS amending/VBG their/PRP$ national/JJ regulations/NNS ./.

The/DT report/NN also/RB accepts/VBZ that/IN some/DT flexibility/NN may/MD be/VB adopted/VBN ,/, and/CC grants/NNS States/VBZ the/DT option/NN of/IN adopting/VBG or/CC applying/VBG alternative/JJ standards/NNS ./.

They/PRP may/MD ,/, therefore/RB ,/, continue/VB to/TO enforce/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ standards/NNS regarding/VBG certain/JJ types/NNS of/IN pressure/NN vessel/NN used/VBN for/IN transportation/NN ,/, where/WRB there/EX are/VBP no/DT applicable/JJ European/JJ standards/NNS ./.

They/PRP may/MD also/RB adopt/VB alternative/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN transportation/NN of/IN a/DT local/JJ nature/NN and/CC for/IN ad/FW hoc/FW transportation/NN ./.

In/IN offering/VBG this/DT explanation/NN of/IN my/PRP$ vote/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, I/PRP wished/VBD to/TO express/VB my/PRP$ deep/JJ dissatisfaction/NN and/CC my/PRP$ deep/JJ concern/NN ./.

Schroedter/NNP Report/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- A5-0108/JJ //NNP 1999/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Mr/NNP President/NNP ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO press/VB home/RB my/PRP$ explanation/NN of/IN vote/NN by/IN this/DT oral/JJ explanation/NN following/VBG on/IN from/IN the/DT Schroedter/NNP report/NN with/IN regard/NN to/TO regional/JJ development/NN ./.

I/PRP would/MD urge/VB both/PDT the/DT Member/NNP States/NNPS and/CC the/DT Commission/NNP to/TO give/VB sufficient/JJ consideration/NN to/TO the/DT huge/JJ disparities/NNS in/IN wealth/NN which/WDT continue/VBP to/TO exist/VB between/IN the/DT different/JJ regions/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ./.

Not/RB only/RB the/DT difference/NN in/IN income/NN per/IN capita/NN but/CC ,/, above/IN all/DT ,/, large/JJ disparities/NNS in/IN employment/NN continue/VBP to/TO give/VB cause/NN for/IN concern/NN ./.

Despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT Community/NNP ,/, through/IN the/DT structural/JJ funds/NNS among/IN others/NNS ,/, injects/VBZ considerable/JJ sums/NNS into/IN combating/VBG the/DT disparities/NNS between/IN regional/JJ development/NN opportunities/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP ,/, these/DT disparities/NNS continue/VBP to/TO exist/VB ./.

I/PRP therefore/RB wonder/VBP whether/IN the/DT Community/NNP should/MD not/RB have/VB a/DT more/RBR drastic/JJ change/NN of/IN tack/NN and/CC ,/, based/VBN on/IN very/RB strict/JJ evaluations/NNS ,/, change/VB its/PRP$ course/NN and/CC change/VB its/PRP$ objectives/NNS in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN as/IN to/TO make/VB it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO combat/VB the/DT disparities/NNS in/IN wealth/NN and/CC employment/NN more/RBR effectively/RB ./.

I/PRP regard/VBP that/DT as/IN a/DT very/RB unsatisfactory/JJ state/NN of/IN affairs/NNS ./.

I/PRP hope/VBP we/PRP can/MD revisit/VB this/DT issue/NN at/IN a/DT later/JJ time/NN ./.

I/PRP want/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB clear/JJ that/IN though/IN I/PRP voted/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT report/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP this/DT important/JJ reservation/NN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ as/IN EU/JJ Structural/JJ Funds/NNS are/VBP always/RB spent/VBN in/IN a/DT manner/NN which/WDT maximises/VBZ the/DT economic/JJ development/NN of/IN different/JJ regions/NNS when/WRB local/JJ and/CC regional/JJ authorities/NNS are/VBP involved/VBN in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN for/IN the/DT spending/NN of/IN such/JJ funds/NNS ./.

As/IN a/DT Member/NNP of/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament/NNP for/IN the/DT constituency/NN of/IN Leinster/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP always/RB supported/VBN the/DT need/NN for/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN bottom-up/JJ schemes/NNS supported/VBN by/IN national/JJ EU/NNP funds/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Irish/JJ Government/NN and/CC the/DT European/JJ Commission/NNP and/CC different/JJ EU/NN governments/NNS can/MD not/RB alone/RB decide/VB on/IN specific/JJ spending/NN priorities/NNS ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC groups/NNS from/IN the/DT private/JJ and/CC voluntary/JJ sector/NN should/MD be/VB fully/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN for/IN the/DT spending/NN of/IN European/JJ Structural/JJ Funds/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN the/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT Leader/NNP I/NNP and/CC Leader/NNP II/NNP schemes/NNS in/IN Ireland/NNP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT jobs/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN created/VBN through/IN the/DT administration/NN of/IN these/DT programmes/NNS in/IN rural/JJ parts/NNS of/IN Ireland/NNP and/CC within/IN Europe/NNP ./.

The/DT Leader/NNP III/NNP scheme/NN is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO be/VB implemented/VBN some/DT time/NN later/RBR this/DT year/NN ./.

The/DT Leader/NNP programme/NN at/IN its/PRP$ core/NN affords/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN for/IN public/JJ ,/, private/JJ and/CC voluntary/JJ groups/NNS to/TO pool/VB their/PRP$ collective/JJ talents/NNS so/RB as/RB to/TO create/VB long-term/JJ and/CC sustainable/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN small/JJ and/CC medium-sized/JJ enterprises/NNS in/IN rural/JJ areas/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT classic/JJ example/NN of/IN how/WRB the/DT partnership/NN concept/NN operates/VBZ and/CC such/JJ schemes/NNS must/MD be/VB supported/VBN in/IN its/PRP$ broadest/JJS remit/NN ./.
