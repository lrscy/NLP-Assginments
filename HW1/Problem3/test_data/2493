It is not the end of the journey but only the beginning.
One thing is absolutely certain, however, namely that violence never can be and never has been the way to deal with problems.
That must be made quite clear.
The way to resolve problems is through dialogue, political pluralism, strengthening democratic institutions such as the parliament, an independent judicial system and governments working under democratically elected leaders.
I call on the Council and the European Commission to ensure that as much as possible of the assistance allocated to East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund is devoted to strengthening democracy.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
Eighteen months have now passed since the last European Parliament resolution on East Timor.
Officially, this country became independent in 2002.
Four years later a civil war broke out, triggered by a group of demobilised soldiers.
After the attack on President Ramos Horta on 11 February of this year, East Timor experienced yet another political crisis.
A state of emergency was declared and a request made for the then 1 600-strong peacekeeping force to be reinforced.
The political crisis in East Timor is accompanied by an economic one.
Unemployment is in the order of 80%, and 40% of the unemployed are living below the poverty threshold.
The country cannot be stabilised unless all the political forces reach a consensus on the fundamental functions of the state.
We must condemn the brutal attack on the President and the Prime Minister and call upon the government of East Timor to put an end to violence, including the activities of gangs.
The international community, notably the UN and the Security Council, must support the consolidation of democracy.
It should also be remembered that East Timor urgently needs economic aid to combat poverty and develop administration and infrastructure.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my support for the joint motion for a resolution condemning the attacks.
I also want to congratulate the institutions of East Timor for their calm response to the tragedy and I must underline, like Mrs Gomes and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, that East Timor is not a failed state.
It is a state that requires international assistance, a delegation from the European Commission, the extension of the UN mission and support from all of us for any initiatives that might help to promote unity among the East Timorese people, with respect for the law and condemning all violence.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission has condemned the attacks against President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in the strongest terms.
The young democracy of East Timor is still extremely vulnerable in its political, judicial and security institutions.
The country is confronted with poverty and high unemployment, especially among the young people who have so far little expectations for a prosperous future and are amenable to violent groups.
In its meetings with the leaders of the country, the Commission has supported a peaceful settlement of the conflict, including the eventual disbanding and disarmament of any paramilitary group.
Following the 2006 violence, the European Commission has reacted quickly: firstly, with humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced persons; secondly, by supporting dialogue among the leaders; and thirdly, in implementing a cash-for-work programme for unemployed youth.
The European Commission also decided to open a fully-fledged delegation in Dili, and the new head of delegation is expected to start work in March 2008.
The delegation will become fully operational towards the second half of 2008.
This will create the opportunity for a formal political dialogue with the government and a faster assessment of support to the country.
The strategy of the European Commission for East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund has recently been approved.
It aims to support the still weak judicial sector, the Parliament and other institutions, thereby assisting in building up a democratic culture.
Support to rural development will help to alleviate poverty and to improve infrastructure.
Health-related activities will contribute to tackling poverty-related diseases and reducing alarmingly high mother and child mortality rates.
Addressing the root causes of the present conflict and providing support for their solution will be as important as the longer term programmes.
The East Timorese Government has submitted a comprehensive Governance Action Plan, which will be the subject of political dialogue between the delegation and the Government, supported by the Commission.
In a mission during the next weeks, the Commission will assess the situation and the possibility of assisting with further measures addressing some of the root causes of the conflict.
This may include requests of the Government to support some labour-intensive programmes to combat unemployment.
In a joint Commission-Council paper of December 2007, both the Commission and the EU Member States supported the central role of the United Nations in coordinating the assistance to the security sector.
In summary, the envisaged support under the Commission programme, more than EUR 80 million, is comprehensive and will help to address many of the present problems of the country.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.

Belarus
author, (PL) Mr President, most of the political prisoners held in Belarus were recently released, in fact nearly all of them were, with only one exception.
This does not mean we can be confident that things are moving in the right direction in Belarus.
On that very same day, the homes of a whole range of individuals connected with the opposition in Belarus were raided.
In addition a secondary school teacher was sacked.
By way of explanation he was told that since he was a member of the opposition Civil Party he did not represent an ideology in line with that of the State.
A very strange situation exists in Belarus.
In that country, there is a concept of state ideology, and therefore it is hardly surprising that when candidates apply to study journalism, law, and international relations, they have to present recommendations from the authorities.
That is how the selection process works.
This is totally unacceptable, although we do welcome the step taken and are cautiously pleased about it.
As for Belarus itself, the question that immediately springs to mind is what the underlying reason for such action can be.
It would appear that through this action and by consenting to the opening of a European Commission delegation in Minsk, President Lukashenko wishes to demonstrate that he does not feel irrevocably bound to adopt a pro-Russian policy to the exclusion of all others.
Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct such a policy in Belarus.
The country does not wish to become totally absorbed by Russia.
In this instance, even Mr Lukashenko has adopted such a stance, but events speak for themselves.
Russia is quite simply buying up Belarus.
Gazprom has just concluded yet another transaction, as a result of which it now owns one quarter of the shares in the companies controlling the oil and gas transit routes through Belarus.
Gazprom's share will soon increase to 50%.
It also seems that Russia will succeed in persuading Belarus to adopt the rouble as its national currency.
As a result of all this, the situation is becoming increasingly threatening.
Support for independent action in Belarus and for civil society is all the more necessary.
Support is already being made available, but it must be scaled up.
In particular, support must be provided for the institutions that have just been set up in Belarus.
I could focus on television broadcasts to the country, which are an important resource for ensuring that the local people know what is actually going on.
In my view, we should keep Belarus in the forefront of our minds, because this is an issue for Europe as a whole.
We cannot tolerate a situation in which there is a country like Belarus, run by a dictator, in the very centre of Europe.
author. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the strongly critical tone of the contributions I am happy to say that we have at least two positive aspects here.
The first one is the opening of the European Commission delegation in Minsk, which as far as I know, has also been approved by the President of Belarus.
I believe that opening an EU delegation provides the bases for further development and activating of relations with the European Union in such mutually advantageous areas as energy, transport, transit and even protection of the environment.
The other positive factor I consider important is the meeting of experts in Brussels last June, which concentrated mainly on the issues of energy supply and also the planned expert talks on transport corridors and the environment.
I consider this development to be extremely important.
We must not forget that Belarus itself is still struggling with the extremely serious consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
Present trends in mutual relations reveal that a certain view of Belarus has taken hold among the political circles of the European Union and that view is very critical and one-sided.
We need not just criticism but also cooperation.
The time has come for a positive step on the part of Belarus as well, and I think that the official Belarusian regime should offer at least a moratorium on the death penalty, which could enable us to open new negotiations regarding the status of Belarus' membership of the Council of Europe.
On the part of the EU, I would welcome for example a relaxation of the visa system or support for young specialists from Belarus on work experience by providing them with opportunities to get to know the workings of the European institutions at first hand.
author. - Mr President, this afternoon I would firstly like to welcome the positive sign of relations between the EU and Belarus.
The recent developments on the agreements to establish the European Commission's delegation in Minsk are a positive step toward renewing dialogue with the European Union and Belarus.
We would like to encourage the Commission to use the full potential of the opening of a delegation.
The time has come for the international community as a whole to extend more support to civil society in Belarus, in particular to increase financial aid to the independent media, to non-governmental organisations and to Belarusian students studying abroad.
The Commission's decision to give financial support to the European Humanities University in Vilnius is very wise.
The Commission and the Council should consider offering financial support to the project, which is already in existence, to create the independent Belarusian television channel Belsat.
Secondly, the European Parliament calls on the Commission and the Council to take further steps towards the facilitation and liberalisation of visa procedures for Belarusian citizens.
We call on Member States in the Schengen area to use all available tools, mainly national visa costs, in order to facilitate the movement of Belarusian citizens within each Member State's territory.
Thirdly, we call on President Lukashenko's regime above all to move towards liberalisation and democratisation, to release all prisoners of conscience in the country, to introduce the rule of law and freedom of media associations and to abolish the death penalty.
In conclusion, I would like to express this afternoon our solidarity with the United Democratic Opposition of Belarus, the leader of the democratic movement, Alexander Milinkevich, and all Belarusian citizens in their struggle towards an open society.
author (PL) Thank you, Mr President.
The actions taken by Mr Lukashenko's dictatorship against his own people in Belarus are widely known.
Since the beginning of this year alone, three peaceful demonstrations have been brutally suppressed.
The authorities are systematically persecuting opposition activists.
They have brought in restrictions on travel abroad by members of the clergy and religious instruction teachers.
Some rather curious provisions have also been introduced.
For example, anyone wishing to study law or journalism must be approved by the ruling authorities.
Against this background, imposing stricter sanctions against Belarus unfortunately seems to be the only possible response to recent events.
We must not forget, however, that it is our moral right and duty to create and support civil society in Belarus.
One of the immediate measures to assist the opposition is to overcome the news blackout.
A good example of this is the initiative taken by the Polish national television service, which began to broadcast to Belarus on 10 December 2007 through the first independent channel, called Belsat.
Unfortunately, as Mrs Romaszewska, the producer responsible for this project, told me today, no financial support from the European Union has yet been received.
There is not even a budget line from which human rights and democracy in Belarus could be supported.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that the high cost of Schengen visas is another mayor problem for the people of Belarus.
If access to the European Union for members of Mr Lukashenko's regime is restricted, we must make access to the Union easier for people who are not connected with that regime.
author. - Mr President, in January of this year, 10 young activists of the Belarusian Popular Front Youth and Malady Front ('Young Front') were arrested after they met a delegation of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe (DEMYC) in Minsk, and then faced expulsion from their universities.
This is the last real dictatorship in Europe.
Belarus still has the death penalty, political prisoners, arbitrary arrests, media censorship, violence and restrictions on access to the internet.
All Europeans should not take their liberty for granted, and young Europeans should follow the DEMYC example in showing solidarity with their neighbours by standing up for democracy and human rights.
Belarus cannot be a partner of the EU while this intolerable intimidation and targeted arrests continue.
Reading the official internet biography of President Lukashenko, I became aware that he considers himself to be 'notable for his in-depth understanding of events, hard work, sense of duty, realism, fairness and fidelity to principles'.
Why, then, can Mr Lukashenko not realise a very simple and plain fact: Soviet-style tyrants belong in the past?
As to the students, repressed and deprived of their fundamental right to education, I urge our Parliament to join me in paraphrasing the song: Hey, Lukashenko, leave the kids alone!
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belarus is and remains the problem child in our Neighbourhood Policy.
Dictator Lukashenko continues to ensure that his country systematically distances and isolates itself from its neighbours.
He tramples human rights under foot and maintains the death penalty.
This is not only a concern for us; it is also encountering massive opposition among Belarus's own population.
More and more young people are leaving Belarus.
It is a dramatic situation for that country.
The European Union's task is therefore to help Belarus to return to the path towards democracy.
From my perspective, this will not happen with Dictator Lukashenko and his presidential apparatus, but only with the opposition, civil society and the young people who could form the country's future elite.
So I appeal to the Member States to change their visa policy for these people and give them the chance to engage in exchanges with young people in the European Union, a chance of democratic education and a chance actually to experience democracy for themselves by visiting the European Union.
Visa policy must not become an insurmountable obstacle which obstructs the path to democracy.
That is extremely important.
In negotiations with Lukashenko, however, there should be no concessions on human rights.
There is consensus on this point in Parliament, across all the parliamentary groups: we want the release of all political prisoners, a moratorium on the death penalty, media freedom and respect for all the basic principles of democracy.
That is the fundamental prerequisite for negotiations.
No concessions.
The crucial factor here is what happens at the next elections.
I hope very much for the Belarusian people that they take control of their own destiny.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Alexander Kazulin, the former Belarusian presidential candidate, has served two of the five and a half year prison term imposed on him for vandalism.
Mr Kazulin's wife Irina is fighting tirelessly to obtain her husband's freedom, despite being gravely ill.
President Lukashenko suggested that Mr Kazulin could be freed to enable him to accompany his wife to Germany where she could receive medical treatment.
The President reacted with surprise when his offer was turned down.
For Mrs Kazulin, acceptance would have meant a cowardly flight from her homeland.
In my view, if President Lukashenko really wants to improve his image, he should free Mr Kazulin immediately and unconditionally.
Let us hope that Mr and Mrs Kazulin will soon be able to enjoy good health and freedom in their homeland.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Belarus is a neighbour of the European Union.
It shares with us a difficult history of Communist domination, but still does not enjoy democratic rule and respect for human rights.
The regime of President Lukashenko brutally represses any attempt to create civil society.
I would remind the House that Mr Lukashenko infringed democratic procedures in order to gain a further term of office.
Journalists and leaders of independent youth organisations and independent trade unions are being intimidated.
Members of the political opposition have been arrested.
I could mention the Kazulin case that Mrs Gacek referred to just now, and the repression of national minorities, including the Polish national minority.
Latterly the regime has become concerned about the financial independence of small entrepreneurs and taken repressive measures against them.
Such is the sad state of affairs in Belarus.
It is the European Union's moral duty to provide financial support and information for all those striving to defend human rights and democratic freedoms in Belarus by way of the independent media, for instance through television broadcasts to Belarus.
Establishing a European Union delegation in Minsk would be a good way to monitor the situation.
Ten years after the Chernobyl disaster I took part legally in a demonstration in Minsk.
I saw OMON special purpose police squads that had been brought from Moscow to deal with people evacuated from the danger area.
I saw pools of blood on the streets of Minsk.
This must not be allowed to happen again.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I have a foster nephew from Belarus, now an adult and considered a wonderful addition to our extended family.
But I remember his condition the summer he first came to stay with my sister, and it is this experience that allows me, personally, to understand the difficulties, especially of someone disabled, raised in an institution in such an unstable environment.
Belarus needs relief - relief not only from economic and political instability but relief for the people.
The people of Belarus are particularly isolated, controlled under a regime that continues to threaten the democratic values and freedoms to which people are entitled.
Before Christmas, I met two representatives from Belarus.
They informed me of the ongoing problem of defending religious freedom.
Religious activity is forbidden without registration with the Government, and a person can be charged a fine or face imprisonment for unregistered religious activity, though government registration is made extremely difficult to get.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to support the statements made by previous speakers.
In addition, however, I should like to mention another very important issue, namely that we cannot deal with policy on Belarus in isolation from the European Union's eastern policy as a whole.
We had a tendency to forgive the Russian administration a great many undemocratic actions.
That should be borne in mind.
I know that events in Belarus do not bear comparison with what is currently taking place in Russia, but they most certainly did and do bear comparison with what took place in Chechnya.
We cannot adopt one course of action for Belarus and a different one for Russia.
Conducting our eastern policy from the point of view of enlargement of the European Union is another very important issue.
The fate of Ukraine currently hangs in the balance, and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of Europe.
If we are prepared to open the door to the people of Ukraine, it will send a signal to the people of Belarus and show them that there is another option, one involving closer links and relationships with the European Union.
In the future it may also involve membership of the Union, although that may not come about for many years.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have encountered a difficulty.
We estimated two minutes for the 'catch-the-eye' procedure: that is, two speakers.
I already have eight or nine requests, and I can see more hands being raised, taking us up to ten or more.
Thus, either I give the floor to the first two, which is simple enough for me, or I can ask you to make a thirty-second statement and we try to get round everybody.
(The latter solution was chosen)
(PL) Mr President, it has become clear from this debate that Parliament recognises the problem of Belarus and attaches great importance to it.
I would like to thank all those who have referred to the situation regarding human rights in Belarus.
I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that parliamentary elections are due to be held in Belarus in the autumn of this year.
We must do all in our power both as Members of this House and also as representatives of the large European political families, to support the Belarusian opposition in this just though unfair struggle for a democratic Belarus.
(SK) Some time has passed since Mr Bernd Posselt and I lit a candle in this House, in spite of the ban on safety grounds, to show our solidarity with the Belarusian people, in the presence of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
What is Belarus like today?
The last European dictator Alexander Lukashenko is popular in Belarus in spite of the strictly regulated economy and the intimidation of political opponents.
The government intensifies repression and imprisons opposition activists.
The government controls the Belarusian media which is why people in the country often do not know that Lukashenko's regime is unacceptable to the European Union.
The European Parliament cannot satisfy itself only with awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Alexander Milinkevich.
This prize commits the European Parliament to detailed monitoring of the situation in Belarus.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to refer to a particular case.
It concerns Frank Wieczorek, a young opposition activist who was recently expelled from university.
The official reason for his expulsion was that he had failed to attend classes.
The reason he had been absent, however, was that he had been arrested.
Expulsion from university means that a person's education comes to an abrupt end.
It also means that there is a strong chance of being conscripted into the army.
I imagine that only people who have had personal experience of living under a dictatorship will understand what service in the regime's army can be like for a member of the opposition.
It could prove very dangerous for this young man.
I believe we should do all we can to assist in resolving the situation in Belarus.
(CS) (The beginning of the speech was inaudible)...as a medical doctor I personally visited the epicentre of the area affected by radiation.
Doctors and scientists are being intimidated and even imprisoned for reporting the truth about the state of health of the local population.
The people had their radiometers confiscated and they are eating radioactive food.
I only have 30 seconds so just to summarise: Lukashenko is a murderer and it has to be said out loud.
By whom, if not by the European Union?
Thank you, the message has been received.
(PL) Mr President, one of the features of dictatorships is that they take no notice of anyone.
We can say what we like, and they will act as they like.
The only way to counter a dictatorship is through democracy.
I would say to the Commissioner that, if I were in her place, I would make every effort to assist in training the thinking democratic elite.
If we do not succeed in doing so in Belarus, we might yet do so in other countries.
Someone needs to lead the way, and I would be inclined to rely on those elites.
(PL) Mr President, it is shameful for Belarus, a country that lies at the geographic heart of Europe, to be the subject of debate at the Council of Europe today because of its violation of human rights.
It is shameful for Belarus that it is the only European country excluded from the Council of Europe, because of its failure to respect any fundamental human rights.
I therefore believe that Mr Bielan was quite right when he said that it is important to strengthen civil society in Belarus by supporting the media broadcasts from Poland aimed at that society.
Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the continuing repression against young Belarusian democrats.
In mid-January, several of them were imprisoned for 15 days and then excluded from university.
There are some specific names: Zmitser Zhaleznichenka, Anton Kalinouski and Franak Viachorka.
I invite EU universities to offer these brave young people alternative options to continue their studies, to facilitate the provision of visas and to add to the EU blacklist the names of those university officials who have consented to use them as tools in the Lukashenko oppressions.
Mr President, I understand that the Free University of Minsk is today situated in Vilnius, Lithuania.
I wonder if Commissioner FigeÄŸ might consider writing a letter to the education and culture ministers of the 26 other EU Member States to suggest there should be 27 Free Universities of Minsk.
When it comes to the United Kingdom, there are of course great universities like Oxford and Cambridge, but I would recommend Bristol.
(DE) Mr President, twenty years ago, I spoke at the underground universities in Czechoslovakia and Poland.
It is very gratifying for me to hear, today, how much our colleagues from the Baltic countries, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland support the opposition in Belarus.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to them.
You are doing something important for the EU - more than the people who engage in talks which merely bolster and support a corrupt regime which needs to be abolished.
I agree with Mr Buzek: Russia has a responsibility here.
This is a post-colonial and pre-colonial situation and we should no longer accept it.
That concludes our new 'speedy catch-the-eye' procedure.
I see you have proved it is possible to say many things in a short space of time, and I thank you accordingly.
Now we move on to the Commission's reaction.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, recently, the situation in Belarus has been evolving rapidly.
Since mid-January, five of the six political prisoners previously identified as such have been released.
One of these political prisoners, though, former presidential candidate Aleksandr Kozulin, is still in jail and in a poor state of health.
The Commission, for its part, through my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, has expressed its satisfaction with the release of the prisoners, which has been a long-standing request from all EU institutions, including the European Parliament.
But we have equally been clear that we want to see all political prisoners freed, and that we want to see an end to the systematic harassment of Belarusian civil society, before we can give a new dimension to our relationship with Belarus.
In other words, our message to Belarus remains the same: there cannot be a full partnership with Belarus until Belarus takes convincing steps towards democratisation, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
This is the gist of the European message to Belarus that the Commission released over a year ago and which includes the '12 points for democratisation' that your resolution mentions.
Again, the release of all political prisoners would be an important step in this regard.
In addition, we will be closely watching the parliamentary elections set for September 2008.
The organisation of free and fair elections would be seen as a decisive step on the part of the Belarusian authorities.
We hope that the OSCE will be able to send a full-scale observation mission to this election and that the European Parliament will also be able to send representatives.
Another important point that your resolution demands is that Belarus should apply a moratorium on the death penalty.
The European Union has carried this message to the Belarusian authorities.
Coming back now to the recent developments in Belarus, another issue close to our hearts has been progressing fast over the last months: the opening of the European Commission's delegation in Minsk, which we officially requested more than two years ago, is now imminent.
We hope to be able to sign the establishment agreement soon, so that our delegation can be opened without delay.
This delegation will allow us to reinforce our links with Belarusian civil society and also to develop contacts with the middle rank of the administration that could be open to democratic change.
On this matter, as your resolution underlines, we have had a number of meetings at technical level with Belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest, such as energy, transport and environment.
Let me, however, reiterate that the scope of these meetings remains limited as long as the current political conditions prevail in Belarus.
As regards to the Commission actions to support civil society in Belarus, the Commission remains committed more than ever to supporting Belarusian civil society, and our 2008 assistance plan is aimed in particular at cementing Belarusian civil society and independent media.
In addition, the Commission has also made clear that its support to the European Humanity University in exile in Vilnius will continue as long as necessary.
I will also pass the message about the Free University on to Commissioner FigeÄŸ.
I think that this is very interesting and a bright idea.
A few other comments to Mr Pinior and Ms Schroedter.
The opening of the negotiations on visa facilitation and on readmission is amongst the elements that would be considered in the event of a real breakthrough in our relationship.
According to EU policy, visa facilitation can only be considered in the context of the European Commission readmission policy as part of a real partnership in external relations.
This was explained to Belarus in the verbal notes sent by the Commission on 8 May.
The European Union's willingness to enter into such negotiations with neighbouring countries with an action plan in force has also been reaffirmed, by the Commission communication on this matter of December 2006.
In the case of Belarus these conditions are not met.
On the point raised by Mr Bielan, Commission contracts are awarded following strict tendering procedures in order to ensure a transparent and fair competition.
This means that the Commission does not support radio and TV stations as such, but specific programmes instead.
The ENPI Regional Information and Communication Programme includes support to media activities of EUR 7 million over three years for seven countries.
The tendering procedure is ongoing, and media from both European Union and partner countries are eligible to submit tenders for contracts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) As joint author of the European Parliament's resolution on Belarus, I would like to draw attention to the state of democracy, respect for human rights and in general to the situation of the people of Belarus.
Belarus is not only a near neighbour of the Union, involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy, but it is also an immediate neighbour of my country, Poland.
We share a common border.
This is probably the best explanation of why the issue of fulfilling the real hopes and expectations of ordinary people in that country is so important to me in my work here in the European Parliament.
After all, one cannot remain indifferent to what one can see happening just across the border: restrictions and administrative pressure on NGOs, intimidation, persecution and imprisonment of democratic opposition activists, including leaders of the youth movements known as the Belarusian Popular Front and Young Front.
Genuine dialogue between the Belarusian authorities and the European Union should therefore be set up quickly.
It is not only the Union's right but also its duty to require the Belarusian Government to free all political prisoners, guarantee media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, and also respect for democratic values and the fundamental rights of the people of Belarus.
Priority must be given to abolition of the death penalty.
For its part, the European Parliament has moved towards making it easier for Belarusian citizens to enter EU territory and spend time there.
The reduction or even total lifting of visa charges is currently under consideration.
That is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming even more isolated.
3.
North-Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo)
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning North Kivu (Democratic Republic of the Congo).
author. - (NL) Mr President, this Parliament is rightly paying great attention to what is going on in the former Belgian colony of the Democratic Republic of Congo and in particular to the continued fighting, forcible displacement, rape and mass assassination in the east of that vast country.
These horrors have been part of the conflict in the neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
Internationally recognised state borders have little meaning for groups of people who must seek new territories as a result of being expelled or the continuing lack of means of existence.
Everything is in motion in this region, and the thing is that the slightest movement one way or the other potentially stirs up either violence or horror.
Warlords who acquire respect, power and wealth by their innate love of conflict increase the already existing problems and make them even more difficult to solve.
Very recently, on 17 January, we discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo here in this House and adopted a resolution that stated our wish to see all horrors cease.
I fear that we could adopt many more resolutions on this matter without any solutions coming of it.
The expectation that last year's elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo could solve the problems has ended in disappointment.
The incumbent president, Kabila, has won, but he represents different points of view from the movement from which he originated, and the outcomes of both the presidential and parliamentary elections were controversial for the opposition.
The question is, how is such a large country with poor lines of communication and a wide range of peoples to function in a way that is supported by its whole population and all its divergent political forces.
It does not seem that this is likely to succeed in an area like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where life-threatening diseases reign, the environment and the land are over-exploited, and people remain completely without rights.
The question is whether the armistice of 23 January for North and South Kivu, which takes for granted the disarmament of the warring factions and the return of refugees to their places of residence, is feasible, and whether the United Nations can contribute on the ground to this end.
It will not succeed by electing parties in the midst of conflict but possibly by persuading parties, the warring party for example, to abandon sexual violence and allow doctors in.
author. - (FR) Mr President, I do not intend to discuss the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo in its entirety, but rather the north-east of the country, and the Kivu region, where a vile war has been raging for years, and even more intensely in recent months.
You might say that all wars are vile, but I feel this one is much more so.
This war has produced, and continues to produce, hundreds of thousands of victims, deaths and displaced persons, but hundreds and thousands of women, little girls and grandmothers have also suffered what is now called sexual violence.
It is more than that, however; it is the use of rape as a genuine weapon of war, and this goes on amid a certain amount of indifference in public opinion and the international community, and more specifically European public opinion.
This vile war has been raging for two years between rival factions: the rebel troops led by Laurent Nkunda, a dissident Congolese general, the former perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda who were imported after the end of the campaign in 1994, but also, unfortunately, certain elements of the recently dismantled Congolese army.
That is enough.
Fortunately a peace conference was held there recently, attended by all the factions involved, and it led to a cease-fire.
Unfortunately, Mr President, the cease-fire is extremely fragile and tension is again mounting.
We therefore propose two essential priorities: the first concern is protection for civilians, to provide means for the MONUC mission on the ground to defend them. In accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter it can use weapons to carry out the mission, for these massacres simply must stop.
The second priority is to support the peace efforts discussed there, because the solution to the problem in the Great Lakes region would be a political solution involving all parties, including Rwanda, which must honour its commitments to repatriate its nationals operating in Kivu.
author, (PL) Mr President, since the end of the Second World War, no other conflict has been as cruel and barbaric as that in the Congo.
Armed conflict in North Kivu province has continued with variable intensity for the last 10 years.
It has resulted in more than five million victims.
Some 1 500 people are dying every day as a result of the fighting.
Mass killings, the rape of young girls and mothers, and forced conscription of civilians and children into the armed forces are the order of the day.
Many other serious violations of human rights have also taken place in recent months in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
They have been committed by the rebel groups loyal to Laurent Nkunda, by the fighters of the democratic forces attempting to liberate Rwanda, and by the Congolese army itself.
The eastern part of Congo is in need of immediate medical aid and food supplies, as recent events have forced most humanitarian organisations to suspend their activities.
I therefore call on the Council and the European Commission to make crisis funding available in view of the unusually grave humanitarian situation in this region.
author. - (DE) Mr President, anyone who has ever seen the Great Lakes region of East Africa from the air might think that it was paradise.
In reality, it is often more like hell on earth.
It is a region of fantastic natural beauty and a wealth of natural resources, on the one hand, and appalling suffering, on the other: natural disasters, war, expulsion, famine, disease, massacres, mass rape and ethnic conflicts - worse than almost anywhere else.
There are 800 000 internally displaced persons in North Kivu alone.
It is important to recognise that this problem of expulsion exists on both sides of the border.
In Africa, there is a phenomenon which does not exist in this form anywhere else, namely that people are not just displaced from one specific side of the border to the other.
Instead, each country expels people from its side of the border into the other country, so there are refugees and displaced persons on both sides.
As a result, the countries are completely unstable.
That is why we need to provide humanitarian aid, and we need a massive presence here in order to help the people.
In essence, however, that is merely tinkering with the symptoms.
Unless we can establish reasonably viable state and rule-of-law structures, the disaster will never end, no matter how much assistance we provide.
That is why it is extremely important for us to play a major role, also politically.
The cease-fire of 23 January is extremely fragile and only really exists on paper.
That is why we need to force all the parties, as a matter of urgency, to get round the table and talk to each other, but it also means that we have to play our part.
Regrettably, Europeans often profit from these disasters.
That is why the call for us to take certificates of origin more seriously, e.g. for natural resources, is justified, for often it is the Europeans who brutally exploit the people's suffering for their own economic interests.
We have a responsibility here too, and we should not be content with making pretty speeches and applying sticking plaster solutions.
author. - (ES) Mr President, we have a new episode today in this tragic serial set in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In this case the scene is North Kivu, but the plot and the victims are the same, as covered by an emergency resolution in the January part-session.
Almost five and a half million people have died in the war since 1998, and forty-five thousand more die every month, directly or indirectly due to the war.
The upshot of this is that one thousand five hundred people die every day: in other words, since we started this part-session on Monday, six thousand people have died already in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The last few months, moreover, particularly in the east of the country, have seen an increase in massacres, rape of little girls and women, and forced recruitment of girls and boys.
Both Laurent Nkunda's rebel troops and the soldiers fighting in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda are responsible for all this.
We also ought to remember that the MONUC mandate is based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, giving it the authority to use all necessary means to dissuade any attempt to use force that jeopardises the life or integrity of civilians or constitutes a threat to the political process.
To date, however, the MONUC presence has proved totally insufficient to bring an end to these barbaric acts.
We must therefore again appeal to the Security Council to react and provide all available means to curtail these massacres.
Moreover, although we must welcome the Goma Conference paving the way towards political negotiation, its agreements, especially agreements concerning demobilisation, remain ambiguous, and their application is unclear.
Lastly, this is another chance, as Mr Posselt has already said, to again call for control mechanisms to be activated and implemented such as the Kimberley Process for diamonds producing certificates of origin for natural resources imported by the EU.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Joseph Conrad referred to Congo as the heart of darkness.
From the beginning of its existence, that is to say from 1960 onwards, Congo has been the scene of horrific pogroms, killings and civil wars.
As a result, Congo has never been able to stand on its own two feet despite being endowed with abundant natural resources.
The conflict in the area is the most cruel and barbarous to have occurred since the end of the Second World War.
Sadly, it is still ongoing, claiming the lives of almost 50 000 human beings every month.
Half of the victims are children under the age of five.
The passage of the armies is accompanied by all kinds of crimes against the civilian population: rapes, looting and murder.
That is why we welcome the outcome of the Goma peace conference and have such high hopes of it.
It could mean the end of armed conflict in the Kivu region, but whether it does will depend partly on us too.
It may, however, prove impossible to resolve this conflict without support from the international community and neighbouring countries.
It is important for international support not to be limited to political declarations, but to focus first and foremost on providing appropriate financial, organisational and technical assistance.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, according to the aid agencies, the situation in North Kivu is in some respects even worse than in Darfur.
North Kivu is not in the spotlight, however, and no one in the international community is taking notice of what is happening there.
Since the official peace agreement in 2002, Kabila's government has attempted to integrate the regional militia into a national army, so far without much success.
The civilian population is still vulnerable to the impacts of the armed conflicts.
Doctors Without Borders/MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšres (MSF) highlights the difficulties facing relief workers in gaining access to the civilian population due to the continued fighting and says that malnutrition is another major threat to the population in North Kivu.
We therefore urge the Council and the Commission to provide aid immediately and to launch comprehensive medical assistance programmes for the civilian population in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo without delay.
We also urge the Council and the Commission to ensure that the recent strengthening of the UN mission leads to substantial improvements in the security of the population.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the agreement reached in Goma on improving security and development in Congo, human rights are still being violated in Kivu province.
Three hundred thousand individuals have been forced to leave their homes due to rising violence since the end of 2006 alone.
The violence affects women and children in particular.
They become the victims of rape or are forced to join armed groups.
To date, six million individuals have been displaced, and five million have died as a result of conflict and war fuelled by economic interest groups and supported by governments eager to benefit from the riches available there.
That is why what is needed is more than debates and resolutions in the European Parliament and humanitarian assistance to the inhabitants of Congo.
The predatory exploitation of natural resources has to be stopped, together with the speculative activities of international businesses that are enriching themselves at the expense of the life and health of the region's inhabitants.
. - (NL) Mr President, we know that our words here will probably not get us much further forward.
We can only hope that all parties will permanently adhere to the agreement made at the Goma Conference and that the madness which has already gripped North Kivu for too long can come to an end.
According to the UN, since the start of the conflict 800 000 people have fled their homes.
Thousands and thousands of women and young girls have become the victims of vicious rapes, and children are forced to take part in the fighting.
Furthermore, we must not forget that the members of the Nkunda militia are not the only ones responsible for massive cruelties.
No, all parties, including the government soldiers, have systematically committed crimes against humanity.
There are not many 'good guys' in North Kivu.
Ultimately, therefore, the same number of culprits must be tried.
They must answer for their atrocities.
It is not only the responsibility of the International Court of Human Rights to pass judgment, it is primarily the responsibility of the Congolese leaders and of Joseph Kabila.
(PL) Mr President, as Mr Posselt has stated, large areas of the Congo are hell on earth.
This has been exacerbated by certain entities not all of which are Congolese.
I wish to draw attention to a situation I have seen for myself, namely the high numbers of children orphaned in the area as a result of the conflict.
In my view the funding should go to missionaries to enable them to care for those children, especially the boys, so that they are not conscripted into the armies.
Once the boys are conscripted they become incapable of anything except shooting and raping.
Allow me to reiterate, Commissioner, that funds are needed to teach and care for those unfortunate individuals.
(CS) Commissioner, I appeal to the Commission here in Strasbourg to release funds reserved for crisis situations now and to start immediately reconstruction projects, notably with a wide-ranging programme of general medical support for civilians in North-Kivu.
The recent earthquake just worsened what already was a humanitarian disaster.
All of us here also ask the Commission and the Council to initiate immediately an Africa-wide coalition to find a political solution to the conflict.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission remains very concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in the Kivus, and North Kivu in particular, where the number of internally displaced people - currently exceeding 800 000 in North Kivu alone - has as much as doubled in the course of 2007, thus alarmingly increasing the vulnerability of the population already suffering hardship.
At the same time, we are aware of, and condemn, the severe human rights abuses - including recruitment of child soldiers and widespread sexual violence - taking place in the region.
Yet, in this context, it is important to remember that today's critical situation in North Kivu, while exacerbated by the fighting taking place in the second half of 2007, is a result of years of war in the region.
The root causes of the Kivu conflict can be traced all the way to the Rwandan genocide at the beginning of the 1990s, while also bearing in mind that there are several local components - such as insufficient political representation of ethnic minorities, pillaging of natural resources and land tenure issues - that significantly contribute to the instability and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
That is why the Commission welcomes the recent Goma Peace Conference and the following cease-fire as positive steps towards solving the enduring conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Conference restored President Kabila's credibility after the army's defeat against General Nkunda's troops at the end of 2007, and launched an inter-provincial dialogue process - something that the Commission has always advocated.
Moreover, along the lines of the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in their Nairobi Joint CommuniquÃ© in November 2007, the Goma Conference also re-emphasised the need to tackle the problem of the ex-FAR as a priority.
At the same time, it was made clear that there is a need to address the root causes of the conflict, while restoring the State authority in the east.
That said, it should not be forgotten that nothing was definitively solved at Goma or Nairobi.
Finding a permanent solution to the root causes of the Kivu crisis, and thus a sustainable restoration of peace in the region, will take time.
Indeed, while complementing each other, the Nairobi Joint CommuniquÃ© and the Goma Conference represent an encouraging start - but only a start - of a difficult and lengthy process.
The main challenge ahead is now an effective implementation of the Nairobi and Goma commitments.
It ought to be assured that all the concerned stakeholders stand by their commitments.
The EU will continue to follow closely and participate actively in this process.
In this context, international action in support of the Congolese is very much needed.
The Commission, together with the Member States, is ready to continue to play an important role in the Kivus.
We have traditionally been one of the most important donors in the east, via our humanitarian assistance and our rehabilitation and capacity-building programmes.
We are willing to further increase our support for the region, especially through European initiatives, as well as in close collaboration with the United Nations.
The debate is closed.

Mr President, I rise on behalf of my group with an oral amendment to the proposed amendment.
While freedom of expression is laid down in the Commission's non-paper, the internet is sadly not particularly included or singled out.
Therefore, to be factually correct and to include all freedoms of expression, not just on the internet, we ask that the phrase 'on the internet' be removed from the amendment.

Statement by the President
For the first time, the past week has seen the death of a soldier on an EU operation under the European security and defence policy.
Sergeant Gilles Polin, a French member of the European Union Force (EUFOR), was killed on active duty after he had inadvertently crossed the border between Chad and Sudan in his all-terrain vehicle.
Another French soldier was wounded in the same incident.
Together with the Sudanese authorities, EUFOR is now investigating how such a tragedy could have occurred.
I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the late sergeant's family and to all his relations.
May I remind the House that the purpose of the EU operation in Chad and the Central African Republic is to protect the refugee camps that have been established in the areas adjoining these countries' borders with Sudan as a consequence of the conflict in Darfur.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 6 March 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No amendments.
Tuesday:
(DE) Mr President, I rise to make the following request: on Tuesday afternoon there is to be a discussion on the Lamfalussy process.
I have heard that Mr McCreevy will be unable to attend. We must accept that.
The Commission is a collegial body, and any Commissioner can stand in for any other.
I have a high regard for Mrs Fischer Boel as a Commissioner, but would it not be possible in this case to ask Mr Almunia, who is more familiar with the material, to represent the Commission?
Mr President, I believe you have had word that Commissioner Frattini will no longer perform his function as a Commissioner with effect from 14 March.
We observe a certain disparity between the Frattini case and that of Louis Michel, who ceased to perform the duties of his office from the day on which he became an election candidate.
Perhaps, Mr President, you can ask the Commission to inform us why this distinction has been made and to explain why in one case the Commissioner in question ceased to perform his duties on the day he became a candidate, whereas in another case the Commissioner will not relinquish his duties until about a week after his nomination.
That is the request I make on behalf of my group.
I believe there are no objections to the first request, namely that Commissioner Almunia present the Commission's views in that debate.
As for the second request, we shall look into that.
Wednesday:
No amendments.
Thursday:
We have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights.
The PPE-DE Group has moved that the second item, on Afghanistan, be replaced by a new item entitled 'Arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia'.
(DE) Mr President, this is not an item about the Russian elections themselves but about the fact that, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian elections, demonstrations were broken up by OMON security forces and 50 people were arrested, most of whom are still in custody.
That was a brutal act of aggression, and we take the view that it demands an instant reaction from this Parliament.
(DE) Mr President, we discussed this at last Thursday's meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I do not believe it serves any purpose to discuss this matter now in isolation.
In the not-too-distant future, in the run-up to the EU-Russia summit, we shall have the opportunity to debate the overall state of relations between the EU and Russia.
This item could be incorporated into that debate.
Accordingly, we have recommended that, instead of consigning it to Thursday afternoon, when only 25 Members are present, we should deal with it as part of the major debate that we already intend to hold.
The delegation from our Parliament is due to visit Russia in a few days' time.
We should await their return and listen to what they have to report.
(Parliament approved the request.)
(FR) Mr President, what has just happened and has made some of my fellow Members laugh is very serious.
Mr Daul, we are talking about a young man of 23, sentenced to death for downloading an article on the rights of women in Islam, in a country that has close ties with the European Union, where our soldiers are defending Afghanistan, with a new constitution that, officially, defends fundamental rights and freedom of expression.
With one voice you have just taken on a responsibility that I hope you will not come sorely to regret.
(Applause)
Let me make the following proposal, Mr Wurtz: I have already written to the President of Afghanistan about this matter, and if you are all in agreement, I shall take the initiative again, not just in my own name but on behalf of the whole House.
May I assume that this is what everyone wants?
In that case, we shall not immerse ourselves any further in this matter, Mr Cohn-Bendit, and I shall launch another initiative on behalf of you all.
I would really like to avoid a debate.
If Mr Schulz wishes to speak, Mr Cohn-Bendit is entitled to address us first.
Does Mr Cohn-Bendit wish to speak?
That is the proper procedure, but I shall not give anyone preferential treatment.
Mr Cohn-Bendit does not wish to make a statement.
What about Mr Schulz?
(DE) Mr President, I do not intend to make a statement.
I should just like to say that I fully share the views expressed by Francis Wurtz.
The decision we took in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday was based in part on the point he has just made.
May I now ask you to let us avail ourselves of the possibility of adding this item to Thursday's agenda?
We now have other matters that we can put on the agenda.
Since I just made an exception for Mr Schulz, I must let Mr Posselt speak again, but please do not let this discussion drag on any further.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Schulz and Mr Wurtz have said.
Our purpose was not to prevent the House from addressing another issue but to put Russia on the agenda.
I would appeal to the chairs of the two main political groups to let us return to the old arrangement whereby we could deal with up to five topics.
The restriction to three items was a mistake, and that is the source of these difficulties.
I must inform those Members who do not yet know about the other requests for inclusion in the agenda that the ALDE and GUE Groups have tabled a joint request for the inclusion of a new item dealing with the case of the Iranian Mehdi Kazemi. I believe that is also a very urgent matter.
In addition, the PPE-DE Group has also requested that the case of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho be placed on the agenda.
I must brief you on the subject of formal requests.
We can now vote again on whether to put the case of the Afghan on the agenda, but if that request were approved, it would definitely rule out a vote on the other two topics.
I have to make you aware of that.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Schulz requested that this topic be added to the agenda as an extra item.
If that is not possible, I regret to say we shall have to vote against it.
We would like to put the Iraqi bishop on the agenda as well as supporting Mr Schulz's request.
That, after all, is what he himself was proposing.
We already have two items on the agenda.
A third item may be added.
It can be this one, but it could also be either of the two others that have been requested.
We have agreed on two items, and three more requests are on the table.
Under our Rules of Procedure, we can only put three items on our agenda, which means that we have to choose between the case in Afghanistan, the Iranian case and the Archbishop.
We are bound by that rule.
This is why I asked you whether you were in agreement with the procedure of voting first on the Afghan case.
If that request is approved by a majority, the other two will lapse.
I have to inform you properly of the procedural consequences.
Mr President, I do not see the logic in taking one of them before any of the others, because they are all different; they are all cases which have great merits on their own.
My group, together with the GUE/NGL Group, has proposed that we have a debate on the Iranian homosexual in mortal danger, and I would like to find a way of dealing with this.
I fear that this is what happens when groups do not coordinate and start acting out of order.
We made a clear decision on Russia at the Conference of Presidents last week.
If the cooperation - and there is a lot of it between the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group - cannot manage this in such a way that we do not end up in this mess, then I think the two groups ought to be looking at it.
I think you have got to find a fair way, Mr President, of dealing with these three together.
It is indeed a difficult business, because we can only have three items.
It would also be possible, however, to regard the Afghan and Iranian cases as a single issue of 'individuals facing the threat of death'.
This would leave only one case uncovered, namely that of the Archbishop, which could be addressed in another item.
That, I believe, would certainly be a reasonable approach.
(DE) Mr President, we shall make an exception and support that proposal.
Let me also say to Mr Posselt that his group's request explicitly stated 'instead of Afghanistan'.
Rather than trying to talk one's way out of a tight corner at this stage, it would be better to consider the implications of requests before tabling them, but in this case, Mr President, we can support your compromise.
I do not see any contradiction there, and in the matter of the Archbishop we can choose a procedure through the President of Parliament which also devotes due attention to his cause without our making it an item in the topical and urgent debate.
(Parliament approved the President's proposal.)
(The order of business was thus established.)
Situation in Gaza
The next item is the President's statement on the situation in Gaza.
The chairs of the political groups will outline their respective positions on this issue.
They have, however, asked me to make a statement too, and I have gladly acceded to their request.
In view of the escalation in the Middle East, there was an urgent need to put the current situation on the agenda once more.
We Europeans are again asking ourselves what we can do, how we are to react to the spiral of violence that is causing the Middle East to flare up once again before our eyes.
To come straight to the point, the only response is the resolute pursuit and emphatic fast-tracking of the peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The peace process launched in Annapolis must not be destroyed by violence and terrorism.
As Members of the European Parliament, we must do everything in our power to prevent that.
The television images of victims of the conflict that reach us daily are harrowing.
If we were moved to sympathy and outrage a week ago by the sight of the innocent Palestinian civilians, including many children, who lost their lives in Gaza because of the disproportionate use of military force, since last Thursday's appalling murderous attack on a school in Jerusalem we have been sharing the sadness and anger of the Israeli population.
Sympathy is a noble virtue in politics too, but sympathy is not enough.
Sympathy is no substitute for political action.
Viable political solutions must be found rationally on the basis of clear principles.
The protection of human life and respect for international law are embodiments of such principles, and they must therefore be our benchmarks.
On behalf of the European Parliament I strongly condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists.
On behalf of the European Parliament I ask the Government of Israel to listen to the voices both within the country itself and beyond its borders that are calling on it to match its rhetoric with actions designed to promote peace.
The Gaza Strip has become the running sore of the Middle East.
To some people it is a thorn in the flesh, because extremists are in political control there.
Many would like to turn their backs on it, to detach the Gaza Strip from the rest of the world and pretend it did not exist.
Behind the walls that already exist there and those that are currently being built along the Egyptian border live people - men, women and children who have the right to decent living conditions - and people do not tolerate walls and divisions for ever.
People are afraid.
We sympathise deeply with the population of places like Sderot and Ashkelon who live in daily fear of new mortar attacks.
We take Israel's security very seriously, and we shall always defend it.
The European Parliament and I myself, during my visit at the end of May 2007 to Israel and the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, have repeated that message countless times.
Mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip must stop.
That kind of resistance is terrorism, and it is non-negotiable as far as we are concerned.
Yet while people's emotions are being ruled by fear, death is final, and no one can bring back the hundreds of people whose lives have been sacrificed to Israel's security needs since the Gaza Strip was sealed off.
We must question the proportionality and the expedience of this approach.
We must also ask whether it is consistent with international law that the population of any territory should suffer for the extremism of their leaders.
Providing the population of Gaza with minimal humanitarian aid and otherwise ignoring them cannot be a durable and viable solution.
The European Union is helping to alleviate distress with its humanitarian assistance, but its priority must now be to make a greater long-term political investment so that its financial generosity is channelled in the most strategically desirable direction.
At the donors' conference in Paris last December, where the European Parliament was also represented, the European Union pledged EUR 540 million for 2008 to support the process launched in Annapolis.
The new Pegase funding mechanism is already operating.
The European Parliament wants the European Union to lend vigorous support and assistance to the peace process.
As the budgetary authority, however, we must ensure that our financial commitment does not miss its target.
All parties will have to realise that the European Union cannot have military actions destroying the fruits of our financial solidarity.
It is the will of the European Parliament to work hard, as an honest broker, for a solution to the Middle East conflict.
Our new working group on the Middle East intends to contribute to the pursuit of that goal.
In two weeks' time, together with the follow-up group of the Paris donors' conference, comprising the French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr StÃžre, Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Tony Blair, Special Envoy of the Middle East Quartet, we shall be discussing progress in the actual delivery of our aid.
If the European Union is to act as an honest broker, even-handedness is imperative.
However, if we focus on the constant diplomatic struggle to describe the escalation in Israel and Gaza in an even-handed manner, we are liable to forget that people, not words, are meant to be at the heart of our policies.
What is termed the Annapolis Process must not be used as a smokescreen behind which the settlement policy remains in place and the Palestinian territories continue to be sealed off with countless security zones that restrict people's freedom of movement.
The situation of the Palestinian population cannot improve unless people can move freely in Gaza and the West Bank.
Without freedom of movement, the establishment of a stable Palestinian state is inconceivable.
Security has more than just a military dimension.
Security cannot be achieved unless people in Israel and Palestine acknowledge and respect each other.
Security begins with reconciliation.
The time has come to sow the seeds of lasting reconciliation between Palestinians too.
Hamas must alter its position and work alongside moderate Palestinians to build peace.
Once again I declare our support for President Mahmud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
One of the keys to success is an arrangement on the crossing points along the border of the Gaza Strip, with high priority attaching to a rapid solution for cross-border traffic at the Karni and Rafah crossings.
This is an area where the European Union bears special responsibility too.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us do everything in our power to back up our financial commitment with consistent political action so that we can contribute to peace in the Middle East and, above all, give our support to the people of the Middle East.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, a few months ago, in Annapolis, the Israelis and the Palestinians had a dream: a dream of two nations, each living securely in its own State with internationally recognised borders, after decades of conflict, grieving families and tragedy.
At the Paris conference a few months ago, the international community was willing to back that dream and enable it to become a reality.
Europe, the main international donor, believes in that peaceful and secure future and is making every possible effort, within the Quartet, to help the two parties break the vicious circle of violence and lack of understanding.
However, in just a few days the disproportionate use of force and armed provocation killed dozens of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and several Israeli soldiers in violent confrontations.
Only last Thursday, a Palestinian killed eight students at a prominent religious school and was himself killed.
The bullets of fanatics and individuals motivated by revenge, intolerance and rejection of others have made it even more difficult to seek dialogue, compromise and peace.
The international community and we in Europe cannot and should not set ourselves up as judges of either side.
Our task is to make the Annapolis signatories see reason, in other words bring them to the negotiating table.
The PPE-DE delegation to Jerusalem and Ramallah that I led a few weeks ago taught me three lessons.
The first is the expectation of Europe in the Middle East: not just of a Europe that supports the peace process financially, although that is essential, but of a Europe that makes its presence felt much more and is stronger politically.
We have to take more action and act more effectively.
The second lesson is that we need to encourage moderate parties in Israel and Palestine and give them our political support.
The risky path that these parties have chosen, the path of peace, dialogue and responsibility to their peoples, is often not to their advantage electorally.
It is those parties and moderate figures that we have to encourage as much as possible, because they and only they hold the keys to a peaceful and sustainable solution in the region.
The third point is that Europe has to make both sides realise that they will never be able to escape this vicious circle of security, defence and violence by building walls, killing people with rockets, humiliating the other side.
No, it is only if their neighbours, especially young people, are allowed to build a future, realise their ambitions, develop in their own land, that a virtuous circle can be formed and produce results.
Together with my group, I welcome the recent call by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders for further dialogue, following the Annapolis roadmap.
Europe has to step up its political support.
I stress, its political support for the moderate groups in power.
That is the only way out and yesterday, during the church service, we heard a Palestinian and a Jewish representative call for the same thing, peace for their peoples.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the analysis of the situation is concerned, I really have nothing to add to your remarks and those of Joseph Daul.
We all agree on what is needed, and we are all familiar with the present situation.
There is therefore no need for me to recapitulate the list of requirements from the perspective of the European Union or to repeat anything about the role of the EU itself.
I must stress, however, that we cannot stay silent when things we construct with resources provided by the European Union are then senselessly destroyed within a short time.
That has all been said.
For this reason I will look at what we in the Socialist Group have to say in this debate at the current time and pick out the following thought for us to ponder: if the principle of renouncing violence cannot be established as a priority, there will be no solution for Gaza and no end to the spiral of violence that has plagued the Middle East for decades.
This is why it has to be said quite categorically that the renunciation of violence - the announcement by both sides of their intention to refrain from any further use of force and to focus all their efforts on the achievement of a negotiated settlement - is not an invention of this House but underlies repeated attempts over the last few decades - and Annapolis was essentially nothing more than a fresh attempt - to bring about dialogue without violence.
Why do these attempts keep failing?
The reasons are obvious, and they must be spelled out.
They fail because there are people on both sides with an interest in continuing the struggle or preaching violence.
On the one side, particularly in terrorist circles, there are those who propagate denial of Israel's right to exist and therefore advocate the use of violence as a matter of principle, while on the other side, in the democratic structures of the State of Israel, whenever an Israeli Government is prepared to negotiate in search of peaceful solutions, the whole process is held hostage by parliamentary tacticians.
This, of course, is precisely what we are experiencing once again.
In Annapolis, the Prime Minister says he wants to negotiate, and Members of the Knesset and ministers from his own government restrict his negotiating mandate for reasons of party-political tactics that all of us will recognise.
The fate of the people in Gaza and the pointless blockade that has brought chaos and misery to that territory are the result of the view espoused by Hamas, which seized power illegally, that violence is the only answer.
This point has to be clearly highlighted, as has the observation that the powers they have usurped are not being used to dissuade radicals in their own ranks from resorting to violence.
That, in fact, is at the root of the suffering endured by the civilian population of the Gaza Strip.
Just as firmly rooted is the fact that those on the Israeli side who seek to sabotage every small step forward because they are pursuing their own agenda succeed repeatedly in undermining even the most minimal progress by means of provocation.
I cannot arrive at any other explanation for occurrences such as the announcement of the continuing construction of settlements.
Who are the ultimate losers?
Women, children, defenceless people, especially in the Gaza Strip, but also, of course, Israelis living close to the border.
To sum up what we have been experiencing, let me say that the radicals need this conflict to justify their existence.
That has been a fact of life for decades, and this chronic condition is prevalent on both sides.
We must say to these radicals on either side that they can never achieve their goal.
They may perpetuate violence, but they will never achieve their political objectives, because political objectives are never achieved by violence.
Perhaps, then, the crucial task for us Europeans is to take to heart some words spoken by an Israeli, namely Yitzhak Rabin. In 1995, he made one of the wisest statements I have encountered: 'We shall fight terrorism as if there is no peace process and pursue the peace process as if there is no terrorism'.
That is the message to both sides.
Without such a message there will be no peace.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the situation in Gaza is, first and foremost, a humanitarian disaster.
No amount of condemnation of any party to the conflict will solve that.
Gaza has been besieged since June of last year.
One and a half million people are trapped with hopelessly insufficient provision of water, electricity, fuel and sewage disposal.
Two years ago, three out of every five Gazans depended on UN assistance; it is now four out of every five.
Businesses are bankrupt, jobs are almost impossible to find and the situation is worse than at any point since the Israeli annexation of the territory in 1967.
The Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, has been held prisoner since June 2006, and I believe some 11 000 Palestinians languish in Israeli jails.
The major condemnation of the European Union in all of this is that we have followed blindly the strategy of the Americans.
Marc Otte, the European Union's Special Representative, speaking to our Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council recently, said that, on strategy, the European Union follows the USA.
The most obvious result of this is that Palestinian infrastructure, funded by the European taxpayer, is being regularly destroyed by the Israeli army using American weapons.
Should we be committing European money in this way, in these circumstances?
If ever there was a need for a common foreign and security policy for the European Union, surely this is it!
My group welcomes the informal truce reached at lunchtime today.
We wish Egypt success in its mediation talks, but we are convinced that the cycle of violence, which most recently led to 56 deaths in Gaza on 1 March 2008 and eight deaths in Jerusalem on Saturday, cannot be broken by violence.
For peace to succeed, we need dialogue.
Annapolis promised peace within 10 months, but many of us believe that, once again, Israel is trying to de-legitimise every interlocutor.
Hamas continues to be cynical with its policy of rocket attacks, knowing that the response will be disproportionate.
We condemn violence from all sides.
Yes, Israel has a right to defend itself against indiscriminate attacks on civilians, but it has a duty as a democracy to be more just than its disposable power implies.
We seem to be getting further away from a two-state solution - whether it is the rocket attacks on Ashkelon or whether it is the 530 new settler homes just announced in Givat Ze'ev, near Ramallah.
The policy of the West has been based on three assumptions: number one, you cannot possibly talk to Hamas; number two, Israel is the only democracy in the region and must be treated as a normal democracy and, number three, Mr Abbas is the voice of the reasonable Palestinians.
Many in my group question those three assumptions and believe that our policy needs to be looked at again urgently to find a situation where those communities can live together.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, like my colleagues, I agree with most that has been said by Mr Daul, Mr Schulz and Mr Watson before me.
The reality of what we are looking at - apart from the geopolitical nature of the conflict or even the historical nature of the conflict - is that, every day, innocent human lives are being lost.
Every single day, families lose their members.
Every single day, one person dies or is injured.
We go further and deeper into driving the forces of moderation further apart.
We should not get into the blame game; we can all go back over what happened in Gaza over the last months, with the cynical exploitation by the Israeli authorities, cutting off water, power and food supplies to people, literally attempting to starve them into submission.
But this is not just over the recent past; this is something that has taken place over many decades.
Likewise, the equally cynical reaction of Hamas by launching rockets into areas and by the brutal killing of eight people in a school.
But, even though we can go on and condemn continuously the actions of the extremists on both sides, whether they are the official terrorists or the state terrorists or the state-sponsored terrorists, it does not get away from the ultimate fact that what is required is dialogue; what is required is understanding; what is required more than anything else is respect for all human life.
A respect of the value of one single person's life. Only then can we truly find a way towards bringing peoples together.
Because all of us speak about a two-state solution, but a two-state solution that is predicated on two viable states, not a patchwork of little bits in between everything else, but two viable states.
Likewise, when those two viable states are recognised, when their leaders are recognised, for negotiation and for discussion.
Through that dialogue with this, hopefully, another first step towards peace in the region with the ceasefire which has now been called, with the talks to get under way between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert and also with our desire to give whatever assistance we can.
I do not blame Europe for giving assistance to build roads, and water and energy plants, to build schools and health centres for Palestinian people who were thrown to the four winds when they were displaced from their own lands.
We all have a responsibility to ensure all of our fellow men are cared for and look after.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in two minutes I cannot draft the peace plan, but I can make one or two points.
It is time we reviewed our vocabulary, for it is not dialogue we need but negotiations.
This term 'dialogue' tells us nothing.
War is being waged there, and it takes negotiation to end wars.
That is the point.
And how does one negotiate?
Graham Watson is right: if the European Union pursues a strategy of its own - and not the US strategy - it must do the following: firstly, it must negotiate with those who hold power in Gaza - and that means Hamas - so that they do what they have always said they would, namely organise a ceasefire.
Then the other side will arrange for humanitarian aid to be taken to Gaza.
That is called negotiation - you give something, and we shall give something.
Secondly, we must say tell the Israelis that, if they want to negotiate with the Palestinians, there is one thing they must do, namely put an immediate stop to any settlement-building and do so visibly, otherwise they will receive no more assistance from the European Union.
That is what I call negotiation.
I am in a position of power and try to exploit it.
Otherwise the whole business is pointless.
I believe in this dialogue, and we shall pursue it.
I believe in playing politics, in simply telling my interlocutor that things cannot go on like this.
Israel's colonial policy is endangering the State of Israel.
We must say that to the Israelis.
And we must tell the Palestinians that the latest attack has endangered the Palestinians and that the attacks must stop.
Once the European Union finally makes the transition from dialogue to political negotiation, which includes exploiting positions of power, there will be a chance of progress in the region.
In short, dialogue can wait - the political cards must be played first.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, thank you for your statement.
We had only just decided on this formal initiative after 110 Palestinians were killed in bomb attacks on Gaza when eight more victims, this time Israelis, were killed in Jerusalem.
On each occasion we all condemned those crimes, but I agree with the earlier speaker that everyone can see that more is needed if we are to have any hope of breaking this vicious circle for good.
The Union needs to be courageous enough not just to condemn all the crimes committed by both sides, but to point to the main cause of all the problems, the occupation, with its grim succession of cruelties and humiliations, never-ending sources of hatred, despair and thirst for revenge.
There is thus no justification for continuing the occupation.
That must be stated plainly and the appropriate conclusions drawn.
A prominent Israeli peace campaigner, our friend Nurit Peled, winner of the Sakharov Prize, made that clear when she lost her child in an attack by a Palestinian.
Speaking to the then Prime Minister, Mr Netanyahu, she said, 'You killed my daughter'.
That 'you' referred not just to an individual but to a policy that his successors had followed and intensified.
Now it is called 'the Gaza blockade', and it even goes so far as to deprive the civilian population of food and healthcare.
It is also referred to more generally as 'the sealing off of towns and villages on the West Bank', 'incursions and bombings', 'targeted assassinations and mass arrests', which include children, 'further colonisation and building of the wall', 'annexation and policy of the fait accompli in Jerusalem', etc. It is prolonging the war to treat these crimes as relative and allow their perpetrators impunity.
If we are to reach out to the forces of peace on both sides, we must dare to tell the truth.
We must call upon the Union to take this decisive step at last.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) It is the prime duty of any state to guarantee the safety of its people, and that is entirely consistent with international law.
It explains and gives legitimacy to Israel's response to the increasing number of missiles raining down on it from the Gaza Strip.
This Palestinian rocket fire has been going on, moreover, since 2001.
And it increased enormously after the Israelis withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
Since then the number of Palestinian rocket attacks on the Jewish state has risen by a good 500%.
Prior to 2006 it was rare for there to be more than 50 rocket attacks on Israeli territory each month.
By early 2008 the number was 50 a day!
It means that more than 250 000 Israeli citizens are now exposed daily to Palestinian rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.
The accusation that Israel is using disproportionate force in response to this deadly threat conveniently overlooks the brutal tactic used by Hamas and other Palestinian terror organisations of launching their rocket attacks from bases in residential areas.
At the end of February the Dutch media reported on this at length under the telling headline - the words of a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip - 'Please, no rockets on Israel from here'.
And it should be said that Israel follows strict legal standards in its military procedures.
An example, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, which the Arab world would do well to emulate.
In the meantime Hamas, the leading power factor in Gaza, is able, as a member of the 'axis of destabilisation' in the region, to count on substantial support from Iran, Syria and Hezbollah.
An unnamed Hamas commander made this abundantly clear only yesterday to the Sunday Times.
If Iran can smuggle its Fajr rockets into Gaza, Hamas may even be in a position to threaten Tel Aviv.
Do the European institutions share this Israeli concern and if so, what is Europe's strategy vis-Ã -vis this axis of destabilisation?
That is the issue, if there is to be stability in the Middle East and any prospect of peace.
Mr President, I can readily join in deploring the recent events in Gaza and the Middle East and in remarking on how terrible is the humanitarian tragedy there and the immense suffering that all sides are being subjected to.
But I have to draw a distinction between the orchestrated, constant, repeated attacks upon the State of Israel and the right of that State to defend itself. It is an internationally recognised state.
It recognises and accepts a two-state solution in the Middle East, and yet it is constantly, persistently and viciously subjected to the most horrendous violence from across its borders, particularly from Hamas-controlled territory.
I therefore make no apology, from my perspective, of saying that Israel does have the right, indeed the necessity, to defend itself and to act against those who, beyond reason and argument, will not even make the most basic concession of accepting the right of Israel to exist.
We hear much talk in this debate and elsewhere about a balanced and even-handed approach.
There is nothing even-handed in equating, no matter how justified they are, the political demands of Gaza with the vicious and repeated terrorist attacks on Israel as epitomised by the attack on the school.
There is nothing even-handed in equivocating over Hamas's refusal to recognise Israel and then demanding that no walls, no defensive action should be taken by the state that is not even recognised.
It is a consequence of that failure to recognise the right of Israel to exist which has bred so much of the trouble and turmoil in the Middle East.
The item is closed.
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues.
- (EL) Madam President, as you know, the talks in recent weeks between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, about the name to be used by the latter in its relations with all international organisations, have reached a sensitive stage.
Discussions are taking place within the framework of UN decisions.
During his recent visit to Skopje on 27 February, the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, referred to Greece's declared intent to place a veto on that country's NATO accession prospects if the issue of the name is not settled first.
He made comments which strike an odd note for anyone upholding European principles and values.
He even said that he did not favour the veto.
In view of the fact that Greece has been an active, fully-fledged member of the EU for 27 years, we request that Mr Solana refrain from comments that hinder the negotiation process between a Member State and a country wishing to join NATO and the EU.
We urge him to bear in mind that he represents the EU Member States, and call on him to respect their sensitivities and contribute towards resolving the issues, showing the Community solidarity that is expected of him and is his duty in view of the office he holds.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(CS) I just want to say that I am very alarmed by the attitude of some European Union politicians and Members of this Parliament towards the Czech Government's negotiations with the US regarding the visa waiver programme.
Although our government has not breached a single provision of the Treaties, it has become an object of criticism, moralising and lecturing. This is spite of the fact that the negotiations took place with a country that has traditionally been a friend and ally of European democracies, not an enemy or a suspect state.
Some critical comments are difficult to explain to Czech citizens who have been waiting for the United States visa waiver programme for years.
Those who wish to discredit the image of the European Union in the eyes of the Czech public are free to carry on with their insensitive actions.
We should all try not to bring up useless negative emotions in this case because there are no grounds for suspicion and the security of the European Union is not at risk.
Madam President, Parma is famous for its ham and the Champagne region for its champagne, but I wonder how many colleagues here realise that Yorkshire is famous for its rhubarb.
The Yorkshire rhubarb growers have applied to the European Commission to grant it protected designation of origin status, and I would urge the Commission to accede to this request.
Nearly 90% of Europe's indoor-grown rhubarb was, until recently, produced in Yorkshire; that figure may have declined, but the quality has certainly not declined.
The special climate of Yorkshire and the special techniques developed by generations of growers have ensured the special quality of this rhubarb, which is grown when the roots are transferred to dark sheds and the darkness means that the stalks grow up seeking light and produce a very special quality which many top chefs and the finest restaurants recognise as being an exceptional delicacy.
I urge the Commission to grant them this status.
(RO) Technical progress in the medical industry, as well as the progress made by medical schools now make it possible to achieve certain levels of performances in the treatment of patients which seemed unachievable in the past.
Unfortunately, there are still many cases when medical malpractice, which could have been avoided, endangers patients' lives.
Malpractice still represents a reality in many European Union countries.
This phenomenon occurs mainly in many of the countries that have recently joined the European Union.
Responsibility for the organisation of health services lies with the Member States, and each of the European Union countries has its own legislation on malpractice.
Nevertheless, given that consumer protection and patient rights are important objectives of the European Union, I believe that we need an approach at European level, with respect to the provision of information to patients, as well as with respect to the legislation on malpractice within the European Union space.
(PL) Madam President, Written Declaration No 88/2007 on investigating the abuse of power by large supermarkets was signed by 439 Members and officially adopted by the European Parliament.
In May 2007 the Polish Parliament passed an act on the creation and operation of supermarkets that meets the demands expressed in the Declaration. In particular, the act requires local authorities on whose territory supermarkets are to be located to ensure that a balance is maintained between the various forms of trade and that the principle of fair competition in the pursuit of commercial activities is respected.
The European Commission has called these measures into question and is demanding that the Polish Government change them or face referral of the matter to the Court of Justice.
I would like you, Madam President, to draw the European Commission's attention to the flagrant contradiction between Parliament's expectations and the Commission's action in this matter.
(DE) Madam President, the presidential election took place a week ago in Russia, and the result was as disappointing as we might have expected.
Dmitry Medvedev won, and the losers were democracy and human rights.
Three days before the election, I had a meeting with representatives of human-rights organisations in Moscow. They reported flagrant obstruction of the opposition during the electoral campaign and harassment of independent journalists and human-rights activists.
Moreover, suspicions of electoral fraud cannot be dispelled.
The EU should now send a very clear signal that it does not accept this conduct.
Relations between the EU and Russia should be placed on a more honest footing.
The same applies to relations with China, particularly as today is 10 March, the date on which, in 1959, the popular uprising in Tibet against the country's occupation by the People's Republic of China was brutally crushed.
- (EL) Madam President, a short while ago we heard the discussion on Palestine.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worse than it has been since 1967.
Currently 80% of the population, in other words about 1.1 million people, are dependent on food aid compared with 63% in 2006.
Unemployment has reached 40%, according to a report by Amnesty International.
We saw what happened in the area last weekend: murders were committed on both sides; there were hostilities, while the Palestinian people awaited a better tomorrow that is slow in coming.
It is therefore time for the EU to assume its responsibilities and implement a policy based on objective criteria rather than dictated by Big Brother America.
(BG) Yesterday was a day of homage in Bulgaria.
March 9 is the date on which Turkish terrorists blasted the carriage for mothers with children on the Sofia - Burgas train 23 years ago.
Seven people died, out of whom two were children.
Another nine were badly injured.
Today, one of the persons convicted for participation in the preparation of that atrocious crime, Sabri Mehmedali, is a party functionary of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.
For almost two decades, this Movement, an ethnic partry existing in violation of the Bulgarian Constitution, has been using the central and local government levers, not only tolerating but also encouraging the dissemination of Islamic fundamentalism.
The MRF is the only party in Europe that has erected a monument to proven terrorists who killed children.
Less than two weeks ago, nine people were burnt alive in the sleeping car on the Sofia - Kardam train.
There is serious evidence pointing to arson committed on the eve of the national day of 3 March.
Last year, on that memorable date, Turks harassed sexually Bulgarian young people in the country called Bulgaria.
The sense of impunity that the government has inspiured in the MRF instigates violence among the Turks.
(The chairperson interrupts the speaker)
(NL) May I draw the House's attention to next Thursday, 13 March, which is World Kidney Day.
As you are know, chronic kidney disease is something of a silent epidemic in Europe, because its progression is often asymptomatic.
Most people are not familiar with the disease and it is not seen as a priority by policy-makers.
It is thought to affect 8% of Europeans, a figure that is set to double over the coming decade unless something is done about it.
Last week the European Kidney Health Alliance and World Kidney Day held a symposium on the subject, with an accompanying exhibition, and I myself have set up an MEP group along with a number of colleagues.
I urge all members of the House to support this initiative, because I am convinced that the European Parliament can play a leading role in encouraging Member States to act promptly to get the scale of the problem recognised and an appropriate strategy devised.
(FR) Madam President, two legally important Council of Europe documents are ten years old: its Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
According to the Copenhagen criteria, these two documents are the criteria for membership of the European Union for the new Member States.
I would urge the countries concerned that have not yet signed or ratified those two legally important documents to do so.
According to the Copenhagen criteria, France, Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg cannot be members of the European Union.
These European documents have to be incorporated and the European Union would have the credibility with Kosovo and new Member States to ask that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through the hunger and thirst strike that he is currently on, our colleague Marco Pannella has launched the first great 'World Satyagraha for Peace'.
Satyagraha is a non-violent collective action.
It is an action about which I should like to inform colleagues in writing, calling for the respect of democratically spoken words, and is emblematic not just as regards the situation in Italy.
I should also like to remind you that today is the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan people's uprising against Chinese repression and to send our best wishes to the Dalai Lama and the tens of thousands of people on the march in Dharamsala, including the Radical Party leaders, Sergio d'Elia, Matteo Mecacci and Marco Perduca.
We have just heard that the Indian police are taking steps to prevent the march, and for that reason as well we send them our best wishes.
(PL) Madam President, a recent major report on child poverty in Europe showed that almost 19% of our children live below the poverty line, defined as 60% of average per capita income in a given country.
There are countries in which the figure is higher.
Unfortunately, Poland is one of them.
I therefore welcome the European Commission's intention to propose a specific programme to combat child poverty.
We are conscious of the demographic situation in the European Union.
Our families need support in many ways, and poor families are in particular need of help.
What, then, are we to think of the high VAT rates on children's clothing - from 7% to 22% in Poland?
In some countries such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are by no means the poorest, the rate is zero, and in others, like Luxembourg, it is very low - only 3%.
The governments of these countries have been very far-sighted, but there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the matter.
I call on the European Parliament to take action aimed at changing the VAT Directive with respect to children's clothing and footwear.
(PT) Madam President, A Voz do OperÃ¡rio, an educational and charitable society, was founded in Lisbon on 13 February 1883, and for 125 years has worked tirelessly in the fields of education, culture, partnership and social support, which I applaud.
This long-standing work is continued through two schools which aim to equip hundreds of children with skills that will help them to develop, creating the conditions for them to adapt to their social environment in a critical and sustained way, on the basis of principles of justice and solidarity.
This intense and recognised activity continues to this day, despite the society's current difficulties due to lack of government support because of the Ministry of Education's failure to fulfil its obligations.
And this is the same Ministry that is trampling on teachers' rights, leading to the largest demonstration of teachers in Portugal - the 'March of indignation' - with 100 000 teachers, mostly ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(GA) Mr President, as regards the increase in the number of sex offenders who are convicted in the courts of various Member States; a number of countries now have a Sex Offenders Register in operation.
When a sex offender is released the police are informed of his place of residence.
If he lives near a school or a youth club, for example, the police and the public should be given that information.
Many offenders reoffend, especially those who do not receive treatment while in prison.
However, there is nothing preventing them from committing the same crime in another country.
Therefore, it is clear that a European database is necessary in order to ensure international co-operation and to help resolve this problem.
Madam President, may I draw your attention to an issue which is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of our Parliament as well as for our political weight, both individually and collectively.
I respect very much our interpreters and their difficult job.
Most of them are very professional and committed.
I would like to underline, however, that weak interpretation leads to misunderstanding both among us, the MEPs, and between us and the citizens.
When I speak in plenary, I try to use Bulgarian as much as possible.
I have this right and it is part of EU diversity and multilingualism.
I use simple sentences and give the written text in advance, so that I can be sure my message gets through.
However, to my surprise, I recently discovered that one third to more than half of any of my speeches simply disappears in the English version, not to mention the other languages which are used by smaller nations.
I believe I speak to all citizens.
I expect to be understood by all EU citizens and I cannot accept that technical issues prevent that.
I kindly ask the Presidency of Parliament to take the necessary measures to improve the quality of interpretation.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Over the last months the press was informed about violent events of a racist and xenophobic nature targeted at Romanian children in Italy.
Two cases caught the attention of public opinion: a 13-year old boy in Civitavecchia, near Rome, who was taken to the emergency room after being beaten by an Italian friend; In the second case, discrimination and stigmatisation are even more obvious, going as far as a Romanian mother being requested the change of her son's name.
The child no longer wants to be a Romanian or to hear of Romania.
The reason for such behaviour lies with the fact that the boy was permanently insulted by his friends for being a Romanian, despite the fact that he speaks Italian and he has integrated well into society.
Honourable President, that is why I ask myself whether all these forms of xenophobia with effects on Romanian children are the result of a media campaign against Romanians; within the meaning of the fundamental principles ...
(PL) Madam President, at the present time opinions are being canvassed in the European Union concerning changes to the Fruit Juice Directive, 2001/112/EC.
The powerful citric acid producers lobby wants it to be legally possible to increase the acidity of fruit juices and their ingredients, including apple juice, by adding citric acid, lemon juice and lime juice.
Such a possibility would infringe the principle of fair competition and wipe out European fruit juices, including apple juice.
So the question is: why do the EU authorities so often give in to pressure from lobbying groups and, in the event of further surrender, what measures will be taken to protect producers of apples and apple preserves?
May I remind you that, in the vote on reform of the fruit and vegetable market, the European Parliament rejected an amendment tabled by a group of Polish Members aimed at introducing protective measures for apples.
In these circumstances, acceptance of the proposal to allow additional acidification of fruit juices, including apple juice, with citric acid would be a huge injustice and a blow to the European fruit farming sector.
Madam President, in accordance with the challenge of the EU development cooperation policy for the new Member States, I shall focus on the national strategy for education in Romania.
Even before my country's integration into the EU, the national strategy for education in Romania was focused on making the system compatible with existing systems in the other EU countries.
Therefore, in 2004 we started the Bologna reforms, and a three-year degree structure has been in use since the academic year 2005-2006.
Recent surveys show that the acceptance of the European credit transfer system (ECTS) is now complete, and students in Romania are already following the new system.
For the future, we plan to finish successfully the implementation of the Bologna reforms, in order to encourage Romanian students to study abroad and foreign students to study in Romania, and to make sure that the degrees awarded by the universities are in accordance with the needs of the labour market in Europe.
(ET) Colleagues, Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe.
Conditions there are no different from life behind the iron curtain, which many colleagues in this Chamber experienced personally.
I remember the yearning for freedom which most Estonians felt; and Finnish radio and television helped North Estonia maintain that yearning, along with Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.
All Belarusians need this kind of window on the world.
On 10 December, human rights day, the television satellite Belsat began broadcasting in Poland, its mission is to make Belarus a community of citizens.
The most important partners of the station, which operates in Belarusian and Russian, are the journalists of Belarus fighting for democracy.
The ten per cent of Belarusians who have satellite dishes can currently watch the broadcasts.
The station is backed by Poland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and the USA.
Good television, my friends, cannot be made on the cheap.
Because of this I ask both the European Commission and all Member States to support Belsat financially.
I see it as our bounden duty as democracies.
Madam President, a few days ago presidential elections were held in the Republic of Cyprus.
The voters demonstrated their wish for a speedy solution to the Cyprus problem by electing a moderate politician, Mr Christofias, and by ousting Mr Papadopoulos who was considered by many to be a hardliner and nationalist.
This important change is further proof that the Greek Cypriots genuinely want a resolution of the long-lasting conflict with the Turkish Cypriots and with Turkey, which is occupying 40% of the island.
The Greek Cypriots have made a very brave move by showing moderation and compromise but in order for things to move forward Turkey must now reciprocate with an appropriate goodwill move such as the return of the ghost city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants or the withdrawal of a significant number of Turkish troops of occupation from the island.
Madam President, I wish to raise the Treaty debate which is taking place in Ireland at the moment.
I think it is simply outrageous that Sinn FÃ©in and its leader, Gerry Adams, are claiming in this debate that if you were to vote 'yes' to the Treaty, it will mean that Ireland will be engaging with NATO and will lose its neutrality.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
There is a triple-lock safety net there to make sure that this cannot happen.
They have said the same thing during the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties and it has always proven to be false on every single occasion.
They have opposed every treaty since 1972; yet they claim they are pro-European.
If you are 'pro-' something, you do not oppose it every single time.
Recently, in his speech to the Ard-Fheis, Gerry Adams never mentioned the EUR 1.65 billion that the EU has given to the peace process on the island of Ireland.
I think it is only fair that somebody who says he is pro-Europe should recognise the work that this Union has done to improve the peace process on the island of Ireland.
If you are pro-Europe, you prove that you are pro-Europe and you do not put out outrageous allegations on this Treaty that are not true.
(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, over the past few days two events have drawn our attention once again to the need for a common European energy policy.
On the one hand, Russia has again significantly cut the amount of gas it supplies to Ukraine, thereby seriously endangering Europe's energy security.
On the other, Gazprom and the Hungarian government have entered into an agreement on the Hungarian section of the South Stream pipeline, an agreement incompatible with current European Union provisions.
The lesson to be learned from these two events is clear: although Russia can be considered less and less of a partner in energy matters, the European Union's dependence on Russia is steadily growing.
This dependence is going to result in a deterioration in energy supply security and ultimately to an increase in prices.
To avoid this happening and to ensure that we can guarantee European consumers a secure supply at a reasonable price, the European Union needs to speak with one voice.
It is not yet too late to strengthen the foundations of a common European energy policy based on solidarity.
Thank you.
Madam President, I rise to draw your attention to the problems being experienced in the south-east of England in consequence of the industrial action taken in the French cross-Channel shipping industry on the Dover-to-Calais route.
For many years this vital link in the trans-European network has been an inefficient bottleneck.
Perhaps that is understandable when it is caused by bad weather or technical problems, but on this occasion - for over two weeks now - the whole economy of this region has been held an innocent hostage in this dispute.
I ask that the Presidency prevail upon the European Commission and the two respective governments to ensure that the principle of free movement of goods and people throughout the European Union is upheld.
I also ask that in the longer term they bring pressure to bear so that far greater urgency can be applied to finding long-term solutions to this problem, which brings so much hardship to our region.
(BG) Mme Chairperson, Colleagues, I would like to once again draw your attention to the proper and efficient use of the EU financial resources.
The reports adopted at the previous session and the debates on them clearly define some key outstanding issues of the existing system.Unfortunately the media and the general public continue the debate on the inability of some of the old Member States, as well as the new Member States, including my country Bulgaria, to apply the European standards sufficiently well and to protect the EU financial interests.
It is also obvious that there is a lack of an effective preventive policy aimed at preventing irregularities and violations in the disbursement and absorption of financial resources.
The events over the recent weeks, in which the European Commission has discontinued the resources under the PHARE and SAPARD Programmes for Bulgaria, are a further testimony to the fact that most of the irregularities in the spending of these resources are associated also with corrupt practices.
In this connection, I believe that the European Parliament's mechanisms should be strengthened and we should insist on monitoring of the implementation before the European Commission.

(PL) Madam President, last month I wrote to the European Commission asking it to halt examination of the Republic of Poland's request for restructuring aid for Krajowa SpÃ³Åka Cukrowa (Poland's national sugar company), reject the application and initiate control proceedings.
My letter had the support of 35 MEPs from various countries and political groups.
In connection with the grant of restructuring aid, Krajowa SpÃ³Åka Cukrowa intends to close the Lublin sugar plant and demolish all the buildings.
In the opinion of the plant's staff and protest committee, which has also written to the European Commission and the European Parliament Committee on Petitions, the preparation and examination of Poland's application contravened Community rules.
We still await a response from the European Commission.
I am drawing the European Parliament's attention to this specific problem because ...

(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have often discussed here whether the Olympic Games in Beijing will improve or worsen the general human-rights situation in China.
That is a fairly contentious point.
What seems certain, as far as I can see, is that these Games will have a disastrous effect on animal welfare in China.
I read today that there were plans to kill 200 000 cats in Beijing by caging them, starving them, letting them die of thirst or simply poisoning them on the grounds that some guests might object to the presence of cats.
This is something that cannot be tolerated.
I believe people should think twice whether they really want to be spectators at these Games.
Athletes should think twice whether they ought to take part in these Games, and organisers should think twice about the wisdom of their decision to award the Games to China.
We need have no second thoughts, however, about you, Madam President, being able to express the disapproval of this House.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
(PT) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the 100 000 Portuguese teachers who demonstrated in an impressive and imposing 'March of indignation' in Lisbon on 8 March last, organised by the Portuguese National Teachers' Federation.
In response to an offensive promoted by the Socialist Party Government against teachers' rights, democratic school management and state education, the teachers reaffirmed their determination to fight for dignity, employment, teachers' rights and improved conditions, and to protect high-quality teaching and state education in Portugal.
(SK) In Slovakia on 25 March we will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Candle Demonstration for religious and civil rights and freedoms.
The Communist regime violently broke up this peaceful gathering of religious believers. This was a serious breach of civil rights and of the freedom of assembly, guaranteed by the Constitution, by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by the Helsinki Final Act (1975).
Although the Candle Demonstration was held at the initiative of religious believers, it expressed the desire for respect for human rights of all citizens.
Its roots were in religious and civil dissent, in the sacrifices of people who were executed, in the suffering of unjustly imprisoned people and in the Pontificate of John Paul II.
Because of people's courage to revolt, the Candle Demonstration in Bratislava in March 1988 can be considered the beginning of the end of communist totality in Czechoslovakia that finally reached its culmination in November 1989.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to the Suhodol case, the environmental disaster for the Bulgarian capital cirty, affecting directly the health and life of millions of people.
In December 2007, the citizens affected by the unregulated landfill in the area of Suhodol sent a petition to the President of the European Parliament, after the landfill, which had been closed at a decision of the Ministry of the Environment and Water in 2005, was re-oepened with the intervention of over 2,500 police and gendarmerie officers on 4 December 2007.
The affected persons invoked the Aarhus Convention which has been ratified by the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria.
The Sofia City, unlawfully supported by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria, has acted without the mandatory environmental impact assessment by the Ministry of the Environment and Water and without subsequent hearings of the affected population.
Furthermore, the Sofia City, again unlawfully suppoorted by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria, has carried out activities for which no enforceable judgment is in place.
I would kindly request you, with a view to terminating the biological terrorism, that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Petitions...
(The chairperson interrupts the speaker)
We have to stop now, because we have gone well beyond thirty minutes.
That concludes the item.
Ongoing negotiations on bilateral agreements between the USA and certain Member States with regard to visas and PNR (Passenger Name Record) (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on ongoing negotiations on bilateral agreements between the USA and certain Member States with regard to visas and PNRs.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, let me begin by saying that, as everyone knows, the common European visa policy has so far brought us tangible results with several third countries, such as, very recently, Canada and Australia.
This has not been the case, unfortunately, with the United States.
Since 2004, we have been working very hard to achieve the aim of having all Member States in the United States' visa waiver programme.
I, together with the Presidents-in-Office of the Council, have constantly pressed the United States administration to make the voices of all EU Member States heard in Washington.
President Barroso, as you know, has raised the issue personally with President Bush, as well as with the leaders of the US Congress on each of his official visits to Washington.
We have all argued that EU Member States already meet the additional security criteria as set out in the reform legislation recently adopted by the United States.
We fully understand that the lack of progress with the United States has created a lot of frustration among those not yet participating in the US visa waiver programme.
Our citizens have a legitimate right not to understand the reasons for such discrimination.
We should not allow ourselves, however, to be divided and bullied into going beyond what has recently been agreed and accepting what should be out of the question - for example, providing others with access to Schengen migration data and asylum data.
All this should be out of the question.
We need detailed discussion, negotiation and consideration of reciprocity.
We have, after all, achieved a great deal together.
Most recently, we have celebrated the expansion of the Schengen area to most of Europe.
In turn, it gives us collective responsibility for dealing with all matters relating to the security of the external borders and for ensuring the correctness of the screening and handling of data pertaining to all those who visit our common territory.
I do not question the right of EU Member States to engage with the United States on issues which are national prerogatives, for example cooperation between intelligence services or air marshal programmes, but we are of the view that what the US is asking from all of us in different visa-related issues raises serious legal and political questions.
Allow me to underline that, although the sense of urgency may be understandable, we all have to acknowledge that the signing of the memorandum of understanding does not get anyone into the visa waiver programme the next day.
The United States still has to set up the electronic travel authorisation and the air exit control.
It will undertake extensive on-site evaluation visits in the countries concerned.
Therefore, there is no need to hurry into something that is legally questionable and leaves each country to its own devices when negotiating with the United States.
Since all European Union Member States, both those seeking the waiving of visas and those already in the programme, are concerned by this and are being approached by the United States, Coreper - the ambassadors of the European Union Member States - adopted on 5 March a common baseline: a set of common parameters that will guide the discussions the Member States will have individually with the United States.
It will be a good basis for our talks with US partners at the EU-US ministerial troika on 13 March 2008.
In parallel, I will present tomorrow a mandate for proper EU negotiations with the United States on matters arising from visa policy.
By pursuing a common approach based on common parameters, we will reinforce the possibility of reaching, in the short term, an agreement with our American partners on the mandate proposed by the Commission.
We need to keep in mind that the EU and the United States are close allies.
This has been demonstrated on numerous occasions.
Fighting terrorism is a global challenge, which not only affects us all but which can also only be successfully countered if we work together.
The European Union is ready to do its part by keeping Member States united and respectful of European common legislation and competence.
In conclusion, we will be negotiating with the United States.
It is simply not possible to abandon, to renounce, not only our European legislation but also our common criteria, on the basis of which we have been negotiating.
We will continue to negotiate.
No Member State will be entitled or allowed to violate or to derogate from European legislation on this.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, the common visa policy is a matter of Community competence.
Moreover, Member States are obliged to respect the principle of solidarity in this area.
If that principle is being infringed, we should ask ourselves why.
The Council says the American visa waiver programme should finally create the same rights for all EU citizens.
Unfortunately, we still lack a concrete timetable showing how and when that goal is to be achieved.
The Commission declares that joining the Schengen area at the end of last year was a great success for the citizens of the new Member States.
Yes, entry into the Schengen area brings them real benefit.
But that only makes the humiliating, time-wasting and costly procedure for obtaining a tourist visa for the United States all the more irritating.
Can the Commission now assure us that it will take all necessary steps to achieve equal treatment of all EU citizens by the United States?
Can the Commission assure Parliament that it will actively take on the coordinating role and render bilateral agreements superfluous?
Parliament itself must take some of the blame. Especially those on the left of this House, whose indiscriminately harsh criticism of the United States strengthens that country's conviction that it can quietly and effectively negotiate with individual states.
It also ties the Commission's hands.
Countries excluded from the visa waiver programme must show political backbone and resist pressure from disgruntled citizens at home.
By breaking the principle of solidarity, they are putting the governments of remaining countries under increased pressure to place particular national interests above Community principles.
Those countries that already participate in the visa waiver programme must stop treating this as a problem only for those who are still waiting to be included.
On behalf of my group, I can assure the Commission that we shall fully support its efforts to achieve visa-free movement of tourists on equal terms for all EU citizens.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Madam President, the recent pressure brought to bear by the US Government on individual European governments in connection with participation in the visa waiver programme should be condemned outright and should entail substantial penalties.
Under no circumstances, Commissioner, should any other response be allowed.
In other words, the unacceptable demands of a US Government that is already on the way out and whose President, just two days ago, vetoed a bill forbidding the US secret services to use torture, must not be used by the Commission to justify the inclusion of such provisions in European law on the pretext of maintaining solidarity.
The bilateral demands and pressure by the United States infringe the national sovereignty of individual Member States and the fundamental rights of their citizens.
Greece and 11 of the 12 new Member States are being pressurised to allow the US security authorities access to a range of extremely sensitive personal data, which is not required of the other European countries.
It is as if the singled-out countries were Europe's poor relations or guinea-pigs for America's new security measures.
Secondly, the measures infringe the common visa policy, because, as we know, third countries are obliged to treat all the EU countries equally.
They cannot divide us into good and bad Europeans.
All the excuses used hitherto, that the passports of some European countries were supposedly insecure, are now invalid, yet the United States carries on regardless!
Thirdly, the measures contravene the recent international PNR agreement between Europe and the United States, which clearly defines what the Americans can and cannot take for themselves.
Fourthly, the measures contravene European legislation on data collection and processing, such as the Schengen Convention.
On this point, you have rightly said that the Americans are asking to be given access to such data.
Madam President, the US Government is promoting whatever is in its own interests by its favourite method of 'divide and rule'.
The question is, what is Europe doing to protect its authority, laws and citizens?
Unfortunately, the answer so far has been disheartening.
For years the European Commission has failed to persuade the United States to extend the visa waiver programme to all EU countries on equal terms, thus opening the door to bilateral negotiations with individual countries.
The Czech Republic meanwhile seems in an indecent hurry to accept the new illegal terms, in breach of Community policy and solidarity.
In the midst of this hive of political pressure and secret negotiations, it is encouraging, Commissioner, that you have responded today.
However, in the light of what I have said, we call on you to provide explicit answers on these points:
Firstly, do you intend to take steps against Member States that conclude bilateral agreements with the United States?
Will you bring a case before the European Court against the Czech Republic if the implementing measures of the agreement prove to be contrary to Community law?
Secondly, have you asked other European governments that are now negotiating with the United States not to yield to such pressure?
If so, which are the governments that you have spoken to or are now in communication with?
