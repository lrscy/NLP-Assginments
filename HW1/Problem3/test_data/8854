So, when is it a suitable time to talk about genocide?
The Armenian lobby is so vociferous in this Parliament precisely because of the apparent conspiracy of silence that has surrounded the genocide question for almost a century.
The murder of the Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink should have provided a period of national reflection but, sadly, this did not happen.
Nevertheless, reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia, including the reopening of the closed border, is an important element of Turkey's efforts to join the EU.
But, in my view, no true democracy can be in denial of its past, even its deepest and darkest secrets.
Just as important is a lasting settlement of the conflict in Cyprus, which remains at an impasse caused by the presence of occupying troops in an EU Member State as well as non-implementation of the Ankara Protocol.
Minority religious rights, in particular Christian, also give cause for concern.
For instance, the Greek Orthodox seminary of Halki remains closed since 1971; the Assyrian Christians who fled to Germany and Sweden during the war with the PKK have been stripped of their Turkish citizenship, preventing them from claiming back their homes lost in the conflict.
And Turkey sees the Alevis as no different from the majority Sunni Muslims and therefore does not recognise their separate religious needs.
Article 301 of the Penal Code on insulting Turkishness has resulted in many convictions and, in March - rather bizarrely in my view - a court in Istanbul issued an order denying access to the video-sharing website YouTube when allegations were made on the sexuality of the founding father of modern Turkey, Kemal AtatÃŒrk.
Speaking entirely personally and not on behalf of my party or my Group: a lot clearly still needs to be done.
(EL) Mr President, today's discussion gives us an opportunity to express our satisfaction with the election results in Turkey, and to welcome the Turkish people's express wish to continue the reforms.
Turkey's prospective accession to the EU, which remains the objective, has opened the way to attempts at reform.
Unfortunately, these efforts have reached a plateau and have slowed down.
The new government, with its fresh, strong mandate, needs to move very fast to fully implement all the provisions of the Association Agreement and its Additional Protocol.
The reform process is above all about democratisation, fundamental human rights and religious freedoms.
In line with this, it is essential to repeal Article 301 of the Criminal Code and respond firmly to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's requests.
Unfortunately, the Turkish Government's attitude towards this issue so far has allowed for extremist acts.
We must also mention the Turkish authorities' inexplicable insistence on keeping the Theological School in Halki shut.
Another issue that concerns us is the tense situation in south-east Turkey.
I believe that the culture of settling disputes violently should not be allowed to prevail, because it will mean instability in the wider area.
It is the present government's responsibility to take action in order to reach a peaceful settlement on the Kurdish issue, and this presupposes dialogue between the two sides.
The international community must play a peacekeeping role in this potential crisis.
To conclude, Mr President, I should like to say that we expect Turkey to honour all its obligations so that it can progress steadily towards prospective European integration.
(EL) Mr President, let me first congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her excellent work.
Mr President, the popular mandate given to the ErdoÄan Government and to Mr ErdoÄan in particular allows for the continuation of a course of reform that has been under way since Turkey's claim for a place in Europe became a firmer prospect.
At the same time, the mandate inspires a new desire for a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue, with the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus as the first requirement.
There is a new desire for genuine neighbourly relations, both in general, and with Greece in particular.
Thanks to the mandate, human rights are respected under new laws such as the law on ecclesiastical foundations, and the laws protecting rights and freedoms.
This is a historic coming to terms with the past, and the genocides of the Armenians, Pontic Greeks and Assyrians are being recognised.
Thanks to the mandate, the Kurdish issue is being seen in a new light.
The potential invasion of northern Iraq is an issue that should be of serious concern to the EU.
Such a move must not be permitted, because the need, on which we are all agreed, to combat terrorism should never be used as a pretext for creating a fait accompli of occupied territory in northern Iraq, as happened in Cyprus.
Mr President, I am not sure what this morning's debate is adding to the Turkish accession issue rather than giving an opportunity to a small number of vehement opponents of Turkish accession to repeat their arguments in this Chamber.
Of course we should urge Turkey to show restraint and to act proportionately in response to the terrorist threat from northern Iraq but I note the criticisms this morning are being made by the very same people who in other debates have been against the European Union's contribution to reconstruction in Iraq.
I welcome the strategic partnership between the UK and Turkey announced by Prime Ministers Brown and Erdogan in London yesterday, including positive cooperation in combating organised crime and terrorism.
I call on other Member States to do the same.
I welcome the youngest female Turkish MP elected, Ayla Akat, who was in Brussels last week as one of a number of Kurdish MPs returned to the Turkish Parliament for the first time in 14 years, who give us hope that the problem of Kurdish cultural and political rights could be solved through democracy and not through violence.
(CS) Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten carried out an outstanding piece of work when she found a compromise wording on a subject which divides this House.
I am convinced, however, that in the future adopting such resolutions and reports, which strive to find compromises at the expense of not expressing Parliament's views on contentious key issues, should be abandoned.
Our efforts to achieve unanimity send Turkey a message which does not sufficiently reflect the different opinions on Turkish membership held both within this Parliament and among the European public.
I will not conceal the fact that I consider the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey to be in itself a fundamental mistake.
At the same time I am aware of and I respect the fact that not everyone in this House shares this view.
The European public is itself strongly divided when it comes to this issue of key importance for the future of European integration.
It is our duty to reflect this polarity.
I would therefore hope that our future resolutions and reports clearly bear witness to this division within Parliament regarding the possible Turkish membership of the EU.
While compromise is welcomed in many other areas discussed in Parliament, Turkish membership and EU-Turkey relations are not among them.
Let us change the approach.
Let us not continue producing reports and resolutions which attempt to give the impression of agreement and unanimity.
Instead, let us show, through our agreement or disagreement with clearly formulated positions, that there is a division among us in the matter of Turkish membership.
It is a question of our responsibility towards both the EU citizens and Turkey who do not deserve half-truths.
I am certain that the Turkish people will welcome much more a communication on disunity rather than a concealment of the real situation, which both Parliament and Europe as a whole have been doing for a long time.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's resolution on Turkey, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal and has thus entered a new phase of constructive dialogue in its relations with Turkey.
Turkey is currently involved in an intense debate about internal reforms.
Turkey now has a government in power which has a clear popular mandate and can set to work.
This is a chance to give fresh impetus to the accession process in several key areas.
Calling for additional requirements to be met which are not part of the accession negotiations is counterproductive.
In Turkey, the development of a new constitution is now the highest priority.
The outline of this constitution is already discernible.
The call for the revision of Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is being considered by the Turkish side.
Turkey now needs further positive signals from the EU.
We must encourage Turkey to continue this reform process with great zeal.
The Commission's progress report is expected on 7 November, and I think it is very important that the current positive developments in Turkey are reflected in that report.
(EL) Mr President, Turkey is a candidate for accession to a united Europe.
It has rights and obligations.
The rapporteur has given a balanced interim report.
This offers Turkey another chance to proceed with the reforms and fulfil its obligations, which relate mainly to economic changes, respect for the Copenhagen criteria, and human, religious and minority rights.
We want Turkey to change because Turkey itself is asking for change and also because the times demand it.
Change in Turkey means meeting its obligations towards Cyprus by recognising the Republic of Cyprus and ending the occupation of Cyprus.
The report correctly states that the withdrawal of the Turkish army will help to reach a solution, and that the Turkish army can be replaced with a small European force under the command of the Security Council.
Turkey must fulfil the following obligations: end colonisation and change the demographic character of Cyprus; repatriate the settlers, who form the great majority in the occupied territories and are the time-bomb waiting to undermine any solution; end the appropriation of Greek Cypriot properties in occupied Cyprus; and stop the destruction of our cultural heritage.
As a first step, Turkey must respect the decisions of the UN and return the city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants.
Ankara regards Turkish Cypriots as isolated, owing to the presence of 45 000 Turkish soldiers, who are keeping Greek Cypriots away from their homes and properties.
Turkey holds the key both to its accession to Europe and to solving the Cyprus issue.
The Turkish policy of dividing Cyprus into two states is not a solution.
We live in an age of unification, not partition.
We say yes to a European Turkey and yes to a European solution, which have little in common with partition lines and zones; they should be based, as the rapporteur rightly stresses, on the principles of a united Europe.
This will create a viable model state for the whole of Europe, where Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and Christians and Muslims, can live peaceful and productive lives based on mutual respect for the principles and values of a united Europe.
(ES) Mr President, as you know, the enlargement of the European Union to include another country is always a dialectical process in which the candidate's efforts must be determined but in which the Union's efforts must also be clear.
In my view, when the European Union has a new Reform Treaty to enable it to be more democratic and more effective, it will also be in a better position to continue its enlargement.
That is the case following the Lisbon agreement.
Turkey is making significant progress.
We are all behind the Ankara Government, behind the Turkish people in the fight against terrorism.
Nevertheless, in order to continue the progress I mentioned, we must call for restraint, moderation and compliance with international law.
A large-scale military operation in northern Iraq would only add fuel to the fire there and could also cause serious problems in Turkey.
Finally, I want to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her resolution, although there is one topic missing: why do we often forget that Turkey is not just a candidate country but also a vital Euro-Mediterranean partner in the Barcelona Process?
This point is indeed missing from the report.
Turkey is vital in that Process just as we are vital for Turkey in the Euro-Mediterranean Process too.
(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her balanced resolution.
I was in Turkey ten days ago and while I was there I spoke to members of the new Turkish Government and the new Parliament.
I stressed the need to carry on with the reforms, with special emphasis on freedom of speech.
The Minister of Justice and other members of the Cabinet assured me that Article 301 will be amended.
The new Government also promised reforms on the path toward EU membership.
The resolution also refers to that membership as the ultimate goal.
The resolution will therefore make a direct contribution to the reforms in Turkey, including reforms in the areas of women's rights, trade union rights and social legislation.
However, calm is needed for reforms to take place, and at the moment fear and anger are rife in Turkey.
Fear of attacks by the PKK, anger that could lead to escalation.
To prevent that, Turkey and the EU must join forces in order to use diplomatic and political means to prevent and punish terrorism.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this lively debate was very useful to the Presidency.
It has clearly demonstrated, if there were any doubt, how much the opinions and views of the many Members differ with regard to the negotiations on Turkey's accession to the European Union.
However, regardless of the many opinions that may exist on this issue, I feel that this debate has clearly shown that Turkey is already a vital strategic partner of the European Union in political, economic and also security terms.
I also feel it is clear from this debate that the prospect of Turkey joining the European Union has been the driving force behind fundamental political and social reforms in Turkey.
Clearly, some people regret that these reforms have not been as rapid or as extensive as might have been hoped, but the fact is that Turkey's people and Government are making gradual progress along the road set out by us, towards an increasingly democratic and pluralistic society which more fully respects the rule of law.
The Copenhagen criteria, as the guide or reference framework for this whole negotiation process, are extremely clear for both Turkey and any other candidate countries: only those countries which clearly respect our economic principles and, in particular and perhaps even more importantly, our political principles can be members of the European Union.
If Turkey fully complies with these criteria, then obviously it can become a member of the European Union.
This is absolutely clear and therefore cannot, or at least should not, give rise to any doubts.
As regards the PKK's terrorist attacks on the border between Turkey and Iraq, I would draw your attention to the Presidency's statement of 22 October on this issue.
In that statement, the Presidency totally condemned the terrorist violence perpetrated by the PKK and expressed our active solidarity with the victims' families.
We also noted that it is vital for the international community to support Turkey's efforts to fight terrorism, while respecting the rule of law, preserving international peace and stability and regional stability, and naturally calling on Turkey to refrain from taking any disproportionate military action.
We also call on both the Turkish Government and the Iraqi Government to effectively cooperate to address this problem and in particular to prevent Iraqi territory from being used for terrorist actions against Turkey.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this very substantive and timely debate shortly before we issue our progress report on Turkey on 6 November - that is, in two weeks.
In the Commission we aim at presenting as objective and fair a report as the one presented by Ms Oomen-Ruijten.
With today's debate and your subsequent resolution, this House sends some very clear messages to Turkey.
First of all, I think we all agree that now is the time to step up the reform efforts in the country for the sake of the Turkish citizens, yes, but also for making serious progress in the EU accession negotiations.
Especially, there is very strong emphasis on reforms without unnecessary delay as regards the freedom of expression, the infamous Article 301 and other equivalent articles, as well as religious freedoms.
Likewise, we need to see progress on women's rights, trade union rights, as well as cultural and religious rights and international obligations over Turkey.
Moreover, we condemn terrorist attacks and we understand the Turkish need to protect its citizens, but we also urge Turkey to seek a political solution in cooperation with Iraqi regional authorities and the international community and to show a sense of proportionality in its response to PKK terrorism.
Concerning the Armenian issue, the Commission supports Parliament's call, as expressed in your draft resolution, for a process of reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia.
This is the best and most effective way that in time would lead to genuine results over reconciliation and justice.
We also consider that all the issues in Turkey, including the Armenian issue, should be debated openly and peacefully within Turkish society in the name of freedom of expression.
Therefore, the reform of Article 301 is also essential for a serious and effective debate on the Armenian issue that could lead to genuine reconciliation.
The current restraints over freedom of expression have a chilling effect and even contribute to creating an atmosphere of intolerance and hatred, as was unfortunately and sadly shown in the case of the assassination of Hrant Dink earlier this year.
Finally, we have to recall one thing.
I do, and you have also, set very strong demands for Turkey as regards the reform process and rightly so.
At the same time, we need to recall that the equation works only if both sides do what they have got to do.
That means, when we are firm we also must be fair.
We have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective of Turkey as outlined in the negotiation mandate.
(Applause)
Otherwise, we can shout as loud as we wish, but it would be like shouting for the forest.
There would be no response, only a long silence.
Two motions for a resolution to wind up the debate have been tabled.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the conditions for EU membership.
Despite considerable progress in recent years, there are still outstanding issues about freedom of expression (particularly Article 301 of the Penal Code), human rights and Armenia.
However, I reject the arguments of those who say that Turkey should never be allowed to join on the grounds that it is not a European country.
We have accepted Turkey as a full member of the Council of Europe for more than half a century.
We have started accession negotiations, thereby recognising its eligibility to join the EU in principle.
Those claiming that Turkey is not European really mean it is not Christian.
But why should that be a criterion?
The motto of the European Union is 'unity with diversity' -we are not trying to standardise cultures, but to find ways of working together while keeping our different languages, religions and so on.
Accepting a secular state whose population is largely Islamic would enhance that principle.
EU-Russia Summit (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia Summit.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the 20th EU-Russia Summit will take place on Friday of this week in the Portuguese town of Mafra.
This represents, in our opinion, an excellent opportunity for the leaders of both Russia and the European Union to take stock of our relations.
We believe that relations between the European Union and Russia are generally good and certainly much better than the international press would sometimes have us believe.
Russia is a key partner for the EU and we take our relationship very seriously.
The summit will tackle the situation in the EU and in Russia.
We will report on developments in the European Union, in particular on progress made in drafting the new Reform Treaty which has just been adopted in Lisbon and on the energy liberalisation package proposed by the Commission and adopted on 9 September.
As for the common spaces, we will review the progress made in implementing the road maps.
This process continues to be wholly positive, although some areas need to be driven forward.
In certain important sectors, the Permanent Partnership Council (PPC) has helped to achieve this objective.
The PPC on Culture, which will be held the day before the summit, will help to intensify our cultural cooperation.
In terms of priorities for the summit, we intend to reach agreement on the launch of the early warning system in the energy sector, on which agreement in principle was reached at the last summit held in Samara.
Given the interdependence of the European Union and Russia in terms of energy, confidence must be increased and mutual cooperation reinforced.
We will therefore highlight the objectives and principles that the EU must respect in relation to our energy partnership, in particular reciprocity, transparency, openness and creation of an effective legal and regulatory framework.
In our opinion, the principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and the text on worldwide energy security adopted by the G8 in Saint Petersburg must be included in the new EU-Russia Agreement which will be legally binding and will replace the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).
In the area of investment, we welcome the formal dialogue planned in the road map for the common economic space.
It is vitally important that transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable conditions are created for EU undertakings investing in Russia, bearing in mind the law on strategic investments which is being considered by the Duma.
We will also urge Russia to avoid the selective use of flanking policies, such as the environment or taxation, to hinder existing investments or create hidden obstacles for new investment.
We believe that Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a priority which is why we also intend to broach this issue at the summit.
The Commission may have something more to say on this.
I must point out that the summit will also be used to apply pressure, in order to ensure progress, if a satisfactory solution has not been found to the main outstanding issues, such as wood export duties or discriminatory rail tariffs.
We are aware that this summit comes at a time when both the presidential and Duma elections in Russia are imminent.
In the election process, freedom of expression, including freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, will be vitally important and a real test of the democratic legitimacy of Russia.
The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) must be given free access to observe the Duma elections.
As a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, Russia has a particular responsibility to protect our common values.
It is regrettable that certain issues have overshadowed relations between the European Union and Russia, given that our interdependence is increasing, not reducing.
Russia and the EU need to work together to overcome their differences as there is really no alternative to our cooperation.
Unfortunately, the start of negotiations on a new agreement between the EU and Russia is still deadlocked.
Russia's bans on imports of Polish meat and vegetables continue to form a major obstacle to the start of negotiations.
The Commission has indicated its readiness to continue contacts in order to find a mutually acceptable solution.
Unfortunately, the situation has been further complicated by the decision taken by the Russian veterinary authorities at the end of last month to ban the import of meat produced by 36 EU undertakings.
The interruption to oil supplies destined for Lithuania through the Druzhba pipeline also represents a sticking point preventing negotiations on a new agreement between the EU and Russia from getting underway.
More than a year has passed without Russia having given any official information on the leak from the pipeline or on the prospects of resuming supplies.
It is therefore vital to find a satisfactory solution that will create the necessary confidence to continue developing the partnership between the EU and Russia in the area of energy.
Despite the current deadlock in the negotiations, the situation should not be overdramatized.
We actually agreed with Russia in 2006 that the PCA would remain in force, thus avoiding any legal vacuum in our relations with Russia.
Finally, we will certainly be raising the most important issues currently on the international agenda, in particular Kosovo and Iraq.
We will also stress how vital positive cooperation with Russia is in our common neighbourhood, so that we can tackle common issues of interest and concern, particularly the 'frozen' disputes.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Russia is not only a close neighbour, for us it is a strategic partner.
If we look to trade and investment we see they are booming, and we also see, as our President has said, that interdependence is growing.
But we also know that Russia is a key partner in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges - also mentioned here - and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship.
The upcoming summit on Friday is the next occasion to assess the state of our relationship.
While several of the outstanding issues will not be solved, we will make progress on some others and thus will also prepare the ground for future work at this moment of transition.
We know it is a critical period for Russia, a few months ahead of the crucial parliamentary and presidential elections, and we also know that the European Union has repeatedly expressed its concerns on the implementation of democratic principles and human rights commitments in Russia.
We, the European Union, are watching developments very closely - the forthcoming elections will be an important test in that regard - and we expect Russia will make a sensible choice and invite the OSCE observers to monitor the elections.
We shall also take the opportunity to raise our concerns on human rights issues, such as the limitations on press freedom, the attacks on journalists, the pressure on NGOs and also the situation in the northern Caucasus.
I had the occasion to discuss the forthcoming summit with the President's key advisor, the special envoy Mr Yastrzhembsky, when I was in Kaliningrad on 11 and 12 October.
Let me start with a few good examples, but then say where we will not make progress.
I believe that Russia is about to announce a major financial contribution to several EU-led cross-border cooperation programmes.
This will be very welcome since cooperation across our developing borders is an important feature following the 2004 enlargement.
And Kaliningrad is, of course, a very special case, due to its unique geographic location.
This requires, as we have always found, special arrangements to facilitate cross-border cooperation and local border traffic.
Russia's financial contribution, however, would also be very timely, considering the very serious traffic congestion on borders between the Member States and Russia in Kaliningrad and at border crossing points with several Member States elsewhere.
Lines of trucks of up to 50 km on the EU side of the border are clearly not acceptable.
We need to implement the measures and therefore we have agreed with Russia to reduce the bottlenecks.
We are just launching a pilot project in the Commission, exchanging customs information and financing modernisation of border infrastructure.
For its part, Russia must streamline its procedures at the borders.
In principle it is ready to do so but it takes a certain amount of time.
Our President has already mentioned energy.
I would just like to add that we should be able to announce an agreement on the early warning mechanism to deal with problems in supply before they come to crisis point.
Our President has spoken about energy culture and also investments so I need not add anything here.
I just would like to complement it by saying that investment and business relations will also be discussed at an industrialists' round table in Lisbon, with the participation of GÃŒnter Verheugen and Andris Piebalgs, starting tomorrow, Thursday.
This round table will then report its conclusions to the summit on Friday.
I think this is a good contribution to what is really a growing business relationship.
Russia is a key economic actor and, on WTO, I would like to add that we will help Russia's efforts.
You know we have always been committed to Russia's WTO accession.
We also think it is very important to have a level playing field, and that is why we will place so much emphasis on the completion of Russia's accession to the WTO.
The summit will give a new impetus to this complex process, which is at a critical stage.
We shall be signing a new agreement on steel on the margins of the summit, thus increasing the quantities which Russia may export to the European Union.
Another sign of positive elements in EU-Russia cooperation is the fact that the memorandum of understanding between the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the Russia Federal Drug Control Service is going to be signed on the margins of the summit.
On a less positive note, I would like to inform you that, although there was a clear Russian commitment in Samara in May to finally sign our agreement on the Siberian overflights, in time for the next summit in Mafra, prospects for this happening seem to be very slim.
We want to turn the page on this long-standing dispute.
A positive move by Russia would then allow us also to go ahead with the aviation summit, planned to take place in Moscow in November, to identify the enormous potential for cooperation in this sector.
As regards international issues, Kosovo will certainly be one of the most important and we need to consider jointly with Russia how to bring this question to a solution, based on the ongoing efforts of the Troika.
We must avoid a renewed conflict in the Balkans.
We will also discuss other important international issues such as the Middle East prior to the Annapolis Conference; Iran, following President Putin's recent visit to Tehran and Afghanistan; Burma/Myanmar; and the situation with regard to the frozen conflicts particularly in Georgia and Moldova.
We would like to work with Russia in a constructive spirit in the search for solutions for these vexed issues.
Therefore, what we have to do is continue our ongoing work and never lose sight of our long-term projects.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we hope that, as the press pointed out, the Portuguese autumn will be warmer than the Russian spring as far as the Samara Summit is concerned.
As the Commissioner said, I believe that we need to continue working to build the strategic association with Russia, but the climate will depend more on Russia's temperature than that of the European Union: to some extent in the light of what the Commissioner was saying, above all in the light of the new role that Russia wants to play on the international stage, and, in particular, as far as the security of energy supply is concerned.
However, Mr President, this relationship has to be built on a series of pillars.
The first is that any decision or any act against a Member State must be seen as a decision or act against the European Union as a whole.
Secondly, Mr President, the European Union is irrevocably and unquestionably committed to human rights and it has to be very firm when defending those positions.
In this respect, I feel that we should welcome the Russian Government's decision to authorise and finally grant visas to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to allow it to have a meeting in Moscow.
One aspect that gives cause for concern is the statement made, in relation to the recent summit of countries bordering the Caspian Sea, about forming a type of broad front to combat to some extent the regional and international threats and some positions in the United Nations.
I am just finishing up, Mr President.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, defend with pragmatism the European Union's interests, build this association, but do not forget that the figures have to match up to the ideals.
I remember something I read in a recent - naturally excellent - article in The Economist: apparently at the Wiesbaden Summit Mr Putin told the Federal Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, that that was where Dostoyevsky had lost at roulette.
I hope that the European Union is luckier in Portugal than the Russian writer was in Wiesbaden.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the run-up to the coming summit, the key assumption for my Group remains that Russia and the European Union have a number of important interests in common and, despite our many differences of opinion, the European Union should continue to operate on the basis of that assumption during the coming summit.
Russia and Europe need each other to tackle problems in Europe, but they especially need each other for tackling major international issues.
Sustainable security in Europe is only possible in cooperation with Russia.
For these reasons we, my Group and I, have always supported the strategic partnership with Russia.
There is a very full agenda for this summit and the Commissioner and the representative of the Presidency have already spoken about this.
All the same we hope that at some point there will be some movement on the question of the negotiating mandate for the new partnership and cooperation agreement.
We hope that a new Polish Government will be able to cooperate with Moscow better and as a result perhaps create some room for progress.
The energy relationship is extremely important and we also think that the starting point has to be reciprocity, but we do have to realise that we are dealing with a form of mutual independence here that we should try to manage better together.
We also want more cooperation in the Black Sea area, and we hope that issues such as Transnistria and Georgia will also be discussed at this summit.
Previous speakers have already mentioned the state of democracy in Russia and, of course, that is not something that can be left out of the discussion.
We are also concerned about the run-up to the Duma elections.
We also want the campaigns to be free and fair, and that all parties have an equal chance to have their say.
That is why it is so important that we press the issue of observers in Moscow: not only observers on the actual election day, but also observers during the campaign in the run-up to the elections.
We all know how important it is to be able to form a proper judgement of the elections; a country that has ambitions to hold the presidency of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe really should also be able and willing to work with the OSCE when it comes to observing the elections.
Finally, and I reiterate what I said at the beginning, we should continue to be critical towards Russia; critical when it comes to human rights and democracy, but we should not polarise things unnecessarily.
Our starting point should still be to be a good neighbour, to cooperate, and to try to tackle issues in Europe together and not to constantly make an issue of things.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, May's summit in Samara exposed the cracks in our strategic partnership with Russia - on energy, on Kosovo and on human rights.
Those fissures have become fault lines that are now so deep and so wide that we are hard pressed to say how meaningful 'partnership' based on common values can be pursued.
By Mr Putin's own admission, 'Russia will not soon become, if it ever becomes, a country where liberal values have deep historical roots'.
How long can we go on ignoring the growing evidence?
Not that Russians refuse the cultural trappings of the West, because President Putin has spoken time and again of his country's place at the cultural heart of Europe.
No, this vehemence, this denial, is directed primarily against what President Barroso calls Europe's 'sacred values' - values like freedom, democracy and the rule of law, which are conspicuously absent in Russia today.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra was right.
From the Council and the Commission we have heard too much Realpolitik and not enough Moralpolitik.
Our relationship with Russia is strategic, certainly, but it cannot be described as a partnership.
We need a pragmatic approach, cooperating where we can on issues of mutual concern, like border crossings, energy supply, and joining the WTO - although yesterday's announcement on price controls on foodstuffs suggests a return to the economic policies of the past.
Some progress can be made with Russia, but without the fanfare, followed by frustration, which marks too many EU-Russia summits.
A bit more honesty is needed, too, as Russia comes up to two major elections.
If human cloning were better developed, President Putin would probably run for both President and Prime Minister following the KaczyÅskis' example in Poland!
For a country which overturned oligarchy back in 1917, it is quite incredible that a new autocracy is gaining ground, and we should not cut down our criticisms for fear of endangering a partnership which exists but on paper.
Only when an independent judiciary, freedom of expression and democracy exist as more than sound bites and when journalists, opposition parties, and NGOs can operate without fear of retribution, can Europe stand in solidarity with Russia.
It is for that reason that my Group sought a resolution to close this debate, and over 300 MEPs backed our calls.
We must be prepared to put on paper what we say in public and refute those who say this House is nothing but a glorified talking shop.
The Reform Treaty promises Parliament a real say on external action for the first time.
So let us raise our game to meet the challenge and deliver at the summit a message that President Putin cannot ignore.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The decision taken yesterday by the leaders of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats not to adopt a resolution prior to the EU-Russia Summit demonstrates that we still have a problem with Russia.
The decision amounts to a serious error.
This is not the kind of Franco-German engine we expect in our part of Europe.
Our resolution of 2 May in advance of the Samara Summit was very helpful.
I trust our silence today is not indicative of an attempt to depart from a clearly defined and demanding policy towards Russia.
If the approach adopted at Samara is undermined, Russia will become ever more convinced that integration and especially the 2004 enlargement are developments that may be disregarded or played down.
The politicians who are currently attempting to turn a blind eye to Russia's move towards dictatorship in the name of pseudo-realism are acquiescing to a repeat of the Finnish case.
They are consenting to discrimination against Central Europe and therefore to weakening the European Union's position as a global partner.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen.
Minister, you said in your introduction that relations with Russia are good, or anyway better than is reported in the international press.
Minister, are you living on Mars?
Are you living on Venus?
Do you dare to tell the Russians what matters, or is the European Union for you ultimately just about money and naked commerce?
Is that more important to you than democracy and human rights?
Let us not mince words: Russia is sliding down the slippery slope to becoming a full-blown dictatorship with a strong leader: a strong leader who will not tolerate any protest and who deploys his secret FSB police whenever he thinks it necessary; a leader who will not give up power under any condition and who will use all kind of trickery to keep his hands on the reins of power after the parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March.
Russia, Minister, is evolving into a closed society where the ruling regime would prefer not to allow anyone to look over its shoulders.
I do not want to confine myself to theoretical considerations.
The reality is that human rights in Russia are constantly under pressure and the state of democracy there is lamentable.
The reality is that freedom of speech and press freedom are succumbing to a strict self-censorship.
The recently passed law on extremism can easily be used to gag independent journalists and political opponents.
The reality is that the Russian regime sees a strong and independent civil society as undesirable and that the position of NGOs is coming under severe pressure due to very restrictive legislation.
The reality is, Minister, that free elections are utopia there.
Only those who are tolerated by the regime can take part.
The 'Other Russia' coalition united around Gary Kasparov, for instance, has been stopped from taking part in the imminent parliamentary elections.
To conclude, Minister, the situation in Chechnya may not be a topical issue in politics any more but the reality there is still extremely worrying.
People are still being murdered, people are being picked up and detained illegally, people are being blackmailed; kidnappings are still a daily occurrence and torture is standard practice.
That is the reality in Russia, Minister, and I hope that you will remember this when you speak to Mr Putin at the end of this week.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, stability and development in Europe and the world are impossible without sensible cooperation between the European Union and Russia.
What would I like to see, in contrast to Samara?
What I would like is for you to come back and tell us that you have a common strategy with Russia for the resolution of the Kosovo problem and a common strategy for the peace process in the Middle East, and that you have a common position on the nuclear problem in Iran and a common strategy to solve the Transnistria problem.
It is not just about energy supplies.
Let us forget about Galileo.
Industry does not want it, and the taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill.
Let us work with Russia on a sensible energy policy using new technologies.
Let us solve the problem of visa-free travel with Russia.
Why have we still not made much progress here, only for these specific groups?
In my view, there is a great deal that could be done.
What will be the European Union's position on the missile shield?
Will we stand with Russia and say that we do not want a US defence shield?
I think it would be wonderful if we could achieve that.
Of course, we also have to be critical of Russia and tell Russia that if I speak out against the anti-terrorism plans being forged by Mr SchÃ€uble and Mr Jung in Germany, then I must also say to Russia that I do not want this anti-discrimination law.
That is quite clear.
If our view is that the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with human rights, we need to make that very clear to the Russians, but we also need to follow up on it afterwards.
I think that if we have a sensible partnership agreement, this is something that good partners can and must say to each other.
We need Russia and Russia needs us, and we will go forward together if we put all the issues on the table and, above all, outline ways of resolving them.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, if we want to stand our ground in global terms, it is necessary that the EU as a strong grouping and Russia as a superpower integrate their economies.
Only in this way will they be capable of facing up to unavoidable political pressures, which might otherwise divide this rational partnership.
As it stands, Russian exports to the EU, excluding energy-related trade, correspond approximately to those to Morocco or Argentina.
This is why I support the appeal by the Trade Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, who asked the EU and Russia to stop acting as two cities connected only by a narrow road and a gas pipeline.
I am convinced that both partners should focus on building long-term, mutually advantageous economic and trade relations and not allow short-term political tactics to take over.
I believe that it is in the interests of EU citizens that the EU acts with consistency towards Russia, which is not the case at present.
We should push for the establishment of a more stable political and entrepreneurial climate in Russia, which would encompass fewer obstacles to imports and create a better platform for investors from the EU.
(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two ways of examining the EU's relations with Russia.
We can see them either as problems or as opportunities.
As we know, at present both are in plentiful supply.
Last week in Lisbon, Union leaders took a step towards a more coherent foreign policy.
Could not policy on Russia be the first port of call for both sides, which is to say for Russia too?
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement needs revamping, and we know it.
In the area of the Northern Dimension something has been achieved in matters relating to the Baltic Sea, but we must move on to new areas.
The road maps exist, but there are not many travellers on the road.
We have endorsed Russian membership of the WTO.
We need to finalise the agreement.
Then the duty on timber and illegal charges imposed at borders which Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner mentioned would be kept in check.
We are completely dependent on one another in the matter of energy, but that dependence needs to work both ways.
Exports represent dependence just as much as imports.
We therefore need to end the dumb act with Russia.
Unfortunately, the situation has been going on for a long time, but I salute Poland's new leader, who wanted to improve relations with Russia, and Germany too.
Russia is obviously more of a problem.
Talks must also achieve results in the area of citizens' rights, and not just when it is a matter of goods.
I would ask the Council if the timber duties will be mentioned at the summit.
Furthermore, what about the new law in Russia regarding the practice whereby a suspect is not handed over for questioning in the country in which the crime has occurred?
That is a strange procedure.
In other words, a criminal who commits an offence in a Member State can seek asylum in Russia.
Will the Council be addressing this issue at the summit?
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from listening to this whole debate and the statements from the Council and the Commission, it has become abundantly clear how difficult it is, with respect to Russia, to combine the requisite respect for that large and important country and that large and important people with the propagation of our fundamental principles on the rule of law, a functioning democracy, free media and respect for human rights.
It is difficult to find the right balance, all the more so since President Putin, like no other, understands the art of exploiting every difference of opinion or different nuance of opinion between the Member States.
We have heard that there are soon to be elections in Russia and we know this will be in a few weeks' time.
In this context I want to stress that the conditions being imposed on parties which are not represented in the Duma are completely unworthy of a democracy.
Whether we are talking about the amount of the deposit, the number of signatures required, the checks on this - look at what happened in St Petersburg a few months ago - on not one of these points do they meet the criteria that we and the rest of the world would consider constitute free and fair elections.
In other words, things do not bode well at all.
We have also heard some very worrying reports about attempts to keep a close check on students' contacts and people on visitors' programmes.
In other words - and I am coming to the end now Mr President - the Member States need to remain more united and vigilant than ever to allow cooperation to continue.
(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is an important partner, but its policies are a cause for concern.
No statues of Mr Putin have been erected in the streets of Russia as yet, but there are signs of a personality cult.
The candidacy of the State President in parliamentary elections is an unknown precedent in the history of a democratic state, just like the nomination of the head of the radical movement 'Nashi' for the post of minister for youth affairs and the refusal to receive a delegation from the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights.
Russia's manipulations of foreign nations are dangerous.
Investigations in Latvia show that Russia's support for peoples is radically opposed to the integration of society.
I also fear that the history of the political activities of those persons who recently organised the Russian forum at the European Parliament gives cause to believe there may be destructive plans in other European states.
Our duty is to combat these manipulations, since Russia is pushing the limits of our patience.
In relation to the dialogue on energy, it is necessary for the principles and ratification of the Energy Charter to form an integral component of the new agreement, in spite of Moscow's dissatisfaction with the reciprocity clause.
Thank you.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear!
The decision we took yesterday will be interpreted - and already has been in fact - by the Russian authorities as a great success: no resolution, no message.
That is a real bonus following the rejection of an official human rights delegation from the European Parliament.
Russian society is, more than ever, hostage to a propagandist press and is retreating into dangerous nationalism.
Today in Russia violence based on fear prevails while racism and xenophobia are taking hold.
The word 'independent' can no longer be used.
'Independent' human rights activists, journalists or political opponents are automatically labelled 'enemies of the regime'.
A law adopted in 2007 is officially devoted to them.
Under the guise of combating extremism, it actually gives the authorities complete freedom in this unfair fight.
As Marie Mendras told us yesterday, this climate of permanent violation of human rights is not spurring the people there into action.
Mr Putin's gamble has thus paid off: he has managed to convince his fellow citizens that Russia has its own special rules when it comes to democracy and human rights.
With such a belief, it is no surprise whatsoever that Russia is still the last member of the Council of Europe not to have ratified Protocol 14.
This is for Putin a godsend, a blessing.
It means that he does not have to comply with the rulings and can prevent the cases from going anywhere, particularly those of tortured Chechens.
In light of this situation, it would be naive to think that free and transparent elections will take place in Russia on 2 December.
Given the circumstances, are they not really just a plebiscite for or against Vladimir Putin?
Without any amendment to the Constitution, he will continue to have power over all political, economic, financial, administrative, judicial and security matters.
On the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, I am calling on the Council and the Commission to include human rights at the highest political level.
It is vital that they play a key role, whether discussing the future agreement, Kosovo or energy.
That is what Russian democrats ask of us. They simply say: 'Continue to talk about them, continue to tell the truth'.
At least we are not risking our lives when doing so.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, debate on the EU-Russia relationship is one of the most frequent themes in this House.
The same clichÃ©s are regularly heard, whether intentional or motivated by misunderstanding or ignorance of the issues.
In spite of this, whether or not we want to, we must deal with Russia as a partner.
If we cannot find a shared language and do not strive to gradually improve relationships, the EU will suffer from it more than Russia.
This does not imply closing our eyes to difficulties, but rather looking reality in the face and judging everyone by the same measure.
It is a fact that today's Russia is stronger economically and is as a consequence more self-confident.
It also protects its own interests just as the US does or for that matter the EU.
We need a sober approach.
This is why I am happy that by postponing the resolution we gave a freer hand to our representatives at the summit in Portugal.
Today's Russia is not the former Soviet Union.
I am saying this not only from my own long experience of work in this country, but also on the basis of words borrowed from the head of American diplomacy.
(NL) Madam President, I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office and the President of the Commission.
I do not plan to measure the success of the summit by the length of the final joint declaration.
What is important to me - and I hope this will be discussed - is that we flesh out the details on those topics where we know that we have to find solutions together.
Relations between the EU and Russia are incredibly complex.
That is not going to change at this election time.
However, we really must acknowledge that for Russia and the EU there is no economic and political alternative to partnership.
Madam President, we have an excellent agreement for that partnership.
It has been in place now for ten years.
How are we going to handle that creatively in the future?
The summit is also an important occasion to ask for clarification about the concept of democracy and I thank the Commission for what it plans to do on this point.
What always strikes me is that in Russia stability and democracy are seen as opposites; that is not and never can be our view, of course.
It is very important for all of us that Russia enters the WTO.
(DE) Madam President, there is not much point in playing Realpolitik and Moralpolitik off against each other, as Mr Watson has said.
The fact is that we need both: in our dealings with Russia, we need to be realistic and we need to be clear and firm about our ethical and moral standpoint.
Many of us thought that, after the collapse of communism, Russia would simply vanish from the world stage, and that is what many people wanted.
However, that did not happen.
It did not happen mainly because, due to rising energy prices, Russia has been able to increase its revenues and thus regain power in the international arena.
We have to recognise that; if we do not, we fail to recognise reality.
There is something that we do not want to accept, however, and that of course is the negative developments, and both the Council Presidency and the Commissioner have made that clear.
We are not prepared simply to accept that more and more steps are being taken to dismantle democracy in Russia.
These are steps which we cannot accept and which have nothing to do with democracy-building and everything to do with its erosion.
We do not want to accept that Russia, unfortunately, is unwilling to offer its neighbours - our common neighbours - an open partnership.
That would be in our interests, and we should make it very clear that we want to work with Russia to foster this partnership, but with a Russia which recognises the independence and sovereignty of all its neighbours.
What we cannot accept is a situation in which Russia rightly seeks to influence other countries through its membership of the Council of Europe or the OSCE, for example, yet on the other hand does not wish to take on responsibility and therefore objects to election observation, for instance.
We should not distrust the elections on principle, but a country such as Russia which thinks that it has fully developed its democracy must also allow some measure of scrutiny.
If Russia wishes to play a major role in the Council of Europe and the OSCE, then we must call on Russia to demonstrate this by admitting election observers to ascertain whether its own elections are transparent and fair.
That is the clear message that the European Union should be sending to Russia.
(PL) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that as we debate relations between Russia and the European Union we should ask ourselves what Russia wants from the European Union and what the European Union expects from Russia.
A certain Russian politician has stated that Russia should now opt for a so-called policy of containment.
If Russia does indeed do so, this will in a sense imply a return to the Cold War era.
We should consider what exactly Russia would be attempting to contain.
Perhaps the winds of freedom, originating in the European Union?
This is a major problem.
At the same time, the European Union claims to be seeking a strategic partnership with Russia.
The challenge is certainly a difficult one, and we would do well to bear in mind that the principles of the rule of law are an essential prerequisite to developing a sound partnership with Russia.
The rule of law involves the independence of the courts.
It involves freedom for the media, freedom of expression and economic freedom.
It also involves not jailing entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, it involves applying the principles of the rule of law in the area of international relations, which implies unfreezing the conflicts in the Caucasus and in Moldova and urging the international community to take up the issue of Kosovo.
(PL) Madam President, the EU-Russia Summit coincides with a crucial time in the history of Russia, namely the end of Mr Putin's era.
Will this era really come to an end, though?
The presidential elections in the Russian Federation will not result in change.
Power will remain in the hands of the same individual who will this time bear the title of Prime Minister.
Andrei Lugovoi, the alleged murderer of Alexander Litvinenko, is set to become a Member of Parliament, thus acquiring immunity.
The Russian authorities are therefore openly protecting an individual who appears to have committed a serious crime on the territory of the European Union.
In so doing, they are sending out a clear message that the Kremlin's interests take precedence over all laws and over respect for European Union Member States.
Nothing will change after the elections.
The people of Chechnya will continue to be exterminated, the press will continue to be silenced, and the Kremlin's abundant reserves of natural resources will allow it to continue implementing a brutal foreign policy.
I very much hope that the European Union's representatives will bear this in mind during their talks with the Russian delegation.
Our representatives should also remember that the talks themselves are not significant.
They will only become so if they lead to genuine changes within the Russian Federation.
Madam President, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner to provide this House with assurances, as was requested yesterday, that the views expressed by it will be put directly to President Putin and to his advisers at Mafra on Friday.
We have heard about the three guiding principles, which President Barroso describes as sacred principles, of solidarity, reciprocity and the rule of law.
Being Portuguese, the President-in-Office will know that my own country, England, has one of the oldest of alliances with his country.
We therefore understand what solidarity and mutual support means.
If we forget, our mutual patron saint, SÃ£o Jorge, is there to remind us.
An attack on one Member State or on one Member State's diplomats, or cyber attacks on one Member State, are an attack on the whole of the EU.
It is surely appropriate that President Putin be reminded that this solidarity and reciprocity are essential to us.
We cannot accept the concept of sovereign democracy if it means, on the one hand, that Russia accedes to international organisations - Commissioner, you have referred to the WTO - promising to abide by undertakings, and then fails to meet those undertakings.
That has to be underlined.
Tomorrow, Mikhail Khodorkovsky comes to the end of his four-year prison sentence in Siberia.
According to Russian law, that sentence should have been served in Moscow.
It might be appropriate to remind President Putin that the rule of law is a two-way thing, as far as our relationship is concerned.
Mr Khodorkovsky will not be freed, as new charges have been raised.
You might ask what relevance this has to the EU.
The answer is that many EU shareholders are concerned that commercial and legal commitments are not being followed through.
Finally, President-in-Office, we are not condemned to cooperation, and cannot have a partnership without mutual respect and mutual understanding.
We are trying very hard from our side to ensure that.
We need assurances from President Putin that he understands our guiding principles.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the words of Minister Antunes when he says that the EU-Russia relationship is stronger and more solid than it might at first glance appear.
The EU and Russia share an interest in a strategic partnership.
After all we inhabit the same continent.
There is a mutual economic dependency.
Without a mutual collaboration we cannot solve any serious international issue, be it global warming, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, conflict in the Middle East or in Kosovo, and so on. In other words, strong, versatile and balanced neighbourly relations between the EU and Russia have a fundamental bearing on the stability, security and prosperity of the whole of Europe.
While cultivating and strengthening this relationship we should not forget, however, the fundamental values underlying the EU, such as human rights and civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law.
I am convinced that we should keep reminding our Russian colleagues of these values now in relation to the imminent elections in Russia.
At the upcoming summit in Mafra, the EU should also be reminding our Russian partners of the principles of transparency and reciprocity in economic relations.
European markets should in fact remain open to Russian firms.
Equally, however, Russian markets should be fully open to European firms, including the energy markets and associated firms.
(EL) Madam President, the transition to a new Strategic Partnership between the EU and Russia is not an easy undertaking.
It is hampered by successive divergences, which are sometimes a source of considerable tension.
Over-dramatisation of these divergences allows the constraining patterns of the past to re-emerge, makes the present uncertain and hinders constructive progress.
Some reasonable questions may be asked about the EU-Russia partnership.
Has Russia come to terms with the reality of the enlarged Union?
Has the Union got over its teething troubles with expansion in the east?
Do the new Member States feel they are participating in an effective European security system?
How is the Union responding to Russia's attempt to redefine and strengthen its new role in the international balance of powers?
Will the two sides continue in a climate of distrust and 'quiet diplomacy', or will they seek to achieve common action plans?
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that sector-based approaches alone are not the best option.
The declared aim of creating four common spaces must remain politically binding, and likewise the aim of Russia's accession to the WTO.
Broad, robust partnership structures are therefore needed for cooperation in the areas of: economic issues; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research, education and culture.
Russophobia is inappropriate for an EU based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.
I understand the sensitivities among some citizens of the new Member States, but over-emphasis on past experiences may cast doubt on the prospects for transparent political cooperation and close institutional interconnection.
President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is in the mutual interests of the Union and Russia to set common political and economic targets for the sake of democratic principle, peace, stability and security.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by highlighting the importance of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, and by stating my affection for the people of the Russian Federation, and indeed for all the nations of Russia.
I also wish to recognise Russia's achievements in terms of economic development and dealing with the social crisis.
A genuine strategic partnership demands a serious and honest approach to mutual relations, however.
The European Union has noted with concern the emergence of a new system of authority centred on President Putin.
This system threatens to permanently weaken liberal democracy in Russia itself.
It is also fanning the flames of neo-imperialism in Russian foreign policy.
In the documents it has prepared in advance of the EU-Russia Summit, Amnesty International draws attention to human rights violations in Russia.
The information provided by Amnesty relates to the infringement of human rights by governmental authorities in the northern Caucasus, notably in Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the worsening situation regarding freedom of expression and association, to the murder of journalists and to the increase in racially-motivated violence.
The Portuguese Presidency should raise the issues referred to by Amnesty International at the summit due to take place in Mafra on 26 October 2007.
Russian civil society, journalists and human rights activists need to be able to perceive the European Union as a guardian of fundamental rights and as an ally of a Russia that is democratic, liberal and open to the world.
(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the EU-Russia Summit will prompt us to pause for a moment and define our common interests for once, for these common interests undoubtedly exist.
They include economic interests and security policy interests, notably on issues such as the Middle East, Iran and combating terrorism and so on, where we must recognise that we cannot achieve our objectives without Russia on board.
However, Russia must also understand that if it does not come on board, it will be undermining its own interests.
Looking at Russia's demographic development and the vast expanses of Siberia, and at the countries with large populations here, if I were on the Russian side, I would not be imagining a threat from Europe.
In the long term, I would see the threat as coming from elsewhere.
I think that here, there is a high level of consensus on where we need to act.
On the so-called Western side, we - and I include the Americans here - did not really take Russia seriously when things were going badly for that country, with the result that it is now reverting to a more imperialist type of behaviour.
This also applies to developments in Russia itself, notably in respect of human rights and press freedom, and its increasingly frequent and unacceptable statements concerning the independence of its neighbours.
It is not acceptable that demands are being made of Russia's 'near abroad' to the effect that certain types of conduct must be adopted towards a specific country.
Every country has the right to take its decisions on a free and independent basis, and to determine where its path should lead.
Russia has to accept that.
There can be no reversion to outdated notions and the use of energy as a weapon, which is even less acceptable.
We can only move forward if we embark on a careful analysis of our interests again.
I think that, once the elections are over in Russia, this will again be possible, and I also hope that it will stop Russia from proceeding down the wrong economic path.
The large amounts of revenue flowing into the country from its oil and gas operations are being used to revitalise the old heavy-industrial combines in the aerospace, shipbuilding and similar sectors.
If the situation takes a turn for the worse, they will face the same disastrous scenario as before, for Russia has not built up a sound, broad-based economic structure with small and medium-sized enterprises, and the consequences of that failure are obvious.
It is in our interests, too, to ensure that no new vacuums emerge in Russia if oil prices fall.
(PT) The summit may prove useful in resolving the ambiguities that continue to affect relations between the European Union and Moscow.
However, Minister Amado has already been careful to lower the bar by explaining that the Presidency does not have an ambitious agenda for the Mafra summit.
In a recent interview with LUSA, his counterpart, Mr Lavrov, complained about the growing disease in the European Union, alluding to the unconstructive attitude of certain members.
Yet what is poisoning our relations is the slow death of democracy, human rights, freedom of the press and rule of law in Russia and the impunity with which former members of the security forces are defining the agenda of the Russian Federation.
This is worrying European public opinion and is reflected in our relations.
The growing disease in the European Union, namely disagreement, is being treated and the Reform Treaty is a potent remedy.
Unfortunately, there is no cure in sight for the drift towards autocracy of Putin's Russia and, if the Council of the European Union continues to shut its eyes to the situation, it will take even longer to find a cure.
(ET) Yesterday a Hungarian puppet show opened in Parliament.
I was struck by the thought of how we sometimes vote here, by numbly raising our hands.
Have we become puppets too?
There are rumours of back-door deals on a proposal by the Presidency to allow the resolution on Russia to slip through, ostensibly so that it would not cloud the atmosphere of the European Union-Russia summit.
It is scandalous that we so meekly surrender our own stance on self-expression.
This is the best example of how Europe has failed to understand that the problem in relations with Russia lies not in the details but in how we conduct ourselves.
Previously the European Parliament has opposed situations such as these, but today it would appear to me that the fear which continues to paralyse Russian society has begun to affect us.
Why are we repeatedly making exceptions for Russia?
Do we continue to believe as before in our own principles or do we allow the thought to force its way into our heads that Russia is so different that not only our pancakes but our relations as a partnership must be after the Russian fashion.
Such behaviour is destructive to both sides, to the European Union as well as to Russia itself.
Madam President, I think it is high time to face realities.
Mr Watson has said that there are cracks in the present cooperation mechanism which are developing towards becoming fissures.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement declares that we share the same values.
However, some years ago, Chris Patten wrote that he does not believe that we really share the same values at this point.
The traditional feature of Russian state policies is pretending - building Potemkin villages - and Mr Putin is still pretending to have democracy while having almost completed building up the authoritarian highly nationalist state.
We also pretend that the coming elections will be crucial.
I doubt it, because everything has been prepared to manipulate these elections and to obtain results in accordance with Mr Putin's wishes, including artificial opposition parties and the creation of phoney NGOs.
If we now agree to play along with this game of pretending, pretending we believe in this sort of democracy, we are going to take co-responsibility for what is going to happen in Russia and for the fate of ordinary Russians who deserve better than this fake democracy.
I strongly disagree, therefore, with the Council statement that there is no alternative to cooperation.
Democracy is based upon creating and having alternatives and we also have to commit ourselves to strongly defending human rights.
We have to balance our relations and we have to signal that we are prepared to stop our cooperation if Russia does not answer with reciprocity and openness.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to all the speeches made here today on the imminent summit between the European Union and Russia and in general on relations between the EU and Russia and also on Russia's internal situation as you see it.
I must say that, as of course is my duty, I have duly noted and will take due account of these opinions.
In my view, there is one common thread running through all the comments and analyses made here today which is that Russia is a strategic partner for the European Union.
The EU needs Russia in the same way that Russia needs the EU.
It is based on this absolutely undeniable finding that we must build a relationship which is course mutually beneficial but which is also solid and firm, based on common values and principles.
Mention has been made of solidarity, human rights and reciprocity.
Now more than ever the European Union must stand firm before Russia in terms of its internal solidarity.
A problem for one Member State - and I have always said this - is a problem for all Member States.
This solidarity cannot under any circumstances be called into question.
On the issue of human rights, we all know that at the root of our Union lies respect for rule of law, democracy and human rights.
These are our inalienable values and principles which must guide our relations with third countries in all cases.
For our part, we must of course ensure reciprocity.
However, in so doing, we are also entitled to expect reciprocity from others.
If, at this moment in time, there are fracture lines as the Member has stated, I consider that the European Union and Russia can only stand to gain by doing everything possible within the reference framework that I mentioned, in other words a framework of solidarity, reciprocity and respect for human rights.
It is certainly essential for the European Union that these fractures are healed and so this is what we are going to work towards.
In our work we will naturally be aware of the difficulties and different goals, but we will also be determined as we are also aware that the current situation does not serve the best interests of the Union.
It is of course our duty to work in the interests of the European Union and we will do this openly and transparently, by talking face to face as we must always do with partners who we regard as strategic.
It will certainly be an intense and important dialogue.
We will talk about economics, trade, human rights and of course the international political situation and the regional political situation.
We hope - and this is what we will work towards - that, despite the difficulties, problems and differences of opinion, despite everything, we will be able, at the end of this summit on Friday, to say that some progress has been made in our relations and that, despite the difficulties, we have managed to achieve our objectives.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on some of the points made.
The debate has made one thing very clear: the very wide relationship of tension here today.
I am still of the opinion that Russia is a strategic partner.
However, I also said that it is of course a neighbour country and that is why it is especially important to take issues such as those raised by Graham Watson, Christopher Beazley and others very seriously.
We do indeed take them seriously.
Let us just cast a glance back to the previous summit in Samara.
On that occasion, Angela Merkel, as the President of the Council, put her cards on the table, not only in the meeting but also to the media.
Please do not think, therefore, that these values are not important to us.
We know that there are some very worrying developments as regards media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, and the issue of fairness, also in relation to the elections.
All the issues which have been raised today are of course the right ones.
However, let me also say that Elmar Brok's comments describe a little of my own view, namely that we need to define our interests clearly.
On the one hand, there are very substantial security issues at stake here, of course, while on the other, there are human rights and democratic interests.
It is also important, of course, to mention the three major principles which Mr Beazley has referred to: solidarity, reciprocity and the rule of law.
Naturally, they appear in various forms and we cannot argue with that.
You are absolutely right, Mr Beazley, but I can assure you that they will be on the table as well.
I know that President Barroso will address these issues very clearly, especially in the context of energy, for example.
As you are aware, the Commission has just adopted a package of measures which point in this direction.
We want clear rules here which are upheld by everyone in the interests of true reciprocity.
Having said that, I would just like to remind you of one point: the more we are prepared genuinely to speak with one voice in the European Union, the stronger we will be.
As we all know, we do not always manage to do that.
However, the stronger Russia becomes, the more we should speak with one voice.
We have this energy dependence, but we can only defend our interests effectively if we send out a strong and clear message.
Perhaps we have not paid enough attention to that in the past, and when Russia was in a weaker economic position, so to speak, we probably did not give it enough support.
Today, however, we must pursue a position which is based on reciprocity and seek a genuine partnership approach, but this means that Russia must recognise what is important to us as well.
Six motions for a resolution to wind up the debate have been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) In connection with the EU-Russia summit, I would like to draw attention to a few factors concerning energy policy.
It is no exaggeration to say that the rules of the market economy are not applied at present in the Russian energy industry.
Russia does not identify with the principles of protecting foreign investment and non-discriminatory trade.
It seeks admission to the European energy sector, but meanwhile does not open its own market to foreign businesses.
In matters relating to energy in recent years, we have also seen Moscow use its energy exports to exert political pressure on numerous occasions.
This has gone hand in hand with efforts aimed at sowing discord among European Union Member States.
When devising a common European energy policy, we need to take into consideration the fact that Russia is already unable to meet its natural gas consumption and export requirements from its own gas resources.
A not insignificant percentage of its gas requirement is therefore imported from Central Asia.
A decline in supplies could mean Moscow using politics to an even greater extent as the basis for fulfilling its energy orders in future.
We believe it is important to apply the principle of free competition in the European Union's foreign relations too.
We must make it clear that we consider it unacceptable to try to create a monopoly over energy resources.
Ensuring a stable energy supply is a fundamental concern of the European Union.
We are convinced that the mounting pressure being exerted on Member States can be combated successfully only by a united European Union acting on the principle of Community solidarity.
At present it is impossible to conceive of Europe's energy supply without Russia.
At the same time, however, this special relationship must be based on reciprocity.
Now and in the past, the EU and Russia have been linked by their common history, strong economic and political contacts and shared traditions.
Their close cooperation has deepened further through the ongoing process of globalisation and the European countries' growing demand for fossil fuels.
In order to safeguard energy supplies in future too, the EU Member States have relied on more intensive cooperation in this sector since the 1990s.
The Energy Charter is a key instrument in this context.
This treaty serves to promote the development of the Eastern European countries' energy potential while guaranteeing the EU Member States' continued energy supply.
As the line between foreign policy/external trade issues and energy supply issues is becoming increasingly blurred, Russia's failure to ratify the Energy Charter is worrying.
In this respect, the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights must never be put at risk, also in the EU's external relations.
In light of the strong economic interdependence between the EU and Russia, threatening economic gestures can never be a useful means by which to achieve foreign policy objectives and must therefore be rejected.
I urge the Commission and the Council to withstand Russian attempts to secure unilateral advantages in the European energy markets.
Full reciprocity in market liberalisation and protection of investments must be safeguarded.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. for the award of the LUX Prize and resumed at 12.00 noon)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I have a request to make to the President of Parliament, not to you as President in the Chair, but to the President of the House.
I have a request to make on behalf of my Group.
However, I am sure I speak for all democratic groups in the House.
I take the view, as do my colleagues, that the matter which I wish to raise is so serious that I must ask President PÃ¶ttering to take action against the individuals I am about to name.
Major protests have occurred in Budapest over the last two days.
There is nothing unusual about that: demonstrations are a normal occurrence in Europe's capitals, and they sometimes spiral into violence.
One might certainly object to that, but they cannot be prevented.
However, there is a new dimension to the events that have occurred in Budapest in recent days, and I would like to tell you why.
You can think what you like about Prime Minister GyurcsÃ¡ny.
You may be for him, or you may be against him.
What is not acceptable, ladies and gentlemen ...
(Uproar in the Chamber)
You may be for Prime Minister GyurcsÃ¡ny or you may be against him.
What is not acceptable, ladies and gentlemen - and I suggest that you look very carefully to see who is already trying to shout me down - what is not acceptable is that a Prime Minister in the European Union is branded a 'dirty Jew' during demonstrations.
That adds a new dimension, and it is a dimension of the Fascists, on this side of the House.
(Sustained applause)
I would be grateful, Mr President, if you would ask Mr PÃ¶ttering to express the House's overwhelming support for the issuing of a reprimand to these people.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Thank you very much.
I think that the message has been fully understood but I will of course pass it on.
Mr President, I rise on a completely different matter.
I should just like to express, on behalf of many in my Group and I am sure of many others, our thanks to you for organising this presentation of the LUX Prize.
It is the kind of thing we have not done as a Parliament before.
It is the kind of thing we should do, and, as a former Swedish Prime Minister once said, 'politicians would do well to go the cinema more often'.
(Applause)
Thank you, I am grateful to you for your comments.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of reminding you that today we are celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the United Nations.
You should have received in the last few days a copy of the message from the UN Secretary-General to mark the occasion.
I also wish to inform you of the official launch today in the European Parliament in Strasbourg of the annual report on cooperation between the European Union and the UN on crisis management, development and the promotion of democracy and fundamental rights.
This act is testament to the importance of the relationship between our institutions, our common commitment to multilateralism and the importance of us working together for the peace and welfare of our fellow citizens.
Statement by the President: see Minutes
Welcome
I have the pleasure of telling you that, in the framework of interparliamentary meetings, a Mauritanian delegation, led by Mr Ould Tolba, is currently visiting the European Parliament.
I would like to wish our guests a warm welcome and emphasise the importance we place on such a visit, the first in Europe for almost 10 years.
Through its election observation missions the European Union has been paying close attention to the recent political transition in Mauritania, which could set an example for the region.
We congratulate you on the democratic election of your Head of State and Parliament and, on behalf of this Parliament, I hope that your meetings here are fruitful and that your visit to Strasbourg can actively contribute to bringing our two institutions closer together.
Thank you once again for your visit.

Immunity and privileges of Gian Paolo Gobbo (vote)
- Report: Wallis
- Before the vote:
Mr President, I believe that the next report is the report by Mrs Wallis. On behalf of my Group, the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group, I would like to invoke Rule 168 and table a motion for this report to be referred back to committee.
Mr President, this motion is based on Rule 168 of our Rules of Procedure.
Upon reading Mrs Wallis's report it is very clear that the rapporteur and perhaps the committee are confused over Article 9 and Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
The report states that Mr Gobbo's behaviour did not comply with Article 9 but Article 9 refers to the words and acts of the Member in the exercise of his functions, notably in this Chamber.
Consequently, it was not Article 9 of the Protocol that should have been examined, but Article 10, which refers to other acts by a Member. What needed to be examined was whether or not Mr Gobbo's acts - which, I must add, I do not support on a political level - fell into the political sphere.
These acts obviously do fall within the political sphere.
Mr Gobbo committed a number of acts in the name of what he calls 'Padania'.
These are naturally political acts and there is no doubt that, given the traditional case-law on immunity, a Member of any other political bent would have had his immunity confirmed, as was the case in the Italian Parliament for the national members of parliament who carried out the same actions as Mr Gobbo.
As a result, if Mrs Wallis's report is adopted as it stands, we risk introducing a distinction, a form of discrimination between national immunity and European immunity, contrary to the Protocol, which refers precisely to national immunity.
That is why I believe that this report should be referred back to committee.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am in favour of referring the matter back to committee, although my reasons might be a little different.
In actual fact, judging by Rules 5, 6 and 7 of the Rules of Procedure and Articles 9 and 10 of the Protocol, Parliament clearly is not competent to express a view on the facts alleged against Mr Gobbo, simply because at the time of those facts Gian Paolo Gobbo was not a Member of the European Parliament.
Article 9 of the Protocol, which safeguards MEPs' freedom of expression, refers to people who were Members of this House when they used certain terms or committed acts identifiable with them.
Since Mr Gobbo was not an MEP at the time of the facts, I believe that the most proper solution should be for Parliament to refrain from taking a stance because he was not a colleague of ours.
rapporteur. - Mr President, as the author of this report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can confirm to the House that there was a full debate in committee before the report was presented in plenary.
The committee also heard from Mr Gobbo, and there was a clear majority in favour of the report.
It is a shame that Mr Gollnisch did not raise the issues he mentioned before, but I am perfectly comfortable and perfectly confident that the committee adopted its position in full knowledge of all the facts and all the regulations.
I see no reason why the report should now be referred back to that committee.
(Parliament rejected the request to refer the matter back to committee)

Draft amending budget No 6/2007 (vote)
- Report: Elles
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Commission.
In its preliminary draft amending budget 6/2007, the Commission proposed the creation of a new budget item - 'Damage requests resulting from legal procedures against the Commission's decisions in the field of competition' and the classification of the related expenditure under Heading 1a of the multiannual financial framework as it refers to an operational activity in the competition policy area.
The Commission would charge against this budget item possible budgetary implications stemming from rulings of the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance in the field of competition.
The need for this budget item derives from recent judgments of the Court of First Instance and from the structure of the budget.
While fines in the field of competition policy are entered as general budget revenue, the amounts to be paid require the creation of a budget item in the expenditure side of the budget, which does not exist at the moment.
The Commission takes note that the budgetary authority does not intend to support the creation of this budget item for the year 2007.
Despite this decision, if necessary the Commission may have to proceed to payments in order to meet legal obligations that might result from the Court's decisions in 2007 within the limits of the current budget and in application of the relevant rules.
It does not prejudge the final decision on the creation of the dedicated budget line and on the classification of the related expenditure within the multiannual financial framework.

Protocol amending TRIPS (vote)
- Recommendation: Susta
- Before the vote:
Mr President, the basis for agreement with the Council on this report was a statement made by the Commission which was supposed to be read out yesterday during the debate.
However, that statement was not read out.
If the Council would agree to attach it to the Minutes or give it some kind of legal status and transparency, then that would help further the process on this issue.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, access to affordable pharmaceutical products in poor developing countries and LDCs is essential to attain the proposed EU development goals and would contribute to poverty reduction, increase human security and promote human rights and sustainable development.
I think we both agree on the importance of ensuring the coherence of EU policies and that consistency in the EU's external actions, namely trade and development policies, should go hand in hand.
We recognise that the mechanism created by the WTO decision and the protocol to the TRIPS Agreement represent just a part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health, and that other measures to improve health care and infrastructure are equally indispensable.
Even if the TRIPS amendment is not the complete solution, we believe that the positive acceptance of the protocol represents an important step.
To this effect, it is worth recalling that the Member States of the European Union remain free under WTO rules to use the different exceptions provided under the TRIPS Agreement in their domestic patent laws, including those provided for under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement.
Furthermore, in order to facilitate access to medicines in countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission all worked hard to adopt Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 on compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems.
Let me add that we support the use of the 'flexibilities' built into the TRIPS Agreement and recognised by paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Doha Declaration as well as the additional flexibilities for less-developed countries made available pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Doha Declaration, in order to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices under their domestic public health programmes.
In view of the Doha Declaration in the framework of the EPA negotiations with the ACP countries and other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries and LDCs, the European Union is not asking, and does not foresee asking, to negotiate pharmaceutical-related provisions, sometimes referred to as TRIPS+ provisions, affecting public health and access to medicines.
Finally, we look favourably upon initiatives encouraging the transfer of technology, research, capacity strengthening, regional supply systems and help with registration in order to facilitate and increase the production of pharmaceutical products by the developing countries themselves and we will work with Member States towards that end.
Concerning the corresponding measures and the budgetary procedures, we are sure that the commitment of the European Parliament which has raised the visibility of the issue of access to medicines will help to increase their efficiency.

Taxation and customs policies and the Lisbon Strategy (vote)
- Report: Wagenknecht
- Before the vote on paragraph 37:
Mr President, the change we would propose is that Parliament, at this stage, 'notes' rather than 'welcomes' that the Commission has forwarded a communication on loss relief, as work on the report on that topic is in progress in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
- Before the final vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is most regrettable that the House has not had the courage to voice genuine and serious criticism of a tax policy trend in the European Union which is moving in completely the wrong direction, which benefits multinational corporations and the wealthy to an unbelievable extent, while consumers, workers and especially the low-paid face an ever heavier tax burden.
In my view, the report is unacceptable as it stands.
I wish to withdraw my name from this report and appeal to everyone in this House who genuinely wants a tax policy for the European Union which not only serves the interests of the top ten thousand but genuinely benefits the majority of Europe's citizens: please, vote against this report.
We take note of your statement, Mrs Wagenknecht.

(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
(in writing). - (CS) It can be reasonably assumed that the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, as recommended for second reading (Council common position), will contribute towards reinforcing legal security of both natural persons and legal entities within the Member States.
It is well-known that the service of the above documents is a serious issue, with a significant impact on both the process of justice and civil and commercial relations.
I believe that the recommendation of the European Parliament is in line with the effort to produce high-quality legislation at Community level.
In relation to the agreements between the EC and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on readmission and the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas which are to be approved by the European Parliament, I believe that insofar as these agreements - and similar agreements with the Western Balkan countries - have a significance in terms of generally strengthening the rule of law and fighting against crime, issues related to illegal migration should be resolved first of all by economic and political means.
In addition, I would like to underline another important factor mentioned in the relevant reports which is that the conclusion of these agreements will imply a considerable financial burden for Macedonia and other Western Balkan countries.
Taking into account the economic situation in these states it is essential that the Community provide appropriate and effective assistance, in particular financial.
in writing. - (NL) I remember in the early '60s there were reciprocal visa requirements for inhabitants of the countries of the then European Community and those of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Shortly after that those visa requirements were abolished.
This meant that the populations of the seven countries that together still made up Yugoslavia at that time were free to travel throughout much of Europe.
Only for EU Member State Slovenia and candidate country Croatia has that not changed.
The inhabitants of all the other territories, including candidate country Macedonia, have been cut off from the EU Member States since 1992.
The young generation that has grown up since then has hardly been able to go outside their own borders.
At the embassies of the EU countries in the Macedonian capital Skopje, for instance, you find large signs listing a large number of strict obligations.
Only criminals can easily meet them, but students, researchers and journalists cannot.
I support the improved access for those groups from 2008 and the lowering of the visa fee to EUR 35.
Unlike some other members of my Group, I do not see the introduction of biometric registration as a reason to reject this improvement.
I regret the conditional sale with the readmission policy, which does not adequately guarantee the safety of the refugees concerned.
in writing. - (PT) The mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to help the populations of Germany and France (La RÃ©union) who were the victims of natural disasters in January and February respectively proves, despite the delay, the relevance and importance of this Fund in assisting Member States.
Bearing in mind the deadlock in the Council on a decision on the Commission proposal to improve this Fund, we would reiterate that the continued eligibility of regional disasters must be defended.
The European Parliament has previously confirmed that 'the EUSF should continue to enable action to be taken in the case of disasters which, although significant, do not achieve the minimum level required and that assistance may also be provided in special circumstances in cases where most of the population in a specific region has been affected by a disaster which will have serious, long-term effects on their living conditions'.
It is also essential to recognise the particular characteristics of Mediterranean natural disasters, such as droughts and fires - particularly in terms of time limits and eligible actions - and the possibility of higher levels of financial assistance for 'cohesion' countries and 'convergence' regions in the event of a disaster.
The creation of an EU agricultural disaster fund must also be assessed.
in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Susta report on the Protocol amending the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement).
For French Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the agreement hereby obtained, which will allow countries to produce generic drugs and export them to poor developing nations with no capability of producing these medicines themselves, constitutes an important step forwards.
For French Members of the Socialist Group, this report makes a positive contribution to resolving a public health problem that is clearly a matter of serious concern.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the protocol amending the agreement on TRIPS and Access to Medicines because I strongly believe the EU should be a key actor in the promotion of public health and access to medicines to all in the third world.
This protocol is a step in the right direction.
in writing. - (PT) The costs associated with introducing 'intellectual property' protection standards in the pharmaceutical sector in 'developing countries' have been known about for a long time.
The dramatic and unacceptable situation caused in these countries by the application of 'intellectual property rights' in the area of health, particularly in the fight against diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, has been highlighted and warned about for a long time.
We therefore feel that this report represents an opportunity lost by the majority of this House, within the scope of its powers, to assume a humanist position and to clearly fight for a policy which could bring an end to intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical sector.
Hiding behind the idea that a negotiation of the Protocol seems very difficult, the majority of this House have signed a blank cheque to the Council because such vague recommendations can only cause the current situation to continue, creating financial and legal obstacles which will prevent those countries with fewer resources from being able to access the advances made in science and technology in this field.
We abhor the fact that it is particularly the pharmaceutical multinationals that will gain through this inhumane policy, by maintaining their fabulous profits at the cost of many lives.
Madam President, following the vote, Parliament has decided to have both a written verbatim record of its sessions and an audiovisual record of its sessions.
This obviously has budgetary implications and I would urge the Bureau to examine the situation, enact the necessary changes to the budget or come up with a new proposal if it wishes the committee to re-examine this matter.
I rather suspect, given the very large majority of the House on this issue, that the will of Parliament is rather clear, so I think it is rather the first course of action that will have to be taken.
in writing. - Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro-scepticism.
However this will also allow the EU to boast of greater transparency when in fact it will in reality do little to enhance democracy, because the European Parliament cannot initiate legislation and can be ignored by the European Commission.
In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all.
The opportunity for a week to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) was well intended and would protect MEPs from errors, but up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week's delay, hindering the free press in informing the public.
Therefore I voted against the report

In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all.
I do not support the opportunity to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) the verbatim report should be as spoken.
I make mistakes as much as anyone.
Up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week's delay, hindering the free press in informing the public.
A separate note by way of explanation might be acceptable.
Therefore I voted against the report.
in writing. - (FR) The Corbett report recommends that, in order to save about EUR 10 million a year, we should no longer have the verbatim reports of proceedings in this Parliament translated into all the official languages.
Access to the debates in each language would then only be guaranteed by way of the audiovisual recordings available on the internet, though individual Members of Parliament would be able to request the translation of certain extracts.
However, not everyone in Europe has broadband internet access and, moreover, it has been suggested that requests by Members for translations should be restricted to some thirty pages a year.
What Mr Corbett is proposing is therefore to limit the access of European citizens to the work of those whom they have elected to represent them and to defend their interests within the European Union.
This is unacceptable.
It is all the more unacceptable because at the same time the same institution is spending EUR 100 million a year on its own propaganda.
To say nothing of the Commission, which spends more than EUR 200 million on vital activities such as the large-scale broadcasting of pornographic internet videos that are supposed to be promoting European cinema.
Fortunately, good sense - or rather the mortal fear of the electorate - has prevailed among most of our colleagues and multilingualism has been preserved.
in writing. - (SV) We firmly reject the report's proposal that oral contributions should appear only in their original language in the verbatim report.
The European Parliament is trying to make a big thing of the fact that speakers are speaking to the whole of Europe as spokespersons for their European groups, but at the same time we are going to refuse subsequent access to their statements and restrict availability by cutting back on translations into different languages.
If we are to have a democratically functioning EU, we must be prepared to pay for it.
An organisation that pours out more than SEK 360 billion on a protectionist agricultural policy must be able to pay SEK 90 million to show respect for the EU's citizens.
However, if the translation costs are deemed to be insupportable in future, the minimum must be that the verbatim report contains the speaker's original language and an English translation.
in writing. - (FR) The French Members of the Independence and Democracy Group voted against the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament which seeks to abolish the full and systematic translation of parliamentary debates.
The idea behind publishing the debates, which applies to judicial proceedings and political deliberations alike, is one of the fundamental principles of democracy.
Publication helps to reduce ideological bias, arbitrariness, cronyism and dirty tricks.
This of course is based on the assumption that all have access in their own language to the full published proceedings by ensuring that the same words do indeed express the same notions for everyone.
Who among the peoples of Europe would be capable of recounting and understanding a debate when faced with a hotchpotch version of it in twenty languages?
It would probably be the same as someone trying to understand the so-called 'simplified' treaty and attempting to replace the 400 new clauses contained in the existing treaties, since here too, apparently, no consolidation version has been made available during the ratification process.
Faced with increasing reticence from the inhabitants of its Member States, the European Union seems to be capable of displaying nothing but obfuscation, falsification and concealment.
in writing. - (NL) The decision of the Secretariat of Parliament to no longer report the debates in plenary in every language went unnoticed in 2006.
Parliament has now reversed this decision.
I agree that too much time and money is spent on translating debates and documents into the 23 official languages of our Union.
It is a pity that no compromise solution was put to us, in which the debates could be translated into English and French, so that the proceedings would still be available in written form in addition to the audiovisual data.
in writing. - (PT) Multilingualism is much more than an expression of the cultural diversity of the European Union.
In an organisation of sovereign and independent states which have joined together as a means of ensuring, through cooperation, the best advantages for their citizens without having at any stage waived their status as free and sovereign states, multilingualism is the recognition of the relationship of equality between all the members.
This reason alone would suffice for us to defend the continuation of this multilingualism in the functioning of the Community institutions.
However, other arguments may be added to this.
Giving up multilingual internal communication potentially means reducing the possibility for political action by Members of the European Parliament who are fully entitled to express themselves in their mother tongue.
Furthermore, if we minimise multilingualism in our external communications, we may end up distancing an institution which expends a great deal of energy trying to bring the EU closer to its citizens.
Finally, there is a counter economic argument to the economic argument made: the linguistic diversity of the European people and the mastery of numerous languages has to be a competitive advantage, not a cost.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 relating to the verbatim report of proceedings, even though I regret the adoption of a whole series of amendments recommending the verbatim translation of the reports into all the official languages.
To those hard-line advocates of multilingualism I would say, somewhat euphemistically, that it is a fiction to claim that, without this extension to the translation process, the European Parliament would be the only parliamentary assembly in the world not to have all its proceedings and debates translated in hardcopy into all the relevant languages.
This is a fiction to the extent that it has been agreed that not only will the multilingual version be retained but the simultaneous translation into all the official languages should also be made available, on request, to all the Members of the House as well as to the public at large.
This is the really essential part, it seems to me.
Finally, I regret that Parliament has been unwilling to adopt a more contemporary approach as far as access to the documents is concerned: I say yes, a thousand times yes to multilingualism.
However, I shall continue to oppose the so-called defence of linguistic diversity when this is used as an excuse by those who support the status quo and openly oppose change.
in writing. - (NL) I voted against the proposal in the Corbett report and I did so for the same reasons that I have previously opposed the scrapping of the budget for translating the verbatim report of our sessions in this House.
In a parliament, the spoken word is sacrosanct.
What we say is not just an item on the day's news if we are lucky, it is part of the democratic legislative process.
Making this accessible in the official European languages is not a luxury.
Translation is politically necessary for a proper archiving system which after all serves to allow open access to information.
We have to bear the consequences of our fundamental decision to choose multilingualism and not let it surreptitiously crumble away.
A parliament that has self-respect does not ditch its traditional archiving system.
If we need to economise, we would do better to choose different areas of the budget.
Anyway, I stick to my view that our insistence on multilingualism is a necessary form of respect for the diverse cultures and languages in the EU and a blessing for democracy.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which advocates the establishment of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board in response to a Commission proposal to improve the production of EU-wide statistics.
in writing. - I voted for this uncontroversial report, proposing the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy.
The amendments Parliament also adopted will ensure the Committee's efficiency, and affect its name and composition.
(RO) Today's vote on Mr. Mantovani's report is important due to the stimulus it gives to the European policy in the field of lifelong education.
Examining the current situation in this field and its correlation with the labour market, the Mantovani report proves to us, one more time, the existence of a reality we have lived for many years, but which has not been followed by a firm and coherent policy that could cope with its challenges.
Therefore, I believe it is important to implement the new proposals as soon as possible.
In fact, I would like to point out the importance of recognizing and promoting education for tolerance on the entire European Union territory.
This is the only way in which mobility on the labour market will not generate socially excluded groups, whose behaviour becomes deviant sooner or later.
in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Mantovani report on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework.
This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the future introduction of the European Qualifications Framework, which will facilitate transnational mobility for workers and learners, while at the same time meeting the requirements of the labour market by way of a common reference point for the transposition of qualification levels.
According to the proposal all qualifications, from the end of compulsory education to the highest levels of university teaching and professional training (the Commission's initial document only concerned general educational qualifications), should be classified according to one of eight reference levels based on knowledge, ability and acquired skills.
Mrs Castex believes that the EQF, as a tool for comparing, translating and converting the qualifications of one Member State to those of another, will respect the diversity of the certification systems and the richness of the qualifications that exist in the European Union.
It is a tool that will also facilitate greater mobility for the citizens of Europe.
It is now up to the Member States to set about the massive task of classifying the reference levels required for the EQF, otherwise the European Qualifications Framework will be destined to remain an empty shell.
in writing. - (PT) This report contains several contradictions and we are critical of the compromise accepted by the majority of the European Parliament on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework.
However, there are positive aspects to the recognition of qualifications among the various Member States which should be supported.
However, the final text adopted accentuates the federalist nature of the European Parliament's proposal by setting specific dates for the adaptation and correlation of the various education and training systems used in the Member States, despite specifying its non-binding nature for the next few years.
We would stress that education policy is the sole responsibility of Member States which is why we feel that the 'adaptation' proposed infringes this principle.
We regard as negative the link with the Bologna Process and the trend towards the commercialisation of education, with emphasis being placed on 'employability' and on the prospects of the labour market being linked to the Lisbon Agenda.
This report deals with the certification at Community level of lifelong learning qualifications.
This is a completely desirable measure and one that should be encouraged.
However, I reject the internationalist justification used in the document, especially as I recall the total defeat suffered by the Lisbon Strategy.
There is an element of Europeanist ideology in this text.
It is written that the sacrosanct objective of globalisation constitutes our one and only hope of salvation and that globalisation is beneficial both economically and socially.
In my opinion ultra-liberal globalisation is a machine for destroying the economic, social and cultural fabric of nations.
Moreover, the report only refers to potential progress, something for the future.
Should we not be looking at the present as we attempt to analyse the failures and damage that has already been done to our society by globalisation?
In the face of such blindness, irresponsibility and inadequacy I intend to vote against the report.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, I voted in favour of adopting the report on the recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning.
The future development of European society will be increasingly dependent on education, scientific research, innovation and technology.
That is why it is so important to provide support for the promotion of mobility across the European labour market.
I am convinced that setting up the European Qualifications Framework will facilitate access to the European labour market.
The rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, has rightly pointed out in his report that as of 2012 all qualifications certificates, diplomas and Europass documents should relate to the relevant EQF level.
The European Qualifications Framework should be used to facilitate comparison of levels of qualification.
It is very important for the Member States to garner support for the implementation of the European Qualifications Framework, notably by the exchange of best practice.
The European Qualifications Framework Advisory Group mentioned in the report is in a position to ensure the cohesion of the cooperation process and monitor the latter.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which seeks the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework to help with the EU-wide recognition of the qualifications that people receive.
It should lead to an improvement in mobility for people who wish to work in other Member States by providing a neutral and credible reference point for the comparison of various qualifications.
in writing. - (DE) In theory, it should be possible for a professional's qualifications to be recognised in any other Member State and for the same conditions to apply as for the domestic workforce.
In practice, there are still some problems which need to be addressed.
For example, if an experienced teacher from Austria were required to complete a two-year period of practical training in order to do the same job in Germany, there would obviously be something wrong.
In some Member States, work placements are not only being misused as a way of employing well-qualified staff with academic degrees as cheaply as possible, they are also being used to create barriers to certain professions.
Precarious working conditions, which initially only affected the low-wage sector, have long since spilled over to skilled workers as well.
The EU must not give further impetus to this trend with the 'Blue Card' scheme.
We have enough qualified workers, if only we were prepared to pay them properly.
in writing. - (EL) The adoption of the European Qualifications Framework reinforces EU intervention in the Member States' education systems, homogenisation, and adaptation to predetermined quality and performance indicators.
It is yet another way of replacing education with flexible 'learning', outside the socially instituted process of education.
Knowledge is replaced with ephemeral, superficial ongoing training that will equip workers with whatever skills are needed by capital at the time.
These qualifications will be recognised on the basis not of certificates awarded by the formal education system of each country, but of certification examinations set by organisations that are controlled by employers.
This further promotes the separation between degree certificates and the possibility of pursuing a career.
Linking different levels of education and forms of learning, which aims to put learning by experience on a par with systematic education, is an attempt at levelling down workers' rights and driving down the wages of all workers to the lowest possible level.
Through a system of lifelong learning and certification of professional qualifications, the EU's wider aim is to subordinate all education to the priorities of the market and strengthen the profitability of capital.
This is at complete variance with the educational needs of workers and young people.
For these reasons, we are voting against the report and the Commission's proposal.
in writing. - (SK) Transnational labour mobility in the EU has become inevitable: it is an everyday reality within the EU-27 after enlargement.
These changes are accompanied by demands for more innovative and flexible education that will prepare Europeans for their integration into the modern labour market where education is the basic precondition for all age groups and all strata of society.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Mario Mantovani on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning because I am convinced that this is the only way to fulfil the goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
The structure of the European Qualifications Framework is based on eight vertical levels, termed 'reference levels', defined in terms of three horizontal criteria - knowledge, skills and competence - thus enabling individuals to better integrate in the labour market on completion of a learning process.
In order for the European Qualifications Framework to be successful, it is absolutely essential for the Member States and social partners to base their cooperation, during the implementation phase, on mutual trust.
The labour market structure in Europe is changing and we see an emerging need for a flexible approach to education.
The Member States should therefore make use of the European Qualifications Framework to improve the lifelong learning programmes.
There is also the need for both employers and European citizens to understand the practical importance of qualifications.
This will lead to greater, and most importantly barrier-free, labour mobility across the EU.
in writing. - (PT) The globalisation of the economy is a question for which Europe has not yet found a clear and convincing answer.
A more globalised economy implies a readiness for change which means greater mobility.
The creation of a common reference framework for the recognition, comparability and transfer of qualifications originating from different systems is fundamental to the development of a decisive component of the European project, in other words the mobility of workers facilitated in this case by the portability of their qualifications.
Better training of our workers combined with a harmonised system for the recognition of their knowledge, skills and abilities will enhance their mobility and the development of the internal market.
More and better skills among European workers could help to ensure better organisation, more innovation and improved competitiveness among our undertakings.
(LT) It is a shame that the launch of SIS II keeps being postponed.
Today we have adopted a resolution on this important issue.
We are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the SIS 1+ network after 13 November 2008.
It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between three projects being developed simultaneously: SIS II, SISone4all and the installation, operation and management of a communication infrastructure.
This is why, in my opinion, the correct distribution of EU and Member States' resources will be of great significance.
However, in view of the project's importance as regards the security of the EU, it is obvious that SIS II is the greatest priority.
We must allocate funds for EU security and the development of communications infrastructure.
in writing. - (PT) To 'fill a gap' during the extension of the Schengen Information System (SIS), which includes the Visa Information System (VIS), the current proposal aims to provide a temporary solution to prevent any hiatuses and potential interruptions caused by the delay in installing the 'infrastructures' of the 'new' system.
The costs will be distributed between the Community budget and Member States.
We would point out that this involves expanding the features of the SIS by developing them, extending access to new authorities and interlinking them, with the addition of new categories of data (such as the data capture mandate and biometric data).
This extension of the previous system significantly threatens the rights, freedoms and guarantees of citizens by adding new elements to a database which is, in addition, shared by numerous bodies.
The confidentiality of this data cannot be fully guaranteed as records may be kept 'for a longer period' and be shared with third countries.
At the root is an attempt to bring the SIS into line with the dangerous and unacceptable objectives of the current security offensive and with the expansion and growing communitarisation of internal affairs in the EU, which we clearly reject.
in writing. - We do not oppose the suggested temporary solution in order to guarantee the existence of a network for SIS 1+ for the period from 13 November to 17 December 2008.
However, we cannot support the use of the passerelle in Article 67(2), indent 2, of the EC Treaty as suggested by Mr Coelho.
That is why we have chosen to vote against the report.
in writing. - (DE) We already have a major problem with organised criminal gangs and illegal immigrants who tend to congregate in border areas where they are also easier to apprehend than in cities.
Both groups are already on the starting blocks and are intent on crossing into other countries as soon as the borders open, where they will vanish without trace.
We must respond to this situation with increased cross-border cooperation and intensive checks in border regions.
The expansion of Schengen is, after all, a major responsibility for all the countries involved.
Accession to Schengen should therefore not be made solely dependent on the functionality of the Schengen Information System, which is something Poland, for example, does not yet appear to have achieved.
