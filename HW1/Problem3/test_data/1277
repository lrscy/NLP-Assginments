rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to say briefly that I hope that we are on the point of adopting, by a large majority, this European instrument for promoting democracy and human rights, because it is the only instrument enabling us to support projects for promoting democracy in third countries, without the support of the governments, and it is therefore the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by Mr Milinkievitch. How can we support free media, how can we support independent civil society, how can we defend and protect the defenders of human rights in third countries, without the support of governments?
The answer is by means of this instrument.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should just like to inform the House that not only have we achieved a separate instrument to promote democracy and human rights as a successor to the European initiative, against the original wishes of the Council and Commission, but we have managed to achieve all the objectives set by the European Parliament.
In reply to Mr Milinkevich this morning, it is true now that that instrument can have the capacity to operate within his country, without his country's consent as Mrs Flautre says.
Moreover, this year I visited a number of what we call 'difficult countries' - China, Cuba, even Russia today, parts of the Arab world - where the democracy backlash is moving in.
I should like to read from the letter that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner sent last Friday to the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok: 'This provision may also include working with democratic political partners in third countries, provided that the principle of impartiality towards such partners is respected.
On the other hand, funding of political parties as such remains excluded from the scope of the draft regulation.'
So, Mr President, this is part of the process of the moral politics that Mr Milinkevich talked about, but it is only part of it.
We must do a lot more and not leave that field to the Americans.
(Applause)
If I am not mistaken, you are proposing an oral amendment to Amendment 147.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, you are indeed not mistaken.
This is an oral amendment to Amendment 147 which, in order to conform precisely to the terms negotiated with the Council, is intended to replace the phrase
'including rights of migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons' with 'including migrants' enjoyment of human rights, rights of asylum seekers and internally displaced persons'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Prevention of injury and the promotion of safety (vote)
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - Mr President, I shall be brief.
I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Secretariat, and to say that safety is something that affects us all.
A split second can change our lives, and the challenge is to save lives and to preserve health.

We shall now resume voting time.
Explanations of vote
in writing. I voted in favour of the appointment of Mrs Meglena Kuneva, the Bulgarian Commissioner designate.
However, while I have no problem with the individual herself or with the appointment of a Bulgarian Commissioner, I have serious doubts about there being enough jobs for 27 commissioners.
I look forward to a Treaty change that significantly reduces the number of Commissioners.
in writing. Mr President, my party is keen on the continuing enlargement of the Union, and we look forward to our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues joining us.
We have paid close attention to the confirmation process of our two new Commissioners, and are satisfied that both are welcome additions to the College.
I am pleased to support Mrs Kuneva's appointment today.
in writing. I voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Leonard Orban as Romanian Commissioner.
However, I very much regret that the Nice Treaty makes it necessary for us to have one Commissioner per Member State.
I simply do not believe that there are enough serious jobs for 27 Commissioners and look forward to a Treaty reform along the lines of the draft Constitution that significantly reduces the number of Commissioners.
in writing. Mr President, my party is keen on the continuing enlargement of the Union, and we look forward to our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues joining us.
We have paid close attention to the confirmation process of our two new Commissioners, and are satisfied that both are welcome additions to the College.
I am pleased to support Mr Orban's appointment today.
in writing. I welcome the appointment of a Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors and am glad that this proved uncontroversial in the light of other difficulties.
in writing. I voted in favour of Mr Ispir despite allegations of corruption involving Mr Ispir being made in the Romanian media.
The Committee on Budgetary Control could find no evidence to support these allegations in their hearing.
Mr Ispir has also strongly denied any wrongdoing.
On the evidence available the allegations against him appear to be politically motivated.
However, if any evidence of wrongdoing emerges I would expect Mr Ispir to resign from the Court.
(DE) Mr President, if a stop is to be put to meat scandals and the back-door introduction of genetic engineering, then consumers need to be told the blunt facts, with nothing left out, but it cannot be acceptable that the stringent food regulations we impose on our own farmers and producers should be regularly circumvented by imports from third countries, a state of affairs that I regard as unfair to our farmers, counterproductive in terms of consumer protection and therefore needing to be done away with at once.
It is for that reason that I voted against the Thyssen report.
in writing. (SV) The June List thinks it crucial for there to be proper consumer protection within the EU.
However, funding the necessary measures is primarily a national issue.
We do not, then, believe that there is any justification for the budget heading of EUR 156.8 million entailed by the present consumer policy programme.
We are also extremely critical of the proposal to support financially the development of master's degree courses in consumer issues within the framework of an integrated European examination.
It is not, of course, for the EU institutions either to determine the type of educational courses to be established in the Member States or to finance these.
We should, then, have voted against this report.
in writing. Irish consumers know only too well the reality that is Rip-Off Ireland.
Spiralling costs of basic services such as gas and electricity, or outrageous mobile phone and roaming charges continue to hit Irish consumers hard.
Of course those living in or at risk from poverty are hardest hit.
In order to counter this unacceptable situation, government needs to step in with stronger regulation and resourcing of the relevant consumer protection agencies.
In this context I welcome today's report by Marianne Thyssen MEP.
The aim of the report is to initiate an action programme in the field of consumer protection for the years 2007 to 2013.
The programme seeks to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting the health, safety, economic and legal interests of consumers.
The programme would also attempt to promote consumer rights to information, to education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests.
In Sinn Fein's view the Irish Government need to take a lead in strengthening the rights and protections of consumers.
However, there is clearly a role for the EU, to assist Member States' agencies in sharing models of best practice and ensuring a level of consistency throughout the European Union.
in writing. - (FR) The Community action programme in the field of consumer protection for 2007-2013 is intended to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States.
It will contribute to protecting the health, the safety and the economic and legal interests of consumers, and also to promoting their right to information, education and organisation with a view to defending their interests.
The actions will contribute to guaranteeing all of the Union's consumers a high level of protection and to ensuring the effective application of the consumer protection rules.
I am delighted that this programme has been divided into two parts, thereby distinguishing between health and consumer protection.
While I regret that the Commission has reduced the financial envelope from EUR 233.46 million - at first reading - to EUR 156.8 million and that the number of actions in the field of consumer protection has been reviewed and reduced from 20 to 11, I have voted in favour of Mrs Thyssen's report, so that consumers' organisations can benefit from this programme in the interests of our fellow European citizens.
This regulation details how to address and combat diseases such as BSE and scrapie, which affect ruminants as a whole.
Firstly, the number of categories of risk of contracting BSE is reduced from five to three, in line with World Organisation for Animal Health recommendations.
The regulation bans the use of animal proteins in feeding ruminants, but states the quantity up to which the addition of such proteins is considered insignificant.
The report also calls for a review of the rules on the use of mechanically processed meat for human consumption and lays down new rules on providing better information to consumers.
In order to prevent mass, indiscriminate slaughter and the ensuing losses for the producer, the report also defines the use of animals up to the end of their productive lives.
This will naturally be monitored very closely given that there is no scientific data confirming that BSE is transmitted via milk or from cattle to their offspring.
Prevention programmes for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are to be carried out on a voluntary basis, and there is to be regular assessment of the scientific results of these programmes.
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs thus support the Roth-Berendt report.
This proposal, submitted for a second reading, differs from the legislation in force in three key areas.
One purpose of the proposal is that data be submitted annually rather than monthly.
According to recent studies, monthly data forwarded up to six months after the event are of limited use in day-to-day market management, whereas the compilation of annual data can be useful for medium- to long-term market studies and can help reduce the workload for the national authorities in forwarding data.
According to the proposal, data submissions are to be required by the flag (or nationality) of the vessels responsible for the landings.
This requirement, as opposed to the current submissions by broad groups of EU, EFTA and other vessels will enable the data to be analysed in greater detail and yet will not significantly increase the workload of the national authorities which already collect the data to this level of detail.
Lastly, this proposal for a regulation provides for a more flexible approach, enabling sampling techniques to be used to estimate total landings.
National authorities may, to an appropriate extent, use sampling methods for data collection purposes, providing that they justify their use and analyse the quality of the resulting data in a methodological report ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The new information and communication technologies have raised pertinent questions regarding the protection of minors and human dignity, given the amount of illicit, harmful and undesirable content that can easily be found on the Internet.
There appears to be a desire for regulation on this issue that has come up against technical and legal difficulties.
Measures to protect minors and human dignity are undoubtedly needed.
It is therefore necessary to discover more about, and to assess, these new technologies and not to downplay the progress that they have brought to our societies, the consequences of which have, in the main, been beneficial to the quality of life of the poorer as well as the wealthier sections of society.
Universal access to information gives the poorest people quicker access to solutions to day-to-day problems.
Accordingly, as regards protecting minors, the recommendations proposed here are eminently sensible criteria that we must disseminate in our societies by raising awareness among parents and teachers and by ensuring that regulatory bodies exchange experiences in classifying audiovisual content.
From a very early age, children are consumers and quickly take to these technologies.
in writing. I welcome this report which aims at the implementation of automated customs systems and of coordinated processes and services under both the current and future modernised Customs Code.
The main objective of this Decision is to determine what action needs to be taken for the achievement of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade.
This is highly laudable but I hope it does not prove to be a pious goal.
in writing. (SV) The June List is in favour of cross-border police cooperation.
It is necessary to confront contemporary international crime, but this has been done successfully for decades by the international police body, Interpol.
The June List is very sceptical about measures to combat crime being taken at supranational level.
We are in favour of intergovernmental cooperation and opposed to common legislation.
The Commission recommends that Asset Recovery Offices be set up in the Member States, directly subject to EC legislation and administration.
This means further interference in the Member States' national legal systems and a weakening of Interpol's respected position.
The June List is therefore voting against the report as a whole.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that cross-border animal diseases are an important area for cooperation within the EU, but it is not for the EU routinely to finance the fight against animal diseases.
We want to point out that, in the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the Member States, both financially and in terms of the measures taken, to combat animal diseases and zoonoses within their respective territories.
We therefore object, in particular, to Amendment 6, tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whereby each Member State would be able, depending on its specific circumstances, to submit national programmes to be financed by the EU.
We are voting against the report as a whole, since it is based on the European Union taking major financial responsibility for combating animal diseases.
EU funds are not a horn of plenty that can constantly finance measures within the agricultural sphere.
Sweden, for example, has conducted a long and successful fight against salmonella within its own borders and is proof that the Member States themselves can engage in such battles without the need for funding by the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, nature has a long memory, and so, for example, thanks to the EU's 'Groundwater 2010' programme in Austria, pollution of the groundwater from the past twentieth century is being laboriously cleared up.
The amount of nitrates finding their way into it from agriculture creates major problems in some regions in that it makes the maintenance of the prescribed chemical conditions difficult.
This underlines once more the importance of biologically and ecologically reasonable modes of management, which, when properly applied, can make a vital contribution, and so I do believe that it is important that much more be done to promote their use, and have voted, accordingly, in favour of the KlaÃ report.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the compromise, even though I also take the view that it would have been desirable, in view of groundwater's extreme importance as a primary source of food, to have a single set of European rules applicable to all hazardous substances.
Let us also bear in mind that our health and that of our children are at stake here.
Since short-term economies will prove to be problematic not only for the state but also for the healthcare systems, I call on all the Member States to put everything rigorously into effect, while at the same time joining in working on a further package of measures with ambitious limit values.
in writing. Groundwater is a valuable natural asset and must be protected wherever possible.
It also extremely awkward to treat for pollution, even when the source of pollutants has been removed.
I broadly support the intentions of the new directive, which would help preserve Scotland's reputation of having a clean, unspoiled environment.
There must be a balance, however, so that any new directive that is passed is not unnecessarily obstructive to farmers and agricultural business.
For example, in 2003, Scottish farmers faced groundwater charges when those in England did not.
As long as this proposal does not produce extra bureaucracy or impractical demands for those who work around groundwater, then I think this directive is a worthy one.
in writing. I voted in favour of the KlaÃ report on the protection of groundwater against pollution.
I believe the report is now much stronger than the Commission's original proposal.
We will now have more stringent rules to prevent or restrict inputs of hazardous substances into groundwater with a possibility to have even more stringent national measures.
As regards nitrates, the provisions are now consistent with the Water Framework Directive.
in writing. Because the south-east of England has suffered so much from drought orders which have affected water usage by consumers, this directive is extremely important.
Some 70% of south eastern England's water comes from groundwater resources.
Protection of this resource, therefore, is essential to allow for both the capacity of such resources to recover as well as for nitrates and other chemicals to be excluded as far as possible from reaching the UK's drinking water.
Parliament has stuck steadfastly to its view that Member State governments must do far more to prevent this type of pollution, such as arsenic, biocides and cyanide.
Parliament's approach to 'toughen up' the legislation in this field is very much welcomed.
Water is the basis of all life, and in this sense, a matter of life and death.
The European Environmental Agency regards the situation as serious: 87% of groundwater in agricultural areas fails to meet EU standards on the presence of nitrates, and most of the Member States have reported on the risk of contamination by pesticides.
A strict new Groundwater Directive is therefore of vital importance.
The text approved by the conciliation committee deserves our support.
This House has managed to make the notion of 'protection against quantitative decline' legally binding.
Moreover, steps have been taken to ensure that the measures for achieving the quality standard for nitrates draw on the Water Framework Directive.
More emphatic demands are also made of Member States and regions to prevent and reduce the introduction of dangerous substances into groundwater.
They are now required to 'take' all the measures necessary, and not just to 'strive towards' them.
The result at first reading was, from an environmental point of view, a huge disappointment, and the Council's common position was also a complete disaster.
These have now been put right at second reading in this House and the subsequent conciliation procedure.
As we should be pleased with the outcome, I have endorsed the agreement reached.
Mr President, in all the continuing debates surrounding abortions performed on those who could live, one rather individual moment is presented by a seemingly neutral formula: reproductive healthcare, which is a catch-all term, and in a sense a confusing one.
Therefore, we should speak openly about non-reproductive health and show concern about how to limit or lessen reproductivity inside European society without causing physical harm to women.
Such harm is a very bad thing, but the time should come to realise that the problem is broader, as the harm includes psychological and social aspects and should deal also with the lack of compassion and growth of cruelty in our societies, which are turning them demographically into suicidal ones.
Those are the reasons why I voted for the deletions proposed by Mr Mitchell.
The original proposal for a regulation, tabled by the Commission and establishing a financial instrument for development cooperation was unacceptable to Parliament, given that it jeopardised its codecision powers and the very principles of development policy.
Following the amendments introduced by Parliament, however, I support the final text of the regulation, which provides for time-limited legislation (2013) and a mid-term review (2009), the creation of a specific instrument for development policy - the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) - as distinct from the policy of cooperation with industrialised countries, a single legal basis and the drafting of more detailed financial provisions.
It also safeguards Parliament's right to define development policy under the codecision procedure.
in writing. The Development Cooperation Instrument covers over EUR 16 billion of development spending over the next financial perspective.
The Instrument is in two main parts - geographic and thematic.
Geographic spending covers the money that will be negotiated between the Commission and partner countries through Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) - almost EUR 11 billion.
I welcome the fact that Parliament insisted in negotiations that social services, and particularly health and education, be prioritised by the Commission when drawing up CSPs.
Parliament also got a commitment from the Commission that 20 % of spending on geographic programmes would be on basic health and basic and secondary education - an important and longstanding priority of the Socialist Group.
Promoting development is, mutatis mutandis, equally as important in the EU's external policy as promoting human rights and democracy.
Whenever the EU boosts the growth and development of third countries within the framework of external cooperation, it is to promote a better world and, indeed, to promote its own interests, a fact that must be acknowledged but that does not in any way diminish the virtues of the gesture.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
In the area of illegal immigration, for example, it should be stressed that this policy is one of the most powerful weapons at our disposal, especially when used in conjunction with our neighbours.
As regards development, it is, like democracy and human rights, a universal good.
in writing. Our part of the world having the privilege to live in wealth has a great responsibility to those who suffer hunger and whose future is uncertain.
I believe we can speak with one voice according to our humanitarian responsibility.
United in this noble cause we can change a lot.
That is why I am against paragraphs introducing so-called 'reproductive and sexual rights' which are simply trying to win our support for abortion.
This subject was not in the original Commission proposal.
It appeared in Parliament.
It is very unfortunate message for those Europeans who do not agree with abortion and do not want to pay for such practices, hidden in this document under the technical term 'reproductive right'.
Do we really want this message to be sent?
We cannot disrespect Catholics' beliefs only because they are in minority today.
Our message to them is clear: it says that Europe is not their responsibility any more!
In conclusion it weakens our fight against poverty and weakens European integration.
Therefore I called for support for Amendments 1, 2 and 3.
I could not vote in favour of this report without them.
The Group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the report regarding the Commission's proposal for a regulation on a 'Modernised Customs Code', because it clears the path for invasion of major monopoly enterprises (especially logistics) in the sector of customs procedures.
Establishing a 'certified financial body' in combination with the replacement of Article 5 of Regulation 2193/92, which refers to customs representatives, will result in the loss of jobs for all customs brokers in Greece and several EU Member States, who will be replaced with monopoly enterprises at the expense of the security of customs procedures.
The new Customs Code follows the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to increase the prosperity of the capitalists.
This policy, apart from destroying labour, salary, insurance and social rights of the workers, which are its primary goal, will have devastating consequences on the self-employed and the small to medium-sized enterprises.
This reactionary policy by the EU is aimed against all grassroots classes.
Therefore, it is absolutely essential to form an alliance between the small- to medium-sized enterprises and the working class, a people's alliance that will put an end to the aspirations of the monopolies and imperialism and will claim its own power and open the road to social prosperity.
in writing. - (EL) It is the farmer's and consumer's right and obligation to look after their health and safety and know the composition of each product, including animal feed.
Therefore, we agree on the amendments and amendment proposal regarding the directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
However, certain companies appealed to the European Court with the pretence that the 'financial interests of the manufacturers would be seriously harmed' and that intellectual property would not be safeguarded, in order to circumvent from their obligation to inform the consumers on the composition of feedingstuffs, something that would provide farmers and consumers with the right to choose but also protect their health.
At the same time each manufacturer would be controlled as to whether the product he is selling corresponds to the ingredients printed on the label and regulations on the protection of public health.
However, we should not be fooled by thoughts that legal and other barriers can prevent monopoly enterprises in the animal feed sector from acting unscrupulously, given that such companies are responsible for the dioxin and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy scandals.
For these enterprises profit is the number one priority and not the protection of public health.
Moreover, for as long as there is a lack of adequate state control bodies and control responsibility is handed over to private individuals, we should be very worried about the protection of public health and the safety of the food chain.
in writing. I supported this report so as to allow for a swift correction of Directive 2002/2/EC by deleting the obligation for feed manufacturers to inform customers on request of the exact composition of compound feedingstuffs, in line with the ruling of the Court of Justice.
The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers.
However, I am concerned and disappointed that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation.
The intention was to amend the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight.
Disclosing exact percentages for animal feedingstuffs goes beyond the equivalent provisions applicable to food for human consumption.
In most cases, ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect the interests of farmers and consumers and the formulations of the manufacturers.
I expect the Commission to take on board these concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year.
in writing. Conservative MEPs supported this report so as to facilitate a swift correction of Directive 2002/2/EC by deleting, in line with the Court of Justice's ruling, the obligation for feed manufacturers to inform customers on request of the exact composition of compound feedingstuffs.
The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers.
However, we express our disappointment that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation.
Our intention was to amend as well the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight.
We do not believe that exact percentages need to be disclosed and note that this goes beyond the provisions applicable to food for human consumption.
In most cases, ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect both the interests of farmers and the trade secrets of the manufacturers.
We expect the Commission to take on board our concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year.
I support the report by Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre on the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, because democracy is a fundamental universal right, and, as such, should be promoted by transnational institutions.
The radicals in this Parliament have fought for years for the 'democratic clauses' contained in many agreements between the EU and authoritarian countries such as Laos, Vietnam and Uzbekistan to be respected.
These agreements must be applied to the letter; however, the promotion of the right to democracy cannot be a mere by-product of policies on cooperation, international trade or humanitarian aid.
We need to take action, devising a genuine European policy on democracy in the world, because the right to democracy cannot stop at Europe's 'neighbours'.
All over the world we need to succeed in building an alliance between Europe and pro-democracy forces: that is what the rapporteurs aimed for.
The EU's ability to act in the future will tell us whether this aim has been achieved, or whether new, more flexible and effective instruments will be needed.
Socialists can look back on a long tradition of international solidarity.
They champion human rights, peace, democracy, social security, fair sharing, public services and a clean environment not only for the sake of people in their own towns, regions or countries, but also for the people in neighbouring countries and in other parts of the world.
Human rights for others are more important than the economic benefits accruing to us from cheap imports from countries where human rights are trampled underfoot.
It is this conviction that has led us to back boycott campaigns against dictatorial minority regimes in South Africa, the former Rhodesia, the former Portuguese colonies and Pinochet's Chile.
By joining forces with opposition movements in those countries, we have managed to help bring about major changes.
This is why we, representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party, support the Flautre/McMillan-Scott report on human rights in international treaties and relations with dictatorial states.
We are aware that this report can be misused for measures against Venezuela or other states where the people have opted for radical steps towards human equality, and maybe even as justification for military interventions on allegedly humanitarian grounds.
We regret that fear of this appears now to have prompted some of our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to opt for a principle of non-intervention, and hence, albeit unintentionally, for turning a blind eye to unacceptable dictatorships.
The fact that the EU explicitly links its external policy with promoting human rights and democracy should be highlighted and lauded.
Yet not everyone in Parliament, and in other Community institutions, will share the same views on which human rights have been violated and on where there is and is not democracy.
Perhaps it would be better to avoid this question at this time, although in so doing we would be sweeping the situation under the carpet rather than addressing it.
That being said, the first of these points should be brought to the fore.
The expansion of democracy and the protection of human rights is intrinsically a good thing that brings benefits to the people of countries in which there is neither democracy nor respect for human rights, as well as to the people of neighbouring countries (which is why promoting these values in our neighbourhood is so important) and of the world as a whole.
For these reasons, albeit with the reservations to which I have referred, I support the report before us.
in writing. - (EL) The 'financial Instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide' is a blatant admission that in the name of 'democracy and human rights' we are establishing the EU's right to imperialistic interventions at the expense of nations around the world.
The Commission report moves in an even more unacceptable, reactive direction, by stating that it will be used 'without the consent of the host country's government', in order to provide plenty of money to the long arm of EU imperialistic policy, to various non-governmental organisations and moreover to organisations that are not officially registered in their country, that is illegal organisations.
It provides for the creation of a productive workforce for independent civil society organisations, namely training of secret agents.
Its objectives include the strengthening of the International Criminal Court, and moreover special international criminal courts.
The EU proclaims itself the universal protector of democracy and human rights, in the sense of a 'Trojan horse' that will be used to undermine the national and social sovereignty of nations that oppose the EU's decisions and overturn governments that do not agree with them.
Let the nations draw their own conclusions.
They should strengthen their struggles against this barbaric imperialistic union of monopolistic capitalists and send into history's trashcan the imperialists' ambition to be elevated to the position of worldwide policemen.
The high number of injuries arising from accidents or violence in the Member States remains cause for concern.
We therefore welcome the focus on the causes of these injuries, on the circumstances in which they occur and on why, when and where they occur.
There are numerous factors behind the injuries, including social, economic and cultural factors.
The more we understand these aspects, the bigger and, more importantly, the better, will be the measures put in place to prevent them from happening.
Hence the report adopted today to place the emphasis on prevention.
The first step is therefore to gather information.
The bottom line, however, is that people's living conditions must be improved, which entails, for example, maintaining a public health policy with guaranteed access for all to healthcare regardless of economic circumstances, ensuring high quality public education and reducing or eliminating inequality.
Accident and injury comes at a very heavy human price - premature death, years living with incapacity - and entails high costs in terms of healthcare and loss to society owing to lack of productivity.
Injuries can be avoided, however.
It is therefore essential to adopt healthier lifestyles and to adopt public policies that help make living conditions safer.
Prevention is better than cure.
in writing. - (EL) The primary reasoning of the 'effort to prevent injuries' is to invest in sectors that will offer something back.
They promote cost-gain reasons instead of health.
We disagree with these free market motives that drive this so-called effort to prevent injuries.
Dissimilar incidents are being lumped together and addressed within the framework of individual responsibility on the grounds that they all classify as injuries.
The true causes of accidents are being concealed, thereby sending the strategy for preventing and addressing them off the rails.
Personal responsibility is stated as the main cause of these 'injuries' in order to cover up managerial liability for accidents at work.
The promotion of 'safe behaviour' conceals the need for a prevention strategy directed at taking collective measures that safeguard safety in areas where employees work and live.
They are aiming at burdening the employee, directly or indirectly, with the managerial obligation and cost of preventing accidents at work.
Their end objective is to promote further intensification of work and reduction of labour cost.
The State is largely to blame.
In order to serve free economy, it does not carry out essential controls; it accepts criminal omissions and imperfections in projects from businessmen, which in turn increases the risk of accidents.
Accident prevention should be enforced by the state on a regular basis, providing detail on the actual causes; moreover the bodies recording and investigating these accidents should be state controlled.
Insurance coverage of occupational hazard, the creation of a state body of workforce doctors and safety technicians will provide the foundation for a systematic prevention of accidents at work.
in writing.
(DE) We owe it to our environment and to the people whom we represent to halt at once the policy of promoting long-distance transport the length and breadth of Europe; now that cancer and respiratory diseases have become the fourth most frequent causes of death in the EU, it is past high time that we did so.
If, though, safety is to be promoted, a solution also needs to be sought to the problem of deluded multiculturalism, which ultimately results in more and more problem areas in European cities, in which the forces of law and order are regarded as invaders, in which a massive decline in values prevails and in which the rule of the state is no longer acknowledged.

This phenomenon is not limited to Paris, for, in Berlin too, there are districts in which fires cannot be put out in good time or the injured taken away because it is impossible to communicate with the rampaging foreign mob, by which those trying to help risk being attacked or robbed - so-called 'no-go areas', in which even the police now venture only en masse.
That is exactly how it started in France, and we all know what that led to.
If we are going to talk in terms of prevention and of more security, then these problems too must be addressed before the situation escalates.
in writing. I naturally voted in favour of my report on the financing instrument for cooperation with the industrialised countries and territories.
As I said in the debate, this might in financial terms be the least significant of the new external instruments, but it will still involve a budget of around EUR 22 million a year and cover our external actions with 17 important countries.
I believe the amendments that Parliament has approved will make the instrument more appropriate and effective in promoting the interests and values of the EU in these 17 heterogeneous countries.
I would like to thank colleagues of all Groups for their support in finding such a wide consensus.

Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions on television broadcasting (debate)
Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank all those in this House who have worked on the proposal for a directive on the various audiovisual media services.
I should like, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, as well as the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs who have put a lot of time and energy into drawing up Parliament's opinion.
Their efforts have been rewarded, as a number of the amendments that we are examining today improve the Commission's initial proposal, presented on 13 December 2005.
I also wish to emphasise the excellent cooperation between Parliament, my services and the Council, whose Finnish Presidency has done a first-class job.
The proposal for a directive on audiovisual media, which updates the TV Without Frontiers Directive, will be seen as one of the important pieces of legislation adopted in the course of this Parliamentary term.
It responds to two requirements: firstly, it enables us to adapt our audiovisual enterprises to the considerable technological and commercial developments that have taken place; and, secondly, it demonstrates the political will that exists to ensure the continuation of the values essential to our communal life and to the forming of public opinion.
On the one hand, the technical and commercial aspects have to be taken into consideration. There are the new means of watching television, such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video on demand (VOD), the shift to digital technologies offering many more services and the arrival of new players in the market, including telecommunications companies, Internet access providers and big international investors.
On the other hand, account needs to be taken of cherished considerations such as consumer protection, human dignity, the protection of minors and the promotion of cultural diversity and of media pluralism.
What is more, the Commission proposal will enable all companies that want to invest in the audiovisual media to do so under fair conditions of competition and at European level, namely that of the internal market.
The principle on which the 1989 directive is based has not been substantially changed and is still that underpinning the updated directive. According to this principle, full compliance with the free movement of services in the internal market is conditional on responding only to the legislation of the country of establishment.
I would thank Parliament for supporting me in the matter of this basic demand, which contributes not only to the strength of our audiovisual industry but also, by opening national markets to European competition, to media pluralism.
The essential points of the Commission proposal are as follows.
Firstly, the directive should be made applicable to audiovisual media services, with a definition of these services that is sufficiently flexible to stand the test of time while remaining sufficiently precise to provide the sector with the legal certainty it needs.
Secondly, the various services should be divided, or grouped, into two categories reflecting the twofold differentiation criterion of, on the one hand, users' choice and control, and, on the other, the impact of these services on the way in which public opinion is formed.
Linear services, which constitute the first group, correspond to television broadcasting involving a chronological sequence of programmes. Such services are 'push' content, whether the platform is traditional, IPTV or mobile television.
The other group - non-linear services - are supplied at the consumer's request. These services - video on demand, for example - are 'pull' content, selected from a catalogue.
Where the rules are concerned, audiovisual content in the first category - that is to say, traditional radio and television broadcasting - needs to be subjected to a set of rules comparable to the current rules, but updated and simplified in order to take account of the developments I have mentioned.
In the case, moreover, of audiovisual content in the second category, recourse to the country of origin principle should be authorised, on condition that the harmonised basic rules relating, in particular, to the protection of minors and the ban on incitement to racial hatred are complied with.
We then need to lower the barriers to entering the audiovisual sector by simplifying the current rules, particularly in the area of commercial communications, and to do so without compromising the general interest.
Madam President, I am very aware of the fact that many Members are very sensitive about this subject and that a number of them are asking for stricter rules on advertising.
I want to be very clear about this issue.
Like yourselves, I do not want to see American-style television, that is to say programmes constantly interrupted by isolated advertising spots.
That is why the Commission is reaffirming the limit of a maximum of 12 minutes per hour and maintaining the principle of exception for isolated advertising spots, except in the case of sport.
At the same time, we must bear in mind that, to put it bluntly, television channels, whether they be publicly or privately owned, need advertising revenue in order to buy high-quality content such as sport, films and documentaries.
If we want Europeans still to be able to have a choice between free-to-air-television and pay TV, we must accept that there is going to be advertising.
What is more, recourse to co-regulation and self-regulation needs to be encouraged as a supplementary means of implementing the directive.
This is the first time that this option has been introduced into a legislative text.
There is also cause for reaffirming the general interest when it comes to the protection of children against harmful content, the protection of human dignity and the consumer's right to transparency, as well as the promotion of European works, which are an expression of our cultural diversity.
Honourable Members, you have today the opportunity, while still making stringent ethical demands, to enable the very successful European audiovisual content industry to become still more competitive and more integrated into the European internal market.
I would ask you, in the course of the debate and the voting, to seize the opportunity to send two messages: one to Europeans, encouraging them to embrace new developments in television, and another to the professional sector, encouraging it to invest not only in order to create value but also in order that tomorrow's creative content might be European.
It will only be possible to achieve this if the legal framework is better adapted to 21st century television.
The Commission is inspired solely by these considerations in examining Parliament's amendments.
Madam President, I shall have the opportunity at the end of the debate to explain the Commission's position on the amendments in greater detail.
Thank you for your attention.
I am able to tell you right now that the Commission intends to accept a very large number of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, I want first of all - Commissioner - to thank the Commission, and also the Council under both Austrian and Finnish Presidency for the outstanding way in which it cooperated with this House, but very particularly my fellow rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, who made it possible for the Committee on Culture and Education, the lead committee, to work so very well with the Committees on the Internal Market, the Economy, Industry, Civil Liberties and Gender Equality.
Our common objective was and remains to keep television, a mass audiovisual medium, both an economic and cultural good in the future, for, in a shared internal market extending across Europe, freedom of information and diversity of opinion cannot be left to the market alone, and so it is vital that we should, today, proceed to revise the television directive, which covers analogue television services, but lacks as yet the legal certainty and clarity appropriate to the new digital services.
It is the express wish of this House and of its committees that television and similar services should in future be evaluated on the basis of their content, and without reference to their technological platform.
What is crucial is the primary purpose of the audiovisual mass medium in which content for information, education and entertainment purposes is produced and complied subject to editorial responsibility and then broadcast to the general public and transmitted via electronic networks, which means that these are clearly distinguished from the other services of the information society and in particular from those covered by the directive on electronic commerce.
It is this legal clarity that the new audiovisual services need, and, by being taken into consideration in this directive, that is what they are getting; it is only when the primary purpose of this directive is fulfilled that it actually becomes effective, so let me reiterate, and make it abundantly clear, that this directive does not cover those emails that are private or not public, any more than it covers the electronic editions of newspapers, for they have nothing to do with its primary purpose.
In the European Union, the country of origin principle is the foundation upon which the freedom of the media rests, and that same principle is very definitely present in this new directive, although it was also necessary to take account of the concerns of those Member States who see it being open to misuse or being circumvented or who fear that it will be.
This, now, is where this House's compromise is a very even-handed one, in that it takes account of both points of view with the end in mind of making the best possible use of the Lisbon process and hence of the economic strengths of the new electronic media.
This means that we have achieved broad agreement on the scope and the country-of-origin principle, not to mention on such other matters as the joint regulation and self-regulation of the protection of young people and consumers, the right to short-term reporting, the promotion of European content and of better access for disabled people.
It will become clear from the debate that we take a different line on advertising; like the Commission, I am in favour, not of more advertising - 12 minutes - but of greater flexibility.
Even so, I had the painful experience of having to agree to a compromise on product placement.
I very much hope that we will be able, by means of better labelling, to achieve a maximum of legal certainty and clarity for the consumers.
Overall, though, the revision of the EU's television directive is a real fitness programme for forward-looking European television, and I warmly invite you to give it your support.
(Applause)
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say, as spokesman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, how pleased I am that our position, which was accepted with only two persons voting against it, is largely reflected in the report voted on by the Committee on Culture and Education, so many thanks to Mrs Hieronymi for that achievement.
In the last few weeks in particular, we worked successfully on keeping the country-of-origin principle at full strength, and I am of course grateful to all those who had a hand in this, for it is this principle that underpins the directive, and it is in the interests of a functioning internal market that we should not go soft on it.
I take the view that the opening up and liberalisation in respect of advertising is essential if our dual-system media landscape is to be preserved together with the free reception of advertising-funded television.
If this liberalisation is to be accomplished, then what is needed is the suspension of the requirement that commercials be grouped together in blocks, along with the abolition of the rule that requires thirty minutes between advertising spots in television and cinema films, in children's' and news programmes, and also for product placement to be allowed.
Product placement is a controversial issue, and I think that its being permitted subject to tight constraints is the only way to go forward; banning it would be unrealistic.
A scientific study has confirmed that product placement, even though banned in many Member States, still goes on, and, moreover, any ban would push European investors towards the American market.
I believe that the positive list can be a way of offering a balanced solution that takes account of the way things are at present.
Another core aspect of the directive, alongside the liberalisation of the rules on advertising, is the rearrangement of its scope; as we know, televised material can now be received over the Internet and mobile telephones as well, and to deal with this, we have opted for a technical approach that guarantees that the developments and platforms of the future will be taken into account as well.
Provided that the plenary takes these essential items on board when it votes, we will be able to face with confidence the challenges of the age of digital media while at the same time maintaining European televisual culture, which is so great a good.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like especially to thank Mrs Hieronymi and my own committee's shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Kamall, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Wallis.
Mrs Hieronymi has, through intelligent cooperation, worked hard with the other five committees, and the internal market committee started out by preparing a number of compromises, which have been taken into account by the Committee on Culture and Education and had an influence on the way it voted, particularly as regards the scope of the directive, which is a matter of some importance to us.
New technologies encourage new products and new forms of customer behaviour.
Digitalisation is causing new and strong actors - the telecoms companies, for example - to force their way onto the market.
If the directive was to be made fit for the future, it was necessary to broaden its scope, but we also managed to frame that scope more clearly and more restrictively than in the original Commission proposal, and that is without doubt a success in which all the committees share.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I shall be happy to enlighten you, Mrs RÃŒhle.
The fact is that you will, later on, have another minute when you speak on behalf of your group, but, as spokeswoman for a committee, you are entitled to only one minute.
I shall leave it to you to sort that out within your group to your own satisfaction.
You will, of course, be able to recapitulate the essential points when you speak later on on behalf of your group.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, the minute's speaking time I have puts me in mind of an advertising spot.
All right, then, I shall try to make something of it, even so.
Let us talk politics, first of all.
I wish to thank the Commissioner.
I remember the Liverpool conference. The document that you presented to us on that occasion was already a good medium-term proposal.
I wish to thank Mrs Hieronymi. Because of her negotiating powers as rapporteur, most of the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs were able to be integrated into the report presented in plenary.
I have two reservations to express.
Firstly, I should like, on behalf of a number of delegations, to say how sorry I am that the compromises approved by the Committee on Culture and Education, which struck the right balance between, on the one hand, the broadcasters' funding needs and, on the other, respect for the viewers, have now been brought into question.
That is a very bad idea, harmful to the audiovisual industry in general, because an industry that does not respect its consumers is doomed in the long term.
On the subject, therefore, of the rules governing advertising, I think it vital to respect the integrity of artistic works and - where I myself am concerned, and until I am more fully informed - I shall continue to give my backing to uninterruptible periods of 45 minutes.
The Committee on Culture and Education has been very precise in mapping out the issue of product placement, and I therefore support its amendment.
Finally, Madam President, I regret that this report and the political conditions in which it is presented do not make it possible to reflect in the medium term on the balance between public and private audiovisual media services. We need to join forces in tackling these matters in the medium term if we want to ensure the survival of this report.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Madam President, the Committee on Women's Rights, too, is grateful for the good cooperation and willingness of the Commission's rapporteur.
We do of course seek to maintain European quality television, which means securing the diversity and independence of the media.
The revision of the directive must not, however, be allowed to open up new grey areas, which is what we fear where product placement - formerly scorned as advertising by stealth - is concerned.
Product placement will now, in principle, be banned, yet numerous derogations make it possible for the Member States to blur the clear dividing line that separates editorial independence from the influences exerted by commercial advertising.
We, in the Women's Committee, have firmly repudiated product placement, and also want better protection for the young, with pornography, gratuitous violence and images derogatory to human dignity banned from audiovisual programming.
We also want to see restrictions on advertising.
Advertising must not be free to do as it likes.
We must ensure that advertising periods are not extended.
I am in favour of retaining the 45-minute rule, and also of alcohol not appearing in programmes broadcast during the day, in the interests of better protection for children and young people.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as on my own behalf, to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi who, on a human as well as a technical level, has brought us home safe and sound in spite of a very controversial debate.
To lay down precise rules in a technological environment that is essentially very much in a state of flux, is no easy matter.
The question might, moreover, be asked: to what degree is it possible to regulate?
It was necessary to find a fair and equitable framework, involving strong and restrictive principles, in connection with sensitive issues such as the protection of minors, and this while ensuring that players in the sector were not penalised.
One strong and basic principle is the country of origin principle, which has been retained.
The current compromise enables the authorities of the Member States to settle their differences, on the basis described in the document, in the event of fraudulent and improper behaviour on the part of the broadcaster's country.
Where advertising is concerned, the PPE-DE Group supports the methods described by the rapporteur, adding however that advertisements need to be broadcast at the same volume as the programmes preceding them, as recommended in an amendment by the Committee on Culture and Education.
I should simply like to point out that, in the ideological debates surrounding advertising, it should not be forgotten that advertising is a lively and creative sector that creates jobs and that also has a cultural dimension.
The controversy surrounding product placement leads me to make the following remark: the solution arrived at - that of banning product placement on principle and leaving it to each Member State to authorise it, or not as the case may be - is a strong message that calls on the Member States to take responsibility for funding high-quality television.
Finally, viewers are somewhat left out of account, as if the directive had nothing to do with them.
Care really does also need to be taken to ensure that television is without frontiers.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I too should like to thank Mrs Hieronymi for both the quality and the quantity of her work.
The directive proposed to us would enable us to retain the European audiovisual model in the new technological and economic conditions.
Advertising is still limited to 12 minutes per hour.
The Committee on Culture and Education has voted in favour of maintaining the period of time between two advertising slots at 45 minutes and of not reducing it to 35 - or, even worse, 30 - minutes, as desired by the Commission.
I hope that this amendment, supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will be adopted in plenary.
The advertising revenue from which television channels benefit should not suffer thereby as, in our world of globalisation and of the proliferation of transnational enterprises, the demand for advertising is expanding and will continue to do so.
Product placement is banned. That is the first thing to say.
Admittedly, exceptions are possible when it comes to cinema films, television dramas and sports programmes but, in those cases, product placement is strictly regulated in order to prevent the abuses and pernicious effects noted in many countries, particularly the United States.
The regulations are extended, in appropriate forms, to the new audiovisual services.
I am thinking, in particular, of video on demand, which has a great future ahead of it.
Minors, consumers and people in general are protected against incitement to all forms of discrimination and hatred.
We note with satisfaction that the new services will also have to play their part in supporting the production and promotion of European works.
With an eye to a number of audiovisual enterprises possibly circumventing the regulations of the Member States, the Socialists propose simpler and fairer provisions that can be implemented more quickly so that countries that are victims of indecent channels or services are better able to defend themselves.
This compromise text, voted in favour of by the Committee on Culture and Education, preserves what is essential.
It can and must be improved, and that is the purpose of our amendments.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and also the secretariat of the committee for its work of handling so many amendments.
With effort on the part of everybody, I believe that we are going to be able to approve a directive which, on the one hand, can be effectively applied, which is not a letter to Father Christmas, since we are in the festive season, but rather a piece of legislation that can be put into practice and will not become obsolete in six months time, because it takes good account of the technical reality that we are talking about and is not drawn up according to any particular person's philosophy, but according to the reality of today's world.
At the same time, I believe that it is a directive that can avoid two extremes, and that will be the case if the amendments are approved, as some of us hope.
One extreme would be American-style television controlled and dominated by advertising.
There is also the extreme represented by those who believe that everything must be regulated by law, who want to change society solely by means of the law, sometimes on the basis of values that we may even share, or on the pretext of protecting the weakest members of society, the young and others whom we all want to protect.
Such people believe that that must be done solely and exclusively by means of the law, imposing burdens which make open commercial television impossible and unviable, or restricting legitimate business freedoms that exist in our market systems and in the European internal market.
I believe that we are achieving that balance between the two extremes.
Certain extremes remain.
For example, there is still an amendment aimed at banning pornography on the Internet; a very worthy objective.
I do not know whether it is the job of the European Parliament to ban pornography on the Internet, for example.
This has nothing to do with the values that any one of us defends, but rather with the reality of the field in which we are legislating.
I would like to end by expressing my support and praise for the efforts of the Commission and of everybody with a view to achieving a text that clearly opts for self-regulation and co-regulation.
It is an instrument that has brought very good results and will continue to do so in the application of this directive.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, take the view that it is right to revise the television directive in view of the fact that the real world has changed so much; revision of it is a response to the digitalisation of the media.
Since we now have 'video on demand', Internet TV, 'webstreaming' and whole new platforms, this directive needs to cover all audio-visual media services, and it is for that reason too that we have renamed it.
We are not, however, regulating the Internet as such; nothing produced by private consumers, no private homepages will end up being subject to the revised directive.
Traditional broadcasting rules - prior control over content, for example - present no threat to press freedom or to the free expression of opinion.
We Greens claim three successes where changes to this directive are concerned, one being the greater opportunities afforded to independent producers, together with a clear definition of what is meant by that term; another is greater accessibility for the disabled; there is also the European right to short reporting, which is all about diversity and the public's democratic access to information.

There are, though, two major points of criticism to be made.
We Greens do not want European television to become more American.
I am not, in principle, anti-American, but I do want to promote and maintain European quality television, while all the proponents of the Commission proposal - including Mrs Hieronymi - think that European television's only chance of a future lies with American-style product placement and 'single spots', and that we all have to submit to the constraints of the advertising market.
I very definitely do not go along with this view.
I want content and advertising to continue to be kept separate rather than being mixed up together.
I do not want 'single spots' every few minutes, or the six minutes' advertising in the space of 36 minutes that the PPE-DE and the Social Democrats want for all formats; I want to be able to watch a television programme without interruption.
The present opportunities for advertising are sufficient.
Perhaps Mr Schulz can tell me - although he is not here - whether he wants, in an episode of the crime series 'Tatort' filmed in Munich, the detectives to be driving around in BMWs and drinking something that is recognisably LÃ¶wenbrÃ€u?
Or perhaps Mrs Prets or Mr Poettering can tell us whether they would allow product placement in a television drama in order to promote the sale of Volkswagens, and I call on Chancellor Merkel and Mr Neumann, her minister of state for culture, now that the German Presidency of the Council is about to begin, to go beyond half-hearted resistance to product placement and give a clear indication of their opposition to it.
I have to tell Mrs Hieronymi that I regard her report as politically wrong-headed.
Its ban on product placement is superficial, in that it then goes on to allow the Member States to introduce it, so, in some formats, product placement will become a reality in all European countries.
Is that really what you want, ladies and gentlemen?
I see this as self-deception; on the one hand product placement is to be allowed, but, on the other, according to the directive, people are not meant to buy the products.
That, though, is ridiculous; we are simply conning ourselves in what I regard as a typical sell-out.
I urge you to be courageous in voting against product placement and single spots, to defend European quality television, to vote for free production aids, for the Greens' amendments relate to all of these things.
We should take pride in our quality television and it is this area that we should most distance ourselves from the Americans.
I would like to thank the other Members and the Commission, too, for their cooperation.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the review of the previous legislation - which is seen as a natural legal adjustment to new technologies - conceals a desire for the uncontrolled liberalisation of the advertising market: no daily limit on teleshopping, telepromotions that are not included in the schedule, unregulated small advertising spots and the introduction of product placement, an advertising practice that is so interwoven with programme content that it cannot be regulated either quantitatively or qualitatively.
The text of the directive also lacks binding references to the principles of pluralism, independence and free competition, which should instead form the basis of every broadcasting system in a modern democracy, as Parliament itself has repeatedly confirmed.
Closely associated as it is with the democratic and cultural life of a country, television is undoubtedly the most important cultural vehicle of our times, and it is dangerous to have its content and its functioning depend solely on market principles, without safeguarding viewers' rights, for example to impartial information or to the protection of their children.
How do we go about protecting children when advertisements change their eating habits?
It is indeed a fact that most children today only eat products that are full of sugars and fats.
In this Commission proposal, which talks about 'no frontiers', that is, no limits, there is nothing but advertising.
If we do not change the course of action in line with the amendments tabled not only by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, but also by a cross-party group of MEPs without political ties, the television of the future is in danger of becoming a slave to the laws of advertising, and to them alone.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, in an era of rapid technological progress on a global scale and the change that this progress brings with it, we should take care to ensure that change fosters cultural and economic development in the whole of Europe, as well as in individual nations.
That is why I welcome Mrs Hieronymi's report, which is based on the country of origin principle.
Adapting rules and conditions at a national level will allow national products, including independent products, to be marketed in a way that is more productive and attractive for the consumer, thanks to the distinction between linear and non-linear services.
I would also like to express my appreciation and support for the rapporteur's proposals concerning the protection of minors, the prevention of racial hatred, and surreptitious advertising, and for the distinction drawn in the document between sponsorship and product placement.
I am also pleased that the proposal to shorten the intervals between commercial breaks during films to 30 minutes has been rejected, as this prevents the distortion of the proportions of the film or a loss of its artistic value.
Mrs Hieronymi's report is a good document and provides a basis for further work aimed at regulating linear and non-linear services.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the Commission and the rapporteur intended a slight liberalisation of advertising law.
However, I believe it has been hijacked by extremists.
Here are some of the most damaging elements.
A ban on advertising during children's programmes means there will be fewer of them and the remainder will be of lower quality.
Jobs will be lost in the media and the toy industry.
The ban also extends to news, documentaries, advisory programmes, theatre, opera, any form of sponsorship and product placement.
The consequence will be to reduce revenue to the commercial media, bringing their very future into doubt.
The right to short reporting - 90 seconds of someone else's broadcast for free - will destroy commercial news and sports reporting.
As you will see, I only have 90 seconds here.
The ban on some foods would be better addressed by working with the food industry to improve its products and safeguard jobs, rather than blaming the advertising industry for something it does not control.
A ban on advertising alcohol will not stop people drinking.
Prohibition did not stop it in the USA.
The directive seeks to use the country-of-origin principle to solve differences between Member States, yet it undermines that very principle.
It will not work.
I have time here for one example.
Many Swedish media companies have been based in Britain to enjoy our employment laws.
They are subject to British law, but they broadcast into Sweden.
Sweden has more stringent child protection laws than the UK.
It is justifiably unhappy.
The IND/DEM Group and UKIP back Sweden's right to decide what happens on Swedish territory and equally Britain's rights on UK soil.
The directive offers no solution, only an ongoing problem.
I have introduced amendments to reject the Commission proposal.
Moderate Members will support this.
Madam President, President Reagan famously said, 'If it moves, tax it.
If it keeps moving, regulate it.
And if it stops moving, subsidise it.'
I suggest to the House that this is the anti-business approach of the European Union when it comes to the television industry, especially with regard to regulating the industry.
We have here one of the most competitive industries that exists.
People in the industry fight to gain viewers, they fight to hold viewers and so, except in special cases, for example involving children, there is simply no need for regulation.
The operators are already working as hard as they can to make sure that what they present is attractive to viewers.
The second piece of damage that this proposal will do is to innovation.
Inevitably, what we are doing here is setting today's technology in stone.
None of us in this Chamber knows what will happen next year or the year after; we are creating, therefore, a barrier to innovation and we should reject the whole proposal.
(HU) Madam President, I would also like to join those congratulating Mrs Hieronymi on the excellent job she has done.
The new Member States have specific problems with regard to the media market, and I am very confident that this workable compromise which has been adopted can lead to the creation of a media market with a more uniform structure in the new Member States, as well as to greater competition in these countries too.
The media system and market in a number of the new Member States did not develop as a result of organic growth, but originate mainly from the media and infrastructure which were under party control during the years of dictatorship.
Media wars have broken out directly in these countries, which includes my own, Hungary, due to the established monopolies, and the particular infrastructure and regulatory conditions favouring a plurality of views have not been established.
This is precisely why I think this matter is important, and I sincerely hope that this will help the situation.
As an elected representative, I also feel it is essential that our fundamental values, by which I mean our views on the protection of minors, human liberties, cultural and linguistic diversity and minorities, are given a high profile in these regulations; after all, they are not only our common values, but also appear in any joint European basic document.
In order to achieve this, we cannot create unnecessary obstacles blocking the development of the media market in Europe.
This is why I am confident that the compromise reached will definitely guarantee that Europe can compete with the rest of the world.
Thank you for your efforts, and I wish this proposal every success in its implementation.
(FR) Madam President, Mrs Reding, Mrs Hieronymi, the adoption of this amended TVWF ('Television without Frontiers') Directive is going to enable the various players to develop within a clear framework, responding to the demands of the digital revolution and of the knowledge-based economy.
I would emphasise the positive point concerning the scope of application, with the inclusion of non-linear services and the unambiguous exclusion of private websites.
A balance needed to be struck between freedom of expression, the free movement of information and freedom of access to new services - such as VOD - and to valuable cultural and economic content.
The emphasis laid on quality will enable European production to strengthen its position.
The same is true of the promotion of European content.
The directive offers real progress with regard to the protection of minors and places ethical restrictions on advertising, but it must confirm matters, particularly with regard to the issue of health and of the fight against obesity.
I hope that our Parliament will confirm its support for my proposal to ban the advertising of products that do not comply with children's labour standards.
(DE) Madam President, heartfelt congratulations to Mrs Hieronymi and to Commissioner Reding; television is about to undergo a revolution, and, although opinions differ as to how that revolution will turn out, there is no doubt about the fact that television is becoming more democratic.
In future, it will not be just for a few major broadcasters to make television and determine what is shown on it; the example of YouTube already shows the way things are going, with the Internet as a new stage, and each consumer his own director.
Television is a living industry, and one that we in Europe must build up, in particular by opening the sector up as a labour market for creative people.
In the USA, more recently, all the new ideas in the audio-visual sector have originated from television, rather than from Hollywood, as in the past; one may take the television series '24' as an example.
Let us not be guided by prejudice, or else there will be a rude awakening in store for us.
What is needed, here in Europe, is a creative industry; too many restrictions - particularly on advertising, which is the only source of income apart from fees - harm the creatives in particular and ultimately result in more trash or cheap imports and to fewer European productions.
(PT) Television lives off the interface between three conflicting interests, namely those of the programme-makers, the operators and the viewers.
The Committee on Culture and Education voted for a solution that I feel is, broadly speaking, a balanced one.
It is not television as I myself would have it, but it is at least governed by rules.
Unfortunately, under pressure from the Commission and some operators, proposals have arisen in this plenary session that jeopardise this balance, to the detriment of the viewers.
As regards product placement, the current wording is reasonable.
Product placement is on the whole prohibited, with exceptions that the Member States can authorise, but pressure at the eleventh hour has led the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to table amendments that run counter to what had been accepted, and we object to this.
The Committee on Culture also voted for a proposal whereby programmes with product placement should be identified to the viewer for the purposes of consumer protection, but a signal that only appears every 20 minutes neither informs nor protects.
For example, when it comes to violent films, no one expects the warning only to appear at the beginning or before the interval.
As regards advertisement breaks, we would distinguish between 45 and 30 minutes depending on the type of programme.
This is the right way forward.
It is a solution that does not alter the thrust of the policy and that avoids the excesses of moral prohibitionism, as Mr Guardans CambÃ³ rightly pointed out.
(NL) Madam President, one explanation for the fact that more and more time is spent watching audiovisual products is that moving pictures hold a huge attraction for people, and it is a generally know fact that viewing habits of this kind are bound to have an impact on human behavioural patterns.
The content of the products on offer can be useful, but can also be so depressing that many members of the public avoid them on ethical grounds.
It is up to the authorities to protect the weaker members of society; they can do this by offering security, not only in the physical, but also the mental sense.
That being so, I am delighted with two sections of this report.
First of all, I am pleased with the stricter rules on jurisdiction.
It is right, in my view, that Member States should have more influence on what audiovisual services are offered within their territory, for every Member State has its own identity, and the audiovisual services provided should be in keeping with this.
It is not enough to comply with the rules of the country where the provider is established.
My second point concerns the position of minors and vulnerable people, both of which categories of persons are relatively easily led and can end up manifesting behaviour that is dangerous to themselves and sometimes to their environment as well. It is up to the legislator to minimise the likelihood of damage.
First of all, my thanks to Mrs Hieronymi, Mrs RÃŒhle and Mr Greg Paulger from the Commission for all their excellent work.
I probably got Greg into trouble there, but thank you very much for all your work.
There were a few issues that I had great concerns about right at the beginning.
One was the extension of scope. I would like to see no extension of scope, because I worry about regulating services that do not yet exist, but I am very happy with the compromise that we have reached.
I am also very happy with the work that was done by the rapporteur in recognising the role of self-regulation.
We have to recognise that product placement exists.
There are examples of German car companies that have gone outside Germany and placed their cars in an American programme that is shown back in Germany, and that has led to a lot of revenue, not only for European producers, but also for European agencies.
Let us realise that there is a world outside the EU.
When it comes to advertising breaks, in a world of multi-channelled TV with thousands of channels and hundreds of devices, we should leave this to the market.
If you over-advertise, people will switch off.
Finally, we need to make sure that we have a strong country-of-origin principle.
We must not allow the enemies of the single market to win their arguments.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, it was a year ago, Commissioner, that you presented us with this document, and I think that a lot has happened in that time.
The report has undergone a lot of development, and we have been presented with plenty of acceptable compromises.
It is evident from the debate that one great central concern is advertising, and, as this is something with which a lot of us have a problem, we will have to discuss it; the question is: how must we control the amount of advertising in order to protect consumers while at the same time enabling creative artists to bring good, high-quality products onto the market without charging even more?
Advertising is something we are not going to be able to get away from.
We have spent a lot of time considering product placement, and have - albeit with certain exceptions - banned it.
We will have to keep an eye on what the Member States do with this, and how this ban is handled; under no circumstances must we end up with a situation in which content is determined by the product advertised.
Clear boundaries have to be drawn, and I think that characters in Bavarian crime programmes have been driving around in BMWs for quite some time without anyone so far being bothered by it.
I would also like - very briefly - to say something about the country of origin principle, for that too is very important and must not be allowed to result in media service providers deliberately moving their production operations to other countries in search of less onerous requirements, and that is something else that we have to deal with.
Madam President, we know that revenue from advertising through traditional media has been reduced, so the equation is simple: if we do not allow more revenue for traditional TV to be earned, then all hopes of quality productions, documentaries and cultural vibrancy are lost.
I believe in the market power of the 'off' button.
Advertisers will not pay for unseen adverts and viewers will not watch unacceptable TV; but unacceptability refers as much to the standard of programmes as to the excessive presence of advertising, so we are back to my original equation.
On balance, allowing advertising breaks in programmes scheduled for 30 minutes is both practical and essential, as is cautious product placement.
On short news reports, we have been very exercised by sports events.
We need to take care with our words so as to allow some reasonable inclusion in general news programmes, while noting that public interest does not extend so far that on a day-to-day basis it undermines the value of copyright or other exclusive rights that have been purchased.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this directive is to totally liberalise the advertising market, and that means a single kind of television, one that is exclusively for entertainment purposes.
It will become impossible to make quality, educational or cultural television.
European cultural production will be greatly harmed, and this directive will cause serious damage to the dailies, which will no longer be able to attract advertising.
Television often gives rise to superfluous needs, and advertising thus becomes a conveyor belt of induced needs: that is why we need to do more to protect the weak members of society, in particular children.
Outrageous as it is, product placement in fact changes the very nature of advertising, which goes from being the essence of selling to the very essence of television broadcasting.
The important liberal philosopher, Karl Popper, described television as a 'bad teacher'.
Today, with this directive, the proclamations of the 'bad teacher' become proclamations 'without frontiers'.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen an Olympic marathon is nearing its completion.
The revised directive 'Television Without Frontiers' is set for vote at the part-session of the European Parliament, in the hope of an approval that will bring to order the most widely known mass media that is television.
It was not an easy task for the Commission and especially for rapporteur Mrs Hieronymi, whom I must congratulate on her efforts but also my colleagues that contributed so that this directive could reach its final stage.
We will know the result this time tomorrow.
The only thing certain is that this race has no losers, because all of us gave our best so that the citizens can gain from this.
In a Europe without frontiers, this directive will harmonise the basic legal framework regarding mass media and will set minimum standards to protect even more the viewer who is surrounded by constant 'fire'.
Television is a medium that has the power to educate, project, inform, entertain, spread civilisation, teach and open up a dialogue with the citizens.
This is its role or at least this is the television we want.
A pluralistic television. Available to all.
A television without frontiers.
The directive we are called upon to vote should be comprehensive and moreover it should be implemented immediately.
This is our main consideration and what we are trying for.
The Council must be convinced that it is their obligation towards society and the generations to follow, to observe the rules of respect and harmonisation of the directive to national law, which is what every civilised nation deserves and what four hundred and fifty million citizens, viewing us now, demand.
(SV) Madam President, the harmful effects of alcohol cost the European Union EUR 125 billion each year, corresponding to 1.3% of the EU's GDP.
Alcohol is, then, not just any product, and there must therefore be restrictions on television advertisements for alcohol.
Children who watch television during the day should not have to be exposed to advertisements for alcoholic drinks.
I therefore hope that Parliament will support Amendment 169 tomorrow.
The directive we are debating in this House is a minimum directive.
The idea, then, is that each country should be able to have its own more restrictive rules on advertising.
In practice, however, this is impossible.
In Sweden, for example, we have banned advertisements aimed at children, but TV 3 and Channel 5 are nonetheless able to get around these rules by broadcasting from Great Britain.
That is absurd.
Broadcasts aimed at Swedish viewers should follow Swedish rules, just as broadcasts aimed at British viewers should follow British rules.
I therefore hope that Parliament will vote tomorrow in favour of amendments such as numbers 246 and 153 that give the recipient country some say about the advertising content of broadcasts.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive has a great impact on two levels: firstly, on that of industry and technology, because we are talking here about an advanced sector of European industry, and, secondly, on that of public opinion, of the development of ideas - in other words, the cultural level of European society.
We therefore think it important to strike a balance between these two elements, namely technology and the content and characteristics of the product.
For this reason, we have asked for a great deal of attention to be paid to the issue of the impact on children, so that the media, as an instrument of growth, does not become an instrument of manipulation.
We are in favour, Commissioner, of finding substantial resources for investment through advertising and other methods of funding, but we want clear rules so that advertising does not stifle and destroy the creativity of production, artistic freedom and the importance of European cultural production, which must be supported.
I am therefore against advertising getting out of control.
I am in favour of 45 minutes between commercial breaks, but not of the kind of advertising that starts to predominate over the product and its quality.
Finally, talking about audiovisuals inevitably means talking about quality issues, and in this case, too, Commissioner, I appeal to your sensitivity: this is not only a question of business, but also a question of pluralism, insofar as a directive of this kind must necessarily include and respect plurality arguments, too.
It is in fact not just culture, but also democracy in Europe, that is linked to this issue.
(FR) Madam President, television is the main source of information and entertainment in Europe; it is watched by all individuals, of all ages, on a daily basis.
For more than 15 years, the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive has been the benchmark where television regulation in Europe is concerned.
This directive has been able to guarantee a common level of protection for important general policy objectives and to make it easier for television services to be distributed beyond borders, thanks in particular to the country of origin principle.
It has also promoted freedom of expression and of information and has played a significant part in promoting the expression of cultural identities.
However, with the digital age, convergence and the arrival of new audiovisual media services, a new revision of this regulatory framework has proved necessary.
The text proposed to us today represents a major step not only for the audiovisual media sector, but also for the people of Europe.
It is the outcome of a real effort to cooperate and exchange views, overseen for several months by our rapporteur.
I should like to congratulate her on the quality of her report and on the considerable efforts she has made to get through these most sensitive of subjects.
Taking account of the two sides - economic and cultural - of audiovisual services, the revision of the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive enables us to draw conclusions from current technological developments and to adapt the Community legal framework to future developments.
In this regard, the very principle of extending the directive to new audiovisual media services is crucial.
Since non-linear services are competing more and more with traditional services, their contribution to the promotion of cultural diversity is crucial and conforms to the objectives laid down in the UNESCO convention.
Furthermore, a major step has been taken for linear services, with short extracts being granted a right of access.
This right will, however, have to be exercised under reasonable conditions and in compliance with exclusivity rights.
Finally, as regards advertising, we have been given the opportunity for the first time to have clear rules on product placements: with the guarantees proposed to us, product placements will provide new opportunities for European audiovisual production and creation, while guaranteeing consumer production and information.
(SV) Mr President, I acknowledge that we need to overhaul the directive in the light of the developments, especially technical developments, that have taken place in the audiovisual sphere over the last 20 years.
However, the Commission proposal and the amendments to the directive all have some unhelpful features.
The directive is, in quite a few respects, in danger of bringing about a deterioration in consumer protection generally and, in particular, of exacerbating the effects of television on minors.
Just as there has been technical progress, the quantity and diversity of advertisements has increased over the last 20 years.
Advertisements are everywhere nowadays and are even aimed at children and other minors.
There must be regulations that create a balance when it comes to the quantity of advertisements permitted and to the particular consumer groups at which advertisements may be targeted.
Even though what we have here is a minimum directive, many of us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of stringent rules governing all advertising in children's programmes and advertising aimed at children.
We understand why the Commission has banned advertisements in religious programmes but question why it is considered less important to protect children from commercial influences than it is to protect people who watch this type of programme.
Children cannot distinguish advertisements from other programmes and cannot, therefore, understand the ulterior motives behind advertising.
Like many others, I am opposed to advertisements aimed at children.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new directive is to be welcomed, for it enables us to guarantee that the traditional television channels on the public network will retain a fighting chance in the digital era.
There is no point, as you know, in imposing stricter requirements on the traditional public network television, if these new rules did not apply to on-demand television, which is expanding at an enormous rate.
I would therefore like to offer the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, and Commissioner Reding my heartfelt congratulations.
Nevertheless, I have two comments.
First of all, with regard to product placement: it is, of course, to be welcomed that this can be done, as it also benefits the television sector in enabling it to tap into a new instrument in order to attract advertisers and compensate for the loss of income from television commercials.
Needless to say, a sound framework needs to be worked out for this - one that safeguards editorial autonomy on the one hand and an announcement before and after the programme on the other, so that the viewing public would then know where they stand.
Secondly, Mrs Hieronymi, Commissioner Reding, in Flanders, we would like to see Europe approve a general ban on advertising in children's programmes.
While this view is widely supported in Flanders, and also in Sweden, there is apparently - and regrettably - less enthusiasm for the idea in the rest of Europe.
What we can do, though, is to impose rules that are stricter than the European minimum we will be approving tomorrow, but as you know, those rules are at risk of being undermined by channels that transmit to the viewing public in Flanders from other Member States.
What is now before us is, unfortunately, not enough to stave this off, so I hope that, tomorrow, we will not weaken the Council compromise even further, and finally, that a code of conduct will be introduced for commercials for fast foods, for example, in our neighbouring countries, which, although this is to be welcomed, we would be better off banning from our screens altogether, and certainly from children's programmes.
In fact, decision-making in this respect is still at Member State level.
This would be the best instrument in the fight against obesity, which we do, of course, all support.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has mainly emphasised the industrial and economic importance of television, which is indeed considerable, but, universally accessible as it is, television is above all the greatest information tool and the main vehicle of culture, as well as being an instrument of power.
There is currently a tendency to extend the space for advertising on television, and this is likely to limit the role of the press and its freedom to gain funding.
The article authorising product placement is based on a falsehood, because first this principle is denied and then it is sanctioned in a thousand different ways.
This will mean that the makers of all fictional programmes and of other shows will see their creativity not just used, but also contaminated.
I therefore understand the painful compromise reached by the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, who has done an excellent piece of work.
However, I, together with many others, have tabled an amendment aimed at eliminating the idea of product placement, in addition to other amendments.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that democracy is a system of public opinion, and the freer the media is, the better the democracy.
This directive regulates the media in the audiovisual sector and I believe that the question we should ask is: does it make it freer or less free than before?
In order to respond to that question, we should consider this equation: the greater the interventionism of the authorities, the less free the media is, and vice versa: the less intervention there is from the authorities, the greater the freedom of the media.
In my view, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is unfortunately excessively interventionist: with regard to advertising, with regard to quotas of audiovisual production, with regard to unnecessarily extending the scope to non-linear services, but above all, with regard to giving the national regulatory authorities power to protect the fundamental right of freedom of expression.
All democrats know that protecting fundamental rights falls exclusively to courts of justice.
This directive, however, and through no fault of the rapporteur, who has fought extremely bravely - and I thank you for that, Mrs Hieronymi - gives national regulatory authorities the power to decide what is accurate and what is not, what may be broadcast and what may not or, as has happened in Catalonia, one of the European regions with the poorest level of democracy in the whole of the European Union, which operators may broadcast and which may not.
That is a way of opening ourselves up to prior censorship.
I would ask you, please, Mrs Reding, to take this seriously, to see whether we can avoid it, amongst other things because we will have to listen carefully to what organisations such as Reporters Without Borders, the World Association of Newspapers or the World Press Freedom Committee have to say about this issue. They are going to embarrass us.
I hope that that embarrassment will at least force us to correct our mistake in time.
Mr President, as I am very well aware that time is pressing, I am not now going to read out the very long list of amendments that the Commission is in a position to accept and those that it has to reject.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to put forward any arguments either.
I am going to submit this list to you and to the political groups.
I must say, however, that the 'Television without Frontiers' regulation, which has been in force for many years now, has proved its worth, by developing the television sector in Europe and by giving a real opportunity to European content.
We are now faced with a fundamental change where technology is concerned: we must therefore adapt the directive to the modern world, with new, fairly flexible definitions that can stand the test of time and the development of technology.
The great majority of Parliament is of this opinion.
We have here the prospect of quality television, where regulated advertising serves to fund European programmes and where media services can take advantage of the country of origin principle and, thus, of the single market: they must both comply with the basic values that are the protection of minors and the ban on incitement to racial hatred, while supporting the production of European works.
While we can thus summarise in a few sentences what Parliament is going to vote on, it is, of course, an imperfect summary, but at least we have tried.
The full complexity of the undertaking is illustrated by the multitude of amendments tabled.
I must say that, among the amendments of the report by the Committee on Culture and Education - once again, I am extremely grateful for the exemplary work done by its rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi - the Commission can accept 44 of them and it can accept 59 of them in part: in other words, two-thirds of the amendments contained in the Hieronymi report.
That tells you something about the quality of the positive work done by Parliament: it should be congratulated.
As regards the amendments tabled in plenary, the Commission can accept eight of them in full and 24 in part: Mr President, as time is pressing, the list will be handed over to you.
Allow me, in closing, to thank the MEPs and the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, who have really done a precise piece of work - one that is very complicated, but that is in the interest of our European television and media sectors.
European content, which will have a chance thanks to you, owes you a great deal!
(ET) The Baltic States almost bloodlessly rid themselves of the Soviet occupation.
The greatest number of people gave their lives defending the freedom and objectivity of the press.
On 20 August 1990, twenty Estonian patriots resisted Moscow's OMON Special Forces soldiers to defend the Tallinn Television Tower.
On 13 January 1991, fifteen people died defending the television tower in Vilnius.
Dozens more Lithuanians were injured in gas attacks against the television and radio building and transmitting centre.
In discussing the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive, the people of the Baltic States think about unbiased media more than advertising sales.
It is manifestly clear that the Kremlin has now once again reined in the media.
What is less well known is that part of the European Union media has been transformed into an obedient instrument of Moscow.
Our liberal attitudes permit the PervÃµi Baltiiski Kanal, which has its headquarters in Riga, to turn the Russian-speaking inhabitants of the three Baltic States against our countries' legal governments.
The channel is funded not by Russian businessmen, but by Russian propagandists. Their skills have reached a new level, and the channel's ideological message is skilfully concealed among entertainment.
This does not, however, fool media experts.
Every Member State must be able to defend itself against such hostile foreign propaganda.
My motion to amend was signed by all of the representatives from the Baltic States, regardless of their party affiliation.
We have already experienced the Kremlin's ideological manipulation, and do not wish to endure it again.
(NL) It is important to promote the free movement of European television programmes and for the production of these programmes not to be hindered by excessively strict legislation on advertising.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is opting for a realistic look on product placement.
Information is useful, but consumers are not waiting for a reminder during a television programme.
A reminder prior to and after a programme are sufficient.
Income from advertising and product placement is needed in order to help finance European productions; the alternative to that is even more cheap American ones, full of product placement.
Children's programmes must be subject to stricter standards, for obesity is an increasing problem.
Given the huge impact of advertising of unhealthy food on children's menu choices, advertising directed at this target group should be restricted.
I would therefore argue in favour of developing an effective code of conduct with regard to advertising, product placement and other marketing of unhealthy drinks and food aimed at children.
Finally, I would still advocate a strong country of origin principle.
Television programme makers should not be made subject to extra rules and regulations when they want to offer their programmes elsewhere in the European Union.
What we must do is enhance the sales of European audiovisual products.
(IT) The outcome of the vote on the Television without Frontiers Directive shows great maturity on the part of Parliament.
In fact, thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, of all the draftsmen of opinions, of the Council and of the Commission, the directive provides an effective tool for promoting the competitiveness of the European audiovisual industry, leaving reasonable scope for private funding (this is nothing new, audiovisual services live off advertising) while guaranteeing an appropriate level of protection for consumers and, above all, for the most vulnerable members of society (such as children and the disabled).
I would, however, have preferred more courage to have been shown, for example regarding the introduction of product placement.
While I agree with those who wish to safeguard the creativity and independence of writers, together with the quality of productions, I must nevertheless point out that, in 2007, and on the international market, this practice is a reality, and denying this fact means risking a loss of competitiveness, funding and market quotas.
I hope that the majority of the Member States will be able to show more courage and more openmindedness than these institutions have so far shown.
(SV) This difficult issue presented by modern technology produces a conflict in terms of goals, with freedom pitted against the interest we have in providing certain forms of protection.
On the one hand, it is awkward censoring programmes broadcast from other Member States but, on the other hand, we believe that each Member State must be able to make its own decisions on cultural and moral issues relating, for example, to advertisements for alcohol and tobacco and advertisements aimed at children and to rules governing discrimination and pornography.
Each Member State must be able to make its own laws in these areas.
Technical developments involving rapid broadband Internet and mobile telephony facilitate media services that are similar to television and in which compliance with the ethical rules is difficult to monitor.
In this area too, however, the Member States need to be able, if they so wish, to legislate in such a way that there are regulations governing child pornography and copyright.
This is undoubtedly a very complex matter, but we believe that Sweden's position in the Council should have been given a better hearing at November's Council meeting.
We believe, however, that the proposal by the Committee on Culture and Education is better than the Council's, and we therefore support this report.
European Union annual report on human rights (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the European Parliament's annual report on Human Rights.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to present to you today the European Union's annual report on human rights.
The first report on human rights was published in 1999, when Finland, as it was this time too, was involved in drafting the report in its role as Presidency of the European Union.
The purpose of the report has not changed since then.
It still deals, in a way that is unique, with the European Union's human rights policy and what has been achieved within its framework.
The report now completed concerns the EU action and policies implemented in the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 and which were aimed at promoting a universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The report follows seven earlier annual reports published between 1999 and 2005, in accordance with the declaration adopted in 1998 by the European Council.
Issued on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it urged the European Union to step up its work on human rights.
It also called on the EU to draw up an annual report on human rights.
The report on human rights presents an overview of the work done to promote human rights and democracy by the institutions of the European Union.
The EU's external policies and internal circumstances are also subjects for scrutiny.
Furthermore, there is a separate section devoted to an examination of action on the part of the European Parliament to promote human rights and democracy.
To its credit, the European Parliament raises issues on human rights and makes certain that they also receive the attention they deserve in the other Union institutions.
The report highlights the special priorities of the EU's human rights policy, such as the mainstreaming of human rights.
In practice, mainstreaming has meant increasing interaction between human rights experts and national think-tanks and presenting aspects of human rights in different EU areas of activity, such as crisis management and the export of arms.
The European Union has developed ways of dealing with special problems, such as women, security and children, in connection with armed conflicts.
The Personal Representative of the Secretary-General/High Representative has been actively involved in mainstreaming human rights in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in increasing awareness of the EU guidelines on human rights.
The European Union has adopted special guidelines on certain issues and in this way has determined the priorities in its human rights policy.
The Union is opposed to the death penalty under any circumstances and has highlighted individual cases where the minimum standards of international law have not been met.
During the reporting period, the Union drew particular attention to countries where policy on the death penalty has been changing.
The European Union has encouraged different countries to join the international Convention against Torture and thus reinforce action aimed at its abolition.
Moreover, the Union has specified certain priority target countries where it proposes to improve the human rights situation by trying in various ways to alleviate the suffering of children caught up in armed conflicts.
It has been important to highlight this issue in multilateral international forums and make the EU better equipped to deal with it in the context of European Security and Defence Policy operations.
With regard to the EU's guidelines on human rights defenders, the Union has launched global campaigns on freedom of speech and women's human rights.
Because human rights defenders very often come under attack themselves, their rights are still one of the EU's priorities.
The Council appreciates the central role played by the European Parliament in our joint efforts to defend and promote the implementation of human rights.
The Sakharov Prize awarded yearly for those who speak on behalf of freedom of thought has a key part to play here.
Over the years Parliament has acknowledged the achievements of major figures, such as Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan.
We welcome the fact that this year's Sakharov Prize has gone to the Belarusian opposition leader Alyaksandr Milinkevich.
There is reason to believe that this internationally recognised honour will encourage Mr Milinkevich and others to continue their important work to strengthen democratic forces in Belarus.
During the period under review in the report, which is to say between the summer of 2005 and the summer of 2006, there was a major change to the UN structures.
The negotiations on the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council and, later, the first sitting of the new Council, provided a crucial framework for EU action in the area of multilateral human rights policy.
The EU's goal the whole time was to establish a Council that would give human rights the status it had been guaranteed in the UN Charter.
Although we did not get all the issues that we had promoted in the final text adopted in March 2006, the Union nonetheless believes that the establishment of the UN Human Rights Council will be an essential element in strengthening the UN Human Rights System.
It will also be a major step forward in the UN reform process as a whole.
The promotion of human rights, democracy and progress in the rule of law is hugely important in the fight against terrorism and various extremist movements.
In statements made in several UN and other forums, the EU has reiterated its opinion that a respect for human rights is vital in the work to combat terrorism.
The Presidency has emphasised on several occasions that effective action against terrorism and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually supportive goals.
Political dialogue is undeniably one key tool in the promotion of human rights.
The mainstreaming of human rights has involved an attempt to guarantee that human rights issues will be dealt with consistently in contact between the EU and third countries at different levels.
This also applies to countries with which the EU is involved in a special human rights dialogue, such as China and Russia.
The human rights report this year for the first time underlines the EU's commitment to enhancing dialogue between cultures, both within the Union and with third countries.
The victims of breaches of human rights and the defenders of human rights around the world expect a lot from the European Union, and for a reason.
The European Union, as a Community based on values, may be expected to strive to promote human rights and democracy with clear goals in sight.
This report will help us judge how well the Union has been able to respond to this challenge.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I very much welcome the publication of the 2006 annual report on human rights.
This is the first time that this report has really been a combined effort.
We have battled for that.
Last year we had the debate here in plenary and I said that I would be very happy if we could prepare the report together.
I would have liked to have one of the prefaces.
Unfortunately it seems it was too late, but I think the Commission should have been visible.
It now seems to be an established practice always to have a special session on human rights and democracy before Christmas.
It is a good tradition; it is a noble tradition, to see what has been implemented and what the new developments are.
The annual report this year is again a valuable record of the combined efforts of us all in promoting and protecting human rights around the world, and a reflection of the positive way in which the European Union has come together to produce it.
This debate gives me the opportunity to quickly highlight some activities in 2006.
First, mainstreaming human rights into external policies ranked high on our EU priority list in 2006, thanks to the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies.
It is indeed a source of satisfaction to note that all actors within the EU are more and more committed to this very important aspect of our policies.
However, let us not forget that mainstreaming or, as I also like to call it, 'integrating' human rights into all policies, is not an end in itself, but an approach to achieving overarching goals.
For the European Union, these goals have a clear basis in our Treaty, which calls on us to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through our various external policies.
In this context, we are particularly pleased that human rights and democracy issues have been integrated into the legal texts of all the new financing instruments under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
Secondly, mainstreaming is a never-ending process; we need to constantly maintain our efforts and introduce new tools.
I am happy to inform you in this context that last June the Commission revised the mandates of its heads of delegation, following up on the report by Mr Agnoletto.
These mandates now specifically mention human rights and democracy issues, and therefore place greater priority on reporting and acting in this regard.
Similarly, in the context of the 'human rights clauses' of our agreements, we have seen the creation of the new forums for dialogue or exchanges of views with third countries.
The number of occasions to discuss the promotion of and respect for human rights has been growing, from Argentina and Bangladesh to India, Jordan, Morocco, Turkmenistan and Vietnam.
That is in addition to the institutionalised human rights dialogues and consultations and the various political dialogues where human rights issues are regularly raised.
Last but not least, the Commission continues to include the human rights and democracy 'essential elements' clause in the negotiation of the new bilateral partnership and cooperation agreements.
This is, for instance, the case for the agreement with six ASEAN countries.
Likewise, preparations are being made for negotiating an agreement with China, and the Commission remains fully committed to the inclusion of this clause in conformity with our standard practice.
Thirdly, while mainstreaming or integrating human rights issues in all our policies, we also need to focus on some specific aspects of the human rights policy.
These have been exemplified by two communications from the Commission: one called 'Roadmap on equality between women and men' and the other 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child'.
The year 2006 has also been characterised by the pivotal changes seen within the United Nations human rights machinery, with the new Human Rights Council that has already been mentioned.
Whilst there was initially great cause for optimism, for example the active participation of NGOs in debates or the desire to move away from the failure of its predecessor the Commission for Human Rights, the overall picture at the end of the year is a cause for concern, not least because of the discouraging signs of politicisation of this new forum.
We, the European Union, have to renew our efforts and engage more with a number of actors in Geneva in order to convince them that the international community needs an effective Human Rights Council.
We still have the possibility to make this new body work and deliver.
Indeed, we have to remain hopeful that today's special session on Darfur will yield some positive results.
I cannot conclude without indicating once again my personal satisfaction, as well as the Commission's satisfaction, with the vote that took place earlier today on the proposal for a regulation establishing the new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
This instrument will make it easier for the Commission to establish priorities when implementing the objectives contained in the regulation and in keeping with its scope.
However, we know too well that measures to promote human rights and democracy deserve to be as worldwide, numerous, multisectoral and cross-cutting as possible.
The fact that the number of beneficiaries has expanded will also have to be taken into account.
But the enhanced complementarity with the various tools, which range from political dialogue and diplomatic demarches to various instruments of financial and technical cooperation, including both geographic and thematic programmes, is warmly welcomed.
Finally, we are looking forward to developing more integrated approaches to human rights and democracy under the new instrument.
There continues to be some debate about human rights and democracy as if they were two different issues.
However, we think that human rights are the foundation for democracy and democracy is necessary to develop and protect human rights.
Therefore, let us not create artificial demarcations.
In any case, we think this is a good basis for continuing our work in the year to come.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki has called the Sakharov Prize into question and I would like to say to her that the Women in White are defenceless women, wives, mothers and daughters of Cuban political dissidents, who make a huge effort to come from many different Cuban towns to meet peacefully and silently on Sundays and to walk together through the streets of Havana dressed in white.
They were doing so this Sunday, when they suffered harassment, threats and insults from people who saw fit to celebrate human rights day in that way.
It is absurd for me to have to point out that these women are not dangerous counter-revolutionary terrorists funded by the CIA, but simply women who are not willing to give in to injustice and the trampling of their most fundamental rights as human beings.
It is therefore also ridiculous that the Cuban regime should still not be allowing some of its representatives to leave the country to receive the Sakharov Prize that the European Parliament awarded to them last year.
We do not know what has happened with the efforts that the President of this Parliament promised to make a year ago now, but if he has done anything, then its results are plain to see.
I am therefore pleased with the initiative by Mrs Flautre and Mr Brok to send a delegation to the island.
Personally, I would not be opposed to that delegation also taking advantage of that trip to talk with the country's authorities and hence to gauge the changing political climate.
I would however call upon the European Parliament's services immediately to begin the formal procedures for requesting the relevant permits for entry into the country.
I would also call upon the Commission and the Council to apply all the pressure it can to ensure that those permits are granted.
If the response is favourable, as I hope it will be, we could express a minimum but effective degree of solidarity.
If it is negative, however, Mr President, then that would demonstrate the attitude of the current Cuban Government, something of which the European institutions should take very good note.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to thank the Council for coming for the second year running to present its annual report on human rights at this December sitting, which the European Parliament is in fact dedicating to human rights.
I naturally welcome the work that the Council has done on this eighth report and I would like in particular to congratulate it on the paragraph dedicated to action by the European Parliament.
It would appear that they are beginning to listen to us.
I also share the Council's view on the importance of the Community acting in a consistent manner.
This principle is valid in all fields, but it is particularly important when it comes to human rights.
The European Union must not just be consistent, but exemplary, in its fulfilment of its international obligations.
It is our moral duty to stand firm in our defence of our values and to place human rights, the rule of law and international law at the centre of our actions, particularly at times when any of these principles are called into question, even on occasions by democratic governments.
We must make it clear that breaches of human rights cannot be allowed in European Union territory and act firmly in order to counter the deterioration that has taken place in respect for the instruments providing safeguards and guarantees.
I would like to see greater commitment from the Council with regard to this concern, and I would like to take this opportunity to correct the report's reference to the Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transportation and Illegal Detention of Prisoners, since the Council has confused the investigation being carried out by the Council of Europe with the one we are carrying out in this Parliament.
There is an ever greater connection between human rights in the Union's external policy and in its internal policy, and one example of this is the growing link between security, development cooperation and human rights.
The European Union must accept its responsibilities as a global player and, to this end, it must stand firm and speak with one voice on the world stage.
Greater visibility and more decisive action on the part of the European Union with regard to longstanding conflicts, such as the Palestine conflict or the Darfur crisis, will undoubtedly be a way for Europe to contribute to these human rights that we are all defending here today.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would be grateful if you could add my time to the time that I was given before, so that, on behalf of the ALDE Group, we have two minutes.
I would like to apologise for Mr Cappato's absence.
He has had a personal emergency and, therefore, I am speaking on behalf of the group.
I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their hard work, and I am glad we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses take place.
I am pleased that there is a section devoted to the European Parliament this time.
I find it difficult, however, that when we are talking about human rights in the subcommittee, we are told that we cannot look at abuses within the EU.
I know that is covered by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but we must find a way of bringing together what we are doing in the Committee on Civil Liberties and the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
One area where we need to be more proactive is the use of cluster bombs.
I know a lot of people say it is a defence issue, but I think it is also a human rights issue.
Although it is not covered by the 1997 Treaty on Landmines, it still has the same devastating effect on civilians.
I call on the Council and the Commission to join the growing opinion that cluster munitions should be banned completely, and I hope that the rumours that the Commission is going to reduce funding for mine clearance are inaccurate, because it is a human rights issue if people cannot move around freely.
Another concern, which is mentioned in the report - and I am very pleased about that - is the continuing existence of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay detention camp, an issue we have raised many times over the last year.
Can the Council, in particular, give an assurance that it will step up its efforts to put pressure on the American Government to close it down once and for all, which is, indeed, what Parliament has called for?
I am pleased also that trafficking in human beings has been fairly high on the EU agenda, but pressure must be put on those Member States that have not already done so to sign up to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.
Finally, I am pleased that we have a section in the report on disabled peoples' rights.
This is timely as, tomorrow, as you are very well aware, the signing of the UN Convention on People with Disabilities will take place.
Let us hope that it is speedily ratified.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, last Sunday the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, died, by a strange coincidence precisely fifty-eight years after the signature by world leaders, in 1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
As we often state, the European Union is a project founded upon values, the foremost of which is respect for, and promotion of, human rights.
Many of us believe that that is right.
The fight for human rights must increasingly involve cross-cutting aspects, such as the promotion of democracy, governability, conflict prevention, crisis management, humanitarian law etc. It is also important to stress the universal and indivisible nature of those rights.
That is precisely why it is so sad to see certain principles and values being so horrendously eroded.
Specifically, we must remember how necessary it is to tackle and correct the effect of the European Union's internal policies, such as the fight against terrorism or the management of migration, on human rights in third countries.
Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the Council is making a considerable effort to ensure transparency in the EU's human rights dialogues with China, Iran and Russia, but it is still worrying to see the double standards applied when it comes to judging actions and attitudes depending on whether or not the country taking them is a potential economic ally or not.
This is also of concern when it comes to assessing compliance with the democratic clauses in certain association agreements.
Finally, the European Union must tackle head on the serious crisis of legitimacy and credibility affecting our arguments in support of human rights, particularly following the regrettable cases of cooperation or tacit collusion in illegal detentions and transportation, which in some cases amounts to directly condoning torture.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, a major element of the European Union's activities in the coming year should be to continue its support for the fight for democracy in Belarus.
Initiatives such as assistance for students who are victims of repression and funding for independent educational institutions or radio broadcasts are excellent ideas, but more could be done.
Around 20% of Belarusians watch EuroNews and 40% have access to the Internet.
These are opportunities we need to exploit.
An Internet service should be set up that is specifically aimed at these people.
A series of programmes should also be created within the framework of EuroNews which, if possible, would be broadcast in the Belarusian language.
I would like the Commission to consider this proposal within the framework of the European financial instrument for supporting democracy and human rights in the world, which was adopted today.
It is vital to continue exerting pressure on the Lukashenko regime using all possible means.
I strongly believe that this pressure will one day result in the European Parliament welcoming the president of a democratic country, rather than the leader of the Belarusian opposition.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report presents many positive things about the EU, for instance what it is doing to promote human rights and democracy.
However, the report has several glaring omissions - more than I can mention, so I will confine myself to the subject of China.
China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate is higher for women than for men.
Approximately 500 women commit suicide in China every day, and yet the report does not say one word about China's 'one child' policy, which denies women the right to make real choices in their lives.
What is more, it says nothing about disabled people in China.
I met with a disability group when I was there last year, and everything pointed to the fact that people with disabilities like Down's Syndrome are simply eliminated before or after birth.
In China the children of prisoners are ostracised by the Government and by society and they often - indeed, usually - have a worse chance of survival than their parents in prison. And those parents may have been imprisoned for any reason.
When you allow this kind of omission and, at the same time, sit down at friendly trade negotiations with China, you are in danger of signalling EU approval.
Mr President, today has been a day when Parliament has focused on human rights, with this debate and with the presentation of the Sakharov Prize earlier on, and I welcome that.
The Council report itself covers the EU external and internal policies, as well as bilateral EU human rights policies with regard to third countries and action on multilateral fora, in addition to analysing a range of thematic issues.
In terms of the process of putting the report together, I am still not satisfied that there has been sufficient consultation between the Council and Parliament and, in particular, with the Human Rights Sub-Committee.
Last year the Finnish Presidency was invited by the Parliament's annual report to consult actively with Parliament in the drafting of its own annual report.
However, this did not take place in as active a way as we had hoped for.
As agreed last year, Parliament supports the idea of a single EU report on human rights, representing the three institutions, to avoid unnecessary duplication of work.
However, that can only be achieved if there is increased consultation between the Council and Parliament.
Ideally, we should see the Council bringing a draft before the relevant committee so that we can have an exchange of views on the text before it is finally adopted.
I am rapporteur for the 2006 European Parliament report and I will continue to urge the Council to produce an all-encompassing cross-institutional report.
I will maintain the narrow focus of last year's report, to constructively assess and criticise the performance of the three institutions in the field of human rights.
Today, the Sakharov Prize was awarded to an outstanding candidate.
He is the leader of the opposition in Belarus and we have a responsibility to continue to support him.
I want to encourage the Council and Commission to continue to raise the profile of the Sakharov Prize in general.
In that regard, it is regrettable that two past award winners, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, and Ladies in White from Cuba, have not been able to come to Parliament to collect their awards.
I hope we will succeed in going to both of those countries with an EP delegation to deliver the awards.
(PL) Mr President, I am speaking today in the European Parliament on the 25th anniversary of the introduction of martial law in my country, Poland.
Martial law brought with it violence, arrests and imprisonment for thousands of people.
I spoke about this yesterday in Parliament, and now say these words again, appropriately enough, a few days after the death of General Augusto Pinochet, one of the world's cruellest dictators during the second half of the 20th century.
The European Union's annual report on human rights is one of its most important documents.
The European Parliament plays a key role in shaping the European Union's human rights policy.
In the future, I think that work on this report should be better coordinated with the work of the European Parliament in this field.
I refer in particular to the coordination of work on this report with the activities of the Subcommittee on Human Rights within the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I would like to draw your attention to the issue of coordinating the human rights policies of the European Union Member States with all European institutions.
There should be better coordination of work done in this field, so that we can avoid overlaps between human rights policy at a European level and the policies of individual Member States.
The human rights situation outside the European Union should be monitored on a systematic and transparent basis, so that appropriate measures can be taken in relation to countries which infringe these rights.
Human rights policies should be synchronised and should also be linked to all the financial instruments included in the European Union's budget.
A clause on human rights should be included in all agreements signed by the European Union with other countries.
Finally, I would like to stress the importance of the European Parliament's delegations to countries where infringements of human rights take place.
I would particularly like to emphasise the importance of the European Parliament's mission to Cuba during the period of change that this country is currently experiencing.
British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, St Helena, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus. The above - 14 in number - are reported as being British Overseas Territories, previously known as British Crown Colonies.
All but one are outside the EU.
They are 21st-century colonies that are located across the globe in strategic positions.
They are collectively inhabited by many thousands of human beings.
They have no elected governments and almost all have no law-making elected parliament.
They are not represented in the UN.
The Queen of England is their head of state and most are run by a governor or an administrator appointed by the British Government.
They are under the sovereignty of Britain and are occupied by the British army.
Yet, in this 250-page report on human rights and democracy, as in all previous reports like it, there is not a single word about them.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner why this is so.
I await their answers with keen interest.
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commission.
This is a very important debate which goes to the very heart of Europe, and is what this Parliament is all about.
This is a fine report, but it is only a report.
Very often what we need in these situations is action.
I should like everyone here to put their hands on their hearts and ask themselves whether we have done everything we possibly can to stop the massive abuse of human rights in Darfur, which continues as we speak.
Over 200 000 people have died and two and a half million people have been displaced.
It goes on, and on, and on.
I do not believe we can honestly say that we have done everything we can and that we have thrown Parliament's full weight behind diplomatic initiatives to end what is going on and put pressure on the Sudanese Government to stop what it is doing.
They are playing cat-and-mouse while hundreds of thousands of people are dying.
This is a fine report, and I support it.
However, as we debate the issue of human rights and the EU's position on them, I really do not believe we are doing enough to stop what is going on in Darfur.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Finnish Presidency, both for its work on human rights and for attending this plenary.
One of our aims has been to make this part-session a 'human rights plenary' every year.
On this, the day the Sakharov Prize was awarded, the Finnish Presidency has honoured its role, and I believe every other Presidency will now follow suit.
At the same time, I would like to thank the Presidency for taking on board a number of points which I suggested as a former rapporteur for human rights.
The references to the European Parliament are more numerous this year, and it has been involved more closely.
I look forward to that developing still further in the future.
The list of countries for priority action in your report very much matches my suggestions for the list of European countries of concern, which some people said was outlandish, but which you have adopted.
I wish to thank the Presidency for that too.
I would have liked to have seen more on the impact and implementation of the EU guidelines on human rights - there was just one page in 260 - but very much welcome the transparency of having a list of demarches relating to different countries.
However, I would ask the Presidency to recall the suggestion made by Parliament in my own report that a group of MEPs should become available for confidential consultation on those demarches in much the same way as for security issues.
I would ask the Presidency to consider that issue again.
In conclusion, I would ask both this and future Presidencies, together with the Commission, to bear in mind the need to undertake impact analyses, and to look not just at the direct work done on human rights, but also at the human rights impact of other external policies, particularly those on trade and development, so that we can mainstream human rights into all the European Union's work.
It is not just one report that counts, but what that report represents.
(PL) Mr President, the European Union does a lot for human rights in the world and we are all proud of that fact.
However, it seems that sometimes we forget about the rights of the citizens of the European Union itself.
I am referring here to the right to religious belief and the right to self-determination.
Man is, in part, a religious creature and the upholding of human rights also includes showing respect for this religious nature.
There are countries among us that are more sensitive than others in matters of religion.
I sometimes have the impression that respect for atheism is more important to us than respect for religious beliefs.
A further issue is the right to determine one's own future.
I have the impression that the majority of Europeans do not want Turkey to be part of the European Union.
However, in spite of this, we are in the process of negotiating with that country.
I think that this poses a threat, if not to the religious, then to the cultural identity of the citizens of the European Union.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this excellent debate, during which we received some criticism about the drafting procedure from several Members of Parliament.
This criticism will obviously be noted and in future we will also try to improve our consultation procedures with the European Parliament also.
Perhaps because this report is based on a decision by the European Council from 1998, the drafting procedure also takes place within the context of the Council.
We can, however, obviously improve the way we do things in this respect.
We also have to remember that the report does not attempt to cover all the possible human rights problems that exist around the world, but mainly focuses on a presentation of human rights work engaged in by the institutions of the European Union.
As I said in my opening speech, the main recent priority area has been the mainstreaming of human rights, as a component in other areas of policy, and obviously the enhancement of the European Union's external activity is a very important part of that, so that human rights can be fully integrated with external relations and development cooperation and so that the link between human rights and security, for example, may be clearly apparent to us.
Last year there was significant progress made when we reached agreement on the establishment of a European Fundamental Rights Agency.
That will do much also to reinforce human rights work within the European Union.
The Commissioner mentioned the fact that consensus has been reached on the human rights instrument.
I would sincerely like to thank Parliament for its cooperation.
This instrument will no doubt contribute to a process where human rights work in the European Union can be made more effective.
We need to remember that human rights work is not just about dealing with contemporary, clearly visible issues: above all, it is painstaking work over a long period of time which also requires patience in order to get results.
This debate also raised the issue of the almost philosophical question as to whether we have done all we can to improve the human rights situation.
That is often to do with finding the right balance between persuasion and drastic action and finding the right balance between encouragement and restrictive measures.
Obviously, dialogue normally yields better results than severing relations.
It is important to show that the European Union employs the same norms in its human rights work with all partners.
Unfortunately, we also surely have to bear in mind that, although we have done all we can, our resources are nevertheless insufficient, perhaps, to improve the situation everywhere in the world.
The challenges in the human rights sector thus abound, and this debate will certainly serve as a good basis on which the European Union institutions can continue to do their work.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, as time is short, I shall answer specific questions.
I shall begin with the Damas de Blanco mentioned by Mr Galeote.
The intended visit by Parliament's representatives to the Damas de Blanco is a good idea, and we hope, and we will do our best, to ensure that the EP delegation can meet a representative of the Cuban Government.
Under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, Cuba has been one of the countries targeted under Campaign 3 to promote the democratic process.
We shall try to go on with that.
We have also continuously requested the freeing of political prisoners and an end to the active repression of members of the political opposition and human rights activists.
Another Member asked what the European Union and the Commission are doing in Palestine.
If you consider human security - that is, freedom from want and freedom from fear - as the basis for human dignity, then no one else has done more than us to help the Palestinians with the basic services of health and energy and to at least maintain those basic services under very difficult circumstances through the Temporary International Mechanism and additional measures.
In particular, we have funded two elections - presidential and parliamentary - and we have also sent observers to observe those elections in order to create the basis for democracy.
On the whole, human rights, democracy and the rule of law have a fundamental place in all our ENP action plans; they are not only written into them but are also implemented, and we try to monitor their implementation.
On China, let me just say that in the future the inclusion of human rights, an essential clause in the new agreement that will be negotiated with China, will also hopefully reinforce the human rights dialogue that has been going on for 11 years, thus demonstrating our firm adherence to the principles of human rights and democracy in EU external policy.
As we have all seen today, with the new winner of the Sakharov Prize, we are working very strongly towards a democratic society in Belarus.
On 21 November we launched a non-paper, in which we show the Belarusian people what they could have if the regime changed and if they engaged in more democratisation, improving human rights and the rule of law.
Those are only a few examples, but I know time is pressing and therefore I cannot go into each and every question that has been raised here.
I thank you for the debate.
It has given all of us a chance to follow on.
I hope that next year we shall be ready to work together on a joint human rights report by the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Mr President, with respect, these debates are useful if they provide answers to our questions.
I asked a very important question about human rights and democracy in British colonies.
I have been given no answer.
I have received one motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Draft general budget for 2007, amended by the Council (all sections) - Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities - Draft amending budget No 6/2006 (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the reports:
by Mr Elles and Mr Grech on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget of the European Union for 2007 amended by the Council (all sections) (15637/2006 - C6-0442/2006 - -
and letters of amendment 1/2007 (SEC(2006)0762), 2/2007 (13886/2006 - C6-0341/2006) and 3/2007 (15636/2006 - C6-0443/2006) to the draft general budget of the European Union for 2007
Section I - European Parliament,
Section II - Council,
Section III - Commission,
Section IV - Court of Justice,
Section V - Court of Auditors,
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee,
Section VII - Committee of the Regions,
Section VIII(A) - European Ombudsman,
Section VIII(B) - European Data Protection Supervisor, and
- by Mrs GrÃ€Ãle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the amended proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities - C6-0207/2006 -, and
- by Mr Pittella, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on draft amending budget No 6/2006 of the European Union for 2006, Section III - Commission [15635/2006 - C6-0441/2006 -.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to draw the strands together as this will hopefully be our last debate on the 2007 budget.
I should also like to welcome the Council and its representatives, who have been somewhat confused at some points in our procedure, which has led to misunderstandings that we hope will be clarified before we come to the final vote.
I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for all the support she has given to most of Parliament's ideas.
Her support has been very helpful during this procedure.
I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their support and input into this procedure, but above all I should like to thank the Committee on Budgets staff who have enabled all of this to be put together.
Without them I do not think we would be at this stage in the proceedings.
At this juncture I should like to raise a couple of points as general rapporteur.
Not only have we been able to achieve - I believe it will be clarified that we have achieved this - the substantive negotiation on the Financial Regulation, which my colleague Mrs GrÃ€Ãle will deal with in a moment or two, but we have been able to establish in our way of doing things for the 2007 budget a very prudent approach on payments below the 1%, largely because we are at the stage of having new programmes for the Financial Perspective.
There are no particular requests or demands from the groups or committees.
That is something we can no doubt expect in future years.
So basically we re-establish the PDB, but with emphasis on our political priorities concerning research innovation where we have had additional appropriations.
Secondly, we have taken what I would call a sensible approach to the use of the reserve.
Often in this House we have been able to put particular funds on reserve at first reading, but perhaps the conditions for release or the way in which this has been approached have not been sensible or coherent.
Here there are three examples that I would like to mention where I believe the conditions for release and the policy for reserve use have actually been helpful in strengthening Parliament's position in the budget process.
Firstly, I would cite the common foreign and security policy where we have a much clearer definition of what we gained in the interinstitutional agreement.
We would very much hope now that the Council will hold to this, as we have had a very clear exchange of letters and we should not then have the same misinterpretation in the 2008 budget.
Secondly, on the question of staff, here too Parliament has been able to provide a way of sensibly dealing with that process, rather than what might have been an immediate surge - as the Council wanted - of productivity gains but maybe not achieving very much.
We have been able to ask the Commission - and it has agreed - for a proper screening process to be established by 30 April 2007 so that we can have a substantive justification for staff increases over the next few years.
That will be very welcome as part of the conditions for release of the staff reserve will be a statement from the Commission in February next year.
So we will know exactly what the legislative programme for the Union will be in February 2007.
Last but not least in the use of the reserve is the question of value for money.
We had an excellent discussion and debate on 15 November at our last session with the Commissioner and the Secretary-General, who came to show exactly where we had taken lines in reserve and where we could now release them.
We have very few of those lines left available now.
That has been a very useful process in getting a much better perception as to where the lines are weak and where we have weak implementation.
We welcome the Commission's participation in that.
Looking ahead, it seems to me that we now have to implement this resolution on the proper implementation of the budget.
Perhaps the Council could come along and sign the resolution on value for money.
If it does not do it now, hopefully it will do so under the German Presidency.
We need to maintain our priorities.
We have been very clear.
We have taken on the priorities of the Financial Perspective.
As we now look further forward to the 2008 and 2009 budget years, there is a lot of work to be done.
We are not going to escape from the speed of globalisation.
That was the first point we made when we looked at the APS back in May.
We are going to have to adjust the programmes for financing, looking forward to seeing where our money can be best spent.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, this year budgetary requests were considered on their own merits, and the actual needs and priorities of the institutions were taken into consideration.
At the same time, all forms of expenditure were critically examined in order to cut down on waste and bad practices.
It was equally important, however, for me to ensure that the institutions were given the necessary tools and funds to function and operate efficiently.
One general observation I would like to make is that not enough efforts are being made by the institutions to present clearer, more accurate and more analytical estimates.
Were this to happen, the amounts that are put in reserve would be markedly lower, and there would be no need to provide unduly inflated margins, with the result that we end up cancelling appropriations at the end of the year and carrying out last-minute transfers.
Once again, I would like to emphasise the need for all the institutions to present more detailed and informative reports about their activities every year, stating whether their objectives have been achieved and how allocated funds have been utilised.
Another major point in this budgetary procedure was the policy related to the recruitment service, which must be improved.
Both Parliament and the Council have, in principle, approved every request for posts related to enlargement of the Union.
However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand or justify the delay in the process of staff selection related to the 2004 enlargement.
This shortcoming should be remedied, and the institutions, together with EPSO, should solve this pressing problem of the filling of vacant posts.
Hence, the decision taken by Parliament and the Council to monitor the recruitment process closely is a necessary one.
The 2007 budget framework concentrates also on another important point, namely cooperation beween the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.
