This is all linked to questions concerning the exclusion of dual candidacy, which one of the amendments seeks to do away with, and the automatic process leading to loss of rights to stand as a candidate.
The Commission is therefore in favour of a more detailed examination of these issues, if necessary by conducting a proper study, and the European Parliament will obviously be involved in this process.
These questions could also be discussed, if necessary, by the interinstitutional information group, which is currently exploring all possible ways in which the dissemination of information on the 2009 European elections can be made somewhat more effective.
Mr President, on a point of order, I see that the ALDE Group has requested a separate vote on every single amendment in the context of this report.
Under our Rules of Procedure, only a group can table an amendment.
I wanted to check whether this has really been done in the name of the group or whether it is just one of their members claiming to act on behalf of the group.
Mr Corbett, we have here the proof that it was the group who asked for that, so everything is OK.
I am sorry, but everything is OK!

Explanations of vote
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not support the proposal to establish a European Institute of Technology.
Of course I wish, like most of you, that the European Union would adapt and would produce more inventions and patents.
However, having listened to the debate on this proposal I do not believe that setting up another institution is a step in the right direction.
Our universities and research institutes will get no extra money; if anything, they will have another institution to compete with for research grants.
Nor has the vote of our venerable institution created a new body of super-scientists.
The Institute will be managed by scientists who will leave the universities where they are now.
I therefore believe that it would be better if we channelled the available funds, if can find them, into the existing top scientific teams through research grants.
(SK) If we actually want to overtake the US, Japan and other world leaders in science and technology and if we want Europe to set the tone, then the necessary preconditions must be created.
Centres of excellence must have all the conditions and preconditions in place.
The European Institute of Technology is a step in the right direction.
It is a shame that this decision has been delayed for so long.
I believe that the problems surrounding sufficient funding for the EIT will be resolved satisfactorily.
I also support the idea of cofinancing according to the Public Private Partnership principle, as is the case, for example, at research centres in the United States.
I would like scientists and researchers from the new countries also to be selected for, and involved in, the scientific teams, and the governing board to be subject to monitoring by the European Parliament.
The research objectives should mirror the Seventh Framework Programme for science and research and only research on embryonic stem cells should not be funded by the taxpayers of those countries where such research is illegal.
(CS) Mr President, allow me a remark concerning the vote on the establishment of the European Institute of Technology.
I voted for the proposal since this is the first time that we have had a system linking research, education and the business sector.
This is a fundamental project in the area of European innovation and like other similar projects it is accompanied by problems, in this case financial problems in particular.
That said, the proposal to establish the Institute and to give it enough space to justify its future existence deserves our support.
(FI) Mr President, I wish to say a few words regarding the European Institute of Technology.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Paasilinna.
He has done some excellent work.
I know that he is an expert in education and research and other such areas.
This a very ambitious project, but I would nevertheless like to point out that if we in the European Union establish new institutions it might be very important that, before we do so, we ensure that existing institutions can obtain adequate funding.
Consequently, we should also ensure that the network of universities which now exists can obtain adequate support and thereby produce new research.
In the vote I voted in accordance with Mr Paasilinna's recommendation, but I would ask Parliament to consider that existing research communities should be able to obtain their funding and that this new institute should not eat up the money set aside for them.
I ask that this should be recorded and taken into account when the decisions are being taken.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Paasilinna report on the European Institute of Technology because I consider that this will make a decisive contribution to increasing the competitiveness of the European economy, by reinforcing synergies between innovation, research and education.
I therefore support the proposals made by the rapporteur which aim to clearly define the sources of funding of the future European Institute of Technology so that this can start work as soon as possible and successfully fulfil its mission, contrary to the objectives set out by the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - (PT) Our position on the creation of the European Institute of Technology is highly critical as a result of the position taken by various research organisations.
For example, last year the League of European Research Universities presented a study which concluded that the plan for the European Institute of Technology was 'misconceived and doomed to failure'.
Euroscience, a European organisation of scientists and political experts, called it 'a politically motivated idea, starting from a wrong premise'.
The United Kingdom's science adviser, Robert May, said that 'it is based on a misunderstanding' about innovation.
This Institute will be virtual, composed of scientists based at EU universities, research laboratories and companies, and will not grant qualifications, contrary to what was originally proposed.
Following pressure from various countries that wanted to host the Institute, this became virtual, a type of gateway for consulting scientific communities in different areas.
The European Parliament has just adopted several amendments to the Commission proposal, but in our opinion these are insufficient to straighten something which was born crooked.
As for the funding, one of the options is the Community budget, including appropriations intended for research, which may end up being just another way of supporting the developed countries and thus worsening the inequalities.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the concept of a European Institute of Technology has changed in the course of the lively debate on how to promote innovation within the European Union.
Initially, the Institute was to be a European equivalent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, within the framework of the Lisbon Agenda.
In other words, it was to be part of our strategy to compete with the United States.
In the current fast-changing global environment, we are thinking instead in terms of a network of Knowledge and Innovation Centres, the so-called KICs, coordinated by a central body.
This was reflected in the separation of two budget lines in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament to the draft budget for 2008 (separate financing for the network and for the coordinating body).
We seem to be closer to finding a solution to financing this enterprise since the European Commission proposed reviewing the 2007-2013 financial perspective, in particular, raising the limit for Heading 1A, whilst reducing it for other headings.
This confirms, once again, that Parliament was not mistaken when it highlighted the unduly low level of budgetary resources allocated to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
I also wish to support WrocÅaw in its bid to host the headquarters of the European Institute of Technology.
I must point out, however, that better financing of R&D and the creation of a new institution is not enough to ensure that Europe becomes competitive and innovative.
That will be determined by the development of a business culture, a willingness to take risks and by practical links between research and development circles and private entrepreneurship.
in writing. - (DE) In my view, the decision to retain the idea of an EIT is a mistake.
None of the arguments presented is convincing as they start from false premises.
1.
Even the original idea put forward by Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to launch the EIT as a European response to America's MIT ignored reality, and the proposal presented for the vote today further worsens the original concept.
MIT evolved with a great deal of money and diverse support, and in Europe numerous 'mini-MITs' are already carrying out world-class research.
Europe's dilemma is the inadequate financial and moral support for innovation and top-class research.
2.
The proposed EUR 309 million in funding from a reserve budgetary source blocks other parliamentary initiatives such as the strategically important Galileo project.
The funding proposal amounts to just an eighth of the estimated budget and therefore does not offer any incentive for serious additional private initiatives.
BP has invested USD 500 million in the biofuels sector in Berkeley in the United States alone.
3) With its own generous sources of funding and grants to the top-class European institutes already in existence, the EIT would have a prospect of success.
For example, the EU could follow the Canadian model and set up an innovation fund financed from monies left in the EU budget at the end of the year.
4.
The planned network infrastructure is a virtual supranational institution without any real significance in the European and international research landscape.
It is an unhappy and bureaucratic compromise.
I have therefore voted against the proposal.
in writing. - I welcome in principle the idea of a European Institute of Technology.
However, I abstained on the resolution because I do not think we have yet sorted out the objectives, management and finances of the Institute to a satisfactory level.
in writing. - (FR) On Tuesday, 25 September I supported my colleague Reino Paasilinna by voting for the establishment of the European Institute of Technology (EIT).
This report reflects a real desire to converge towards a knowledge society.
Arranging for tools to be put in place, within the European Union, to promote the integration of innovation, research and education will eventually help stimulate competitiveness within the European economy.
The activities of the EIT will be steered by a Governing Board of scientific and administrative personnel.
This Board will designate the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) that are responsible for implementing the strategic priorities of the EIT.
At the same time, however, it is a matter of regret that the financial resources being earmarked for this project are somewhat lacking.
This could in the long term prove to be the undoing of this promising initiative.
We all need to be aware of the absolute necessity of providing the European Union with Community projects that will ensure its development within the context of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - (PT) The European Union is now at a real crossroads in terms of its competitive capacity with regard to the rest of the world.
Despite enjoying many attraction factors, whether historic and cultural or economic and tourist-related, we cannot escape the major challenges of global competition with the new emerging Asian economies.
Our capacity to be an attractive environment for knowledge and innovation is under question.
I believe that the vote on the European Institute of Technology marked an important step in the construction of a framework of European actions to help our economy grow and develop, based on the triangle of innovation, research and education.
I believe that it should not be low wages or cheap labour that make the EU attractive to investment and the growth of our companies.
The future is companies which understand that they need to invest in making the population highly skilled, by helping society to interact with industry and companies in order to develop high-quality and highly innovative responses to the dynamic and demanding needs of the markets.
in writing. - (FR) When the European Commission proposed establishing a European Institute of Technology (EIT) the idea was to create a new centre of excellence for higher education, research and innovation.
This ambition is now being thwarted by the difficult question of funding and no satisfactory or permanent answer has yet been found to this problem.
This is extremely worrying because it diminishes the credibility of the EIT even before it has been established.
The idea of the EIT issuing an EIT mark could help solve the problem of visibility from which European research has been suffering, while at the same time providing real recognition for projects whose excellence and quality has merited such a label.
It appears to me that such a flexible system, which lends itself well to the diversity that exists within Europe, would stimulate healthy competition between universities and between research projects.
Another imperative, I believe, is to involve the private sector in the EIT project.
The role played by public authorities should be restricted to promoting and structuring the various instruments that are required.
All the rest should come from the private sector, namely the funding, organisation and management of the EIT.
Above all I do not want to see the EIT become just another in a long list of EU agencies.
In spite of these reservations, however, I support the report in order that the EIT may have a chance to succeed.
in writing. - The EPLP have chosen to abstain on both the Amended Proposal and Legislative Resolution for the Report: European Institute of Technology.
While in favour of the general objectives of the proposal and its focus on innovation, EU and Member States money would be better spent on existing Universities and EU research framework programmes.
We believe that the EIT administrative structure should be as least bureaucratic as possible, and therefore smaller than the proposed 21 appointed members.
There are also still serious concerns regarding the private and public financing of the EIT.
Given that the Commission's proposal to finance the EIT suggests the reopening of the financial perspectives, we cannot support the report.
- (NL) Mr President, I would like to take a moment to explain why I voted against the Duff report, although the Duff report is not really a controversial report as such.
It is because I am opposed to the European federal philosophy that underpins the report.
In short, I am opposed to a European federal state and so I am also automatically opposed to EU citizenship, and this right to vote and right to stand as a candidate for election for EU citizens in Member States other than their own is an integral part of that.
I believe that the Union must remain a community of national democracies, where the right to vote and the right to stand for election, whatever type of election, must continue to be reserved for the citizens of the states concerned.
It is actually a mark of the evolution of the European Union that EU citizenship is systematically confirmed and expanded, including now making the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union binding.
(PL) Mr President, we have today voted on and adopted Mr Duff's report on the exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals.
I cannot support this report, because contrary to the intentions of the rapporteurs in my view, this method of voting and standing in elections to the European Parliament will not promote good neighbourly relations between countries, especially if they share a border.
Over many years, countries with significant national minorities have developed standards for avoiding conflicts of a nationalistic nature.
The voting method adopted may re-ignite such conflicts, which will run counter to the spirit of peaceful coexistence between the nations of Europe.
This is because it will be possible for individuals to stand for election and vote when they are not nationals of a particular state.
There are bound to be abuses of the system, for example by providing a fictional domicile simply in order to reduce the voice of a particular country, and to engineer an impact on the outcome of the elections.
Checking the relevant information is difficult and expensive.
In addition, this voting method will strengthen separatist movements, which is surely not what we wish for contemporary Europe.
I regret that for somewhat unclear reasons, we are imposing our will on the Member States from above in this regard, thus interfering in national electoral procedures.
Mr President, of all the claims made by supporters of the European Constitution, perhaps the silliest is that EU citizenship does not prejudice national citizenship.
One by one, the entitlements once bestowed by nationality have been eroded: the right of residence; the right to elect your own representatives; increasingly, too, the right to claim welfare.
Any neutral observer would conclude that EU citizenship is becoming the primary legal status of our constituents, with their national citizenships a secondary, almost folkloric category.
I accept that this is where the majority in this House wants to go but, for heaven's sake, be honest about it!
Let us hear no more nonsense about the status of my constituents as British subjects being unaffected.
in writing. - (ES) I feel that adopting this report is a serious mistake and extremely irresponsible, and so I am voting against it.
Above all, we must remember that there is no European election system.
Things would be different if this were to be established at some point (and I would support it).
Meanwhile, European elections must be in line with the election systems in each Member State.
The Duff report proposes the scrapping of dual or multiple candidacies in European Parliament elections.
The same candidate could stand in a number of states, and after the elections could choose which of the seats he or she wants to retain.
In addition to the obviously complicated arrangements this would involve, it is evident this is defrauding the electorate, and is adding nothing to the respectability of the Parliament we wish to construct.
Moreover, the proposal put to the vote today eliminates compulsory recognition of legal decisions (both civil and criminal) in relation to the capacity to stand as a candidate, making it possible for someone who has been banned from standing by a court in the state of which he or she is a national to stand in another state.
This is a contradiction of European justice and home affairs practices, and we can easily imagine the shameful situations it could create.
in writing. - (RO) Due to the heavy system of information exchange between Member States, in practice, very few citizens know how to use the right they hold under the Treaty to vote in the elections for the European Parliament if they are residents of another European country.
The voice of these people needs to be heard and their access to the political life of their country of residents needs to be facilitated; this is why I support the replacement of the current system with the requirement of filling in a sworn statement.
For the residents who wish to candidate in the European elections, the obligation to obtain a national attestation is disproportionate to the general objective of the EC Directive 93/109.
In practice, obtaining such an attestation from the institutions of the country of citizenship is very difficult and time consuming.
This formal obligation actually results in the cancellation of the right granted by the Treaty.
A future proposal of the European Commission should also deal with the issue of the establishment of political parties of non-national citizens.
Electoral laws of Member States must not discriminate between national parties made up of nationals of the given country and other parties.
Political representation in the European elections is a very important matter for countries with a large segment of population residing in another Member State of the European Union, such as Romania.
If the people of Europe do not vote in large numbers in their country of residence and if the level of participation in the European elections fails to match the aspirations of the Eurocrats it will not be because the application of voting rights and eligibility for the European elections has been overcomplicated by the need to exchange information between the Member States.
It will simply be because your bureaucracy and policies appear to them at best pointless and incomprehensible and at worst harmful, and because many European citizens not residing in their country of origin prefer to participate in the parliamentary elections being held in their own country.
As for the report, it uses this technical pseudo-simplification in an attempt to authorise multiple candidacies, in other words the appearance of the same candidate in several countries, something that would give an inordinate advantage under common law to foreign residents only, and it tries to bypass the laws of the Members States where ineligibility is concerned.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
We believe that citizenship is indissolubly linked to nationality and the rights, particularly electoral, that it generates can only be exercised within a national setting.
If European citizens want to participate in the democratic life of their host country then the option is always there: naturalisation.
in writing. - I welcome this report, which should reduce the burden on electoral authorities and individuals as regards the right to vote in the European elections.
I support scrapping the current information exchange system while keeping the individual declaration not to vote or stand twice.
(DE) Mr President, the ending of set-aside is absolutely the right course of action for us to pursue.
The demand for food and feedingstuffs as well as for renewable raw materials is constantly growing, and it is therefore absolutely essential to have these areas in production.
Set-aside was a measure which farmers never wanted but which they had to go along with because it was necessary.
Farmers want to produce!
I hope that the abolition of set-aside will not only apply for one or two years but on a permanent basis.
It also gives the agricultural sector the opportunity to make its contribution to the EU's ambitious targets for the reduction of its CO2 emissions.
in writing. - (PT) We not only agree that the cultivation of set-aside should be permitted for agricultural purposes for 2008, we in fact consider that the derogation should apply for longer.
We therefore tabled a proposal for 2009 and 2010 and it has been agreed to include 2009.
As a result farmers will be able to plan better in relation to the situation of exceptionally high prices in the cereals market.
However, this measure does not resolve the fundamental issue of the need to increase the production and supply of each Member State and employment in rural areas.
We must also draw attention to the shortage of cereals on the European market and to the negative effects of gambling on biofuels, as was decided by the Council, in terms of both the offer and price.
Once again we repeat the need for an in-depth review of the CAP (common agricultural policy) to take account of the soil and biodiversity characteristics in each country, to adapt the rotation of crops and to guarantee farmers sufficient income without threatening consumers' interests in terms of healthy and high-quality food.
in writing. - (FR) Would you have believed that after years of accusing the common agricultural policy of all kinds of wrong-doing, of costing too much and especially of producing milk lakes and grain mountains that could not be sold on the market, we would now be discovering that we have to stop cutting back our production capacity in these areas?
I am pleased to see the Commissioner's immediate response following the surging prices, which have certainly been lucrative for our farmers: put an end to set-aside to encourage our farmers and growers to produce more grain in order to take the pressure off the market.
She should also react just as quickly to increase milk quotas and abolish the surcharges for exceeding quotas at national level.
Moreover, I hope that this will serve as a lesson to the Commission, which has also been trying to reduce wine production capacity by 200 000 hectares without any regard for the opportunities that European wine producers would have for exporting to emerging markets such as China and India.
in writing. - Given the changing market conditions I understand and support the Commission's proposal for a zero set-aside for agriculture in 2008.
Ending set-aside is expected to increase output by at least 10 million tonnes of cereals. This should take pressure off the rising grain prices.
in writing. - (FR) The Commission in Brussels has been telling us since 1992 that there were grain mountains, to say nothing of the oceans of milk and other larders full to bursting.
The agricultural land of Europe therefore had to be put on set-aside and production had to be scaled back.
The southern hemisphere and the US were calling on the WTO for a monopoly on wheat and oilseed.
Remember that as part of the Uruguay Round, and with the Blair House Accord of 1992, the European Commission agreed to limit our oilseed growing areas to 5 million hectares.
What was supposed to happen happened.
Agriculture is subject to the vagaries of climate.
In the Bible Joseph explained as much to Pharaoh. Drought in Australia, falling production in Ukraine and no end to the growing demand in China, India and Africa: all of these factors are driving up the price of grain and maize.
After having paid our farmers not to produce from 1993 on, even after having removed aid to production and after having put millions of hectares on set-aside when one third of humanity is going hungry, the Commission in Brussels now discovers that there is a shortage of grain and that stocks have collapsed.
They are thus going back on their decision on set-aside.
It will be the same for wine.
It has already happened for butter and meat.
Confusion and Malthusianism are running the show.
in writing. - One of the great mysteries to the population of the European Union is how we can devise a system that pays farmers for leaving land idle.
Now whilst I understand that some reputable organisations like the RSPB in the UK use this system to fund their excellent work, nevertheless it cannot be right that we leave good land idle and pay farmers for keeping it that way.
That is why I support a zero per cent set-aside, but we must also in tandem ensure that our farmers and others are encouraged to keep land in good order and by making the land productive by helping them from other sources.
If we are serious about fundamental CAP reform then an end to set-aside payments has to be at the forefront of any reform procedure.
That is why I will support the Commission's proposals.
Mr President, I would like Members to take some note of how I voted.
The bottom line is that we must and will protect children.
We should be uncompromising on chemicals and pollutants that can in any way affect their functioning and development.
Companies must be held to account.
But we cannot stop there.
We have to take a serious look at the kind of pressures companies are under.
Companies functioning in China face these pressures from the Chinese Government.
The rules of the game in China are far different from the rest of the world.
If a company is to operate there, it must surrender most of its decision-making and operations procedures to the Government.
China puts incentives into place which control the vertical operations of manufacturing.
The tools used by Mattel to produce those 21 million toys are Chinese made and owned.
The moulds used to form the plastic and put in the machinery to push out all those toys are owned by China.
The reason for this is that the Chinese subsidise companies' parts if they remain in China, and to break with this system increases their costs by 20%.
So we see that China controls businesses far more than perhaps we realise, and we need to take a lesson from this in toy safety.
We must not tolerate this, just as we must not tolerate any of the human rights and environment practices of China any longer.
in writing. - I have repeatedly called on the European Commission to press forward with legislation which would require all imported products to have a country of origin label.
This is extremely important as it has been found that in 2006, 17% of all detected unsafe products, including toys, were of unidentified origin, while 58% are of third country origin.
While 48% of detected unsafe products had their origin in China it should not be assumed that the fault lies solely with quality control deficiencies of Chinese manufacturers.
It has been shown for instance that of the 21 million toys recalled over the past 3 months, by the US Mattel Company (which also markets its products in Europe under the Fisher-Price brand), 18 million were because of Mattel design faults, and not defective manufacture.
It has been clear for some time that tougher penalties are needed for both manufacturers and importers, to ensure that they take their responsibilities to consumers seriously; in this case to defenceless children.
But some Member States continue to resist change at the behest of importers and companies which outsource manufacturing.
Globalisation of trade and the lack of transparency and information on the origins of the various products being marketed across the European Union means an increased risk of acquiring dangerous, defective or counterfeit goods.
The joint resolution on product safety, especially that of toys, which I voted for on Wednesday, has been adopted by almost all the groups.
It is another example of the commitment being shown by the European Union, and especially by the European Parliament, towards consumer protection.
By calling for requirements to be imposed in respect of product safety, the integrity of the CE mark, the exclusion of counterfeit goods and the introduction of traceability this resolution will provide more effective protection for consumers, especially children.
However, the call for better cooperation with the third countries concerned must not be allowed to overshadow the responsibility that falls on those companies that are placing the orders, for it is up to them to ensure that their product specifications comply with these health and safety requirements.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on 'Dangerous toys made in China' because I consider it essential to take all necessary legislative and administrative action to ensure that consumer goods that are marketed within the EU not only comply fully with existing EU standards but also do not put the health and safety of consumers at risk.
I therefore feel that Directive 88/378/EC on the safety of toys should be revised as quickly as possible and that it should include efficient and effective requirements for product safety.
in writing. - (PT) Ensuring product safety, particularly the safety of toys, is a priority in the protection of public health and children's health in particular.
The necessary checking and quality control of products is an essential mechanism in achieving this objective.
Companies and competent national public authorities should carry out this control and certification as a preventative measure.
As legislation defines all the safety rules with which products must naturally comply, it is up to the company or companies designing, producing and marketing these products to assume their responsibilities.
The initial reaction to unsafe products or products harmful to health, particularly toys, being imported from third countries is to try and shift the blame onto others, to the point that the Financial Times noticed that the Mattel company had formally apologised to the Chinese Government and people.
It should be stressed that many imported products are made in third countries but their owners are large EU-based multinationals, which, greedy for profits, transfer their production elsewhere.
Furthermore, focusing the discussion of poor quality on imported products only obscures the fact that many products made in the EU also do not comply with the standards in force.
in writing. - The resolution of the Parliament, approved today by a large majority, rightly concentrates on the immediate issues of ensuring the safety of products under existing EU directives.
The EPP-ED group has insisted throughout that the resolution should concentrate on practical proposals that would reinforce consumer safety, without delay.
We have, in addition, proposed the evaluation of a European Consumer Safety label, to be applied on a voluntary basis by providers of consumer goods.
We are pleased that the Parliament has endorsed this proposal.
We will take an intense interest in the future Toys Directive, and will examine the Commission's proposed reforms with an open mind.
In our view, the attempt to introduce very detailed and specific requirements for this future Directive in this resolution was entirely unnecessary.
We have therefore voted against these proposed additions, but this in no way diminishes our interest and concern to bring about an effective and workable directive when we receive the Commission proposal in 2008.
Parliament's resolution only contains a few proposals for putting an end to the import of dangerous products, half of which come from China.
It focuses on toys, yet fails to mention clothing containing toxic dyes, dangerous medicines, foodstuffs containing ingredients unfit for human consumption, electrical goods that catch fire, toothpaste made from antifreeze: the list just goes on.
It also makes do with feeble measures that are based on cooperation and certification and points the finger of responsibility at the Member States rather than at China, at European companies rather than at others.
This is just not enough in this particular instance.
It is time to apply exemplary sanctions against any country that, after becoming a member of the WTO, continues to engage in dubious commercial practices, whether this be dumping, counterfeiting or forced labour.
It is true that the few trade protection instruments available to the European Union fall within the competence of Mr Mandelson, who has quite rightly been cited for his passivity in this area.
If at the end of the day we are then to approve this document it is because, in spite of everything, it is better to have some derisory measures in place than none at all.
At least that is some form of reaction.
in writing. - I welcome the overwhelming vote in favour of this resolution.
We have sent a clear message to toy manufacturers and to China that failure to ensure the highest safety standards for children's toys will not be tolerated.
China is on notice that it must improve its inspection of goods and detection methods to dramatically reduce the flow of unsafe goods on to the European market.
in writing. - (FR) Children in Vietnam, Africa and elsewhere are standing on land mines.
In Europe our own children are being suffocated and poisoned and are developing allergies because of Barbie dolls and toys.
The cinema has already sounded the alarm bells with the film 'Le pÃšre noÃ«l est une ordure'.
It is now up to us, the Members of this Parliament, to react and to do so on safety principles as well as to protect the demographic future of our continent, which has already been afflicted by the games played by adults at large.
It is time to do this now.
Even yesterday was not soon enough, for how many faces with skin as smooth as a Brancusi sculpture have been ravaged by celluloid dolls that burst into flames at the slightest hint of a match.
Toys kill and the children of Darfur do not know how lucky they are in not being able to play at eating.
in writing. - (FR) Following the large-scale safety recall of Chinese-made toys by the US manufacturer Mattel the European Commission is now taking stock of its product safety legislation, especially where imported toys are concerned.
The European system of regulation in this area is solid enough, with RAPEX and the CE mark, but it needs to be strengthened.
The European Parliament is therefore going much further and, as part of its resolution on the safety of toys, wants to see adopted a common regulatory framework for the marketing of products and the surveillance of the markets.
For me restoring consumer confidence and protecting the health of our children is an essential condition.
In continuation of the REACH regulations, which impose strict controls on the use of chemicals in our consumer goods, I have therefore voted today for an unconditional ban on the use of any toxic substances in the manufacture of toys.
Moreover, in support of Amendments 8 and 6, I am in favour of a total ban on the use of dangerous phthalates in any toys that can be put in the mouth.
The chemical safety of toys is not just a regulatory matter; it is also a hygiene issue and as such is vital for the safety of our children.
in writing. - (DE) Today's resolution underlines the urgent need for the revision of the Toys Directive.
CMRs - in other words, substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction - must be banned under the new Toys Directive.
Commissioner Verheugen endorsed this demand during yesterday's debate.
It will also be necessary to end the confusion over the CE marking.
European consumers assume this marking either to be a statement about product origin or a seal of quality, neither of which is denoted by the CE marking.
(SK) Energy security and energy form the axis around which both the domestic and foreign policy of every union revolve and are a vital factor in maintaining prosperity and, where in critically short supply, a matter of survival.
We need to take immediate steps to free ourselves of our raw material dependence on Russia, which may subsequently become a political dependence.
I find it alarming that we are allowing energy to be used as a means of exerting political pressure on countries of transit and destination.
I support the development of the Black Sea dimension, cooperation with the countries of the Southern Caucasus, and stepping up our involvement with Norway, the Maghreb and Mashreq countries, and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Energy market predictability must be ensured through agreements with China, India and Brazil and a partnership should be established with the US Government.
Black-and-white-thinking environmentalists should realise once and for all that burning 'eco' fuels and biomass massively increases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and that a reasonable, decisive proportion of nuclear energy is necessary.
The influence of the fanatical Greens, who have even managed to get a ban on nuclear energy included in the constitution of a Member State - something which will not certainly affect its economy and even that of its neighbours - is of tragicomic proportions.
(FI) Mr President, energy security is one of the crucial factors in European security generally.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report responds to this challenge to Europe's future.
The EU's problem is that its level of self-sufficiency in energy is on the decline.
The EU already imports half its energy needs from outside and by 2025 dependence on imports is estimated to exceed 70%.
To deal with this problem we need a firm common voice, a new kind of energy diplomacy and, to engage in it, a special EU High Representative for external energy policy.
Making external energy policy more the mandate of the Union, however, cannot mean weakening the sovereignty of the Member States to decide their energy production means and structure.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for this especially.
The report allows for independent decision-making by the Member States on their energy supply structures.
in writing. - Transparency, reciprocity and the rule of law are cornerstones of European energy policy and consequently in our foreign policy.
It is however not the right time to add new institutions and I am therefore against the creation of the new position of a High Official of Foreign Energy Policy which also threatens the influence of the European Parliament when it comes to foreign energy policy.
in writing. - (FR) I have voted in favour of this report, which is aimed at putting in place a common foreign policy on energy.
The solutions applied need to be international in scope and the European Union must play a leading role in this.
It is clear that energy has become a real weapon in today's international negotiations.
Ever since the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine in January 2006 the European Union has been aware of its vulnerability where energy supplies are concerned.
In order to develop a foreign policy on energy the report essentially proposes to appoint a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, who would be responsible for coordinating the EU's activities in this area.
This High Official for Foreign Energy Policy would wear two hats, as the person in question would be acting under the authority of both the newly created High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Vice-President of the European Commission.
I welcome this positive development, which in particular will help to promote the dialogue between the producer countries - witness the Euro-Mediterranean partnership - and the consumers.
This will enable the EU to defend its interests in the area of energy security when negotiating with external suppliers.
in writing. - (PT) Energy is currently a central strategic issue.
The various EU countries, due to their high energy dependence, aspire to dominate the exploitation of existing energy resources, hence the proposal to create an energy strand within the common foreign and security policy.
If adopted, this would also form a way of overcoming the contradictions existing between the main powers.
To do this, the EU should announce its 'market', its 'competition' and its enlargement to other countries in the framework of the so-called 'energy communities', the 'Energy Charter Treaty' - ensuring 'security of investment' and guaranteeing a 'right to compensation in the event of expropriation and/or nationalisation' - or the inclusion of an 'energy security clause' in commercial agreements.
All of this can be controlled, hence its fear of the creation of a 'gas version of OPEC'.
The majority of Parliament also defends 'establishing an Energy Security Partnership with the US' and, of course, a 'critical and constructive dialogue' with the countries in the South Caucasus, Caspian and Central Asia regions 'which balances the EU's interest in diversifying its oil and gas supplies and the goal of achieving political reforms in those countries'.
More words for whom?
Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa ...?
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union is a major consumer of energy and is dependent on external sources of power.
The latter are characterised by uncertainty and potential destabilisation.
In the specific case of Russia and those countries of the CIS that are rich in natural resources, an additional factor contributing to the uncertainty is a tendency to use energy as a weapon for political purposes, as we have already witnessed.
This should have mobilised the European Union to close ranks and stand shoulder to shoulder in crisis situations.
Such a response has been very slow to develop, however, because of the diverse national interests of countries that are not as likely to be the victims of energy blackmail as the post-Communist countries.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report is a step in the right direction.
It represents a call to base the EU-Russian relationship on the foundation of mutual trust and respect for the principles laid down in the Energy Charter.
The context of the current debate is defined by the parallel efforts of the European Commission to liberalise the Union's energy market, with Gazprom in the background.
This leads to stronger pressure for implementation of the principle of separating production and distribution.
The countries that are reluctant to liberalise are the same ones that are inclined to resort to bilateral energy contracts with Russia and to cooperate with Russian State-owned companies regarding capital.
It is no coincidence that this involves the remnants of the public energy monopolies in continental Europe.
The effect is to delay the desired free choice of energy suppliers and the development of a Community policy based on solidarity for this strategic sector.
in writing. - Clearly the European Union needs to co-ordinate its approach to external sources of energy much better than at present.
However, I can see no value in the proposal for a High Official for foreign energy policy believing it would only cause confusion with the role played at present by Mr Solana, and I therefore voted against this proposal.
I did on the other hand vote in favour of the reference to unbundling energy production and energy transmission and distribution.
in writing. - The report advocates a 'common European foreign policy on energy'.
Although so far there is not even a legal base for such a policy, it aims to push ahead with it even before it can be inserted in the new reform Treaty.
Instead of solving the problem of expensive and polluting energy, the report wants to shape the EU as a hegemonic, global actor.
Such an expansive geopolitical approach of the EU would create more tension and conflicts worldwide.
A strong anti-Russian current is seen as a red thread in the text.
Almost every idea which could hinder the normal development of relations between Russia and EU Member States has been included.
Critics therefore speak of a touch of cold war.
By the inclusion of a so-called 'energy security clause' in all agreements with producer and transit countries the EU will define its interest far beyond its borders.
We are concerned about the foundation of an EU energy foreign policy that would be founded on geopolitical pressure, a background of military threat.
The report calls for a close partnership with the USA on energy security, being aware that the USA is waging war in Iraq to secure cheap energy resources.
in writing. - (PT) Given the growing importance of energy in modern society, on the one hand, and the growing international interdependence which is also now a common characteristic, on the other, it is impossible to exclude energy policy from the external dimension of the EU's policy, either at Member State level or in terms of the common foreign policy.
I therefore agree with the resolution where it states that 'whilst the Member States should retain their sovereign right to make strategic choices concerning the energy mix, to exploit their energy resources and to decide on the supply structures, there is a need to [promote a common approach and not necessarily a single policy] covering security of supply, transit and investment related to energy security, and the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings as well as clean and renewable energy sources, particularly in relations with countries whose energy consumption is growing rapidly'.
However, as for the idea of a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, this dimension must be included within the work of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as I do not believe that a more specific approach than this makes any sense.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the adoption of Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report on a common European foreign policy on energy.
Pursuant to the action plan on energy policy adopted by the Council in March 2007, we must make every effort to develop a common European foreign policy on energy for the European Union, equipped with the instruments required to ensure its effective operation.
I would like to draw attention to the need for solidarity and cooperation between Member States, the diversification of energy sources and ongoing development and better cooperation in this area.
I agree it is necessary to decide on a detailed road map, laying down the various stage of the introduction of such a policy.
The Commission should present its proposals in this regard at the earliest opportunity.
It is also important for the Member States to consult amongst themselves and with the European Commission on issues concerning strategic decisions on contracts with third parties in this area.
The proposal to appoint a High Official on Foreign Energy Policy is very appropriate and deserves further consideration.
This person would be responsible for coordinating all policies related to all external aspects of energy security.
Such a post should help to enhance the protection of the interests of EU Member States during negotiations with foreign partners.
in writing. - British Conservatives recognise the need for the 27 Member States to show more solidarity in terms of external energy policy as all Member States in the coming years become increasingly dependant on imported oil and gas from third countries who could otherwise pick off the more dependant and vulnerable states to the detriment of the Union as a whole.
This does not mean that we endorse a common energy policy, in particular, that the EU for instance can determine individual Member States' energy mix such as the proportion of fossil fuels versus renewables.
Broadly, Conservatives support the aims of this report although we reject the need for a single powerful co-ordinating figure to speak on this matter.
Neither do we see the need for a new legal basis to be created within the Treaties to address this issue.
Attempts to add new EU competences instead of making proper use of existing ones are unnecessary.
Conservatives also believe in a market-oriented approach, not further EU institutionalisation.
in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports much of this resolution, in particular the priority given to supporting renewable sources of energy, promoting energy as one of the cornerstones of the European Neighbourhood Policy and calling for increased safeguards against pollution.
We abstained on citation 12 due to the abandonment of the Constitutional Treaty, which makes the proposed citation irrelevant.
We abstained on Amendment 2 and on paragraph 13 as we feel that the position of a new High Official for energy policy could lead to unnecessary confusion.
We voted in favour of paragraph 62 maintaining the reference to unbundling of energy production as we wish to be consistent with a previously stated position which considers transmission ownership unbundling to be the most effective tool to promote investments, fair access to the grid and transparency in the market.
(SK) I voted in favour of Mrs Gruber's report.
I welcome the drawing-up of a general framework directive and the directive on the entry conditions for highly skilled workers, the directive on the entry and residence conditions for seasonal workers, and the directive on the entry and residence conditions for remunerated trainees.
It is glaringly obvious that the European Union must lay down precise rules and actively regulate who will be admitted to work in the EU.
We all know that Europe is already experiencing a 'demographic winter' and urgently requires manpower from non-member countries.
However, it is absolutely vital that we admit only skilled labour and I propose that we select professions which are in short supply on the labour market in Europe.
We must be consistent in this regard; otherwise if we willingly and thoughtlessly inundate the European Union with unskilled labour we could see problems arising from the idle lifestyle of unemployed immigrants, who subsequently commit crime and engage in illegal trade and the grey economy outside the law and are often involved in drugs and people trafficking.
They create ghettos and often end up as members of terrorist groups.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report because it was made clear in Parliament that it will remain a matter for Member States to decide which and how many labour migrants will be accepted into their sovereign territory.
If the 'Blue Card' is introduced, it is important to ensure that it is applied as a control instrument for highly skilled workers residing in the EU, allowing temporary - not permanent - residence in the European Union as a whole.
I would like to address a proposal to Commissioner Frattini - who unfortunately is no longer present - from the European People's Party: that the 'Blue Card' be marked with an additional national symbol, such as the flag, so that it is apparent which of the Member States has issued the work and residence permit.
(EN) Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleagues Lilli Gruber and Javier Moreno.
As someone who is temporarily disabled, I have had to use an auxiliary contract for an immigrant and I have understood better, if that were possible, what Mr Lobo Antunes was saying today about the need for solidarity and humanity, although I also understand Mr Frattini's explanation concerning complete respect for the rule of law.
In my times of solitude I have often thought that Don Quixote, the famous character, the greatest literary figure of all time, would not have existed without Sancho, and today Sancho would undoubtedly be an emigrant coming to his aid.
Therefore, at all times there must be respect for the rule of law and respect for human beings.
- (NL) Mr President, I did not indeed approve the Gruber report on the policy plan for legal migration for two main reasons.
Firstly, I do not think it is wise to encourage a brain drain from the poorer countries into Europe to an even greater extent than is already happening now in any case.
I do not think that it is helpful to anyone, and certainly not the poorer countries.
Secondly, I continue to be amazed at the naivety with which immigration is looked upon in this Parliament, as a kind of solution to Europe's undeniable demographic problem.
In any case, not a word is said about the huge cost of immigration for the receiving countries, nor about the fact that, more than ever before, we are having to be vigilant to preserve our European culture, our values and standards, which are increasingly coming under pressure due to the massive number of immigrants from other cultures.
As well as all the other problems, this also has an economic cost.
Today, in our European capital, Brussels, about 53% of the inhabitants are of what you could call non-Belgian origin; by 2050 that threatens to be 75%.
We do not need new mass immigration, but the exact opposite.
- (NL) Mr President, in the Gruber report, Parliament is following the particularly one-sided quantitative economic approach to the immigration problem.
I emphatically reject the assertion that only a new wave of immigration can guarantee the economic future of Europe and I want to point out that immigration is about far more than just figures and tables.
The proposals in this report will only make the already serious integration problems worse.
You have to have read it to believe it.
While some of the immigrant population do not want to work and do not want to retrain, some people actually want to set up an information and management centre for migration in Mali.
It is undeniably the case that many so-called temporary workers will disappear into illegality when their permit expires, as happens now.
Experience, for example in Switzerland, clearly shows that family members of seasonal workers continue to come in illegally.
Last but not least, the fact is that more legal immigration of highly educated persons will undeniably lead to a further brain drain from the developing countries with all the consequences that brings.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Gruber report because it took on board so many issues raised by the PPE-DE Group and by myself.
However, although I realise that integration is important, I believe it must occur with the consent of our citizens.
Therefore, as well as integration there needs to be firm, decisive law enforcement.
For example, Member States must enforce the rule stipulating that if immigrants cannot demonstrate their ability to support their family they must be repatriated after three months.
This is not happening in some countries, and if it does not happen the dissatisfaction felt by citizens will render any European initiative on integration meaningless.
in writing. - (PT) Despite containing important points on migration issues which we have been defending for a long time, the report not only does not denounce the EU's current guidelines and policies - which are criminalising and repressive towards migrants - but in fact forms another aspect of these.
To be specific, the report adopts as its own the concept of the existence of different 'categories' of migrants - such as the 'most highly skilled', 'seasonal' and others - and their management according to the labour needs of the various EU countries, particularly through the creation of a Blue Card: what a dehumanising view of migration and migrants.
Furthermore, the report advocates creating a common migration policy which we consider to be inadequate and unrealistic, given both the results of other 'common' policies and the differing situations existing in the Member States.
We reiterate that migration policy is the responsibility of each country and its democratic institutions.
As we have said, a common policy is not necessary, but another policy is, in a framework of cooperation between the Member States, which will promote the rights of migrants, particularly through the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.
In considering that 'the future situations of the European Union labour markets can be broadly described as in demand of [...] legal immigration', Mrs Gruber, like Mr Sarkozy in France, is seeking to give economic justification to the immigration policies being applied in our various Member States.
However, the labour force coming from those countries that have been slow to develop is for the most part ill-equipped for the jobs that our economies need doing.
Moreover, it has to be remembered that legal immigration is essentially the immigration not of workers but of people.
This policy that is bringing us nearly two million additional immigrants every year is in fact turning into a colonisation of Europe.
Between now and 2050 the non-European population, which already stands at some 40 million people, will have tripled.
With the accession of Turkey the Europe being constructed by Brussels will include 220 million Asians and Africans, most of whom will be from the Muslim world.
This colonisation of population constitutes a lethal threat to the Christian and humanist values of our civilisation.
If we are to protect the legitimate rights of the peoples of Europe to self-determination and to remain themselves, we have to restore our borders, reverse the flow of migrants and introduce major policies that are pro-family and pro-life.
We need a new Europe, a 'European' Europe, a Europe of sovereign nations, for that is the only thing that can guarantee our rights to defend our culture and history.
in writing. - (DE) The fact that around 18.5 million third-country nationals are living in the EU clearly demonstrates that Europe needs a common immigration policy.
We must assuage our citizens' concerns and fears about immigration and show them that regulated and sensible immigration is entirely necessary in some sectors in Europe.
However, I do not share the view, apparently put forward as an article of faith by the conservatives in particular, that the issue of demographic change must be linked to the issue of maintaining the European social model.
What is needed instead here is the launch of a debate about the extent to which the substantially increased wealth generation throughout the European economy, which must be considered separately from demographic change, should make a solidarity-based contribution to the European social model.
I have abstained from voting on Amendment 8, since while I do recognise that the problem of a brain drain from developing countries into Europe is a very serious one, I distrust the motivation of the ITS Group in tabling this amendment.
We must strive to prevent highly educated people from leaving their own countries in massive numbers, thereby causing economic damage, but it should certainly not be about opposing immigration into Europe by definition.
in writing. - I welcome this report, which is designed to make life easier for legal migrants.
Despite their status, legal migrants are often intentionally and unintentionally discriminated against.
The rapporteur calls for a range of measures for legal migrants including improved employment rights, transfer of pension and welfare rights, recognition of qualifications, long-term and multiple-entry visas, all of which I support.
in writing. - Our vote today reflects our wish to see an efficient, humane and rights-based approach to immigration in Europe.
Immigrants of all types must be treated equally and in accordance with the highest human rights standards and decency.
Furthermore, as a general principle, European Member States should accept immigrants on the basis of the need of the immigrants in addition to the needs of the economies of the countries of Europe.
Immigration policy across Europe must not add to the loss of vital skills, the 'brain drain', in developing countries, Member States and the EU Commission must not pursue policies which undermine development.
in writing. - We have voted in favour of Amendment 8.
In general our views are very far away from the group which tabled it, especially in the case of refugees, immigrants and ethnic or religious minorities.
ITS tries to block the admission of refugees who are in danger, and, on the contrary, we try to help those victims of suppression, catastrophes, and poverty.
So we understand very well that the majority in our group doesn't like to support ITS amendments on migration.
Unlike the situation of refugees and traditional forms of immigration, in the case of the proposed attraction of highly skilled workers the EU Member States are creating a problem for their countries of origin.
People who are skilled in countries like India, South Africa or Brazil are highly needed there for the necessary development.
We now see that such problems are even arising inside the newest EU Member States, Romania and Bulgaria, who are losing their medical and engineering people at a rapid rate to more wealthy countries.
Privileged countries and companies are stealing the brains of those people.
As we don't want to support this brain drain, we voted in favour of this amendment.
in writing. - (DE) The Gruber report views immigration, in some parts, solely in terms of the usefulness of the immigrating workers as capital.
For example, the report stresses 'the importance of establishing stable and lawful labour relations between businesses and workers to increase productivity and EU competitiveness' and 'calls, hence, upon the Commission to consider the effects circular migration could have in this regard'.
Whereas the repressive measures against migrants and asylum seekers encounter no opposition, 'any measure designed to increase the attractiveness of the EU to the most highly skilled workers, so as to meet the needs of the EU labour market in order to ensure Europe's prosperity as well as to respect the Lisbon targets' are to be supported.
While the 'risk of a brain drain' is to be averted, 'return' is envisaged for migrants who can only enter Fortress Europe illegally.
As regards the endorsement of the Policy Plan on Legal Migration, a key focus is on admission procedures 'capable of responding promptly to fluctuating demands in the labour market'.
Immigration cannot be regulated according to the criterion of its usefulness as EU capital.
Instead of immigration for the benefit of Europe's businesses, fundamental and human rights for migrants and asylum seekers must be the priority.
I reject any categorisation of people based on usefulness criteria.
in writing. - (PT) The debate on migration too often focuses on issues of illegal flows and therefore frequently forgets legal migration, which makes an important contribution to our economy and to our cultural enrichment.
In this context, we agree with two fundamental concepts: a clear and effective policy on legal migration is one of the keys to solving the issue of illegal immigration, and a generous welcome based on common principles promoting the integration and adaptation of those arriving is essential.
However, it is also necessary to recognise that migration flows, migrant communities and host countries have different traditions, customs and memories and that these differences cannot be ignored.
Another issue in this debate is qualified migration.
The idea of a Blue Card facilitating entry and movement could prove interesting, although it seems rather too complex.
In any event, the central issue must be the attraction factor, particularly at academic level.
It is therefore essential to make educational institutions aware of the need to attract students from other parts of the world.
I of course support this objective.
in writing. - (SV) The Swedish Green Party supports and wants a liberal immigration policy.
There are many good things in the report which pursue this aim.
However, I believe that a framework directive in this field will reduce the possibilities for people to migrate, not the other way round.
In addition, the proposal poses the risk of intensifying the brain drain which is afflicting the developing countries and is cynically exploited by the EU for its own development.
I am therefore abstaining in the final vote.
in writing. - It is a dangerous fallacy that demographic change in our domestic population requires large-scale immigration of people from different, often hostile, cultures and societies, with all the implications that this has for our national cohesion and identity, the full integration of our settled immigrant population, the impact on our public services, as well as on public health, safety and security.
I wholly oppose the transfer of powers or responsibility from national authorities to the EU in relation to our national border controls and immigration and asylum policy.
I therefore voted against this report.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because the European Parliament has agreed a comprehensive strategy here to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration.
As the European Parliament, we have thus sent out a clear message that 'illegal' means the same as 'not legal' and must be dealt with accordingly.
In my view, it is particularly important to have clarified that there will be no quota-based allocation of illegal immigrants across all Member States and that mass legalisations of the type witnessed in recent years will no longer be permissible.
This ensures that there is no 'pull effect' and also allows human trafficking to be tackled indirectly.
- (NL) Mr President, the report on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third country nationals that we have just approved is certainly not the worst report that has ever been passed here and it does, in fact, contain a number of very interesting recommendations, but I still think that the report fails to clearly tell the whole story and so I have not approved it myself.
The immigration problem in Europe threatens to be the problem of this coming century - it may already today be the problem of the coming century - and illegal immigration is an important part of that.
We might, therefore, have expected a much firmer standpoint to be taken, especially against the successive waves of regularisation in the various countries of Europe.
After all, these have the effect of sucking people in that will eventually roll out over the whole Union, over all Member States.
It is simple actually, and we should have had the courage to put it into words.
Illegal immigration cannot be tolerated.
Illegal immigrants must be tracked down and we must be resolute in sending them back to their countries of origin in a humane manner.
Those who dare not say that, and thus will certainly not dare to carry it out, will create enormous problems that will eventually cost our prosperity and our civilisation dear.
- (NL) Mr President, going through the Moreno SÃ¡nchez report automatically brings to mind the Dutch saying 'zachte heelmeesters maken stinkende wonden', which means that desperate times require drastic measures.
As my colleague Mr Vanhecke already said, although a few of the proposals in the report represent a step in the right direction, in general Parliament is still taking a half-hearted approach, which does not bode well for an efficient and firm European policy to combat illegal immigration.
Parliament has failed, for instance, to make clear that the regularisation measures being implemented in many European countries really are one of the most important, if not the most important, causes of illegal immigration, because of the 'pull effect' that they create in the immigrants' countries of origin.
Illegal immigrants should not be regularised, but they should be actively tracked down and deported in a resolute but humane manner.
Contrary to what Parliament insinuates, the explicit proclamation of this political message has nothing to do with so-called xenophobia.
In addition to a firm deportation policy, tight border controls, and agreements with states to take back their nationals, refugee centres in the region of origin should offer some relief, but this has also been rejected by Parliament.
For these reasons I voted against this report.
We Social Democrats want a humane immigration and refugee policy in the EU based on solidarity, which seeks to increase mobility across borders responsibly and which guarantees protection to all who need it.
However, we do not want a permanent EU-financed border control force.
The Member States are responsible for guarding their own borders.
Community deployments should be subject to need and based on inquiries.
We therefore chose to abstain in the vote on paragraph 37.
As regards paragraph 18 on a review of the basic principle of the Dublin II Regulation, we think that a discussion of the principle is justified but that it should be conducted in a wider context and as part of a discussion of the common immigration and refugee policy as a whole.
in writing. - (FR) I fully support this excellent report and would like to add three comments of my own on the subject.
Firstly, we have to rid ourselves of the illusion that an active policy on legal immigration will put a stop to the illegal flow of migrants into our countries.
An active policy on legal immigration will, by definition, be determined by our own needs, whereas illegal immigration will correspond to the needs of those - and there are currently tens of millions of such people, mainly in Africa - who want to move here to escape war, persecution, poverty or, quite simply, the lack of future prospects for themselves and their children.
Secondly, the control of the EU's external borders and the fight against networks of illegal immigrant smugglers will unfortunately remain a political priority for many years to come because in reality the trade in human misery is in the hands of criminal gangs.
The fight against illegal immigration is therefore not directed 'against' the illegal immigrants as such: it is part of the battle against organised crime, which is something we have to win together.
Thirdly and finally, we must at the same time maintain our relentless efforts to combat poverty and this can only be done through co-development in Africa.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of this report, which presents a balanced and realistic view of the issue of immigration and has achieved a broad consensus, as the rapporteur hoped.
The report has come just at the right time when you look at the latest events and see the Member States try, one by one, to adapt their legislation to cope as best they can with the influx of migrants.
In reality we all know that the scale of the migration phenomenon exceeds the capability of the countries concerned to control these events individually and that a global and coherent approach is therefore needed at European level, as the report rightly states.
The text sets out a number of priorities: combating the trafficking of human beings, respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms when applying measures to prevent illegal immigration, strengthening cooperation with third countries, taking the firm steps that are required to combat illegal employment and, finally, the need for a responsible return policy.
For these reasons I supported the adoption of the report during the final vote in plenary.
in writing. - (PT) Despite containing certain points with which we agree, this report also assumes the repressive security-oriented view of 'illegal immigration'.
Although less so with regard to certain aspects, the report advocates developing the main axes of the current EU guidelines and decisions on immigration, including: the so-called 'European return policy' or, in other words, repatriation; the activity of Frontex in terms of border patrol and control; the so-called 'temporary reception centres'; the development of biometric tools, or the so-called 'readmission agreements'.
The report also proposes setting up 'European patrols', a 'European monitoring system' at the sea borders and even a system for 'automated checks on persons entering or leaving Union territory'.
In other words, the report aims to reinforce the EU's security-oriented policy of criminalising 'illegal immigration' by turning it into a common European policy which is repressive, involves sinister information systems and includes measures and infrastructure for the detention and expulsion of immigrants.
We wholeheartedly reject this.
It was the application of a repressive policy like this which led to the authorities of a Member State prosecuting seven Tunisian fishermen for having saved 44 people at sea, despite this action complying with international maritime law.
in writing. - (FR) The official figures are evidence of it: Europe is being inundated with illegal immigrants.
It has proved to be completely incapable of controlling its external borders.
The annual report presenting the activities of Eurodac in 2006, which is the biometric tool that Europe uses for monitoring asylum applications, shows that the number of persons recorded as having illegally crossed one of Europe's external borders is up 64% on 2005.
The report presented by Mr Moreno puts forward a number of approaches that are supposed to put an end to this phenomenon, which is growing exponentially.
I think they are all as useless as each other, not to say counterproductive.
For example, how can we be happy with the idea that to encourage legal immigration, and to do so mainly by means of the European Blue Card, which would essentially be a European work permit for immigrants, will reduce the level of illegal immigration?
That is idiotic.
If you open the doors to some, you are opening them to everyone.
What is the point of setting up a biometric database to combat illegal immigration?
Why plan to allocate more manpower and resources to the European border control agency, Frontex, when the borders in question, whether internal or external, are still not being properly protected by the Member States?
Once again the European authorities have succeeded in identifying a problem but have proved incapable of resolving it, carried along as they are by an ideology based on 'immigrationism' and internationalism.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, immigration, both legal and illegal, has been recognised as one of the main challenges confronting the European Union.
Quite apart from the procedural and legal issues, the tragic human dimension of this phenomenon is becoming increasingly manifest.
I have visited centres for African refugees in Malta, and discussed matters with the services patrolling the Mediterranean and the responsible officials.
It was while I was there that the news of the tragedy that befell that Chechen family in the Bieszczady region came to light, confirming the universal nature of this phenomenon.
Hailing as I do from a country that was for centuries a source of political and economic emigration, it is hard to remain indifferent to the tragedy of refugees for whom the Union is a promised land.
It is from that perspective that I consider the two reports on which the debate in the European Parliament is based.
These documents provide an overview of the scale of the problem of immigration and of the current state of Community policy in this regard.
I agree with the premise that because of its demographic situation, Europe needs controlled channels of immigration that could compensate for the shortfall in the labour force and also reduce the scope of the underground economy and its associated problems.
All these issues have been recognised by Frontex, the Union's specialist agency.
The proposed solutions, namely the so-called 'burden sharing' merit serious consideration.
The advent of a Community immigration policy with a sound legal and financial basis is long overdue.
Better late than never!
I voted for the report on political priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals and I want to stress that controlling the influx of migrants to Europe, especially from third countries, is one of the greatest challenges facing European policy-makers.
In this 21st century trafficking in human beings is totally unacceptable and we have to find a way to eradicate this appalling activity and end the personal tragedies that sadly accompany it.
To do this it is essential to tackle the problem of illegal immigration on a European scale, for if one Member State is open to clandestine immigration then it puts pressure on all the others.
The implementation of a policy plan for legal migration has to include the fight against illegal immigration, for the two are closely linked.
What this report lacks are concrete proposals that would allow us to draw up a solution that will put an end to large-scale clandestine immigration and discourage the traffickers.
In Italy, for example, the introduction of quotas for economic migration has not reduced the level of illegal immigration into that country.
In fact quite the reverse, for the announcement of annual quotas has triggered an increase in the number of illegal immigrants who are prepared to risk their lives to enter the territory of the European Union.
in writing. - I welcome this report which in essence calls for a firm policy to fight illegal immigration based on solidarity between Member States and co-operation with third countries in full respect of the fundamental rights of the person.
in writing. - (DE) Despite millions of euros in funding, the countries of origin are not willing to cooperate.
However, taking back illegal immigrants must become an obligation at last.
The EU is also acting extremely negligently, however, if it fails to provide adequate resources to secure its external borders or accommodate apprehended illegal immigrants in reception camps, in order to ensure that they do not go underground, until they can be returned to their home countries, to say nothing of a border protection agency which closes down during the main migration season!
Brussels has also slept through the potential threat posed by Islamic immigrants.
If the EU does not wake up soon and put a stop to the influx of radical Muslims and the immigration and naturalisation of citizens from Islamic countries, we will not only be forced to live in permanent fear of terrorist attacks; we will soon be strangers in our own country.
The present report pay far too little attention to these issues, which is why - despite the sound approaches it contains - I am unfortunately compelled to reject it.
in writing. - (PT) Effective political intervention in the area of illegal immigration must act on two points of the problem, on the origin and on the destination: in other words, as stated in the adopted resolution, 'the authorities of the countries of origin, as well as the strengthening of the criminal legal framework to fight trafficking rings, combating illegal employment and human trafficking' form essential elements.
Without firmness in these areas, the response will be inadequate, even though this response involves other dimensions, such as development cooperation and action in the area of legal migration.
Furthermore, as we stated in the report on the European maritime strategy, any immigration policy which aims to be effective within the European Union 'requires', as stated in this resolution, 'that Member States abide by the principles of solidarity, shared responsibility, mutual trust and transparency'.
We fully agree in this respect.
in writing. - (SV) I am voting against the report in the final vote because I am opposed to FRONTEX and an EU border police, for which it would be difficult to secure accountability.
The report shows enthusiasm for expensive and ineffective biometric data in passports and visas, which are moreover a threat to personal integrity.
The EU is cynically exploiting the difficult situation of refugees to gain power over our borders.
in writing. - British Conservatives voted against the reports on migration, as the issue of migration is solely a matter for Member States and intergovernmental cooperation.
References to the Draft Reform Treaty and the extension of qualified majority voting are the wrong way to deal with the problems the EU is facing.
A 'one size fits all' approach does not work with immigration.
in writing. - By insisting that non-EU spouses of EU nationals must have lived in another EU Member State before being entitled to residency in Ireland, the Government is I believe in breach of the 2004 directive.
Furthermore, singling out the spouses of non-Irish EU nationals for the issuing of deportation orders is contrary to EU legislation which bans discrimination based on nationality.
I would remind the Commission that they informed the European Parliament in 2006 that the 2004 directive on residency should be interpreted by Member States in accordance with the European Court of Justice decisions in July 2002 (Case No C/459/99 (MRAX)) and again in April 2005 (Case No C/157/03).
These decisions established that the right of entry and residency in the Community of a third-country national who is a member of an EU citizen's family arises from that relationship, and depends neither on the legality of their previous residence in the Community nor on the presentation of a residence permit or other permit issued by another Member State.
Ireland's actions clearly breach those court decisions.
Consequently the Commission is obliged under the Treaties to take action against the Irish Government.

Secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving member states of the Council of Europe (reports Fava and Marty) (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving member states of the Council of Europe (Fava and Marty reports).
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in December 2005 the European Parliament's resolution requesting the formation of a Temporary Committee on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners reaffirmed, and I quote: 'its determination in the fight against terrorism but stresses that this fight cannot be won by sacrificing the very principles that terrorism seeks to destroy, notably that the protection of fundamental rights must never be compromised'.
Previous Council presidencies had the opportunity, in this House, to express their agreement with this sentiment.
I cannot start my speech without underlining that the current presidency shares this same determination and resolution.
I would reiterate that the fight against terrorism cannot compromise our values and principles on the protection of fundamental rights.
This is, in our opinion, a crucial issue.
In the fight against terrorism, we will only be victorious if we remain free: free from fear and any abuse or manipulation in the name of fear.
Our most powerful weapon and our most effective protection are our values and principles on the protection of our fundamental rights.
Although the Council as such does not have the competence to express an opinion, there will not be a single Member State of the European Union that does not recognise the importance of the efforts made and initiatives taken to get to the truth.
We should remember that we are talking about fundamental principles on which our European democracy rests.
Discovering the truth will allow the climate of suspicion to be eliminated.
It is therefore essential that the investigations in this area shed light on the issue and do not lead to further confusion.
The previous presidencies that had the opportunity to come before this House, the Secretary-General and High Representative and the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator did not fail to cooperate with the European Parliament's Temporary Committee in this respect.
I therefore believe that it would be totally unfair to suggest any lack of commitment on the part of the Council or the Foreign Affairs Ministers.
In fact, I must highlight the numerous initiatives, both parliamentary and legal, that the various European countries took following these reports.
It was therefore absolutely appropriate to act in the spirit of the principle of subsidiarity.
As you know, in many of the areas investigated by the Committee, the European Union does not itself have any power to act.
I am thinking in particular in this respect of the supervision of intelligence services.
This is a fact which the previous Council presidencies and the High Representative, Mr Solana, pointed out to this Parliament and its Committee.
It may of course be regretted that this is the case, but the fact is that the current Treaties limit the Council's scope of action in these areas.
However, for our part, I can assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will not fail to cooperate actively and constructively.
I would remind you of the full and transparent cooperation offered by the Portuguese Government, both during the investigations made by this Parliament's Temporary Committee, which completed its work in February of this year, and in relation to the initiatives of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the alleged CIA flights and illegal detention centres in Europe.
As is generally known, although the Council has not taken a position as such on the reports by Mr Fava and Mr Marty, respectively under the aegis of this Parliament and the Council of Europe, this does not mean that it is ignoring them.
In fact, the Council has actively and positively defended human rights and international law in the European Union's foreign policy.
We have consistently argued that the protection of the fundamental values of international law requires a serious and in-depth dialogue on human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism.
In this respect, the EU has stressed that human rights, the rights of refugees and international humanitarian law must be respected and preserved.
The Council will continue to monitor closely the developments occurring in respect of human rights in the fight against terrorism and will take appropriate measures to ensure their protection.
The EU also continues to be firmly committed to the total ban on torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.
Our actions are governed by this objective and we will always raise with third countries the concern that this problem causes.
The EU and its Member States have clearly indicated that the existence of any secret detention centres where detainees are kept in a legal vacuum is not consistent with international humanitarian law.
The EU Guidelines on Torture clearly stipulate that Member States must ban secret places of detention ensuring that all persons deprived of their liberty are held in officially recognised places of detention and that their whereabouts are known.
The EU Guidelines on Torture also state that no one can be forcibly returned to a country where he or she risks being subjected to torture or ill-treatment.
It is generally known that the issues in question, which involve competence for airport control, inspection and intelligence services, essentially fall under the responsibility and control of the Member States.
It is true that Sitcen conducts periodic analyses using information provided by the Member States but it has no operational jurisdiction over so-called 'intelligence' activities.
It should be noted that the EU Member States were also faced with the complexity which, in this respect, typifies the system of sorting and processing requests for overflight, landing and on-the-ground inspection authorisations.
This is a new challenge for everyone.
For our part, the Portuguese Government has not only carried out this sometimes difficult and very slow process of data collection, but has also set up a working group to assess the numerous procedures and propose improvements, the importance of which was duly recognised by the final report adopted by this Parliament in February.
I must point out that we regarded the work carried out by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe as particularly important and we took due note of the reports produced by Mr Marty.
The questionnaire and recommendations developed by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights also allowed, both in Portugal and I believe in other Member States, an unprecedented assessment of the national legal frameworks, guarantees and control mechanisms as a whole, including the analysis of procedures for sorting, verifying and inspecting requests for authorisation for aircraft overflights and landings on national territory.
In the case of Portugal, they have certainly led to institutional, technical and operational improvements.
As regards the recommendations made by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe on control guarantees, the predominant understanding of its members was that the initiatives in hand should not lead to unnecessary legislative duplication or the assignment of new powers to the Council of Europe.
On the other hand, it seems to be agreed that there is room for more effective application and more scrupulous monitoring of the existing mechanisms.
I believe that if these investigations were conducted with more rigour and composure, their conclusions would be more effective.
Despite rigour always being recommended and without confusing facts with allegations, but trying to observe some restraint in the language used for the importance of the values in question and the good name of the European democracies, the truth is that all these initiatives have scope and meaning.
They must therefore be pursued, particularly at a time when it has become essential to analyse, in a serious and straightforward manner, the new dilemmas posed by the terrorist threats, for example the dilemma of security versus freedom.
Furthermore, there is an increasing need for a response from international law to the difficult issues raised by the fight against an unprecedented threat.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice, based on the Hague Programme and respective action plan, is one of the main priorities of the 18-month joint programme of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies.
The fight against terrorism is, in this respect, one of the main challenges for which the three Presidencies have defined the objective of intensifying cooperation in this area through continued implementation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
As you know, Mr Gilles de Kerchove was recently appointed as the new EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator, and like his predecessors he will be available to give this House all the information it requires.
I must also take this opportunity to stress that the issue of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism has been specifically raised in the transatlantic dialogue, notably at the last summit between the European Union and the United States in April, when the conclusions of the European Council of 11 December 2006 were raised.
Portugal, while holding the presidency of the Council, has clearly stated its commitment to continuing and expanding this dialogue, which it regards as key to both sides.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the Council representative.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission - and I myself - have from the outset followed and supported the work of the European Parliament's Temporary Committee on this well-known topic and on the serious accusations and serious events concerned.
The seriousness of these events as such, even the very fact of imagining that they may have occurred, obviously makes it essential for all three institutions, Commission, Parliament and Council, to cooperate.
We should of course repeat once again - and I am happy to do so - that the war on terror must be waged with full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.
These are the two necessary conditions for democracy to function.
In this spirit, I believe that unlawful prisoner transfers, and the hypothesis that more or less secret places of detention exist - if such events were to be demonstrated in the appropriate manner - would undoubtedly constitute a serious violation of international law and fundamental human rights.
We are all aware that the members of the European Union, all of them, are obliged to comply with the important principles of the Convention on Human Rights, especially Articles 5 and 6.
We hope of course that these events will be thoroughly investigated in the Member States.
These investigations must obviously be conducted by the competent judicial authorities.
One point must be clear, but it has been clearly stated several times, both in the report by Mr Fava and in the Council of Europe report: a parliamentary report can set out facts, but Parliament naturally has neither the power nor the duty to conduct a judicial inquiry.
Obviously, when evidence from unknown sources is cited, the rule of law - which we must respect - dictates that investigations be entrusted to free, independent courts.
It is they that have a duty to reveal the sources lying behind an accusation.
Clearly, accusing a Member State or individual without revealing the sources for that accusation is a principle which is admissible in a parliamentary report but not in a judicial investigation.
That is why I hope the judicial investigations will continue, as is happening in some Member States, including my own country.
However, the report evidently needs to be followed up, so I shall list the initiatives that I believe can contribute to its follow-up.
On 23 July I wrote to the Polish and Romanian Governments, reminding them of their duty to hold a full, in-depth investigation and asking them for detailed information about whether the investigations had begun and what the outcome had been.
I hope that both governments will reply, and I shall of course inform you of their replies, especially because I believe that transparency and truth demand that when one is accused of something one must have every legal means of explaining and demonstrating that the accusation is untrue, or else of entrusting the inquiry to an independent court.
It is in the interest of an accused party, in my opinion, for there to be a very clear answer.
My second point is this: I have drawn up a questionnaire on terrorism for all Member States, as I mentioned at the last part-session.
The questionnaire asks each Member State what measures it has adopted to combat terrorism, what the results have been in terms of the effectiveness of national laws and, in particular, what level of protection for fundamental human rights is afforded by national legislation.
My intention is to analyse the responses and then draw up a report for the Council and Parliament on the effectiveness of the Member States' counter-terrorism measures and their suitability and compatibility with the principle of respect for fundamental rights.
My third point relates to air traffic.
I made a commitment to the LIBE Committee, promising to look into an extremely important legal aspect that is not covered at present: where does the borderline lie between the definition of a civil aircraft and a government aircraft, in other words one not subject to normal controls on civil aircraft?
Well, this work is underway, as promised, and the European Commission is to produce a communication on general aviation.
The communication will be adopted by the Commission before the end of this year, very soon therefore, and we shall of course put forward a proposal for a better definition of this concept of government aeroplane, which clearly is often interpreted in a way that circumvents the necessary controls.
However, there is another initiative concerning air traffic.
It is part of a general solution introducing common rules for all Member States on every type of aeroplane that enters the European Common Aviation Area without a flight plan. You no doubt know that as from 1 January 2009 the rules implementing the so-called single European airspace will introduce common requests to all Member States for flight plans, so in this context we shall harmonise the rules on the flight plans of all aircraft whether they pass through or enter European airspace.
This will be of enormous benefit because it will eliminate the differential treatment that we have noted in Member States concerning overflight and landing.
The other topic is ratification of the extradition agreement between Europe and the United States.
If there had already been, as there should have been, a European agreement - which we have signed but not yet ratified - then the rules on the extradition of prisoners from and to the United States would have been a lot clearer.
We are talking here about prisoners under investigation for, or suspected of, terrorism.
This agreement has yet to be ratified by certain Member States, fortunately only a few.
I have made another formal appeal to all the Ministers of Justice to ratify this European extradition agreement with the United States as soon as possible.
Then there is the subject of supervision of the intelligence services.
This subject is covered in both reports, but it is a sensitive matter.
I think what counts above all else here is the national response, although certain common requirements can be highlighted.
The first requirement is to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny in the Member States.
Some countries have adopted, or are adopting, national laws to tighten up substantially their national parliaments' powers of scrutiny over the activities of their secret services.
This is the road along which we should be going, in my opinion, because, as you will appreciate, I cannot imagine a future common European law governing the secret services, though I do think it is extremely useful to discuss the topic.
To conclude, Mr President, I think that this is a topic that we must continue to discuss, bearing in mind the rule of law as a principle and of course respect for fundamental rights; but fundamental rights also include the right not to come under accusation except on the basis of evidence gathered according to the proper procedures.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group has expressed valid criticism of the Marty report and voted overwhelmingly against the Fava report.
It is a shame, because at least on subjects like terrorism and human rights this House ought to be able to overcome its internal divisions and produce a common position.
If we have not managed to do so, it is because unfortunately the Fava report started from a preconceived view: the United States is guilty!
We thus wasted a year seeking not the truth, but proof of that guilt, omitting and even concealing any facts that would run counter to this view.
Let me give just one practical and, I may say, scandalous example.
One reason why we went to Poland was to interview a journalist who had been among the first to report, a year before, on the existence of CIA prisons in Poland.
When we met her, she had unfortunately changed her mind; when I say 'unfortunately' I mean it ironically.
She was no longer certain; she told us that she would not have written that article today.
Well, there is no trace of her change of mind in the report, whereas it is full of testimonies by journalists who share the rapporteur's thesis.
We have wasted a year for nothing, spending taxpayers' money without discovering anything more than we already knew from the press and from official and unofficial US sources, and if President Bush himself had not revealed the existence of CIA prisons, we would not even have been certain about that.
You told us, Commissioner Frattini, that you have written letters to Poland and Romania asking for explanations but have not received replies.
It is always bad form not to reply, but I am not surprised because the accusations are unfounded.
You yourself refer in your letter to presumed information, not to concrete facts, and both countries have already stated at the highest level that they have investigated and that, in their opinion, no CIA prisons exist.
That may or may not be true, and everyone can think what they like about it, but as you yourself said, Mr Frattini, we cannot make accusations until there is evidence.
The fact is that the Fava and Marty reports are too full of phrases such as 'it is highly likely' and 'one cannot rule out', on which basis firm conclusions are then drawn.
Let no one come and tell me, to justify the lack of evidence, that we are not a court and that ours is a political document.
It is no longer political when we are invited to consider whether or not circumstances are sufficiently extreme to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.
Now, given that I sense a mood in this House in favour of putting together a new CIA report, I have a recommendation to make.
Let us stop producing tendentious interpretations of the past; let us stop investigating this matter about which we have discovered nothing.
Let us leave it up to the courts - as the Commissioner said - and to journalists who have the wherewithal to investigate, and can do so better than us.
Let us concentrate on the future, on politics and on the 'recommendations' part of the Fava report, which is the only acceptable part.
The United States has undoubtedly made mistakes; in some cases it has violated human rights, but it is very easy not to make mistakes when one does nothing to combat terrorism.
Terrorism is a new phenomenon not countenanced in our laws, and legislation now has to be adapted.
Let us try to enact laws on conduct to prevent any further human rights violations, so as to avoid a repeat of past errors, and to adapt our rules and regulations to a new type of global threat.
It is fair that the Commission should attempt to carry out an overall assessment of measures adopted by the Member States; the other initiatives announced and launched by Mr Frattini are equally acceptable.
Nevertheless, a good deal still remains to be done if the problem of terrorism is to be tackled in a global, forceful and coordinated manner.
I am thinking of the Internet and measures to prevent and prosecute criminal offences, so as to avoid the paradoxical situation where, while governments operate separately at national level, terrorists for their part act at global level through the Internet and cells located all over the place.
Our future depends on our ability to defeat terrorism.
Let us unite in order to win this battle.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report was adopted seven months ago, and since then the only signs of anything new happening have come from the United States.
One such sign was recalled by Mr Gawronski: President Bush decreed on 20 July that his administration would continue to have recourse to unlawful CIA activity in the form of extrajudicial seizure and detention of suspected terrorists in willing third countries.
The other important sign is that the US Congress has opened its own independent inquiry into extraordinary rendition.
This tells us that we are dealing not with a chapter of history but with current affairs.
Judicial inquiries are underway in four European countries: Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy.
Thirty-nine provisional detention orders have so far been issued against as many US secret service officials and agents.
The inquiry by this House documented facts, not opinions.
It is a fact, for instance, that some of our governments and security services cooperated with the CIA in carrying out extraordinary rendition.
I would remind Commissioner Frattini that our sources in this case were not anonymous.
Our sources, as the report says, were statements by the UK and German Governments.
We put forward 48 recommendations, above all to the Council, and we should like to know from the Council whether even one of those recommendations has been followed up over these seven months.
We made two requests in particular: we invited the European institutions - including the Council - to shoulder their respective responsibilities under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, and we expected the Council to exert pressure on all the governments concerned to provide full and exhaustive information, with the possibility of arranging hearings where necessary.
This has not happened.
It is not true that the Council has no powers, Mr Lobo Antunes; the Council has the powers conferred on it by Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty.
Our request certainly could have been acted on by the German Presidency and now the Portuguese Presidency.
We appreciate Mr Frattini's initiatives, but we are not satisfied by these two six-month presidencies which have in effect consigned to oblivion a year of work by our committee of inquiry.
Given that public opinion in our countries is calling for truth, the silence of the Council - and, I must say, of many of our governments - constitutes a missed opportunity for Europe.
Nevertheless, this House does not intend to give in.
I am sorry for Mr Gawronski, but we shall come back to this topic.
An own-initiative report in the Committee on Civil Liberties will be our contribution to combating terrorism in a way that is respectful of human rights always, everywhere and for everyone; the number-one human right, as Cesare Beccaria taught us centuries ago, being the presumption of innocence.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Parliament adopted a resolution on this issue, the Council of Europe adopted another text on this same issue, clear and explicit in all areas, but those of us with some legal knowledge are aware, and it comes as no surprise to us - I say this with a certain amount of irony - that there is a rule of law, especially criminal law, whereby no one is obliged to make self-incriminating statements.
This is what surprises us: that the Council and all the governments are applying it to themselves.
In this case, instead of taking action they have decided to remain silent, like the man in the dock who does not defend himself but refuses to accept the charges by simply remaining passive and silent.
It is shameful to see the Council as an institution and all its members acting in a collective fashion, collectively availing themselves of the law used by defendants in court.
Institutional silence concerning responsibility, whether active or passive, through actions or through negligence, through conviction or the fear of causing problems following pressure from an ally nation: this silence is one of the major disgraces of the democratic context we live in today, and it affects all those involved.
It is likewise difficult to apply mechanisms of responsibility in the European Union, because the mechanisms are not intended to be used against all Member States acting to protect themselves in a reciprocal fashion.
Certainly no one imagined when the Treaty was drawn up, when Articles 6 and 7 were being drafted, that we would find ourselves in a situation where we would not be discussing infringements of fundamental rights, or passiveness concerning the defence of fundamental rights by a government, but by a European institution: the Council as such remaining a passive accomplice, with the complicity of all Member States.
That situation was never envisaged, and this truly affords it protection.
We have no legal mechanisms to take action against this, but I wish to tell the Council representative that History will clarify matters, because History will always bring to light the shame of this time when, on the pretext of protecting our freedom, all the concepts on which this European Union was founded have been jeopardised.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The Fava report was based on circumstantial evidence and instead of firm conclusions it simply created a feeling of suspicion towards Member States.
The Marty report was drafted in an even less responsible manner.
All of its findings are based on anonymous sources and are therefore impossible to verify.
This approach cannot provide any assurance that Mr Marty's work was not the subject of manipulation by services and organisations reluctant to engage in transatlantic cooperation in the interests of overcoming terrorism.
I am very grateful to Mr Antunes for pointing out that international law does not make sufficient provision for the problems associated with terrorism.
None of the reports under discussion has contributed anything in this regard.
The official investigations and explanations submitted by Poland comply with our principles of civilian control of the secret services.
Furthermore, our principles comply with the relevant European standards in this regard.
I therefore do not see the point of repeating this debate.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report was adopted by this House in February 2007, and it contains a long list of recommendations which relate both to the legal and the political aspects.
I would have liked to see the Council refer to these recommendations and give details of what has happened since then.
If the Council does not have Mr Fava's report available, we will gladly supply it with another copy.
However, we would then be very keen to hear what has been done in respect of the recommendations made in this report, notably as regards the cooperation with the Member States but also with regard to the Council's own role, to which attention is drawn in this report.
Mr Dick Marty, the Council of Europe rapporteur, also presented a second report in July this year.
I would like to confine myself to two points.
In this report, he says that some European governments have not only obstructed the search for the truth but are continuing to do so by invoking the concept of 'state secrets'.
This is nothing other than the abuse of secrecy in order to protect those who have broken the law.
I am sad to say that he applies this criticism to my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, and to Italy, in particular.
On the other hand, he cites the positive examples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Canada, which holds observer status with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
In a second point, however, he makes explicit mention of Poland and Romania and refers to these countries in relation to the secret detention facilities.
That is also a point on which I wish the Council would provide us with an account of what has happened.
Invoking the subsidiarity of Member States is not enough in this case, for we are dealing here with common European values.
I draw your attention to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaties.
They apply in all Member States irrespective of subsidiarity.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would describe what we have experienced during the so-called 'war on terror' as a method of 'outsourcing' human rights abuses.
People are being detained in GuantÃ¡namo, where they are deprived of their most fundamental rights.
People have been handed over to torture regimes because others obviously don't want to get their hands dirty.
Secret prisons have been operated, as President Bush himself has admitted, and Europe's governments have simply looked away as the CIA has committed systematic human rights abuses on their sovereign territory.
The Council of Europe and this House have not remained silent in the face of these monstrous events; instead, they have gathered the facts, investigated the abuses and criticised them clearly and unequivocally.
Dick Marty has worked with very great commitment here, and I would like to express my thanks to him.
The report by our colleague Mr Fava, which was supported by my group, calls, as a matter of urgency, for a shift away from the practices which have now come to light, but what is happening instead?
In the case of Khaled el-Masri, for example, my own government kowtowed to the US Government only a few days ago.
It is refusing to forward to the US administration the Munich prosecutors' request for the extradition of the 13 CIA agents accused of abducting Mr el-Masri.
Why?
Simply because merely submitting this request would annoy Washington.
I have no objection to my own country and the EU joining forces with the US to combat the threat of terrorism, but does this mean that kidnapping and torture are no longer crimes?
Surely CIA agents cannot be given carte blanche to do whatever they want?
Is this really the kind of transatlantic security zone that the German Minister of the Interior has just been talking about?
Our fundamental values - and above all the comprehensive protection of human rights - cannot be put up for grabs in this so-called war on terror.
The European Parliament and the Council of Europe have rightly underlined this fact, and I expect the Council and the Commission also to uphold this principle without restrictions and, above all, to be guided by it in their actions.
Let me say that what I have heard from the Council today is far from adequate.
I really do expect the Council to act in accordance with the principles it itself has formulated and to follow up on the recommendations made by the European Parliament.
Mr President, it is almost two years since Parliament decided to set up a Temporary Committee of enquiry; a decision that was pushed through despite strong opposition and substantiated objections.
Now, two years later, the objections of the time are being raised again.
Today we are debating two reports: Mr Marty's report and Mr Fava's report.
The latter report does not add anything new to the report by Mr Marty that we were already familiar with at the time.
The Council of Europe's report was balanced and cautious in directing accusations at Member States.
Unfortunately, that cannot be said of the report in this House.
The fact that we are today debating both reports can be said to be progress.
That progress in the field of cooperation is fortunately also taking shape in the agency for fundamental rights.
The Conference of Chairmen of the political groups has rightly called for good cooperation between Parliament and the Council of Europe.
Where fundamental rights are at stake, cooperation is essential, because the protection of fundamental rights is extremely important.
If that is the purpose of enquiries into the actions of the American security services on European territory, the Council must also address its efforts to that.
Can agreements be made in transatlantic relations on combating terrorism or is it to remain at the level of unilaterally imposed measures?
With all measures against terrorism, the attention given to rights is often inadequate.
After two enquiries, it is time to look forward and to work on restoring relations with the United States as equals.
I would very much like to hear from the Council what it plans to do in concrete terms to restore relations.
Are we going to continue to put pressure on the United States to clear up the question of whether there were secret detention camps on EU territory or are we going to try to prevent it from happening again?
Finally, I have a question for the President.
In the debate on 14 February I asked whether we could be given an indication of the costs of the enquiries carried out by the Temporary Committee.
To date no information has been forthcoming on that.
Mr President, can you arrange for a financial report in addition to the enquiry report and is it also possible for the Council of Europe to also provide some information on the costs incurred by Mr Marty's enquiry.
Mr Gawronski is right: this is about spending tax payers' money.
- (NL) Mr President, I wish to make a number of remarks on behalf of my group.
It really is a pity to have to conclude today that the Council has not really responded to the questions that Claudio Fava's January report raised partly on behalf of Parliament.
What has the Council actually done with the findings, both our findings and the findings of the Council of Europe?
Has there been no real consultation to prevent the practices described in these reports from happening again?
We are more positive about the Commission's response.
The Commission has embarked on an evaluation of anti-terrorism measures and how they are implemented.
I am very pleased indeed with the Commissioner's announcement just now about what can be done to prevent aircraft landing at European airports in the future, which are carrying people to be transported elsewhere unlawfully; we have to have a system of control for these so-called 'State aircraft'.
The next point is that we are, of course, pleased that another terrorism coordinator has been appointed and we wish him great success.
We were somewhat surprised at the sudden departure of Mr Gijs de Vries, who never gave the impression that he was really very keen on his job.
Hopefully the new coordinator will be, his position as coordinator will be strengthened and in future the new coordinator will be able to answer questions from Parliament if required.
I now turn to Mr Marty's report on the possible secret prisons in Poland and Romania.
I agree with the remarks already made here about the fact that the last report was based on anonymous witness statements.
Mr Marty still has to explain what the criteria are in the Council of Europe, when you can cite anonymous sources, and so we are not really satisfied with the way Mr Marty approached it.
A number of people were put in the dock and no new facts emerged.
I think that it is time for Mr Marty to say whether that list of names can be deleted, especially as two of our colleagues are on the list.
I said this before some time ago, when we spoke to Mr Marty in the committee.
I have one final point.
It is, of course, important to make clear to the citizens that the practices that have taken place in some EU countries, such as the abduction of people by secret services from outside the European Union, cannot happen again, that the CIA cannot be allowed to operate in Europe without any supervision by national authorities.
The Americans seems to operate under different rules from us.
Once again the recent examples of the refusal by the Americans to extradite people or to agree to deportation requests from Italy and Germany are a sign that we evidently operate under different standards.
These two examples give us food for thought about the manner of cooperation between the European Union and the United States when it comes to the fight against terrorism.
Do the Americans want to observe the same balance when it comes to security and human rights?
Mr President, the President of the Council threw up his hands and said the EU had no power to act, that torture flights and secret prisons are 'nothing to do with us, Guv!'.
Then he said that the Council had been involved in the active promotion of human rights outside the EU.
I really am getting quite sick of hearing presidencies endlessly parrot European values but claim that they cannot deliver accountability for human rights abuses inside the EU.
Here are two things that you could do.
Why have only 12 Member States signed the UN Convention on enforced disappearance, notable absentees from signature being the UK, Germany, Spain, Poland and Romania - a funny list that - as well, of course, as the US?
Secondly, you could get EU Member States to volunteer to take GuantÃ¡namo prisoners who have been cleared for release.
The UK had to be taken to court before it bid for five UK residents to come back to the UK.
If the EU calls for the closure of GuantÃ¡namo, which we more or less did, then let Member States put their action where their mouth is.
I agree with Commissioner Frattini that a parliamentary inquiry is insufficient.
We did not have the powers and the investigatory techniques of the police and judicial inquiry, but firstly I would say that the weight of testimony from victims and others that we received and published was weighty, consistent and persuasive.
Secondly, it is a bit rich to reproach a parliamentary report when Member States refused to instigate police or judicial inquiries.
The UK Intelligence and Security Committee, which is appointed by and reports to the Prime Minister - not to Parliament - reproached British security services for not realising that information they passed to the CIA would be misused for abduction, disappearance and torture.
Well, if we have such naive British intelligence services, it does not make me feel very safe.
It is certainly good to hear that Commissioner Frattini is shutting the stable door somewhat after the horse has bolted in terms of stopping abuse of European airspace, with private planes evading controls on state aircraft or not filing flight plans, but that is no substitute for accountability for past permission or tolerance for torture flights through, or secret prisons on, European territory.
(PL) The Fava report and the report by Mr Marty for the Council of Europe share a common feature: they are devoid of all evidence.
They amount to a series of vague irrelevant reflections by the rapporteurs on the rendition of terrorist suspects and the supposed secret CIA centres in Europe.
The Fava report has been discussed on a number of occasions and it would be a pity to waste time on further debate.
I should, however, like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Marty.
From the very beginning he set out to make his name known and he has certainly been successful in that regard.
Both his reports are of a lamentable standard, and cast him into ridicule as a lawyer.
Mr Marty obviously came to the conclusion that it was worth paying such a price in order to make his name known in political circles.
Inter alia he did not allow individuals who had come forward voluntarily to be heard, including the Members of the European Parliament he slandered in the report but could not spare time for.
Mr Marty failed to respond to repeated invitations from the Polish authorities.
He was unable to offer an explanation for such behaviour when he appeared before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Mr Marty has serious difficulty distinguishing between facts and speculation.
I can appreciate that to do so would endanger the tactical approach and strategic target he set himself from the outset, namely political self-aggrandisement.
It is unfortunate that he exploited the good name of the Council of Europe to achieve his ambition.
(FR) Mr President, Amnesty International has set the tone of our debate in a statement issued today.
It says, in effect, that Germany is refusing to demand the extradition of certain US citizens, members of the CIA, who are suspected of having organised the abduction and detention of Mr Khaled-el-Masri, and of subsequently having tortured him.
Restrained by a political decision, the legal system therefore does not have the wherewithal to dispense justice in cases involving the alleged breach of human rights, committed in the name of the fight against terrorism.
This is precisely the situation that is at the heart of this debate.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you tell us things and you make hypothetical statements such as: 'the fight against terrorism has to be conducted with respect for basic human rights'.
We agree with you.
However, the debate we are having today shows that the real facts have now been confirmed: Member States of the European Union have been complicit in the programme of secret detention and return that has been set up within the territory of the European Union by the CIA and in doing so have broken the law.
This has now been proven.
The question that we are now asking is this: what initiatives are you now going to take? What lessons are you going to learn from this situation?
When are you going to condemn these illegal activities in clear terms and in the name of the Council?
When are you going to start putting pressure on Member States to provide full and accurate details of what has been going on to the national parliaments and to the Members of this House?
When are you going to get Member States to reject the whole business of giving diplomatic assurances?
I welcome the announcement by Commissioner Frattini that there is to be a report on the effectiveness of anti-terrorism measures and on respect for human rights.
I believe that Parliament will be very interested in receiving this report and I look forward very much to being able to discuss it with you.
I would like to invite you here and now to such a debate.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this House did a remarkable job of work in approving Mr Fava's report.
Similarly, I think the General Assembly of the Council of Europe made a significant contribution to ascertaining a truth that has now been proven: there have been thousands of flights, there have been dozens of kidnappings, and there has been direct involvement of European governments and EU intelligence services.
We have witness statements and we also have the minutes of the special European Parliament committee, testifying to the fact that European governments sat down with the US administration and discussed extraordinary rendition.
This is a proven fact and public knowledge, which I believe deserves to be respected even by those colleagues who voted against this report.
There is only one black hole in this affair: the silence of the Council.
It is rather embarrassing here, given that everyone else has spoken out.
However, there is one anomaly: while the Council remains silent the governments are acting.
It is not true that the governments are turning a blind eye; they are doing whatever they can to prevent clarification of the truth.
For instance, the Italian Government is currently avoiding seeking the extradition of the CIA agents involved in the judicial measures and has even invoked official secrecy to slow down the judicial activity on the case of Abu Omar.
Thus the governments are indeed acting while the Council maintains its silence.
In my opinion this is wrong!
The excellent work done by this House deserves respect, and surely a sign of respect should come first and foremost from the Council.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee have done our work.
It is a proven fact that the CIA has kidnapped and abducted people in Europe.
The public prosecutors in Milan and Munich have established and proved this beyond doubt.
What kind of policy is in place, however, when responsible people in Berlin and Rome are now refusing to pass an arrest warrant - that is the correct term - to the US Government?
The kidnappers - and that is exactly what the CIA agents who abducted Khaled al-Masri in Skopje are - must be handed over.
In a state governed by the rule of law - which is what we have, surely - no one can be exempt from the law.
This is true even if, as certain high-ranking security officials in Berlin claim, relations with the US Government are being soured by the work of the Munich public prosecutors, who are simply doing their job in the prescribed fashion: this speaks volumes about these people's mentality and their attitude to the rule of law.
Yes, international terrorism must be combated by every means, but please, with the means available under the rule of law, not with Wild West methods according to the country-of-origin principle, which is what the CIA has done here.
It is all well and good for the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to urge the Chinese to respect human rights and for her to receive the Dalai Lama, but that is not enough.
We have homework to do here in Europe as well.
We cannot have a strong Ã  la carte rule of law, a rule of law which is only permitted to be strong when it fits in with the system.
When I hear the questions about what the Committee cost, what democracy actually costs, let me just say this to those people: my dear people, a dictatorship is much cheaper, but tell me the price of that!
It is a price we are not willing to pay!
- (NL) Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers.
The Member States acted collectively, both in the Council and in NATO, and so we must also account for our actions collectively as the Council; you cannot hide behind the argument of powers and subsidiarity; it is not a matter of making two particular Member States into scapegoats.
People keep saying that there is no conclusive legal evidence.
That is not necessary, firstly because we have a witness, Mr Bush himself, who said: yes, there are renditions, yes, there are black sites.
I will go further than that: we think it is an excellent idea.
Furthermore, the facts have been proven in court cases in both Germany and Italy, in addition to all the other facts on the table before us.
Besides, Parliament is not a court of law - Mr Frattini is right about that - but the Member States not only have a legal, they also have a political and moral duty to account for their actions, not only before the court but also to their citizens.
Can the Council, can the ministers look their citizens directly in the eye and say that human rights violations in Europe will continue to go unpunished?
Because that is what it amounts to.
The allegations are extremely serious and if, according to the Council, there is no truth in them at all, then the Council must refute them.
If, however, there is a grain of truth in the allegations, then the facts are serious enough to warrant an enquiry.
Finally, I also agree with those who say 'yes' to extradition between the United States and the European Union; not, however, just for those whom the United States considers to be suspects, but also when countries of the European Union request the extradition of CIA agents.
(PL) Mr President, the previous speaker referred to President Bush.
I would point out that the latter made no mention of Europe and we should therefore not invoke him.
I shall not refer to the Fava report, as much has already been said about it.
Let us focus instead on the Marty report.
We might just as well be discussing abstract painting today.
I say this because abstract painting exists, even though it is sometimes incomprehensible.
There is no way of verifying whether the allegations concerning CIA operations and the presence of detainees in Poland have any foundation, just as the circumstantial evidence regarding the existence of the Yeti in the Himalaya and the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland does not provide grounds for belief in the existence of those two creatures.
Parliament's report refers to the CIA prisons that might have been located in American military bases in Europe.
Entire squadrons of UFOs might have landed on Parliament's courtyard this evening.
They might and could have landed but have not done so.
Of course, if we were to set up an investigative committee, the latter might well find otherwise.
- (ES) Mr President, listening to the Council and some of our colleagues, I get the impression we are still in January 2006, as if nothing has happened since then, and yet since then we have had a committee of inquiry, a number of reports and, most importantly, we have had an admission by the US President that these practices did in fact occur.
What more do the governments and the Council need to issue a plausible response to the European citizens and chalk up a little prestige and credibility on this issue?
It is obvious that there is a huge gap here between practising and preaching.
All due rigor is called for, and I agree, but it must be said that rigor commences with the facts and the evidence, facts that have been borne out time and time again, and here what we want to know is not merely who is responsible, but just how far this responsibility reaches.
Therefore I wish to ask Mr Lobo Antunes very directly indeed: what are you waiting for to demand that the European governments and the US Government put an end to this practice that we have condemned on so many occasions?
What are you waiting for to retrieve the prestige and credibility that the Council and the European Union as a whole are losing on a daily basis?
(SV) Mr President, as we all know, our report documents 1 245 cases of illegal CIA flights, 21 illegal abductions and numerous cases of torture and abuse.
We demanded that prison camps such as GuantÃ¡namo be closed and that the EU guarantee that these abuses would never be repeated.
What did we get?
Very little unfortunately.
The USA continues its abuses in the so-called war on terrorism.
It was depressing to hear the Council's response to our important demands.
I want to hear a European Council say that we are to put pressure on the USA, that their kidnappings must cease and that all prison camps must be closed.
I want the EU - not just us in the European Parliament - to say that we are standing up for human rights.
I want the EU to say that the fight against terrorism can never be waged by illegitimate means.
It is clear that human rights must be fought for all over again every day.
Let us continue to act as watchdogs and ensure that not a single innocent person becomes a casualty of the so-called war on terrorism.
(PT) Before the day in September 2006 when President Bush confirmed the existence of secret prisons in third countries, the Portuguese Government had regarded as reliable the guarantees given by Washington that the sovereignty or legality of its European allies had not been violated.
However, after this date, once it had been proven that various renditions had taken place across Europe, it became essential to investigate whether Portugal or Portuguese agents had been involved and, in particular, to prevent their continued involvement.
To my sorrow and shame, however, the Socialist Party, my party, the party in government, voted against the formation of a parliamentary committee of inquiry on 10 January 2007.
However, it has now been proven that over 100 stopovers were made at Portuguese airports by aircraft involved in the rendition programme.
The passenger and crew lists of the most suspicious flights that the SEF (Portuguese Foreign Nationals and Borders Service) has managed to identify have never been provided by the Portuguese Government to the national parliament or to this Parliament, despite repeated requests.
Nor did the Portuguese Government permit the director of the secret service or his predecessors from 2002 to be heard by the European Parliament mission that went to Lisbon in December 2006.
The Portuguese Government did not provide the national parliament or the European Parliament with the oft-requested list of civilian or military flights to and from Guantanamo that passed over Portuguese territory.
Until December 2006 the government denied the existence of such flights.
However, they were recorded and the list compiled included 94 overflights and 17 stopovers specifically by US civilian and military aircraft between January 2002 and the end of June 2006.
There is evidence that several of these flights were carrying prisoners from the Incirlik base in Turkey to Guantanamo, including the 'Bosnian Six'.
Once the list reached the European Parliament, the Portuguese Government did not deny its authenticity, but instead alleged that the Guantanamo detention centre was not the same as the Guantanamo military base and that flights to this military base were supposedly 'normal' and under the auspices of the United Nations or NATO.
The Secretary-General of NATO subsequently denied this in writing.
In January 2006 I obtained evidence that chained prisoners had been sighted at the Lajes base in the Azores during their transfer to US aircraft.
This evidence was confirmed by journalists and reports were published including photographs of the buildings.
Mr President, a judicial investigation is currently being conducted in Portugal.
Unfortunately this was not instigated by the Portuguese Government, but on my initiative.
However, the truth must come to light given the worrying facts discovered by this Parliament dating from the time of Mr DurÃ£o Barroso's Government to the current one.
(PL) Mr President, in my speech I, too, would like to focus on the Marty report which has been frequently referred to in the House.
This is because that report is characterised by a high degree of confusion between objective truth and subjective assessments.
I represent a party that is in opposition to the present government and was also in opposition to the previous one.
Supporters of my party did not vote either for the present president or for his predecessor.
Our party is a strong advocate of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We would find it extraordinarily useful to have ammunition of this sort available to us as we strive to overcome our political opponents in Poland.
Unfortunately, however, we do not have such ammunition at our disposal, because it simply does not exist.
Under the auspices of the Polish Parliament an investigation was also carried out by a permanent committee, on which the opposition is represented.
It did not uncover anything; nor did the enquiry by the Ombudsman.
We must not, therefore, confuse subjective assessments with facts.
No such facts exist.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many months have passed since Parliament's well-documented denunciation of the serious unlawful acts committed or condoned by various European governments in complicity with the US secret services.
We noted at the time that those same European governments did little or nothing to cooperate with the parliamentary committee in seeking the truth and those responsible.
In the light of the statements made by the Commission and the Council, we can say that things have barely moved on from where they were at that time.
Little or nothing has been done to make Member States provide adequate information about the activities of their secret services, apart from the commendable letters referred to by Commissioner Frattini.
Nothing at all has been done to redefine the role and independence of some countries' secret services in view of the obvious supremacy and command exerted by those of the USA.
Given what we now know about Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and Germany, for example, it has to be said that some of the vital nerve centres of European security are subordinate to the United States.
Surely, not even if our principal ally were to respect European laws and principles could we agree to forfeit European sovereignty!
This becomes quite intolerable, however, once we discover that our principal ally is behaving towards us in an imperial fashion, ignoring or flouting our laws on our territory.
I therefore wish to express my dissatisfaction with the statements made by the Council and the Commission.
I believe that Parliament must keep up its good work.
Mr President, turning a blind eye to torture and breaches of human rights by a state will not defeat terrorism.
It will deepen a sense of grievance and create new recruits for terrorist activity.
That is the bitter lesson from 30 years of strife in Northern Ireland.
Turning a blind eye to breaches of human rights and to torture is not an option for a democratic state.
On the contrary, in working to end terror, it is supremely important that we demonstrate the strength of our commitment to justice.
The lack of response by Member States to the recommendations of this Parliament is quite appalling.
It is equally sad, I have to say, to see some on the Right of this House continuing, ostrich-like, to deny the obvious.
The US has admitted illegal detentions, transfer and torture of suspects, and they may, in fact, still be under way.
We do not know.
Some EU Member States connived with that breach of human rights.
I regret to say that Ireland facilitated the landing of 147 CIA-operated planes in Ireland, some of which we know were involved in the rendition of prisoners.
There has been no parliamentary inquiry in Ireland; there has been no parliamentary scrutiny of the security services in Ireland and there has been no inspection of CIA planes.
The Irish Human Rights Commission has announced that it is reviewing its contacts with the Irish Government on this matter and is bringing forward proposals at the end of this year for dealing with it.
Finally, let me respond to Mr Blokland, who demanded to know the cost of the inquiry of this Parliament.
It is a legitimate request, but could I ask him what price he puts on human rights?
What price does he put on the prevention of torture?
I believe we cannot put a price on those things.
We have to spend whatever it takes to reveal what is going on and take action to stop it.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I will be as brief as possible, but this debate involved many contributions and various questions have been raised.
As you will certainly understand, Mr President, some of these questions must receive my full attention and a response.
Of course, during this debate, the Members of this House have expressed many points of view, not all of them uniform.
They all of course deserve my full respect, even though I cannot agree with all of them.
In particular I cannot agree with the speech made by one Member from my country who, in her speech, referred exclusively to the situation in Portugal.
I cannot of course subscribe to this speech in any respect.
However, despite these differences of opinion, I am sure that we are all agreed on the essential point, which is that we are engaged in a war against terrorism in the name of freedom and that we can only win this war in freedom.
As I said at the start of my speech, the fight against international terrorism can only be won through a joint effort and with respect for the values and fundamental principles shared by the European Union and the United States of America.
It is true that the Council was urged to act but, as I said and as previous presidencies have also said, the Council in itself does not have any competence in this area.
You may lament this but that is the truth of the matter.
Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaties have been invoked here today.
As you know, these articles lay down principles and establish values but they do not assign competence.
The institutions, in accordance with the so-called 'principle of conferral of competences', can only exercise those competences which have been effectively, clearly and expressly assigned to them by the Treaties.
This is how the institutions of the Union function.
However, the Commission has presented here today a series of proposals and initiatives, some of which have already been implemented and others which will be implemented and which naturally will merit the Council's full attention and effort.
The Commission's proposals will of course be welcomed by the Council.
Furthermore, I should also like to say that numerous initiatives have been taken by the Member States, mainly through their parliaments, with investigations being conducted in line with the recommendations made by the European Parliament's report.
In this respect, with specific reference to what is happening in Portugal, I am here today representing the Portuguese Government, a government created by the Socialist Party, a party which in Portugal was famed for and exemplary in the fight for democracy and freedom in our country.
Of course neither the Government nor the Socialist Party agreed, agrees or will agree with violations of human rights.
As I have said to you, the efforts and initiatives to discover the truth of the matter are welcome.
It is therefore essential to be rigorous and the basis for a rigorous analysis is not to allow any confusion or to accept mere supposition as fact.
As regards the transatlantic relations which have been mentioned, the Council reiterates that, in general, in the fight against terrorism, generalised internal security measures, not limited to one Member State of the European Union, can only be put into practice in the framework of very strict cooperation with the US.
This cooperation must of course be developed, as noted, from the statement made at the last transatlantic summit that took place during the German Presidency.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think anyone in this House can have any doubt that these actions are unlawful.
The added value that I see in Mr Fava's report is that it commits everyone, all three institutions, to ensuring that such events never happen again.
This urgent entreaty comes across to me from the conclusions of the Fava report and is the political point that I believe needs to be emphasised.
Thus there are two aspects here, I believe.
One is strategy, in other words looking to the future and seeing to it that such events never happen again on European territory, and then trusting our judges to investigate the past.
As others have said, no one believes that we can replace our judges who, in accordance with the rule of law, have to investigate with all the evidence to hand and with due respect for the presumption of innocence, as Mr Fava has reminded us.
The past and the future: these are the two levels requiring attention.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe and the United States undeniably share a tradition and a constitutional background of guaranteed fundamental rights.
I therefore believe that torture, unlawful detention and the seizure of individuals - even if suspected of terrorism - in themselves run counter to our shared transatlantic background of democracy and rights.
So the political conclusion I draw is that we need ways of strengthening our Euro-Atlantic links in order to provide more security along with more rights.
It would be quite wrong to point the finger at the United States when, on the contrary, we should be seeking a way to wage a joint war on terror based on respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights.
This is the lesson that I personally learn from many of these recommendations.
Then there is the question of how to bolster our sovereignty.
This is a serious matter.
How can Europe strengthen its own area of sovereignty so as to be a stronger ally, and no longer a weak one, in Euro-Atlantic cooperation?
One preliminary example is the reference that I made to the single European airspace.
Once we have, as from January 2009, a common rule valid for all 27 Member States on overflight rights, the definition of aeroplanes and powers of control over this single European sky, Europe will have bolstered its sovereignty.
Moreover, at that stage the Commission will undoubtedly have coordinating and supervisory powers, because the rules will then no longer be national but European.
Finally, Mr President, this debate gives us one more reason to introduce the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future constitutional treaty or institutional treaty, whatever it may be called.
It is one more reason because that inclusion, that institutional reference to the Charter of rights, will give the EU institutions powers - including that of supervision and of taking action before the Court - in sectors which are absolutely crucial to all of us in our everyday lives.
The debate is closed.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to know whether it is possible to have Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty annexed to the minutes of our debate.
We have just heard from the Council that Articles 6 and 7 are confined to a statement of principles.
As you know, Article 6 sets out principles, while Article 7 sets out actions to safeguard those principles.
I believe it would be worth reminding the Council and also my fellow Members of this fact.
We will check whether that is possible in procedural terms.
ESDP operation in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the ESDP operation in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic.
