This is then transferred to the market management system.
This price does not amount to any kind of support for the producer and therefore differs, for example, from the intervention price. Rather, it is a virtual system used to trigger a further imprecise and poorly defined measure.
I refer to private storage.
The latter will not work.
It has not worked for other sectors, and will only aggravate the producer's financial situation. This will in any case be precarious, as the producer will have to bear the consequences of more capital being tied up and also the high costs of maintaining and preserving the product.
I would now like to comment on the special EUR 120 price, that is, the proposed safety net.
Allowing prices to stabilise at around EUR 120 amounts to allowing rice growers to go to the wall.
Public intervention must therefore be retained as a regulatory mechanism with an institutional price guaranteeing competitiveness and self-sufficiency.
Regarding protection at the frontiers, the exchange regime was designed to comply with the unfortunate Marrakech Agreements for this sector.
Consequently, it provides for a system of maximum import prices.
The price of husked cargo rice would therefore not be above 180 or 188% of the intervention price, depending on whether the rice is Indian or Japonica.
This price does not take account of the costs of processing from unhusked to cargo. Further, it results in better quality, more expensive rice being imported into the Community at lower tariffs.
The Commission has called for a mandate from the 15 Member States to allow it to negotiate replacement of the current system of variable import duties with fixed duties, within the World Trade Organisation.
There does not appear to be agreement, however.
The Committee on Agriculture believes it would be wise to do away with the maximum price system that has resulted in the current situation.
It follows that a number of amendments to the report refer to the need to set up appropriate control mechanisms to avoid any irregularities.
Other amendments concern the need to guarantee the origin of imported rice and to avoid social and environmental dumping.
Still others concern preventing social phenomena such as triangulation, and call for strict traceability and labelling procedures to guarantee food safety.
For all these reasons, the Committee on Agriculture feels a report assessing the consequences of tariff reductions further to the Everything But Arms initiative should be prepared as a mater of urgency. Such a report must also take account of our concerns and of the economies of third countries.
Mr President, I have reservations as to whether decoupled payments as proposed by the Commission are appropriate for the specific environmental characteristics of rice growing. I am also concerned that cessation of cultivation might be detrimental to the environment in these areas.
In addition, a proportional penalty system is required, not a progressive one. This is because rice producers are already unfairly penalised in comparison to other producers.
Further, the reference areas must be those predating the reform proposal.
I agree with Mr Cunha's decision in that rice should be a special case, and that it should not be affected by decoupling.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when, at the beginning of this year, the Commission's legislative proposals on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 and the timetable for them were put before us, we were under considerable pressure of time.
Parliament was meant to produce its positions by this week.
The task before us seemed almost beyond our capacities. Few of us dared to believe that we would manage it.
As the rapporteur responsible for the reports on the dairy sector levy and on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, I can say, with a great deal of satisfaction, that we have done it, and done it together.
Cooperation at an early stage across group boundaries, which was our experience particularly with the milk sector, has finally paid off.
From the very outset, I was able, in the drafts of my reports, to take into account the concerns of my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as those of the other groups, which meant that there was a manageable number of amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and that the result that you have before you is coherent and consistent.
Finally, the small number of amendments tabled in the plenary is evidence of general agreement, which was also reflected in the outstanding voting results in the Agriculture Committee.
This is a splendid piece of work, for which I would like to thank most warmly all those Members of this House who have worked with me with this end in mind, showing goodwill, expertise and a willingness to compromise.
I also wish to thank the Committee's secretariat, which was a valued and ever-reliable support to me in my task as it did its coordinating work behind the scenes.
The Commission has presented a package of legislation on the dairy sector, and it is one that we very much welcome, including as it does such measures as the retention of the milk quota up to 2015.
In order, though, to achieve its goal of bringing the dairy sector into line with WTO requirements, the Commission is offering instruments which - taken as a whole - are highly problematic: further price reductions, quotas raised still further, and the decoupling of milk production from milk premiums.
What would be the consequences of such a course of action?
If the massive price reductions were implemented as planned hand in hand with extended quotas, the milk quota system would in fact be nullified.
In particular, small and medium-sized rural dairies in disadvantaged areas would find it practically impossible to cope with the competition, at which point the decoupling of the sector would do the rest, so that milk production would move very rapidly from grassland and disadvantaged areas to what is termed prime land.
The adverse structural, social and environmental consequences in the areas affected could not then be ignored.
In order to make dairy farming in the EU more competitive and more efficient, the Commission is frustrating, by means of its proposals, its own structural and rural development policies.
It makes no sense, though, to destroy today businesses and jobs, especially in disadvantaged, structurally weak areas, whether this be done out of anticipatory obedience to the WTO or, conceivably, for ideological reasons, since we will, tomorrow, have to replace or create anew these jobs, with a great deal of effort and expense to public funds, using rural development programmes to do it?
The need for a gradual transition if such conflicting objectives are to be avoided in this area is therefore plain to see.
With the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, then, I have taken another approach.
We aim to maintain sustainable and extensive production of milk, especially on grassland.
What is clear is that, if dairy farming dies out on grassland and in disadvantaged areas, a great deal of public effort will be needed to maintain the landscape in the state that we all know today, as a valued place in which to relax and go on holiday.
This makes the retention of the milk quota system until 2015 right and vital, and - as we want to make reliable policies - let there be no bringing forward of what was decided under Agenda 2000.
The price reductions decided on in Agenda 2000, some of which have already been implemented, have already given us more room to manoeuvre in the WTO.
This room to manoeuvre was originally to have been made use of in the negotiations.
If the outcome of those negotiations is that further price reductions really are necessary, my reports will give an indication of what further price reductions might be like.
In order to keep the dairy and cereals sectors on a par - at least to some extent - we are calling for a higher level of compensation for price reductions.
The 50 cents proposed are definitely inadequate.
The WTO's argument is irrelevant to the extension of quotas unless the Commission were to have as its declared objective the use of these measures to exert renewed pressure on prices.
No representative of the Commission, though, has put it to me in these terms, so we urge that we meet the quota-hungry Member States halfway on this by introducing a flexible system.
This means a 'yes' to increased quotas, but it must be dependent on the market situation.
We propose that a gradual approach be taken to decoupling. At this point in time, there should be none.
The Agriculture Committee proposes that this be reconsidered in 2008, when experience will have been gained of decoupling, re-coupling, or simplification in other sectors.
We will then be able to have some idea of the likely effects and consequences and fashion the instrument accordingly.
It is important, as regards both the milk reports, that a similarly good voting result should be achieved in the plenary as in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Let us join together in sending a clear signal to the Council and the Commission.
Sustainable land use can take the place of much environmental, social and regional policy.
The European Union is committed to extensive and sustainable agriculture, at the heart of which, in many of Europe's regions, is the dairy industry.
Mr President, Commissioner, last June you presented us with a document on reform of the CAP which established the objectives which this reform should pursue: food quality and safety, the strengthening of rural development and more extensive production methods which are compatible with the environment.
Nobody could oppose these objectives, but today we have to tell you that the instruments you wish to use are not only mistaken, because they are not valid in terms of achieving the proposed objectives, but that, most seriously, they move in the opposite direction.
One of the key elements of your reform - the decoupling of subsidies - may have adverse effects if we do not manage to modify it.
The decoupling proposed to us for certain sectors as an instrument capable of creating a new model for agricultural policy is not viable if you maintain the criterion of historical references in order to set the decoupled aid by farm.
The direct aid, as laid out, corresponds to the logic of the market and is directly linked to quantities produced and the yields allocated.
According to the information that you yourself have provided, in 2001 5% of European farmers received 50% of the direct subsidies.
You cannot ask us to accept the validity of this great imbalance in the distribution of aid in order to support the implementation of a new CAP.
In the herbaceous sector, a model in which you propose total decoupling, 3% of farms receive 40% of the support.
If we work on that basis, if we allow that situation to continue, Commissioner, we would be changing everything so that everything can stay the same.
Please allow me once again to ask you to change the criteria for allocating decoupled aid; use multifunctional criteria in order to establish genuine multifunctional aid by farm.
Agricultural multifunctionality means that agriculture contributes to the maintenance of the rural population, creating jobs. It also helps to preserve the environment, preventing depopulation and desertification of our territory.
You should therefore introduce the criterion of territory, the criterion of agricultural surface area, the criterion of employment generated and of the environmental benefits contributed by the farm and then we will be in a position to talk about genuine multifunctional aid.
Of a genuine decoupling of aid to production, but of a genuine coupling of aid to producers and their farms.
You yourself recognise that this proposed decoupling will create serious problems for many small and medium-sized farms, in less favoured and less productive areas.
If that is the case, change it, Commissioner, because otherwise we will be banishing many of the European Union's small and medium-sized farms from the agricultural system.
Another key element of this reform is modulation.
In June I applauded and supported it.
Let us reinforce rural development by means of significant modulation, transferring funds from the first pillar to the second pillar.
What is now proposed to us following the budgetary Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October - where the Community budget was cut - is that just 6% of the modulation should go to rural development, leaving the rest to fund sectoral reforms in the first pillar.
It is true, as you say, that this is a Council agreement and that the Council therefore has political responsibility for it, as do those people who, like my government, applauded it and who lied to the farmers, telling them that they would guarantee sufficient budget until 2013.
That is not true.
In 2008 there will be problems, as you have acknowledged.
I would ask you to be a little more rebellious, to make a little more effort, if you really believe that rural development has to be strengthened in order to create a more sustainable and fairer CAP.
I say no to a linear modulation, which would mean that the cut in direct aid would affect all farmers equally in order to fund the budgetary gaps in the Brussels agreement.
And I say no to a modulation which is the same regardless of differences between favoured and less favoured areas, and which does not take account of the farmers' incomes.
And I say no to dealing with the person who receives EUR 5 000 in the same way as the person who receives EUR 50 000 or more.
That is not fair, Commissioner.
For all these reasons, I would ask you, please, to show flexibility, not to expel the small and medium-sized farms from the market. Those smaller farms guarantee the viability of a rural framework which take up more than 80% of European rural territory.
This reform, essentially, does not provide cohesion, it does not contribute more social justice to an agricultural policy which is in great need of it.
I would ask you to reflect and to modify this proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Greek Government took over the Council Presidency on 1 January 2003, the reform of the common agricultural policy was one of its focal points.
Thus, negotiations to close this dossier were one of the main objectives of the Greek Presidency, in cooperation of course with the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Our Council discussed the Commission's proposals at its meetings in February, March and April on the basis of the Presidency's questionnaires, which focused on reform issues of particular importance.
The Presidency drew positive conclusions from this procedure and decided to give impetus to the negotiations by creating a High Level Group.
The role of this group was mainly to prepare the crucial summit of Council ministers in June.
The push towards reaching an agreement was reinforced at the Council on 26 and 27 May, when Commissioner Fischler and I met each minister in order to identify basic problems and possible solutions and reach an honest compromise.
Both the Commissioner and I found to our satisfaction that we have the support of the majority of ministers for our timetable.
This majority is convinced that, provided that we achieve the right mixture in the content of the dossier, we shall be able to take decisions before the end of the Greek Presidency, in other words at the June Council.
I should like to point out to Parliament that the Ministers for Agriculture of the 10 new states participated in the tripartite consultations.
The European Parliament is a particularly important factor in the procedure to formulate the future common agricultural policy.
Your resolution in November 2002 on the Commission communication gave the Commission important pointers for the orientation of its legislative proposals.
The opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's legislative proposals for the reform of the CAP is exceptionally important and is awaited by all with keen interest.
I should like at this point to thank all the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and, of course, all the members of the Committee on Agriculture, who managed in such a short space of time to complete their efforts and vote on the truly interesting reports on the Commission's package of proposals.
This consistency on the part of the European Parliament, and especially the Agriculture Committee, will allow the House to give its opinion on the European Commission's proposals in good time, thereby enabling our Council to pursue an honest and sincere compromise.
This compromise will not ignore the European agricultural model based on family holdings or the multifunctionality of agriculture or, of course, the needs of less favoured areas, as confirmed by the European Council in Brussels in October 2002.
Allow me now to refer to the most important issues in our overall endeavour.
The first is decoupling.
This is without doubt the core of reform.
This is what is causing the greatest difficulty in finding a commonly accepted solution.
The approaches to this vary between the Member States, with the consequence that, so far, material reservations have been expressed on a series of individual elements.
One initial issue is the entry into force of the system.
The view expressed by certain members of our Council with so-called partial decoupling is also particularly important.
Although this sort of approach could, in principle, constitute one element of a compromise, we must bear in mind that various interpretations of differing content are given to the term partial decoupling.
There are also Member States who have expressed themselves in favour of the derogation from decoupling for certain products while, on the other hand, other Member States have come out in favour of the integration of more products, in order to avoid competitive phenomena between the productive sectors.
The opinion of the European Parliament on this crucial issue will, I hope, help us find a satisfactory solution.
Second issue: modulation.
Most Member States have expressed reservations as to the franchise level of EUR 5 000 for the derogation from the obligation to gradually reduce support, whereas others wish for an intermediate scale to be provided for, which will allow for the more progressive application of gradual reductions on the larger and more competitive holdings.
Other issues on which the views of the Member States diverge are the need to safeguard small and medium-sized producers, the application of principles of social justice and the wish for more straightforward administration on farm holdings.
We must not forget that the arrangements also aim to save resources, which will be used to fund future reforms of the common organisation of the markets.
In other words, because agricultural resources are specific, any increase in the franchise or any other similar arrangement must not jeopardise either the funding of future reforms in dairy products, sugar or Mediterranean products or the financial ceiling.
The third issue is cross-compliance.
Almost all the Member States take a positive position on this measure in principle.
The problem lies in the fact that this endeavour is considered to involve an excessive administrative and financial cost, which is disproportionately high in relation to the objective pursued.
Consequently, our efforts must tend towards finding ways which will allow demands to be restricted to the absolutely necessary, and making provision for greater flexibility in the Member States, with the possible gradual application of the proposed system.
Ladies and gentlemen, various measures have been proposed within the framework of the Community policy on rural development, in the aim of responding better to the concerns of society as regards environmental protection, compliance with Community standards in the agricultural sector, improving the conditions in which animals are kept and higher food specification standards.
These ideas on the part of the Commission have attracted a great deal of support.
It became clear during the various stages of discussion of the new measures that the reform of the common agricultural policy must be the starting point for simplifying the Community farming development policy.
At sectoral level, the European Commission's proposals need improving so that the Council can adopt them within the framework of an overall package.
Finally, the reform of the common agricultural policy must include specific measures for young farmers, who represent the future of European farming, and specific arrangements for disadvantaged, isolated and problem areas of the European Union currently threatened with abandonment.
I should like now to refer to the financial aspects of the proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy.
Discussions in the Council have focused on the anticipated financial impact of the proposed market measures and the financial aspects of the main elements of the reform proposals from linked payments, gradual reduction and modulation.
The Commission's expenditure forecasts show that the modulation and gradual reduction measures are required in order to safeguard compliance with the financial ceilings set by the summit in Brussels in October 2002.
As the presidency, we shall endeavour to ensure that the solutions adopted are within the framework of the financial frameworks decided for the European Union budget.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, our Council has accepted that the present economic climate is such that we need to go one step further in adjusting the common agricultural policy.
We all need to recognise that the common agricultural policy was never static and that it has always responded to changing circumstances by adjusting existing and creating new means.
These decisions have always been founded on the Community method, which means cooperation between the institutions and compromise between the Member States within the framework of the Council.
Today we are at a crucial stage in the overall process.
With pragmatism and good will, which have always been demonstrated both by the institutions and the Member States, I am optimistic that we shall be able to reach political agreement over coming weeks.
I should like to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Council, like the citizens of Europe, awaits the views of the European Parliament with the keenest interest.
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Bautista Ojeda, Mr Cunha, Mrs Jeggle, Mr Olsson, Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, and Mr Souchet, as well as the proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are, in my view, truly impressive evidence of the commitment with which Parliament intends to tackle the pressing challenges facing European agriculture and the future of the common agricultural policy.
For that, I wish to extend to you all my warmest thanks.
I do think that there is a large degree of unanimity among Parliament, the Commission and the Member States when it comes to analysing the problem and defining our general objectives.
There is no doubt that this consensus is founded on the common denominator of the model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture, the maintenance of which is of prime concern to all of us.
This model is our programme.
If the common agricultural policy is to claim to be sustainable, it must be consistently guided by economic, social and environmental objectives.
If we measure these objectives against the reality, the extent of what still remains to be done becomes apparent.
The social function of agriculture, the general economic framework, the stability of international trade relations, the maintenance of the environment, the preservation of cultural landscapes and, above all, the production of high-quality, safe food - all these things, taken together, are the challenges that we must overcome in the interests of farmers and in the interests of all Europe's other citizens.
It is these factors that underlie the Commission's proposals for reform, which are being debated here today.
We want to adapt market management mechanisms to future conditions of supply and demand, in order to avert crises before they develop.
We want to make direct payments that are compatible with the market and with our international trading obligations.
We have to offer farmers the legitimate expectation of adequate payments and determine the amounts paid in individual cases by reference to historic levels of support.
The expectations of present-day society cannot be ignored; we have to tie the direct payments to criteria measuring the protection of the environment and of animals, the safety of food and safety at work.
We want to facilitate uniformly productive farming and see cultural landscapes preserved by means of agricultural activity rather than through any other kind.
To the instruments of rural development policy, we want to add elements guaranteeing quality and protecting animals.
We are obliged to introduce degression in order to secure finance for new reforms, and modulation can help to develop rural development policy.
Last but not least, we do not want our reforms to lose sight of the need for cohesion.
In listing these elements, I am treading upon the ground that is, to a substantial extent, common to all of us.
I do not want to deny, though, that there are differences - some of them major ones - as regards the assessment of the situation and the choice of the appropriate instruments.
I am of course aware that we still have some way to go before we reach agreement. As the President of the Agriculture Council said, however, this is for us the way forward, both in Parliament and in the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
Looking at the specific elements in the Cunha report, I have to acknowledge that it contains much food for thought, and I also thank Mr Cunha for his clear affirmation of the need for reform.
I, too, am sympathetic to preferential treatment for disadvantaged areas, but I wish neither to repudiate nor to endorse the idea that applying different modulation rates is the most appropriate means of doing so.
There are also reasonable arguments to be adduced in favour of not granting farm income payments for certain vulnerable production sectors such as the keeping of suckler cows, sheep or goats, not least the maintenance of agricultural production in problem areas.
We do, though, have to consider the drawbacks of such a course of action, which includes such things as the market-distorting effect of coupled aid, or the constraints that prevent farmers from doing the most economically sensible thing for their businesses.
There is sound reasoning, too, behind the idea of excluding fruit and vegetables from the land eligible for support, yet we also have to ensure that we do not, overall, go so far as to risk losing the advantages of decoupled aid.
In the Olsson report and the Committee on Agriculture's amendments to it, I admire Members' ambitious visions of the further development of rural areas.
I agree entirely with Mr Olsson that we should all make the effort to avoid the proposals being watered down.
This makes me sceptical about the large number of proposed amendments, and also about their scope.
In my view, programme packages put together on the basis of Regulation 1257 should not be wholly dismantled halfway through the programming period.
I might add that the existing Budget framework does not permit fundamental changes to the amounts and rates of aid.
Ultimately, the Commission also has to take care that the whole package should retain its coherence.
The same can be said of the rules for state aid and the regulations of the Structural Funds.
We should not forget that the great debate on the future of structural policy still lies before us.
When the Commission presents the third cohesion report at the end of this year, it will also be putting forward proposals for the new, post-2006 structural policy.
This brings me to the reports on the market regulations, and I would like to start with the Souchet report on cereals and starch.
We have learned from the experience of recent years that, in Agenda 2000, we took too little account of market development.
Our analysis of long-term prospects gives very clear indications that, without further changes to market support, the EU's cereals producers will be unable to find adequate markets for their produce.
That, at the end of the day, is what counts.
This dilemma is made even more acute by changes in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar.
It is for that reason that we must regrettably cut intervention prices by 5% as scheduled, and stop increasing them on a monthly basis.
As is well known, this still involves a number of specific problems - with rye, for example, intervention stocks of which have increased to 5.3 million tonnes, equivalent to more than the harvest for a normal year.
This state of affairs, already unsustainable, may well get even worse after enlargement in 2004.
Responsibility for these structural surpluses lies primarily with the intervention mechanism, and so we should do away with the problem for good, rather than - as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing - fixing our sights on a partial solution in the form of the introduction of national indicative maximum quantities.
As I see it, there is no alternative to abolishing intervention for rye.
From the point of view of economic principle, the retention of production refunds in the starch sector is no longer necessary, as market prices will correspond to those on the global market.
Any minimum price for starch potatoes are made questionable by measures in the cereals sector, with which it competes.
Moreover, the retention of a 50% coupled premium will provide sufficient economic incentive to grow starch potatoes.
Turning to dried fodder, I would like, in order that the Commission's position be better understood, to remind you of the trenchant criticism levelled at these rules by independent studies and the Court of Auditors' report, on the grounds of adverse effects on the environment.
There is no doubt that the amendments aimed at using aid rules to promote technical progress, in order, in particular, to minimise energy consumption, are of interest, but I ask myself whether it really does make sense to do something of this sort within the framework of market support measures.
Would the rural development programmes not be a better framework for such a scheme?
In view of the social, economic and environmental significance of the rice sector, I have no wish to question the need for a market regulation on rice, but there is no getting away from the need for radical reform, without which, we would end up with enormous intervention stocks, which - quite apart from the resultant cost to the Community budget - we would be unable to sell.
I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development shares this view in principle and supports the essence of the Commission's proposals for dealing with this.
A number of your amendments, such as the increase of import volumes and the obligatory price refund, have my complete support.
As for your other proposals, I support their general tendency, but not the form of words you have chosen.
I am convinced, though, that the guidance you have given me will help with the final negotiations in the Council.
As regards import rules, any change to the bound customs duties on rice would have to be negotiated under Article 28 of GATT.
For that to happen, the Council would, ultimately, have to give the Commission a mandate to conduct negotiations on the subject.
In addition, as I understand it, import duties for rough rice should be checked separately.
If, however, a permanent intervention mechanism for rice were to be retained - albeit only at the level of EUR 150 per tonne - that would prove very expensive.
I do, though, have an open mind as regards testing a standard mechanism at a price level that is compatible with the conditions expected on the markets and that prevents a renewed increase in stocks.
This brings me to the last two reports - Mrs Jeggle's - on market regulation.
I note that the members of the Committee recommend the extension of the rules on milk quotas until 2015, whilst taking a critical view of the bringing forward of price cuts under Agenda 2000 from 2005 to 2004, as well as of other cuts in intervention prices and the limit on the intervention volume for butter.
I am convinced, however, that these steps are needed in order to make the EU's milk sector more competitive.
Being the world's largest exporter of dairy products, we also have to allow developments on global markets, and discussions in the WTO, to influence our decisions.
It is evident that the 1% increase in the milk quota in both 2007 and 2008 is another sensitive issue.
Independent studies have shown that increased consumption means that the markets are able to cope with these additional quantities.
I am therefore convinced that this proposal makes sense.
If, however, you want first to wait for the changes to happen, the Commission will not stand in the way of a discussion on the subject.
I am sceptical, though, about the proposals for granting higher support payments, increasing them in disadvantaged areas, differentiating on the basis of quality standards or fixing prices in line with the costs of labour and production.
I do, however, have an open mind when it comes to the amendments on the position of those who market their goods directly and the consideration of the question of to what extent the Member States might add part of the transferred quotas to their national reserves.
I share the general view of the Committee's members that the milk sector must remain profitable and that producers' incomes must be safeguarded.
I can also assure you that I will give careful consideration to all the proposals you have made.
Finally, let me turn to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' own-initiative report on multifunctional agriculture and reform of the CAP.
You have said, Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, that you cannot bring yourself to oppose the objectives of reform, and that is quite something.
We all want to build up the rural environment, especially in disadvantaged areas, and this is what the budget funds allocated, the use of sustainability as a guiding principle, and the payment of farmers for the performance of social services, are all about.
It goes without saying that we have to apply funds in the most effective way, in the way most suited to the end in mind, but we also have to account to the taxpayer for this.
Our concept of rural development and the use of modulation to strengthen it are tangible steps towards the achievement of the objectives you have set out.
This is a more than adequate reward for agriculture's multifunctional nature.
What you are demanding is a massive redistribution of aid funds, and I cannot agree to it.
I am not convinced that the system would thereby, and automatically, be made more just, but I do understand that we, as a matter of necessity, have to give special consideration to cohesion; that is why we have included an element of cohesion in the choice of the allocation key of the additional rural development resources that will be available in future, and that must be retained.
All in all, I would like to thank you most warmly for all that you have done, and will add that I look forward with eager anticipation to the forthcoming contributions.
I will be happy to reply to your questions at the end of the debate.
.
(ES) Mr President, the European Parliament is debating today what should have been a simple revision of the common agricultural policy, as laid down in Agenda 2000, approved by the Fifteen in March 1999.
However, the debate has a much greater scope as a result of the aspirations of the European Commission, which has wished to impose, without taking account of the will of the Member States and the European Parliament, an in-depth reform of the common agricultural policy, perhaps the greatest in its history.
Furthermore, it has proposed providing itself with prerogatives which do not correspond to it at budgetary level.
This week, Parliament, on the one hand, should show responsibility towards those Community farmers whose investments require a minimum of stability.
And on the other, it should also try to preserve its powers.
I have been draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on this reform, which has given me the opportunity to observe certain accounting contradictions in the European Commission's proposal.
For example, the Commission proposed a modification of the common organisation of the market in the milk sector - which is no more than a reform of the reform already adopted in Agenda 2000 for this product - and the costs of which will rise to EUR 1 500 million in 2013, a figure which coincides in that year with the budgetary deficit which the Commission estimates in its financial record sheet.
Fortunately, in the debates held in Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development the majority of political groups have demonstrated that they are against this reform, the high cost of which is not justified in any way because the provisions adopted in Agenda 2000 have not yet entered into force.
Furthermore, I would like to stress that the decision we adopt today in relation to the reform of the CAP will have repercussions beyond the current financial perspectives, and it is therefore appropriate to take the necessary precautions to prevent a reduction of Parliament's budgetary powers.
Any decision which profoundly modifies the common agricultural policy halfway through Agenda 2000 should be revised within the framework of the next financial perspectives, with the aim of preventing the rash adoption of measures which commit us beyond 2006.
In my opinion, it does not make sense, for example, to establish today, definitively and with closed percentages, funds which will be transferred to category 1 B as from 2006, when we have not taken a decision on the non-obligatory expenses in the agricultural budget for the next financial programming period.
All this would do would be to create dissatisfaction today amongst European farmers, cutting subsidies and not telling them what that money will be used for and how it will be used.
I recognise that the text has been improved in the parliamentary debate, but not sufficiently so.
The important thing is that this text does not guarantee balanced development of European agriculture and livestock breeding, and neither does it guarantee a territorial balance amongst the European rural areas.
And this Parliament should not send unnecessary and discouraging messages to European farmers.
Mr President, the Commission's goals are laudable and certainly comprehensible in a macroeconomic framework, but it is hard to support them.
The Commission advocates greater price competitiveness, but also respect for the demands of society, in other words, sustainability and quality.
We need to ask ourselves how European farmers are going to manage to meet the demands of society, which is calling for extremely rigid rules on production methods, guarantees, food security and so forth, at a time when they are being forced to reduce prices and keep costs down if they are to continue to be competitive on world markets.
The Commission advocates simplification.
In my opinion, an analysis of the proposals reveals that these are complex measures which will increase rather than reduce bureaucracy.
Just one element of the proposals - the system of rights in respect of decoupling - suffices to make it clear by exactly how much bureaucracy will increase costs for our farms.
I hold a pessimistic view - and I sincerely hope I am wrong - which can be broken down into three very simple points.
Firstly, the proposal to reduce prices, together with decoupling, will lead to large-scale abandoning of production in many regions and many sectors, which will speed up structural changes and cause an exodus from rural areas.
In addition to the impact on farms, decoupling will result in the dismantling of the agrifood chain, threatening jobs and having a severe impact on farming cooperatives.
Secondly, the European market will be strongly influenced by the main world exporters, which, in our view, will certainly not be the developing countries.
Thirdly, the only new measures that will be adopted to help farmers implement more stringent rules and safeguard quality will have to be financed by the farmers themselves through cuts in support.
In view of this, I do not know how it is possible to endorse reform.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - something like eight hundred of them - have made plain how controversial the Commission's proposals on the future of the common agricultural policy for Europe are.
The spectrum extends from outright rejection to qualified approval.
Despite that, we have managed to draw up a compromise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was able to adopt; this entailed a feat of strength the like of which has never before been seen, although it must be conceded that this was done under great pressure of time.
This compromise represents, as a German weekly periodical puts it, a respectable staging-post on the road to an agricultural policy that will take us up to 2013.
The imminent WTO negotiations, the soon-to-be-accomplished enlargement of the EU, and a mandate to review Agenda 2000 - these were the constraints upon the Commission when, in January 2003 and at the Council's behest, it presented Parliament with its proposals for its consideration.
If it is the case that, in the reports now being put to the vote in this House, much has been toned down, much added, and a certain amount rejected as currently impracticable, then that has, in the final analysis, happened under pressure from those who work in agriculture, whom it is our function to represent.
Many critics worked on the assumption that, just as opposing views on the proposals were to be found in the Council, it would not be possible, at the present time, for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to come up with a workable solution.
It may be that the Council had been covertly hoping that Parliament - because it was unable to do so or, above all, because of pressure of time - would not come to any decision, so that it would be this House, rather than the Council, that would be able to put the brakes on an agricultural reform that is much needed.
I can tell the Ministers of Agriculture that they are way off the mark.
Whatever the result of Thursday's vote may be, it will not be binding, as agriculture is still not yet subject to codecision, a situation which, it is to be hoped, will soon change.
The result of this vote will, however, send a signal and impose on you, the Council, who are supposed to take final decisions, the duty of finding your own compromises before this Presidency's time is up.
We in Parliament have done our homework, and, speaking on behalf of my group, I can only recommend to the Council that it act in accordance with this House's balanced proposals.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we have gone from an Agenda 2000 mid-term review of the CAP to a reform that will be valid until 2013, in other words for ten years.
It is therefore important that we make no mistakes in our fundamental choices.
With this in mind, Commissioner, you have proposed two major objectives, multifunctionality and competitiveness in agriculture, both in the light of the desire to increase the European Union's room for manoeuvre in WTO negotiations.
On behalf of my group, I would therefore like to support this promotion of a multifunctional agriculture to meet the expectations of our society and underline the adequacy of resources, the conditionality of aids and the strengthening of actions in the second pillar.
I would like to stress, however, that the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, has had the pertinent idea of increasing the modulation of aid rather than adopting your combination of degression and modulation, which is complex, administratively cumbersome and would leave few resources for the rural pillar.
Turning now to the objective of competitiveness which, you say, entails reductions in prices for cereals and milk, I would like to point out that the application of multifunctionality will result in an overall increase in production costs, while at the same time direct aid to holdings will fall in the 15 Member States.
In this context, to follow your recommendations would be unwise, to say the least, especially since it seems to me that the idea of Europe as an agricultural exporter needs to be looked at again to take account of the new market of 450 million consumers that we will shortly be.
You seem, Commissioner, to see the decoupling of aid as a miracle solution, but it would be better if this were done partially and gradually, to put the Union in a better negotiating position at the WTO, but also so that we can make a first-stage appraisal before possibly going further.
My group, the PSE, is proposing an amendment to this effect to increase decoupling to 50% for arable crops and male cattle from the time it is first implemented.
It is a solution that combines boldness with caution and I ask all my fellow Members to support it.
Finally, as it is legitimate to make a better distribution between farmers, crops and regions of the aids intended for holdings, my group fully supports the Cunha report's Amendment No 61.
This amendment in fact recommends that multifunctional credits be allocated according to the criteria of area and employment from 2007.
Over all, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the absence of co-decision I think we have contributed enlightened and well thought-out opinions.
I therefore want to conclude by congratulating Mr Cunha on his excellent report, which is the basis of the debate, and those by the other rapporteurs, who build on it consistently.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I am on this occasion to express an opinion on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
In my previous speech, I spoke mainly on my own behalf as rapporteur.
The difference is, in itself, marginal.
I am all in favour of decentralisation and like to see things done on a small scale, but I want to say to my esteemed fellow MEPs that globalisation is on the way for agriculture too.
It does not help to bury one's head, ostrich-like, in the sand and say that we have not noticed anything and that we do not wish to change anything.
When I listen to my fellow MEPs, I find that many of them are in actual fact behaving like the proverbial ostrich.
What is odd is that, in this Assembly, people appear to be more conservative the further to the left they are.
I should like to make a comment on the Commissioner's view regarding multifunctionality and sustainability.
As those of us in the ELDR Group have said, it is important and a matter of urgency that we should in the long term deregulate agricultural policy, but now it is very important, in the near future, to guarantee aid to a form of agriculture that is multifunctional and sustainable.
That is something with which we agree.
We are trying to change the systems so that we have something to fall back on, the world being as it is.
Mr President, I wish of course to thank everyone for all the work that has been done.
It is fantastic that we coped successfully with all these amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
As representative of my group, I also want to say that we support the compromise in Mr Cunha's report.
We support it because it is in favour of the principle of decoupling.
That is important, and even if we do not go the whole hog, we shall nonetheless make a little progress.
To the President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say that, if now we have taken a decision, I regret that we do not also have the right of co-decision.
I nonetheless think that the Council and the President-in-Office of the Council must make use of the opportunity that does in actual fact exist, not completely to fall in with Parliament but to go a step further.
If you do that, you will in any case serve my, and perhaps also the Commission's, interests rather better.
Mr President, my political group considers the Commission's proposal for the mid-term reform of the common agricultural policy to be unacceptable.
We are dealing with a reform of the CAP which is unprecedented in its scale, which is more a radical reform involving budgetary restrictions in view of enlargement, and the fundamental proposal is to dismantle the organisation of the markets.
It coincides with a greater liberalisation of exchanges, with an increase in US competition, resulting from the increased support stemming from the Farm Bill and, in cases such as rice, from the increase in imports resulting from the application of the Everything but Arms initiative.
The Commission's proposals on the reduction of subsidies and on the reforms of the common organisations of the market will require increasing competitiveness, but this can only mean more intensive production which will increase food safety risks and environmental impact.
Through its proposal, the Commission intends to improve the European Union's negotiating position within the World Trade Organisation, by anticipating supposed demands.
However, in negotiations, to grant prior concessions sometimes leads to double concessions.
The main problem with the Commission's proposal is decoupling.
If it is applied, agricultural activities would cease in the least productive farms and areas.
Faced with lower market prices and subsidies decoupled from production, the farms with less gross margin would decide not to face the production costs.
In areas with lower yields, in addition to agricultural activity, the economic activities linked to it would also disappear, and this would create unprecedented problems in economic, social, environmental and land planning terms.
We cannot expect aid for rural development, with all its restrictions, to compensate for these defects.
In my opinion, decoupling is ethically unacceptable.
It would merely consist of remuneration for ownership of land, and therefore, as well as reducing agricultural activity, would lead to speculation in the land market.
Furthermore, the granting of aid based on the average aid received over the last three years would perpetuate the existing imbalances between farms, sectors and regions.
A CAP based on decoupling would be contrary to cohesion because it would restrict the granting of aid to an historical basis, it would promote inactivity in areas with natural difficulties and would promote inactivity in areas with natural difficulties and concentrate activity in areas with the most intensive agriculture.
It would create problems of depopulation and reduction in economic activity in the least-favoured areas.
Furthermore, decoupling would make land more expensive and promote speculation, creating a dual market of plots with the right to aid and plots without that right.
This would make it difficult for young farmers to establish themselves, creating a delicate situation of generational contrast. It would increase costs and would allow only the largest farms to survive.
However, it would be well received by farms whose owners are close to retirement age, who would see that it was possible to receive aid by reducing activity to a minimum.
In summary, all the negative aspects of the Commission's proposal boil down to a financial problem resulting from the intention to carry out enlargement with no additional budget.
The Commission's proposal would benefit the food industry and distribution, which will be able to increase their profit margins by buying raw materials more cheaply.
It is very unlikely that consumer prices will be reduced, consumers will not benefit and the consequences will be absolutely negative for farmers and for the whole of society.
We cannot reduce the protection of farmers by dismantling borders, demand that they produce food of a high quality and with a high level of food safety, look after the environment and keep the rural fabric alive, without providing them with adequate compensation.
We must provide adequate compensation which stimulates them to carry on with their activities and not to abandon them.
We must rebalance the support given to the different types of farms, sectors and regions.
Society needs active agriculture, with adequate numbers of farmers and farms able to guarantee a balanced management of land, with varied economic activity and products which are safe for the consumer.
But for us, unfortunately, the Commission's proposals move in the completely opposite direction.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term review has nevertheless been quite an adventure and it is no bad thing that we, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have arrived at a possible compromise, which might, it seems to me, satisfy farmers.
We wanted the policy directions to be clear to all and that is why we have given the Cunha report a clear introduction.
For us Greens, the positive aspect of this compromise is that it strengthens rural development.
The thorough grooming proposed today allows European farmers to keep the positive aspects of multifunctionality by strengthening rural development, the system of modulation allowing them to pass from the first to the second pillar.
I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 44 to Article 12.
This proposed modulation uses a territorial criterion for the application of different percentage points, taking account of less-favoured areas.
Indeed, as the rapporteur says in his justification, the objective must be to consolidate the structure of producer organisations.
Moreover, this amendment obliges States to commit themselves to rural development, since they will only get 100% of the EAGGF Guarantee amounts if they commit themselves to obligatory national co-financing.
I am sure that will encourage States to correctly finance all the social, food quality and environmental aspects of rural development.
The territorial farming contracts model introduced by France was an excellent precursor from this point of view.
It should be noted, since it is essential for the future, that Member States may use this modulation to fund their national contribution for the so very necessary establishment of young farmers.
Similarly, States may - and in our opinion must - chose to finance the compensatory payments to less-favoured areas and to areas subject to environmental constraints or agro-environmental measures - all this without affecting the overall amount allocated by the State to the second pillar.
This strengthening of rural development is therefore a step in the right direction for two very good reasons: the first is to consolidate good farming practices, more extensive practices, protecting the health of the consumer, respecting the environment and biodiversity and producing a good social added value; the second is to protect the rural world from the vicissitudes of the aggressive commercial liberalism advocated by the WTO.
Thus, the multifunctional specifics of European agriculture or the exploitation of products specific to a particular region will still be able to be paid for under the second pillar, which affords the best protection for small producers in less-favoured areas.
In addition, there is the difference between the degression of direct payments to fragile areas (6%) and other areas (8%).
If it is to remain meaningful, this strengthening of the second pillar must preserve the milk quotas which have proved their effectiveness in safeguarding mountain stock farming.
We must also protect and consolidate natural pasture land, but more than that we must continue to support the fodder and, more generally, the protein crops necessary for healthy, high-quality stock farming - the alfalfa mentioned by Mr Souchet - and maintain the necessary schemes.
It ought to be possible to grow protein crops on all frozen land since Europe is in deficit in them and growing vegetable protein is also beneficial for the quality of the soil and the environment and for the quality of animal feed.
On the sensitive issue of decoupling, we had to decide between those who supported total decoupling and those who wanted none.
We feel that the compromise of going a step at a time opens up a perspective that everyone can accept.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission's legislative proposal contains elements of reform of the common agricultural policy which we feel give some cause for concern.
Total decoupling, proposed by the Commission, will lead to widespread abandonment of production, particularly in disadvantaged areas or areas classed as marginal, and cannot on its own, in any case, provide an exhaustive response to the need for substantial CAP reform.
Indeed, although it gives us more room for manoeuvre in WTO negotiations, total decoupling of production aid could, in the long term, lead to the dismantling of all market management mechanisms.
We consider reform to be necessary, but it must be carried out with due regard for the goals laid down in the Treaties and for the principles of quality, environmental protection and, above all, employment. With a view to increasing employment, Member States must be given the tangible possibility of making employment a criterion in allocating a quota of the direct aid provided under the first pillar.
In any case, we feel that preserving our farming system and fostering a future of security and dignity for our farmers must continue to be priorities, and we hope that it will be precisely these priorities which will influence any WTO negotiations, not vice versa.
For all these reasons, we believe that gradual, vertical decoupling of aid is possible, with a view to gradually limiting the application of the measure to a few sectors.
It is far too early to extend decoupling to the animal-rearing sector, rice and durum wheat, considering, not least, the definitive nature of the measure.
Then we cannot endorse the proposed differences in aid and we believe that money saved through modulation must be channelled principally into preserving rural development measures which include, not least, support for quality, with no distinction made between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas.
These are the main reasons why we have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of our group, amendments which I hope will be accepted by the House.
We have also, on behalf of the UEN Group, tabled a number of amendments seeking to introduce a more balanced system of aid to the nut sector, a system which, taking into account the different production situations in the Union, establishes a fairer distribution of support between the different Member States and more aid per hectare than was originally proposed by the Commission.
We welcome the introduction of a distinct animal-rearing sector, with the goal of preserving traditional rearing methods and the use thereof in the territory.
We will firmly support all the genuinely important amendments which, like those tabled by our group, seek to establish a system of special benefits for young farmers with a view to facilitating access for new generations to production activities.
Lastly, as regards the dairy sector, we believe that it is desirable to move on from the quota system and that, 20 years on from the adoption of the temporary quota regime, it is now time to bring about an appropriate transition to normal market dynamics through a conclusive process with a reasonably short timeframe.
In any case, we believe that the agreement in principle achieved on the key principles of the reform could serve as a sound basis for the future Council agreement.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have only two minutes to speak so I will get right to the point, and you will no doubt understand, Mr Fischler, that two minutes to tell you everything I think about your proposal, which is, in fact, a complete overhaul of the CAP, is a very short time indeed.
What can we say about the decoupling you are imposing on us?
Even the United States has abandoned the idea.
That should give us some food for thought.
Whether it is total or partial, fixed or degressive, it will result firstly in a divide between farmers and citizens, secondly, in additional administrative burdens, not to mention the audits you have added, and, thirdly, in speculation in land.
What is happening as regards the transfer of rights?
I have now asked you that question three times and you have still not responded.
Perhaps I will be in luck today.
What can we say about the absence of any future prospects not only for our young people but also for our current farmers?
What can we say about your silence regarding Community preference and border protection?
What can we say about the lack of information on the impact of your proposals?
The studies were launched very late in the day.
What can we say about the sprinkling of information you have granted us regarding intermediary areas and less-favoured areas?
What can we say about ecoconditionality and these 38 directives, some of which are the responsibility of the states?
What can we say about the 1 200 amendments that have been tabled?
They are proof that your proposal has not satisfied anyone in spite of the good will of the rapporteurs, which I commend today.
Commissioner, your proposal fills farmers with despair.
You have been utterly deaf to their requests.
They do not need a social worker; they are men and women who simply want to make a decent living from their work and their production.
Mr President, thank you very much for your understanding of my request, and thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament.
As you know, air traffic controllers are currently on strike and the aeroplane on which I have to return to Athens will not be able to take off after 5.30.
I shall try to say a few things in reply to the very accurate comments by all the Members and the rapporteurs and spokesmen.
I can assure you that I have noted all your proposals with particular interest and shall take them into account in the compromise proposal which we shall submit to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture to be held in Luxembourg on 11 and 12 June.
I have noted with particular interest your accurate proposals on the repercussions of full decoupling, especially on small and medium-sized holdings, together of course with the repercussions which full decoupling may have on holdings in remote and disadvantaged areas, which is why I think that the Council will show particular interest in these proposals.
Now as far as modulation is concerned, I should like to assure you that I am taking serious account of the limit proposed by Mr Cunha, which is slightly higher than that proposed by the Commission, but of course this is a matter that will also be discussed at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture.
I shall close on the issue of cross compliance.
I think that all the ministers are calling for greater transparency in the payment of subsidies.
They are calling for the money paid by European taxpayers to be put to good use, as regards the development of farm holdings, the production of quality products, healthy products for European citizens and of course for our customers, and that is why we want payment procedures to be as simple as possible.
With these words, Mr President, I would like to thank you once again for your very courteous treatment. I assure you that the Presidency will take all the measures at its disposal so that an honest and sincere compromise on a new dynamic and efficient European agriculture is reached at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture on 11 and 12 June.
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
I am sure that your colleagues will make sure that you receive brief accounts of the opinions expressed while you were absent from the debate.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure Mr Martinez that I am very proud of Austrian agricultural policy and of what has been achieved in Austrian agriculture and by the farmers and others who live in rural areas.
Let me start by thanking most warmly all the rapporteurs for the work they have done. I would also like to extend the warmest thanks to all the staff of this House and also to those of the Commission.
Without them, it would not have been possible, in this short time, to agree on these compromises, which have met with overwhelming approval in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We all know what close ties bind agriculture to rural areas and to the people who live and work in them, that rural areas are a place of relaxation for our industrialised society, and that they contribute to cultural and biological diversity.
Rural development, then, must be about more than ensuring that food is produced, for the European model of agricultural policy, which is committed to extensive and multifunctional agriculture, makes great demands of us.
The first pillar, which governs the organisation of markets and delivers production incentives, is closely connected with the second, which contains the policies on agricultural structures and rural development.
It is therefore of fundamental importance that these two instruments should be kept in constant balance and harmony with each other, rather than being applied counter-productively.
Objectives and means for rural areas can be worked out centrally, but they must take effect on a regional basis.
Europe's rural areas are very diverse and have different characteristics, advantages and also problems.
This means that, in many areas, the rural development programme very much needs, as an instrument, to bear the stamp of the regions to which it applies.
There is, in addition, a need for the regions to be fundamentally motivated and involved.
Although the Commission proposal and the report represent two important steps in the right direction, I do believe that it would be desirable for the second pillar to be strengthened to an even more marked degree and for rural areas thus to be developed in a sustainable way.
I can see no comprehensible explanation of why the redefinition of objective criteria that the report calls for is necessary; I think the definition is perfectly adequate already.
Integrated rural development must not be restricted solely to agricultural structures, for the maintenance and the functioning of rural areas are dependent on a functioning infrastructure being in place.
The utmost care must also be taken with the distribution of funds, as, when supporting the infrastructures of other, new, businesses, care must be taken to ensure that funds from the EAGGF are allocated only to farmers.
Let me conclude by saying that extensive and sustainable agriculture is the guarantee that production will go on in every region.
For example, an Austrian farmer safeguards three jobs both up- and downstream, and we know too that, as enlargement progresses, agriculture will not exhaust the EU's budget resources; on the contrary, regional policy has need of many more of them.
(Restrained applause)
Mr President, I would like to speak principally on the report by Mr Cunha.
As regards the other reports, I want to mention only the question of intervention in rye, which the Commission proposes should be done away with and not replaced.
I therefore support the proposal on intervention in the form in which we modified it in the Souchet report in the Committee.
There must continue in future to be the possibility of compensation for certain specified sites, the natural characteristics of which allow only a limited number of economic alternatives.
Let me turn, though, to the Cunha report, which I wholeheartedly endorse.
It incorporates elements that we social democrats have repeatedly called for, such as the requirement for both modulation and cross-compliance, as well as aspects related to the protection of animals.
The preamble inserted before Article 1 reflects this House's priorities: a secure income for farmers along with support for environmental protection and employment in rural areas.
What I see as important in this is that Parliament is strongly advocating that a start be made on decoupling aid from production; in the text voted on by the Committee, though, this affirmation is still very muted and vague.
This, in my view, is where we have to choose a form of words that clarifies what we are calling for.
It is for this reason that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled amendments providing for decoupling to start, in 2005, at 50% and, following the presentation of a report from the Commission in 2007, for it to rise progressively and be extended to other sectors.
This is especially important, as, in the compromise motions, we have agreed on the partial decoupling of only two sectors.
Much as we should, certainly, welcome this introduction of decoupling, we should not lose sight of the longer-term perspective.
So I hope that the Group of the Party of European Socialists' Amendments Nos 126 and 127 will be endorsed, as these amendments will enable Parliament to send the Council a more emphatic message.
Let me conclude by addressing yet another important aspect, that of renewable raw materials.
These offer farmers in many regions great potential for viable alternative crops while, at the same time, having a positive effect on the environment.
The possibility that our amendment - in contrast to the Commission proposal - will continue to enable set aside areas to be used for cultivating renewable raw materials is one that I very much welcome.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have in our hands a huge programme of reform, one that right now is unavoidable.
Our committee has, in a spirit of positive cooperation, drafted a large number of amendments to the Commission proposal.
These amendments will serve to hone the reform to make one that is good for the farmer.
As the lower limit for modulation is being raised to EUR 7 500 and less-favoured areas are being treated with special care, agriculture in the Union will also be able to continue in the poorest regions: in the north, in the south and in mountain areas.
Unfavourable conditions must be taken into consideration when distributing funds earmarked for rural development, and for that reason my group has tabled an amendment proposing that the number of LFA areas be added to the criteria for distribution.
We should not race ahead in the matter of milk production if the market situation does not demand it.
We must remember that milk production is of particular importance in the less-favoured areas, and in those areas reduced prices can be a serious threat to motivation with respect to production.
Commissioner, in Finland rye is very special.
Very high quality rye is used there in the production of functional foods.
The Commission should also take such special circumstances as these into consideration.
For us rye is not just a mediocre crop used as fodder, but an appetising daily breakfast food and a staple in our traditional food culture.
Mr President, the rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development have had a hard job positively revising the Commission proposals for reform of the Agricultural Policy, which are ill thought-out and unreasonable.
I refer specifically to complex cereals, dried fodder, milk, and also to reductions in defence of the gradual decrease and the full decoupling of direct payments.
Particularly in respect of enlargement, it is a positive thing that the majority of the committee are behind my proposal to allow, with regard to rye, a time-limited intervention for locations where there is no alternative to its cultivation.
All in all, however, I am dissatisfied, in particular as the pressure of time was so great that the assembly-line voting did not produce a conclusive result.
Furthermore, I consider it wrong in principle that the majority show such unwavering solidarity with the Commission on the road to decoupling and total liberalisation.
I want to state clearly that, for me, the issue is not about a primitive autarky, but an agricultural policy whose priority is orientation towards the internal market offering ever greater opportunities for regularisation.
Exports should be limited to finished agricultural products and imports subject to special external protection which does not hinder developing countries, and at the same time does not prevent access to the market for cheap goods from large non-multifunctional agricultural export countries, such as the USA and the Cairns Group.
Without these conditions there can be no sustained universal multifunctional agriculture in the European Union.
We should all be clear about this.
In conclusion I would like to mention two further important reasons for rejecting the Cunha report.
Firstly I am opposed to modulation funds being a sort of second Cohesion Fund.
These funds should be used in the interests of rural development in each Member State.
Secondly I consider it wrong that decoupling is being prematurely implemented.
It is therefore obvious that a regionalised land premium is far more progressive.
The proposal from Mr Cunha, however, will be almost impossible to carry through.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament has demonstrated that it is willing to shoulder its responsibilities.
I hope that the Convention now adopts both the form and content of what has been jointly decided, and that not too many exemptions will be placed before the Council.
I could understand it if exemptions for all decisions were to find their way to the Commission, but Parliament must be involved in all decisions.
The work before us has not always been easy.
The analysis has been good, new perspectives have been gained, which are reflected in our preamble, but implementation has been somewhat difficult.
With regard to the audit process, for example, we demand that business consultancy is introduced; this has been taken to mean that we want to tie the hands of businesses.
Let us consider qualified external protection, which should guarantee multifunctionality; the Commission gave this too little publicity.
A crucial error has also been made with regard to differentiated modulation and re-designation in the second pillar, in that, firstly, too little money is being moved and, secondly, clearly it is not meant to be decoupled in the second pillar, which thus acts as a balancing mechanism for difficult or at-risk types of farming.
Proposals for decoupling - to which I will return later - should have been made immediately.
The issue is not, for example, support for the rye sector as a whole, but for certain specific types of crops in certain regions, and this is exactly what can happen in the second pillar.
Furthermore, no proposals were submitted for abandoning intervention and export subsidisation.
Whereas with milk you have gone down the same old road, you have proved, with regard to rye, just how brutal reform can be.
Both were ill-conceived and an integrated abandonment to a set timescale with quantitative limitations but no more price reductions should be considered.
Decoupling is also a complicated area.
Many have not understood it; many have understood it and made use of it for their own purposes.
You have once again completely undermined the possibility of greater freedom in price setting in respect of subsidies by immediately backing down when the starch potato industry says, 'but then we'll get no more raw materials'.
The reason why these raw materials will no longer be available should have been discussed more thoroughly and questioned more aggressively.
Why does the milk industry fear that decoupling the milk premium will mean certain areas falling by the wayside?
If everyone is now saying that milk production in these deprived areas ought to be safeguarded - and has it now been? - the funds remain the same.
If this had been better publicised, the associations working in the interests of these industries would have had less opportunity to cause trouble.
Finally, the second pillar must become the core component of agricultural reform.
Even here the Commission is very restrained and cautious.
Possibly you thought there are not enough funds available and the instruments have not been assembled, but this too is an omission on the part of the Commission.
I hope that, this autumn, there will be a debate between Parliament and the Commission so we can really flesh out the contents of the second pillar and then make it clear that it can and must be a core component of decoupling.
Mr President, Commission proposals for a mid-term reform of the common agricultural policy have led to a very difficult debate.
The tabling of 1 200 amendments represents a serious divergence of views within Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Attempts by the Commission to introduce premature - and in the case of milk - unnecessary reform, have contributed to insecurity and unease among farmers.
Our immediate objective must be to restore farmer confidence in the political process and to safeguard the integrity of the common agricultural policy, outside of which EU agriculture will not survive.
In the time available it is not possible to evaluate the proposals other than to say that the status quo is not an option, the bottom line must be a sustainable profit margin for farmers, and we need assurances that, whatever the outcome, they are fully protected in the context of the WTO talks.
While there appears to be some consensus emerging on decoupling, I have reservations about the long-term implications for a commercially focused EU agriculture.
I pose the question, and not for the first time, what happens following decoupling if the projected price increase in the market place does not materialise?
Mr President, EU agricultural aid discriminates against the developing countries, the acceding EU Member States, the environment and ecological interests.
The large intensive farms receive the most aid, leading to environmental damage and reduced animal welfare.
In the set-aside scheme, which promotes the cultivation of marginal land, farmers are paid for doing nothing.
The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods.
Reform of EU agricultural aid is therefore more necessary than ever.
The June Movement believes that the only real way forward is to abolish discrimination by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely.
The cutbacks must be organised in such a way as to create equal conditions for both conventional and organic farms.
This can be achieved by stipulating that no more than 70% of the aid is to go to the actual acreage, a target that can be reached by removing the higher amount of aid for protein crops and by promoting extensification by setting an upper limit of 0.5 units of livestock per hectare.
This means that the set-aside aid and the additional measures can in this way also be done away with.
The cutbacks must restrict the artificial structural development whereby the large intensive farms receive the largest amount of aid.
This can be done by having the aid relate to upper limits of 150 hectares and 75 units of livestock.
The cutbacks must also create better conditions for livestock.
This can be done by phasing out the aid for skimmed-milk powder from factory calves, as well as by phasing out the aid for the horrendous export of live animals to third countries.
Better conditions for the developing counties can be created by phasing out sugar aid and direct aid for exports.
Finally, the EU countries must be placed on an equal footing.
Instead of increasing aid by 100% for the new countries in 2013, the old countries should receive 25% less aid in 2013.
Commissioner, you are right when you say that we are discussing reforming the CAP at last, but your reform is not the kind of reform we need, still less so if we call for its impact to be reduced, as Parliament seems to be doing.
Your reform does not get to the heart of the CAP issue, which is the scandalous fact that the European Union is continuing and intends to continue in the future to tie up half its budget in subsidies and agricultural protection in order to protect a sector which represents 2% of the European Union's GDP.
We constantly talk about the Lisbon objectives, about making the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
How do we think that this objective can be in any way achievable when half of our budget is being used to protect and subsidise agricultural production?
CAP reform cannot be based on the interests of farmers; the focus must be on the interests of the European Union, on the interests of all the citizens and all the consumers who are paying 70% more for milk than they would on an open market free of subsidies; who are paying 220% more for meat while their Argentine cousins are starving to death or, if not dying, are suffering the effects of an economic recession because we are preventing them from exporting their meat to Europe; who are paying 90% more for sugar while Mozambique is unable to achieve economic recovery because of European protectionism.
The example of New Zealand is significant, although it is a small country. After the total elimination of subsidies and agricultural protection, the contribution of farming to GDP rose, employment rose, particularly among young farmers, and quality improved.
Even if we talk about protecting the environment and marginal and mountainous areas, if we continue to call for half of the Community budget to be channelled into protecting and subsidising the production and export of European farm products regardless then that is something else altogether.
We are denying ourselves the chance of reaching an agreement on the major WTO trade agreements and, most importantly, we are continuing to harm the European citizens, consumers and taxpayers.
This is the truth, and reform seeking to dismantle the CAP must be placed on the agenda as soon as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first make a small, general observation.
At this point, I would like to express our particular thanks to the ladies and gentlemen of the Committee secretariat, to our staff and the staff in the Parliamentary groups.
All have been under enormous pressure of time.
In particular I must thank the rapporteur with dual responsibility for cereals and dried fodder, our French colleague, Mr Dominique Souchet, for his two sound and, from a practical point of view, balanced reports, and above all, for the truly remarkable and transparent cooperation and close coordination across group boundaries, right from the start.
This is not always the case in this House.
We in this House - and we really should see this - consider ourselves the chosen representatives of the public and understand the individual working situation more precisely and also much more clearly than others - even including the Commission.
Now, briefly, let me turn to the report by Mr Souchet on the subject of cereals.
We consider the proposed reduction in the intervention price unnecessary.
Ten years of continuous intervention price reductions have left it almost at the level of the world market price. Even the additional monthly charges - Commissioner, I know I said 'yes, but' - ultimately help towards better distribution over the year.
Of course there have been many suggestions here today - for which we are grateful - regarding the proposed situation in the rye sector.
Amendment No 28 - I mention this amendment in particular - also contains a measure to limit surplus.
It provides opportunities for increased consumption at various levels on the one hand, and the restriction of rye cultivation to limited farm locations - as Mrs Fiebiger has already pointed out, this is by and large where the heart of the matter lies.
Regarding potato starch, which is of course regulated by the cereal market organisation, we envisage the fundamental retention of production refunds.
Nevertheless we will get a decoupling or a step-by-step partial decoupling of cereals.
With regard to the report on dried fodder, Commissioner, I find the total abolition of the dried fodder regulation incomprehensible.
For many of our grassland farms the cooperative drying plants maintained by farmers are a valuable means of support, which make an important contribution to the supply of mineral-rich fodder.
As Mr Goepel has already pointed out, we have all seen the danger that discussion of this reform is happening too close to WTO issues, and also to the discussion on the future structure of the enlarged EU.
In actual fact the current discussion and this conclusion are vital.
We have shown that we have carried out our responsibilities regarding co-determination.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am taking as a starting point the fact that there was absolutely no guarantee that we would reach the vote in plenary.
We are here because of a sensible decision made by the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has displayed great commitment and has adopted a method capable of dealing with over 1000 amendments and achieving a reasonable balance in its proposals overall.
Precisely because of this ability, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow in the House, I am sure that the Commissioner and the Council will pay greater attention to Parliament's work.
I consider the reports to be well-balanced, particularly Mr Cunha's report.
We have emphasised the need for reform, and to those who oppose reform with various arguments I would simply say that blocking reform will not protect the CAP - it will ultimately divest it of social legitimacy.
We have therefore concentrated on introducing useful amendments to avoid the risk of decoupled aid, which would become support measures or lead to the abandonment of production.
We consider partial decoupling to be the right way forward.
Lastly, I would like, if I may, to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Commissioner to the decision we have made to maintain support for durum wheat unchanged, and I hope that there will be particular focus on the expiring COMs as well as on this package - oil, tobacco, fruit and vegetables - so that we avoid using the savings made through the decisions we are about to take for some sectors and not others, in other words solely for milk and sugar, thus avoiding exacerbating imbalances between producer countries.
Mr President, I too should like to thank all the rapporteurs.
With regard to decoupling, I also support the Commission proposals to a large extent, but there are exceptions to every rule, of which I should like to mention two.
It should not be the case that agricultural products such as vegetables, fruit, flowers, and so on, which were not subsidised in the past, should now be subsidised indirectly.
In my view, an exception should therefore be provided for in the regulation.
The second exception should apply to potato starch.
To my mind, the 50% decoupling, as proposed by the Commission, is not sufficient and should remain at 75% in order to avoid as unacceptable social consequences.
I too am in favour of making the payment of premiums dependent on the observance of environmental requirements, but what are these?
They are very vague.
If every Member State were to observe the nitrate directive, agricultural policy would become very simple, but, as thirteen of the fifteen Member States do not observe the environmental requirements, we should prescribe clearer parameters.

I would like to make a third remark with regard to the budget in general.
I do not know what the costs are of the reports on which we are about to vote, but the current proposals mean that the budget is already extremely tight as it is.
What will the Commission do when reform proposals are tabled for sugar, for vegetables and fruit, for olive oil and for tobacco?
Can we then look forward to other reductions, other degression standards?
This is the question I should like to put to the Commission.
Mr President, the Commission's recent proposals on the reform of the CAP do not simply recommend a mid-term, corrective review, but give the coup de grace to small and medium-sized farming, reducing the quality and competitiveness of agricultural produce and destroying the environment.
With harsh, forcible measures, which none of the reports we are debating revokes; rather they gild their destructive logic with anodyne amendments on individual issues, Community farming is being brought into line with conditions on the so-called globalised market and farmers are being turned on Mr Fischler's 'because I say so' from producers into businessmen, as he is wont to say; in other words they are prey to the laws of the market, importers and multinationals in the foodstuffs industry.
Decoupling subsidies from production and paying direct income support, modulation with the gradual reduction and degression of support over and above EUR 5 000 per holding and making aid conditional on strict compliance with environmental standards, so-called cross compliance, are turning the already disastrous CAP into a mechanism for wiping out farmers, with radical changes to the productive map of the countryside.
Mr Cunha's analgesic proposals such as, for example, the partial decoupling method, in other words making decoupling gradual rather than universal, with fewer products in the first year instead of all products, revoke none of the above and, on a medium-term basis, they will have the same catastrophic results on the rural economy.
The objective of the reform of the CAP is to save resources from agriculture for other policies - EMU, CFSP and others - and to orientate farming to the market on terms of unadulterated competition, with no social, development or environmental criteria, as required by the mechanisms of the WHO and pressure from the USA.
The reference to environmental protection, which is repeated throughout, is being used as an alibi to reduce agricultural production.
A typical example of this hypocrisy is in the giving way to pressure from the USA for the release and use of genetically-modified organisms, with unforeseeable adverse repercussions on the environment and public health.
The famous multifunctionality of agriculture, with resources being reallocated to the second pillar for supposed rural development, is nothing more than a very poor pretext to conceal the pursued objective of marginalising the rural world and changing its social and environmental role.
The implementation of these proposals leaves no margin to develop the rural economy, leads to the forcible readjustment of holdings, the disappearance of small-scale cultivation, and an increase in tenant farmers both in the new Member States and in the existing Member States, increases the profits of the multinationals and reinforces and consolidates the plundering of developing countries and their peoples.
Not only do Parliament's reports fail to get their act together and move away from the Commission's disastrous policy; on the contrary, they add fuel to its fire.
As the farmers are fighting not to embellish but to overturn anti-farming reforms, we shall vote against these proposals.
We take the farmers' side and support them in their proactive fight, which is the only way to secure their survival and protect the quality of products, the consumer and the environment.
Mr President, in this Parliament we have discussed the CAP often, and at length.
I hope this time we shall achieve some conclusive results.
I am sure I speak on behalf of the whole farming community in that regard.
I come from a country, Wales, where the per annum income of some of our farmers, especially in the less-favoured areas, 80% of our nation, is as low now as EUR 6 000.
This is at a time when the large supermarkets receiving their products are recording their best profits ever.
Such a situation is totally unsustainable.
The plethora of amendments to the reports highlight the conflicting viewpoints on this very emotive issue.
We must avoid a situation where a small number of the large Member States dictates the future shape of European agriculture at the expense of a more representative and democratic decision.
The lesser regions and nations in the European Union, with endemic problems of the exodus of young people from rural communities, small family farms and less-favoured areas, should also be involved in the important decisions taking place.
The general swing now towards partial decoupling weakens what could have been a bold move on the Commission's part.
It could at least have provided the mechanism for Member States, and importantly the nations and regions within them, to target support at their own priorities through national envelopes.
To this end, as has been mentioned by other Members, democratic representation of regions in the Council of Ministers is vital, as well as codecision for the Committee on Agriculture.
My problem with a mixture of the current livestock support schemes and the new decoupling scheme is that it would result in an uneven playing field for many sectors and bring increased bureaucracy and more barriers for producers aiming to focus on the market.
If this means people having to leave small family farms in less productive areas to find work, it risks undermining the very foundations on which these rural communities are built.
I know this is a scenario that the Commissioner will be keen to avoid.
Having discussed this topic extensively with Welsh farmers, I find that what they undoubtedly want is simpler, more market-focused policies to help farms return to profitability.
Mr President, Commissioner, if an instrument overshoots its goal, you need to adjust it, but the goal needs to be the right one.
Commissioner Fischler proposes decoupling aid and production.
He has given up the fight for the European agricultural model within the WTO before it has even started.
That way, he is overshooting the goal.
Complete decoupling may well serve the cause of trade liberalisation, but it does not serve the European agricultural policy.
On other continents, decoupling as an instrument has failed.
Should we repeat this mistake?
Mr Cunha is right to draw our attention to the great difference between economic theory, which is probably very rational, and practical application, which brings with it many risks.
European farmers should not again fall victim to economic experiments devised at drawing boards in Brussels.
Decoupling does not work in places where there are no stable internal markets.
The Commission's plans lack any measures to promote stability.
I would, for example, mention protection at the borders against great fluctuations in the world market price and regulation of production on the internal market.
To be sure, I too would welcome an end to the intervention regime and export subsidies; not, however, via a structural reduction in prices but by restricting production.
Rural policy stresses the multifunctionality of agriculture in the European Union.
This is why a substantial proportion of the proposed modulation should reinforce this second pillar.
As is evident from my amendment, it is only fair that the Member State that makes the saving should be able to use these monies for rural development within its borders.
Mr President, by agreeing, although with a number of reservations, to back the decoupling line proposed by the European Commission, the Cunha report is asking us to take a step in the wrong direction.
Why?
It is a step in the wrong direction because decoupling, by introducing a radical divide between farmers' wages and production, would transform direct payments into income linked to the land, of a set amount, comprising a sort of negative tax that is hard to justify in the eyes of the public and taxpayers, increasing the price of land in an inappropriate and uneconomical manner, and thus making it more difficult for young people to become farmers and establish themselves.
Decoupling would also have negative consequences for the regional localisation of crops and would therefore encourage relocation rather than land-use planning.
The declared aim of decoupling is to promote our negotiating position in the WTO, but it is hard to see how the announcement of a reform before the negotiations could give us any more weight.
Finally, by doing away with all links between production and State aid, we are forgoing any market guidance and control measures, which are the basis for all of our COMs.
We must therefore abandon this crazy, pointless idea of decoupling.
Total decoupling would be a total mistake and partial decoupling would be a partial mistake.
Partial decoupling would be an incomprehensible compromise, a bureaucratic monster and an unsustainable system.
It would make the CAP, which must be simplified as soon as possible, even more complex.
It would create a new cursor, that of the decoupling rate, and many hands would ensure that this moved towards total decoupling, to the detriment of our agriculture, our independence and our food security.
Mr President, the key elements of this reform are decoupling and modulation; the two measures combined are going to have a very considerable impact on the development of the least-favoured areas and that worries us.
According to the studies carried out, in my country we could see the abandonment of one million and a half hectares of cereals, half of which are in my region, Castilla-La Mancha, one of the regions with the lowest yields in the European Union.
The total decoupling of aid seems to me to be a hasty decision, particularly in view of the precedent of the United States, which introduced this measure in 1996. The measure is costing the US billions of dollars in emergency aid to alleviate the losses to farmers.
Furthermore, the European Commission has not yet clarified to this Parliament what the functioning of the complicated system of rights it has conceived of would be.
The excuse used is the negotiations with the WTO, but a modest partial decoupling would be sufficient to provide the room for manoeuvre in those negotiations.
We agree on the need to strengthen rural development, but European farmers will never understand any cut which does not benefit that development.
Therefore, the reduction in subsidies proposed by the Commission in order to deal with other financial needs should be eliminated.
Furthermore, it does not make any sense to adopt decisions today on the basis of calculations and estimates which could vary over the next few years.
With regard to the rice sector, it should be said that this sector is the main loser from this reform.
The production in the intervention price of 50%, as proposed by the Commission, without full compensation, in addition to the repercussions of the Everything but Arms Agreement, will jeopardise Community production.
While we must support the commitments made by the European Union to those countries, it is also necessary to find a solution for many countries of Europe.
The current common organisation of the market in rice contains perverse elements, particularly the system of penalties for exceeding the maximum guaranteed areas.
In the rice sector those penalties are exponential, which could lead to penalties of up to 50%, for an excess of just 8%, in contrast to the cereals sector, in which penalties are proportional to the excess.
I believe that resolving this and establishing aid which compensates fully for the reduction in the guaranteed price are two of the things that the rice sector is demanding of this Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and they must be taken into account.
I would like to reiterate my full support for the report by Mr Bautista, which furthermore urges the Council of Ministers of the European Union to adopt the Commission's proposal to negotiate a fixed tariff within the World Trade Organisation.
And I would also like naturally to congratulate all the rapporteurs who have been involved in this series of reports.
Mr President, for me - not a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - it is quite extraordinary that the effect of these proposals on developing country producers and markets has barely received any attention in this debate.
Therefore, my contribution may seem somewhat esoteric in the context of what I have been hearing this afternoon.
How can this major issue, which is a key issue for Cancun, and its implications for developing countries have been so marginalised here in the debate?
As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I can confirm, of course, that European agricultural policies are currently in direct contradiction with the EU's declared rural development policies for developing countries.
The debate, therefore, should and must reflect the need to assess the impact of these reforms on the EU's declared poverty eradication objectives and our sustainable development objectives for the world's poorest countries.
Farm subsidies cost those poor countries about USD 50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports.
Today we had the G8's very weak statement on trade and reform.
We expected at least a moratorium on export subsidies and an end to those domestic supports which to me and to many others are simply hidden subsidies.
Let us not only assess what is perceived to be best for European farmers and producers, let us at last and at least look as if we are prepared in our deliberations to consider the people on much poorer continents than our own.
I urge the Committee on Agriculture and others who quite rightly care about European citizens and farmers to take a much broader view of the context of agriculture in the world.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, if I may, to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work.
I would stress that, overall, we can only support the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, given the financial constraints which we have imposed on ourselves until 2013 and considering, not least, the new challenges posed by enlargement. However, we do have a number of concerns.
Firstly, we do not know the proposals for all the sectors and so we do not have an overall picture. Secondly, once the principle of decoupling has been endorsed, the Commission is free to apply it as it wishes.
We must therefore endeavour, first and foremost, to reassure our farmers.
I therefore call upon the Council to regulate this mechanism as rigorously as possible, safeguarding the different areas of production and, above all, farmers' incomes.
Another part of the Commission's proposal which causes me great concern is the employment incentive.
The July proposal referred to the criterion of working units: this criterion disappeared subsequently and we have attempted to reincorporate it through amendments, for we consider it to be necessary.
The danger that the transferral of aid from production to income will not encourage working of the fields may be partially averted by this decision.
We must therefore put all possible effort into these areas of reform, and also into quality, for in promoting quality we will be equipping our agriculture to compete on the markets.
Mr President, the Commission's proposals are not in the interests of farming and could have serious consequences for family-based farming and for small and medium-sized farmers, unless some of their basic assumptions are revised.
Instead of correcting the present imbalances in the distribution of aid amongst countries, areas of production and producers and instead of paying particular attention to the specific characteristics of countries such as Portugal, the intention is basically to ensure that the Community budget under the enlargement process is frozen and to take a step further towards liberalising the farm sector at world level, with a view to the forthcoming negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.
One of the policy's fundamental principles is to establish aid on the basis of historical reference criteria from recent years and to ensure its decoupling from production, which primarily benefits the large producers and the countries with the most advanced forms of farming and condemns the producers that lag behind, the small-scale and family farmers, to their current situation.
Consequently, in addition to speeding up the process of concentrating production and land, this will set in stone the current inequalities in aid distribution in which Portugal suffers greatly, and encourage absentee land ownership and speculation on the market in farmland. It will promote unfair competition between the forms of productions entitled to aid and those that are not and create further hurdles to entering the sector, particularly for young farmers.
We cannot accept this being converted from a policy of support for production to a policy of social handouts.
The CAP reform that we want to see is quite different and we regret the fact that the opportunity provided by this mid-term review to establish such a reform has not been taken.
Some of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are to be welcomed but most of them are not.
One of the most worrying is the report by Arlindo Cunha, which is dangerously similar to Commissioner Franz Fischler's proposal.
In fact, it not only fails to put forward a genuine proposal for modulation, it also accepts decoupling aid from production for some payments for arable crops and bovines.
What is required is for instruments to regulate the market to be promoted, guaranteeing the maintenance of a price that is fair and that compensates for farm production, for the principle of Community preference to be guaranteed in order to protect the internal market, and for consumer safety and food sovereignty to be promoted, taking account of Portugal's conditions and specific characteristics.
We shall continue to fight to achieve these aims.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to use my speaking time to call for a reform of the CAP that does not again overlook those regions of the Union that have climatic and environmental conditions and farming traditions that are particularly appropriate to multifunctional rural development.
These are regions whose farming consists of small and medium-sized family holdings, based on land and pastures, regions that have considerable milk-producing capacity and which, because they did not have the necessary milk quota when they joined the Community, have undergone a Malthusian modernisation, which has led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of holdings.
Today, these regions receive practically no production subsidies, which means that they would not receive decoupled aid either.
They form part of States where there is an enormous deficit between milk consumption and production.
I am talking about Galicia, but I am not only referring to my own country; I am talking about countries that need their milk quota to be increased, countries that could provide for their internal markets without calling European balances into question.
I hope that these are not ignored once again in this reform of the CAP.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, you are called upon to give your opinion on the various draft reports on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
I will not talk about the substance but, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot ignore the comments, not to say the criticisms, some of you will be tempted to make as regards the procedure chosen for the adoption of these various reports.
Unfortunately, we were pressed for time and I am the first to regret this.
The goal of the Council presidency was to have Parliament's opinion by the end of June.
The time we were allotted was very short.
However, we have chosen to respond to this request so that it cannot be said that the principle of consulting the European Parliament merely causes delays in the discussions underway.
In fact, at a time when the debate on the development of the European institutions is considering precisely the competence of our House, any delay in the consultation procedure could have been interpreted as a sign that Members were incapable of dealing with an issue head-on and giving their opinion within the allotted timeframes.
That is why, in the Committee on Agriculture, we adopted a procedure that made it possible to respect both the timetable set for us by the Council presidency, which is keen to move this issue forward, and the right of expression and of amendment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture.
We achieved this as a result of the remarkable work of the committee staff, and also the coordinators.
I felt it was necessary, Mr President, to explain why we adopted a working method dictated by the urgency of the situation and increased the pace of the work, whilst respecting our fellow Members' right of expression.
As far as I am concerned, it is the result of a compromise achieved through the desire of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to preserve the key provisions on the management of agricultural markets laid down by the common agricultural policy, whilst allowing us to move towards a form of agriculture that gives greater consideration to the general interest.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must now take the right decisions to guarantee a decent income and a future for our farming families.
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall begin by expressing my deep disappointment with this reform of the common agricultural policy and I wish to challenge your conscience, Commissioner, with the injustices and the discrimination that your policy is perpetrating against farmers and also with regard to the way in which you are protecting desertification and damaging the credibility of the Union itself.
Let us look at the injustices: you are responsible, Commissioner, for around seven million farmers in the Community.
Only three-and-a-half million are entitled to direct aid - only three-and-a-half million. Of these three-and-a-half million farmers, 52% receive only 4.5% of the aid.
Is this or is this not a profound injustice?
In my own country, one hundred farmers - the one hundred largest - receive more than 60% of farmers in my country do.
I challenge your conscience with this injustice.
Next, Commissioner, your policy is discriminatory!
Two areas of production, cereals and bovines, which between them account for 21% of Community production, receive 60% of aid; I repeat, 21% of production receives 60% of all aid.
I call that discriminatory, Commissioner!
It is all the more discriminatory because these two areas of production are those most responsible for desertification.
By not opposing this policy, Commissioner, you have contributed to the enormous increase in unemployment throughout the Union, because the only winner is something that causes unemployment and not the areas of production that actually employ people.
The third issue concerns the damage done to our credibility, because the institutions have a duty to protect the weakest.
Commissioner, I have probably been involved in politics as long as you have, and the basic duty of the institutions is certainly to protect the weakest members of society and yet you have put yourself in the position of protecting only the strongest.
Why have you abandoned the ceiling, Commissioner?
Even the United States, which has companies that are two hundred times larger, has a ceiling of EUR 350 000, and you, who initially had a ceiling in place, abandoned it, concluding that it was excessive because it should not exceed EUR 100 000.
You and this Parliament will go down in history as being profoundly unfair and discriminatory and for having damaged the credibility of the political process.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past year, it was important that confidence in Agenda 2000 should be maintained.
Today we deal with the further development of the common agricultural policy post-2006, taking into consideration world trade law, with the applicant countries participating as appropriate.
I emphasise that it is right at this time to make a serious and sustainable decision on the future of the common agricultural policy.
However, Commissioner, the parallelism of agricultural decision-making on the one hand, and the continuance of world trade discussions on the other also have a part to play here.
They can only be properly combined if the Commission adheres strictly to the whole package of WTO negotiations and allows no watering down in this case.
With this in mind I would like to say that Mrs Kinnock's comments with regard to the evaluation of the agricultural policy are an evaluation of the Agricultural Policy from 20 years ago.
If we do achieve a balance in development policy and commit all industrial nations to this, we have no reason to hide behind others.
Commissioner, you have always quite rightly said that only economically healthy businesses can be sustained in the long term.
The concept of sustainability does not have to be continually updated.
It is adequately and internationally defined and set out in Agenda 21.
The issue before us today therefore is in a sense to rework the Commission's proposals so that they are, if possible, more practical and more manageable, and at the same time to make the necessary adjustments without these adjustments asking too much of businesses or people.
Regarding the simplification of the agricultural policy, with regard to the thirty-eight directives named and the possibility of Member States implementing these administratively, I would ask that still more be done to avoid hardship cases so that the simplification of European agricultural policy also fully and completely respects the basic principle of non-discrimination.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, can the European Union continue to ignore the expectations of society, which has been deeply affected by the food crises we have experienced in recent years?
Is it right for 80% of agricultural aid to be distributed among only 20% of farmers?
Can Europe seriously be exonerated from the need to carry out an in-depth analysis of a policy that accounts for almost half of its budget, at a time when it is preparing to welcome 10 new countries?
You were right, Commissioner, to prefer movement to the status quo, anticipation to a waiting game.
Your reform is courageous, for it advocates, through decoupling, a break with the approach of providing incentives for production.
It is ambitious in that it seeks to strengthen the multifunctional nature of European agriculture.
It is relevant in terms of the future WTO appointments and the impending enlargement of Europe.
However, I am afraid that it may also be unfair in that it is based exclusively on the situation in mainland Europe and does not give sufficient consideration to the diversity of regional situations, particularly as regards production in the outermost regions.
These regions have not yet achieved the initial objective of the CAP, namely a degree of agricultural self-sufficiency.
Their markets are far from being saturated.
They need incentives to help develop their farms.
If the proposed measures were automatically applied to the outermost regions, they would be an undeniable hindrance to the dynamism we have witnessed in recent years.
It is not a question of putting the outermost regions in a bubble; we simply need to take account of their specific situations.
The legal basis already exists, in Article 299(2); what we need now is the political will.
The Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has shouldered its responsibilities by adopting on 21 May an amendment, which I tabled with the aim of ensuring that the outermost regions are not subjected to automatic, systematic application of the reform.
The Commission and the Council must now shoulder theirs.
There is no doubt that we must learn from the lessons of the past and adapt our agricultural policy to the challenges of the twenty-first century, but it would be unacceptable to allow this reform, in the name of general principles, to sound the death knell for the Union's most vulnerable farmers.
Mr President, I am rather concerned that I have been looking at a slightly different document from the rest of this Parliament.
I very much agree with the Commissioner's views on decoupling and very much support them.
It is important to keep it simple, to keep away from partial decoupling and to cut red tape.
Let us have total decoupling.
It will mean that for once the funding will get down to the farmer and he will receive it.
That is perhaps partly behind the Commissioner's principles.
One of the problems we have always had in the common agricultural policy is that the funding has gone to multinationals such as supermarkets and not actually got down to the farmers.
I must confirm what Mrs Kinnock said about the poorest people not receiving the funding.
A statement made in the United Kingdom recently made it clear that British farmers were virtually at the bottom of the table for earnings: they were third from the bottom.
So let us hope that the funding reaches some of those people who need it.
I have a question for the Council.
Does it want reform because of enlargement or because of the WTO?
Do not go into bed with the USA, because the USA's farm bill certainly went against the principles that we in the European Union want.
The USA has no interest in or concerns about the EU.
I have three short questions for the Commissioner, which I hope he may be able to answer, if not today then certainly later on.
They concern problems arising from the 2002 reference period in the Commission's report.
If national reserves for a single farm payment, i.e. for additional claims, are to be raised from 1% to 3% of the total allocation, where will this come from?
The fruit and vegetable problems are great.
Where are we going to find funding for such areas as starch potatoes?
The Commissioner mentioned this very briefly.
I hope he can confirm what he said.
Finally, as regards biofuels on set-aside land, I know the Commissioner has changed his views on that.
I hope he will keep to that and still reconsider biofuels on set-aside.
Mr President, the Commission's proposals on total decoupling and modulation are devastating for many sectors and territories.
For example, in Andalucia and other regions of Spain this total decoupling may be very harmful.
And degressivity means a transfer of funds from Mediterranean agriculture to continental agriculture.
In terms of social cohesion we could go from bad to worse.
Commissioner, the CAP has been producing scandalous agricultural incomes for a few people who are sometimes not even farmers.
These socially pernicious effects should have been corrected in this reform.
But no, far from it, these proposals intend to make these social imbalances permanent and furthermore, Mr President, they forget about the women farmers and agricultural workers, who contribute so much to European agriculture.
With regard to the least-favoured regions, Commissioner, in person you say to us, yes, yes, yes, but then your proposals say no, no, no.
The least-favoured areas must be given special intention in view of the impact the total decoupling of aid will have on them.
And if this is not done through active policies for markets and the distribution of agricultural products, we will then have to face the horrendous damage which will be caused by passivity and the disappearance of crops.
With regard to modulation, I would suggest, Commissioner, that you consider what the regional competence may be in those Member States where agriculture falls within it.
Finally, I will refer to the how and the when of the reform.
With regard to the 'how' in terms of the negotiations, Spain runs the risk of being isolated and of losing, as a result of the extreme blocking positions of its Minister for Agriculture, who should correct such serious negotiating errors.
With regard to the 'when', there has been a degree of hastiness and if we continue to work in such a hurry we will very soon have to carry out a reform of the reform.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a proposal for reform, however comprehensive, will never be able to satisfy the many different farming systems in Europe.
It was therefore inevitable that the debate would become heated and even change in tone according to the different viewpoints of the Members.
To get straight to the point which interests me, I would like to say that I come from the mountains, and in this debate I want to express the opinion of those who live and work in mountain regions.
We endorse the transition from market, in other words from production, to farm, and we also endorse the proposal to transfer the savings made through modulation to rural development.
Despite the many instances of reluctance to address mountain concerns, despite the fact that the mountains are not mentioned anywhere in this reform, we can say that there is hope on the horizon.
At last, for the first time, multifunctionality, which is indispensable for some disadvantaged peripheral areas, is treated quite seriously.
Multifunctionality has always been practised in mountain areas where, together with their primary activity, farmers are required to control forestry development, channel watercourses, concern themselves with animal welfare and look after the environment for the benefit of farm and other tourism.
This also means taking the greatest possible care to ensure the quality of typical products and niche products, which have for some time been highly successful and not unprofitable on the market.
This too could help to convince a young farmer or two not to abandon the mountains.
It is not enough, however: multifunctional farming brings added value to the community and it is therefore right that there should be appropriate remuneration.
The ridiculous premiums for meadow mowing are not enough: a decent, fixed, supplementary income should be provided for those who work in the mountains and perform these services for the benefit of all.
Otherwise, the exodus already taking place will continue and depopulation of the mountains will be the inevitable result.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the resolutions adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development even though I do not doubt that, in many areas, they do not go far enough.
Having had the same experience with the foot-and-mouth disease report, I would also like to congratulate the members of the Committee on their tremendous hard work.
It is hard work but an agreement must be reached.
Much that has been negotiated, however, has still not been implemented. In addition, many of Commissioner Fischler's proposals, which I believe go in the right direction and in which there is very much that I can support, have unfortunately still not been fully implemented in all areas, something of which he is well aware.
We should however stop breaking everything down and unravelling it all again because in the end, we can only negotiate the whole as a package.
There is, of course, the World Trade Organisation, which requires that we observe certain rules.
If one considers the governments that took part in the negotiations from 1986 to 1994 in the Marrakech Round and the Uruguay Round and which ones then signed the treaties at the end of 1993 or 1994, there were abstentions in many areas.
Even though I come from Upper Bavaria, I do of course think that an increase in the milk quota is wrong.
Many other price interventions have to be readjusted as well - rye is one of them - because everything cannot be ploughed up in one go or from one day to the next.
That will not work.
I would also like to make it clear that I support cohesion in the European Union and the shifting of funds into those regions and countries that have less, to help them to improve.
I do not understand, though, why money that, for example, will be cut back from many operations that are in a higher grouping, should go back to the Commission for redistribution elsewhere.
The bulk of the money should be used within the two pillars, according to the principle of subsidiarity, in the regions from where it originates. Otherwise, to put it bluntly, many will in reality be paying twice.
Commissioner Fischler's reforms are necessary and they would be necessary even without the entry of the ten accession states and without the World Trade Organisation because no one in this Chamber will seriously claim that the system is fair in terms of the way it has been managed up until now.
It is not fair.
Decoupling in the most widely varying of areas - and, as you and I know, this will one day be complete; it is a matter of time - will lead to greater fairness.
It will not help however if everyone takes their region out and says that nothing should be done here and nothing should be done there.
That does not begin to solve the problem.
A few words on the developing countries: I am really glad that these have been discovered in the meantime.
The 'Everything But Arms' initiative will not kill anyone or cost anything.
We must however look at which countries are attempting to sell from the little that they produce because they need other vitally important goods.
We must look into that.
In the European Union, for decades, we have dumped our surpluses at a world market level and have forced them onto the developing countries and deprived many of their farmers of the capacity to make a living.
We should also give some thought to that.
Mr President, as far as we are concerned, Commissioner Fischler will go down in history as the Commissioner of decoupling.
If, in order to guarantee a successful WTO agreement, we have to choose between two options, then we would pick decoupling rather than price reduction.
If the Council and Commission have listened carefully, this is, in any case, the direction that Parliament has indicated.
The CDA (Christian Democrat) delegation in the European Parliament has been happy to help reach a compromise on the Cunha report which contains a number of points that were of interest to us and which we have highlighted by means of amendments.
First of all, there is set-aside.
In our opinion, it should be possible to rotate, and it should be up to the farmer to decide, rather than it being fixed for ten years.
Secondly, land that has been decoupled and where other products may possibly grow should definitely not be used for growing free products, including consumption potatoes and vegetables.
The CDA has tabled an amendment to that effect, which has been adopted by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Our third point, which is a little more controversial, is that we welcome the increase in franchise per farm on which decoupling is practised, from EUR 5 000 to 7 500, but that is too little in our opinion.
The European Christian Democrats should protect the family concern and in our view, this ceiling should be raised to EUR 10 000 or 15 000.
In fact, we in the CDA have, together with our British colleagues, tabled an amendment for EUR 10 000, and a Spanish amendment has been tabled for EUR 15 000, both of which we will support.
With regard to the dairy sector and reform, we back the Jeggle report and, partly based on a CDA amendment, we have decided in favour of far less far-reaching decoupling and also for change.
In our opinion, we should first reach 5%, wait for a WTO agreement and possibly implement the Berlin Agreement in its entirety.
Anyone who thinks that the dairy sector should be reformed - and I am particularly addressing Mrs Kinnock - should realise that, since 1983, the European Union has surrendered 5% of the global market and that production has not benefited the developing countries but other rich ones.
To state that we must further pull down European dairy policy without considering the effects is evidence of armchair socialism. It is a cheap form of armchair socialism.
I am in favour of any discussion on development cooperation, provided this is done on the basis of the agreements which Europe has reached with the 48 poorest countries and after we have considered the implications for the European farmers and farmers in developing countries.
If we fail to do this, the European farmers will be sitting targets in the whole discussion on development cooperation.
As a member of this Parliament, I refuse to have any part in this.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like also to be able to say Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, but, unfortunately, he is absent.
I wish to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs who have worked on the very important matter we are debating today, but mainly I wish to congratulate Mr Cunha on his magnum opus, which I do not envy him at all.
I would not want to be in his shoes, but I congratulate him on what he has managed to produce.
Allow me to convey to you the anxiety and uncertainty of Greek farmers, because Mediterranean products are not included in the reform of the CAP, and their anxiety as to what will emerge from part two, from the second round of negotiations, when we discuss Mediterranean products after the Cancun round of the World Trade Organisation.
We are worried.
We are very worried and I hope that it will turn out that we have no reason to worry but, until it does, we shall worry.
We consider that the EUR 5 000 limit is very low.
It needs to be increased drastically if we really want improvements to production and monitoring of all the preconditions needed for us to have improved prospects in the agricultural sector.
I also wish to express the conviction that disadvantaged island areas, which in my country especially are particularly exposed, and mountain areas throughout the European Union should receive special treatment.
We must take care to keep these people in their villages, in their agricultural areas, instead of making them unemployed town dwellers.
I welcome the prospect of making agricultural production a business.
However, I want to see how farmers are to become businessmen.
Finally, we obviously all welcome the enlargement of the European Union with the 10 new Member States, but what I should like is for not only the farmers of the European Union to be called upon to pay the bill for enlargement.
There are two issues in relation to the mid-term reform before us.
One is the detail of what is proposed and the other is the timing.
Decoupling is a central tenet and is quite revolutionary in itself.
While there are risks and benefits, I feel very strongly that partial decoupling proposals pose a far greater risk with no prospect of decrease in regulation.
Beware of the various menus on decoupling!
Even our colleague Mr Cunha's proposal for decoupling male beef but not sucklers in my country, Ireland, must come with a health warning, as it will collapse the price of calves and weanlings.
Beware of partial decoupling proposals!
We need to be more market oriented to simplify the burden of regulation and also benefit from the WTO talks.
However, I am not convinced on the second point, despite the Commissioner's protestations on many occasions that we have played our WTO cards wisely.
Look at what happened in the last GATT round: the EU traded in a principled way our agricultural rights for other non-agricultural areas.
We gave market access guarantees which we lived up to in the EU and in return we got no market guarantees.
In fact, the US have used 9/11 to introduce the biggest increase in domestic supports in decades while we in the EU limited our production, and they returned to the WTO talks with a clear message of more of the same.
Buyer beware!
Nothing they have said nor any utterances from Harbinson's mouth leave me with confidence that we are going to benefit from playing our cards up front.
In fact, the contrary is the clear message.
What is the chance of the import tariffs remaining at around 36% reduction and not closer to the 60% proposed?
There is little chance.
The jury is out and we are gambling in advance of Cancun with the critical part of Europe's economic policy, the CAP.
The Commissioner is living very dangerously and some would say recklessly in the timing of his proposals.
Modulation of EUR 5 000 is unacceptable, even with promises of further investment in rural development.
Robbing a poor Peter to pay Paul is an inverse Robin Hood policy and is at best perverse.
To introduce degressivity to support - at least in Ireland's case - a new dairy com (i.e. common organisation of market), i.e. coupled payments for the milk sector, is illogical, given the gospel of decoupling underpinning the mid-term review.
Each country has its own menu of special cases, be they young farmers, disease issues, early farm retirement issues, successor rights and those who invested heavily in the reference years.
They must be looked after.
We have a duty of care to farmers in the developing world which we can and will discharge in the context of a level world playing field but, as European legislators, our primary duty of care is to our own farmers and to a sustainable future for agriculture in the EU, the largest agricultural producer and the largest economy in the world.
Mr President, Commissioner, there have been many speeches this afternoon about the financing of EU agricultural policy.
In my opinion, the overall situation over recent years has been much more favourable for consumers than for farmers.
I never tire of saying that the proportion of outgoings spent on food by the citizens of the European Union has fallen continuously over recent decades.
There are hard figures indicating that those who, decades ago, spent 40% of income on food, now spend approximately 14%, so foodstuffs are not surplus junk and, with EU support, the farmers produce them and look after the countryside perhaps even far more cheaply than municipal farms could do it.
My idea of the European agriculture model has remained unchanged for years.
I would like farmers in the European Union to continue to perform the dual task of producing high quality products and caring for and maintaining the cultural landscape.
In my opinion, therefore, we should really now be using the debate on common agricultural policy to ensure that this task can be performed in the long term in difficult locations not only in Germany but in all European regions.
There has been much discussion today about your proposals, Commissioner, but, if I have understood you correctly, there are one or two places where you have allowed for a certain readiness to compromise, and this affects decoupling.
The agriculturalists in my parliamentary party are demanding clear differentiation between arable and animal production.
I therefore regard as eminently important the consistent continued development of common agricultural policy and also quantity-oriented market policy for milk.
Commissioner, I am convinced that we should now decide - as you have always said.
The parliamentary reports are available and I am very keen to know what the Council will make of them.
We should really use this negotiation capital.
Finally, I would therefore like to encourage you to follow our suggestions.
If we all fight together it will produce the best results for agriculture and I am someone who would really like to defend you out there.
I cannot imagine what interest you could have in initiating something unsuitable.
(Applause)
Mr President, I congratulate the Commission on its radical proposals for decoupling.
I fear that the propositions that Parliament is putting forward are far too timid and believe that we should go down the road of decoupling.
If we are going to do it partially, then let us at least do it sector by sector, not by horizontal decoupling across all sectors.
Mr Cunha, you know I believe that part of the proposal is mad.
Farmers need a clear direction as to where they are going.
We need a decision from the Council of Ministers so that farmers can plan for the future.
What we do not want is a complete mixing of decoupling.
If we need to look after less-favoured areas there are ways to do that.
We do not have to do that through production subsidies.
The decoupling system that you have put forward, Commissioner, will help us with the WTO round.
It will also help us face up to enlargement.
Let us face it, many of the accession countries would find it very difficult to put into place the production-based subsidies we have.
What point is there in asking them to put those systems in place if, a year or two later, we change the whole system again?
We have to face up to the reality that we will have a different agricultural policy for 25 Member States than we have for the existing 15.
That is where we have to be careful in what we do.
We also have to be sure that when Europe goes to the WTO round we can fight our corner and face up not only to the United States, but Third World countries.
We need to support our farmers, but not at the expense of Third World trade.
The proposals you put forward will help us to support European agriculture, European farmers and give good value to European taxpayers who are sometimes forgotten.
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank you all for your contributions, which, even though in parts very critical, were constructive and always relevant.
I would also like to assure all of those who have pointed out the importance of giving the European Parliament the power of codecision in the field of agricultural policy, that you have the full support of the Commission and also my full personal support in this matter.
Anyone who is involved in European politics knows that compromises are necessary in the interest of a common cause and in the interest of reaching a joint decision.
Compromises must, however, be judged by criteria, and these criteria are the substance of reform, which must be preserved.
The Commission cannot depart from this principle and does not want to do so.
On many topics however, there has for some time been discussion on the adaptation of Commission proposals.
These include, for example, the concentration of the cross-compliance requirements on the most important provisions with the aim of improving administrative manageability, a moderate increase in the portion of cross-compliance moneys remaining in the Member States, a longer preparation time for the installation of the management advisory system with initial voluntary participation which shall only later be made obligatory, greater flexibility for the Member States with regard to the payment of advances relating to direct payments, flexible treatment of cases of hardship and problems in calculating and allocating the uniform management premium as well as the option for the Member States to exclude certain types of fruit from the areas subject to premiums, the retention of the rotating set-aside land with the possibility of secondary growth of commodities in these areas, delaying the decoupling of milk premiums in the interest of simplifying administration or a more flexible cofinancing rate for agricultural environmental measures and an occasional increase in the promotion sums in areas with specific environmental restrictions.
There are however other topics where even greater efforts are required in the discussion to enable us to achieve solutions.
The Presidency will certainly undertake these efforts jointly with the Commission, especially next week in Council.
These topics include, amongst others, the various aspects of the decoupling of direct payments.
Here as well there is definitely scope but again, it is important to achieve the basic objectives of decoupling.
These are the simplification of our promotion policy, the avoidance of absurd production incentives, the strengthening of a market-oriented entrepreneurial trade and finally, the avoidance of trade distortions.
In particular, we should not forget that decoupling means that of the promotion granted, twice as much money will remain in the farmers' pockets as under the old system.
This has been demonstrated again recently by the OECD.
The important topics still requiring an open discussion include the treatment of the outermost marginal areas or overseas areas.
Here as well, it is crucial to protect the basic principles. This of course includes the need to take into consideration both the special features of these areas and the objectives of the POSEI Regulations.
I would also like to mention the wish voiced in many quarters for an even more targeted strengthening of the two columns of common agricultural policy.
You will not be surprised that I am open to ideas here as regards strengthening these two pillars even more than was envisaged.
Once again let us briefly return to the question of decoupling because very many here have mentioned partial decoupling: I think there are problems with the idea of introducing decoupling gradually over a long period or only decoupling a certain percentage of each individual support measure.
These mixtures of a partial decoupling mean in the end that the disadvantages of the existing system are linked to withholding the advantages of the new system.
We should therefore be very careful here.
The particular disadvantages of the existing system are the farmers' lack of freedom to make decisions about their farms.
Other disadvantages are that the farmers have to pay out more for increased and more complex bureaucracy and in particular, they are denied entrepreneurial freedom.
A final word on the question of intervention prices, in regard to which some of you have been very critical, asking why we actually want or need a measure to guarantee market balance for the coming years, 10 years in total.
The main reason is that if we compare the market forecasts that we used as a basis for the Agenda 2000 with the market forecasts that the same institutes, for example, Fabri, are now publishing, these institutes have had to drastically lower their very positive expectations of that time. For example, a reduction of 14% for wheat, 10% for barley, 16% for maize, 37% for butter and more than 30% for skimmed milk powder.
How can we then come up with a 5% drop in the intervention price?
Only because we were considerably more cautious then when these forecasts were suggested to us and we can therefore now take a more moderate approach.
Not taking steps however, would again result in a market imbalance and that means none other than downward pressure on price.
Last of all, the question on Mediterranean products: I would like to say to you quite clearly that next week, when it is time to decide in Council, we will be pressing for the Agriculture Council, jointly with the Commission, to make a declaration guaranteeing that Mediterranean products are assessed on an equal footing and in the same way if new steps are taken.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0097/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
I regret that this Question Time, as a result of where it falls on our agenda, always, or almost always, begins late.
Today we are beginning 30 minutes late, which means that we must deal with it is quickly as possible.
I am banking on the cooperation of all the Members.
Part I
Question No 22 by Stavros Xarchakos, which has been taken over by Mr Folias (H-0317/03):
Subject: Measures to combat the deadly SARS virus
The deadly SARS virus has justifiably caused alarm throughout the world.
What immediately implementable measures to protect against this virus, if any, has the Commission proposed to the Member States?
.
The Commission has taken a proactive and leading role in responding to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
As recently stated by the Council on SARS on 6 May 2003, this has been undertaken through the EU network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community, working in the framework of Decision No 2119/1998/EC.
This has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response in which EFTA and candidate countries have fully participated in collaboration with the WHO.
At its extraordinary meeting on SARS, the Council broadly agreed the orientation developed by the Commission with the assistance of the Network Committee.
Although the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States, the orientation for immediate and future actions will focus on the following issues: rapid detection of all suspect cases of SARS through good surveillance; protection of those at risk of infection through effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals, including measures to protect carers; particular attention to be paid to air travel, which has been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably to standardised screening of passengers leaving affected areas; on-board advice to passengers and effective information at ports of entry from affected areas; raising awareness among professionals and the public and the timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other countries, in particular EEA and EFTA countries, acceding and candidate countries, and with the WHO.
Cooperation should also be developed with other partners such as airline companies, and the organising bodies of mass gatherings.
The Council also took note of the Commission's intention to submit a proposal to create a European centre for disease prevention and control.
On behalf of Mr Xarchakos, who cannot be here for reasons beyond his control, I would like to thank the Commissioner.
Question No 23 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0314/03):
Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba
In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba. Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years.
The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible.
These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.
Given that the Commission has recently opened an office in Havana and that the Cotonou agreement makes certain stipulations regarding human rights, what does the Commission intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba?
What is the Commission doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home?
What steps will the Commission take to support the prisoners and their relatives?
Part 2
Question addressed to Mr Monti
.
The recent large-scale arrest of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on them, as well as the execution of three Cuban citizens convicted of highjacking a Cuban ferry, have had a prompt, firm and sustained reaction from the European Union.
The Commission has fully and actively supported the actions that have been taken in this context.
The Commission, together with the Member States, has strongly condemned such arrests in a declaration published on 26 March 2003, which was followed up by an EU dÃ©marche in Havana to urge the Cuban authorities to allow the prisoners' immediate release.
A second EU dÃ©marche in Havana took place on 18 April, following the Foreign Ministers' statement issued on 14 April.
Further measures have recently been agreed, including limits to high-level visits.
The Commission decided on 30 April to defer the examination of the Cuban application for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, signalling that these recent developments are not conducive to cooperation between the European Union and Cuba.
The Cuban authorities decided on 16 May to withdraw their application.
The Commission is concerned about the treatment of prisoners and believes that the Cuban authorities should invite the International Red Cross to visit them to ensure that they are treated humanely.
Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Byrne for his answer.
Approximately 60 of the 75 people sentenced and imprisoned in Cuba following summary trials have received prison sentences of more than 20 years.
They feel, quite simply, that their lives are threatened.
Sentences as tough as these have not been handed down in Cuba for several decades.
My follow-up question to the Commissioner is about how we might follow up the protests in terms of practical politics.
Can we act within the world community - within the UN - by trying to persuade the Red Cross to take action?
Can we act through churches or in some other way?
By means of various types of sanctions, can we put pressure on the Cuban regime?
We are concerned here with people who have had to pay a very high price for the sake of democracy.
.
As I have already indicated, the view of the Commission is that the International Red Cross should be invited to examine and report on the situation.
In addition, a new EU dÃ©marche is being prepared for the beginning of June, but there is no agreement yet on the text.
To sum up, the situation is that the Commission is keeping this issue under review and maintaining such pressure as it is capable of bringing to bear on the situation.
Commissioner, the people whom the European Union calls human rights activists are nothing more than agents of the United States of America, as proven in the Cuban courts.
In addition, the Americans themselves have admitted that they are offering them several tens of millions of dollars to set up internal opposition in Cuba.
Indeed, which country would not protect itself from outside plotting?
In all events, I should like your comments, Commissioner, on the action by Mr Cason in Cuba and by his office.
I should also like your comments on Mr Bush's message on 20 May, promising freedom to Cuba, and your comment on the fact that the United States have not punished the hijackers who forced aeroplanes to go to Cuba.
And, finally, what do you think about the detention by the United States of five Cuban patriots who have barely seen 80% of the bill of indictment, because it is supposed to be confidential?
.
The issue under discussion here this evening is that of breaches - very fundamental breaches - of human rights in Cuba.
Whatever issues you refer to, whether they can be established or not, they do not justify the breaches of human rights that have been identified and acknowledged.
These include the executions of the three individuals in question following very short trials in circumstances which are generally regarded by the international community, and the Commission in particular, as being highly unsatisfactory.
As the author is not present, Question No 24 lapses.
Question No 25 by Ward Beysen (H-0315/03):
Subject: Parallel trade
Is the Commission aware of the continual threats to legal parallel trade in medicines inside the EU, a process which saves Member State governments and European patients millions of euros each year?
Has it considered using Article 82 as a legal basis for ensuring pharmaceutical manufacturers play by the single market rules?
. (IT) The honourable Member's question is not just undeniably of interest but is also extremely topical.
The question is interesting in any case because the barriers to parallel trade in pharmaceutical products have for some time been a source of concern to the Commission, which has already prepared many cases for trial in this field in the past and continues do so now.
In particular, a large number of cases are currently under investigation in the competition sector, at the request of both pharmaceutical laboratories and complainants.
The matter is also, as I said, highly topical.
As you are aware, the Commission has two legal instruments under which it can take action: Articles 81 and 82.
With regard to Article 81, just a few days ago, Mr Tizzano, the Advocate General of the Court of Justice, presented his conclusions on the Bayer case, relating to parallel trade in one of the company's products.
I do not want to go into the details of this case or the conclusions of the Advocate General, which concern a matter of highly specific legal practice.
The conclusions do not, however, endorse the lines taken by the Commission on the case.
The Court's judgment will be issued in a few month's time but will not, in any case, compromise the Commission's other decisions on issues different from the matters addressed in the Bayer case, such as, for instance, the decision adopted by the Commission on 8 May 2001 on the dual pricing system employed by the company, Glaxo.
As far as Article 82 is concerned, the Commission is currently working along precisely these lines.
That raises a number of new questions, especially with regard to the definition of markets and abusive practices.
Moreover, last February, the Court of Justice received a preliminary question from the Greek Competition Committee, which is the Greek authority responsible for competition.
This preliminary question seeks to establish to what extent the refusal by a pharmaceutical company in a dominant position to supply a wholesaler with a view to stopping parallel trade can be deemed to be abuse prohibited by Article 82 of the EC Treaty.
The Commission will, as usual, be called upon to express its opinion to the Court in the coming weeks, but the Court is not due to issue its judgment for many months yet.
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his extensive response to what is indeed a very topical problem, which, as the Commissioner was right to emphasise, causes great concern.
In my view, Article 82 is indeed the only legal basis on which we can carry on, and I hope that more light will be shed on the situation within the foreseeable future, because major mergers within the medicines sector almost always lead to huge cuts in employment.
Moreover, current practice is very detrimental to the consumer.
I would therefore expect, as soon as possible, a more detailed answer to the question that was put before you.
.
I subscribe to the importance that you attach to the subject, as well as to its urgency.
I shall give you just a brief indication on where we are going.
As I said, our priority for the moment is to finalise our contribution to the Court of Justice in the Greek preliminary ruling request - this should be done by mid-June - concerning the treatment of approximately 30 cases pending before the Commission.
I am sure you will understand that I cannot give precise dates.
The assessment under Article 82 is ongoing.
One way or the other you can expect the Commission to adopt its position - positive or negative - on the supply quota systems by the end of this year.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the pharmaceutical area, the Internet has meant that we have recently experienced a completely new development, in that medicinal products are being traded on the Internet throughout Europe.
Nonetheless, we still have territorial restrictions applying to pharmacies.
How do you envisage this area developing in the future?
.
