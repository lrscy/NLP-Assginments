One only has to mention, somewhere in a sentence, the need to respect subsidiarity, and the machine can rumble on its way as if nothing had happened.
This omnipresent method raises not only the question of subsidiarity, but also the question of how effective the work of the Council actually is.
We very much doubt whether the Heads of State or Government were really able to examine all these subjects, and we very much doubt whether it is possible to make things happen by using such methods.
The large number of subjects dealt with merely serves to show up, even more sharply, the almost total absence of any role for the euro, despite the fact that the euro had been presented to us as the number one priority in order to achieve a competitive Europe, which was the principal objective of the Stockholm Summit.
The Council' s conclusions contain, buried somewhere beneath a mass of words, an indication that, in less than 300 days, the euro should be circulating in the form of notes and coins, but there is no mention of the organisational reforms needed to extricate it from its present weak position in the exchange markets.
There is also no mention of the Commission' s recent communication on this subject, which seems to have been put aside.
However, if the euro does not recover, Mr President, its credibility in the eyes of the public will be called into question.
Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, on the front page of yesterday' s Financial Times, Horst KÃ¶hler, the head of the International Monetary Fund, was lashing out at European political leaders, albeit in a very civilised way.
Referring to the economic situation, he said that a reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank would undoubtedly help the European economy, but it is at least as important for Europe to bring about more ambitious transformations.
When, in the same connection, he says the IMF would probably lower its forecast for growth for the euro area for this year to 2.5%, we can see that the financial players have reacted to the totally indecisive outcome of the Stockholm Summit with as much disappointment as my own Group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, here in Parliament.
We have thus already fallen below the 3% growth target that was set for the mid term as a basis for sustaining and improving employment and social security in Europe.
Stockholm was like a mini Nice, without the squabbles.
Nobody wanted to speak up for the European common good, and most governments clung to their own interests, such as they imagined them to be.
That is what happened, despite what was certainly an enormous effort to achieve results on the part of the country to hold the presidency.
At the beginning of the year someone joked that the aims of Lisbon had become the promises of Nikita Khrushchev.
It was he who said at the start of the 1960s that the Soviet Union would overtake the United States in ten years in terms of economic power.
In the wake of the Stockholm meeting, there is going to be a grain of truth in that joke.
We have to remember that the decisions that are now required concerning European patents, the liberalisation of competition among the gas and electricity boards and in the Post Office, making air traffic more flexible, Galileo, and other matters, will not result in any real changes until four to ten years have gone by after the political decision is taken.
I would nonetheless like to mention one positive decision that was taken at Stockholm.
At last a nugget of something concrete has been found for a policy on the northern dimension.
Hopefully, it will encourage not just us in the European Union, but the Russians too, to seek and find suitable targets of cooperation in other areas. As a Finn, I would ask the Prime Minister of our beloved neighbour and the country to hold the presidency the following question.
The conclusions of Stockholm state that the sound economic situation that has lasted quite a long time now in the European Union would not have been possible without monetary and economic union: has the Swedish government started preparations to fulfil their Community obligations by joining the third phase of monetary and economic union?
Och pÃ¥ svenska: Sverige Ã€r alltid vÃ€lkommen i klubben.
[And in Swedish: Sweden is always welcome to join the club.]
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to say a few words on the foreign policy decisions taken in Stockholm.
Last weekend, we all witnessed the television reports and the tension surrounding former President Milosevic' s arrest.
Our Group, undoubtedly like many others here, welcomes this arrest with open arms.
We also have a great deal of respect for the way in which the authorities of the former republic of Yugoslavia handled this matter.
It must have been an extremely difficult situation to deal with.
There was a great deal of tangible tension.
The fact that this step was ultimately taken indicates that another move has been made towards more integration within our law-based community, also here in Europe.
At the same time, our wish remains, of course, to ultimately see Mr Milosevic brought before the International War Tribunal in The Hague.
We assume, as before, that the European Union will keep the pressure on in that respect and that the International War Tribunal will ultimately be the place where he will face his final reckoning.
At the same time, we have seen a great deal of tension, probably more than some of us had expected, in FYROM' s border regions.
We have to say that, for all the problems in the past, we still have a great deal of respect for the way in which Mr Patten and Mr Solana dealt with the situation there, in tandem with the Swedish Presidency.
Needless to say, the early warning systems are still not fully functioning.
We probably could have reacted more promptly in a number of areas.
The consultation structures are not yet completely in place either, but we certainly have more tools at our disposal than before.
We are better able to operate in those regions, and we are seeing the first signs of a common foreign policy, something which we would very much like to promote further.
Once again, the Association Agreement too could be an excellent tool in this respect.
Here in Parliament, we are ready to adopt this agreement as quickly as possible, and we want to encourage everything which can make progress possible in this respect.
With regard to the Middle East, the Ministers Perez and Nabil Shaath of the Palestinian Authority are supposed to meet in Athens today.
In actual fact, violence increases with each passing day, while we would like to return to the old agreements, which, at the very least, ensure that both parties keep their own troops in check, and retrace our steps in terms of violence.
The UN resolutions, the Oslo agreements: it is as if some things no longer exist, and both parties operate in a very irresponsible manner.
We hope that Moratinos, our representative, in conjunction with Mr Solana and the Swedish Presidency, succeed at least in bringing those parties around the negotiating table once more, for there is no other alternative.
Either we talk and negotiate - which will bring the things which were discussed in Camp David, as well as the different possibilities, back on the negotiating table - or we end up in a situation where this spiral of violence, from which so many of the extreme factions on both sides stand to benefit, is given a chance to develop.
This brings me to my third point.
We are pleased that the Swedish Presidency has managed to bring the northern dimensions as a whole back to the fore once again. St Petersburg has been mentioned.
This is a crucial point for us.
You have relations and contacts there which provide extra opportunities.
Which brings me to my final point.
The Swedish Presidency has, traditionally, always played a very clear role, not as the Swedish Presidency, but as Sweden in the UN Security Council.
It is evident that during the Bush administration, the cowards of this world threaten to change their course again.
It is important that Europe in this respect - Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has actually said this on behalf of our Group - adopt its own, self-assured role.
Not so much an anti-stance: we should not fall back on old patterns.
It is a 'global village' , and we rely on global partnership.
In that respect, a unilateral withdrawal from Kyoto cannot be accepted.
This is also true of the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in other respects, such as in the field of rocket defence systems.
As Europe, we must counter this with intelligent, partnership-focused policy, and I expect that the Swedish Presidency, together with our former fellow MEP, Mr Schori from the Security Council on behalf of the Swedish Presidency, can play an excellent role in this matter.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the President of the Council on a successful summit in Stockholm.
I believe that many Swedes were delighted to see their country finally being able to act as host to the leaders of the EU.
Stockholm was supposed to be about the creation of a competitive Europe.
It was supposed to be about action, not EU rhetoric, but was that the case?
No, unfortunately not enough, as the President of the Council himself has admitted.
Reform of the EU is going too slowly.
It was unfortunate that those in Stockholm were unable to agree on a timetable for deregulation of the energy markets.
On the other hand, they did succeed in agreeing to create a common financial market, which has been eagerly awaited.
We liberals now assume that the Council is prepared to act such that we achieve a solution which can also be accepted by Parliament.
Mr President, this is about democratic support and openness.
The Swedish Presidency has an overall vision of bringing the Union closer to its citizens.
This is an excellent ambition.
It therefore surprises me that at the Stockholm Summit the first step was not taken towards wide-ranging reform of agriculture and food policy, as this is the question possibly most under discussion over the breakfast tables in Europe, even - as I have understood - in the Prime Minister' s own home.
Finally, I would like to point out we are now halfway through the Swedish Presidency.
One issue is becoming ever clearer: - It is becoming more and more problematic for Sweden to remain outside the EMU.
My question to the President of the Council is therefore this: according to the Council, what difficulties will be posed in terms of a more cohesive Union by Britain, Denmark and Sweden remaining outside EMU in the long term?
I am not seeking an answer in terms of domestic policy but a theoretical opinion from an EU perspective.
Mr President, I welcome the statement that future spring summits are going to be sustainability summits, and thank the Swedish Presidency for their real leadership on this.
But if we were looking at the world properly, all our summits would be about sustainability.
The environmental and social effects of the liberalisation of the energy sector, for example, are sustainable issues.
Liberalisation alone will not help us reach our pretty meagre Kyoto targets.
How will liberalisation ensure that all people can afford warm homes if they do not have an adequate basic income?
Will the development of our trade with Russia simply strip that country of its natural resources for the lowest possible price?
How will this ensure its sustainable development in future?
Sustainability is not just a domestic issue.
It is an international and inter-generational concept.
If we are to take it seriously it will radically reform the European Union agenda, which will make it a far more relevant and exciting one than people find at present.
Mr President, suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights of the Palestinians and Israelis if the international community and the European Union do not decide to take firm action to restore the international and human rights violated by the Israeli government.
The two sides are not equal: on the one hand, there is a State, which has never defined its borders, which is expanding its settlements and has one of the strongest armies in the world; on the other, there is an occupied people and an occupied territory, without either State or army, which is unable even to exercise any control over bean imports, let alone borders: since 29 September, this people has been besieged, bombed, its villages sealed off, with its sick dying at military check points, its doctors and nurses attacked and its parliament unable to meet.
There is no European Union diplomat who does not speak openly of the way the Israeli government has contravened international rules.
Human rights organisations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International and Israeli organisations such as Betrelem also condemn this.
We must do something to restore the possibility of peace and put an end to the cycle of violence.
The Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to stop the terrorism perpetrated by Palestinian extremists but, on the other hand, the Sharon government in Israel is not sending out peace signals: murders outside the Occupied Territories, bombings, expansion of settlements, carte blanche for the settlers, who have bombed architectural structures in Hebron which are part of our human heritage.
It is time for the European Union to find something which will convince the Israeli leaders: not sanctions or embargoes, given the disastrous results where that strategy has been adopted, but at least the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which would probably suffice, according to Israeli organisations like Rabbis for Peace and others.
I feel that this is extremely important: we must speak out for peace, but peace in respect for all ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the excessive optimism in the wake of Stockholm and the numerous objectives on the agenda do not reflect the bitter, discouraging reality.
It is not clear, now the Stockholm Summit is over, how Europe intends to deal rationally and practically with the extremely serious issue of our ageing population and the resulting decline in the work force, while, at the same time, ensuring that it maintains a sufficient standard of living.
The outrageous on-going lack of social service provision, the discriminatory treatment of pensioners, the poverty zones which are becoming increasingly common throughout Europe, require clear, courageous choices to be made.
In other words, the single currency will not suffice without reform of the financial market.
It is pointless to attempt to achieve a stable European Union without a genuine, effective foreign policy.
As President Prodi rightly said, Europe's credibility is at stake: too many promises have been made and not kept after recent European summits; there have been too many dashed hopes.
Either we do act resolutely right now, or Stockholm will go down in history as yet another pointless stage in the long, exhausting attempt to produce the promised Europe for the Europeans.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have questions to ask on three points: do you not think that the huge crises which we have seen in Macedonia are, in the final analysis, a consequence of our failure to coordinate our policies in Kosovo?
Should we not put them down to the fact that we were not really able to do our job there, that we failed to disarm the UCK, that the fragmentation of responsibilities between numerous international organisations and within the European Union itself is a fact of life and that the crisis has again taken hold because we failed in our duty?
I have a second question.
Mr President-in-Office. I know it is not your sole responsibility as a result of this summit, but how, in your view, will future European Councils operate once the number of seats rises and there are 27 participants, if the European Council is to discuss every detail?
The European Council was founded so that the Heads of State or Government could discuss fundamental questions.
Now there are sometimes 30, 40 or 50 items on the agenda.
Do you not think that the heads of government are trying - and more' s the pity - to assume responsibility for every detail, undermining the authority of their own work and the work of the European Council in the process?
The third point that I wish to address concerns the Council itself.
I think that, if we want to implement a reform process, the Council of Ministers must become more transparent, more efficient and more open.
Everything gets passed to the European Council because of the inefficiency and inability to take decisions of the weakest institution which we have in the European Union, namely the Council of Ministers.
That is not your personal responsibility; it is a structural question which we urgently need to address.
I think that, for this reason, now that we are heading for a Union of 27 members, the question of legislating in public needs to be raised.
This applies to the Council, when it acts as legislator, and should demonstrate that we have an interaction in political debate in Europe.
Responsibilities must be clearly outlined and we must make clear that we need decision-making mechanisms here which bring about results.
We cannot offload everything on to the Heads of State or Government, on to you, only to find that we are unable to reach a solution.
Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming the Prime Minister of Sweden once more to the European Parliament.
I would also like to congratulate him on a successful meeting in Stockholm.
I will concentrate on the Lisbon Process.
A discussion has taken place here concerning whether or not the process represents progress, and criticism has been heard from the right that insufficient progress has been made.
However, this depends on how the meeting of the European Council is perceived.
If the progress of the Europe of the future is measured only in terms of deregulation, it is clear that the meeting was possibly not a success.
I myself, who am also in favour of deregulation, would have liked to have seen us progress further in that direction.
However, the most important aspect of the Stockholm Summit was balance; in other words, the fact that the deregulation which nevertheless was achieved was balanced by a policy for employment, social security and justice.
We can never create a Europe for its citizens if these ingredients are not also present.
Mrs Carlsson said that the Social Democrats in Europe were having a difficult time of it.
Let me name these 'difficulties' , which in actual fact centre on a social democracy that has produced fairly good economic growth and which is responsible for political development in practically every country within the EU.
The difficulties are probably rather in another direction on the political spectrum, namely among Mrs Carlsson' s friends.
I see the Stockholm Summit as a success, especially in terms of the drafts provided by the Commission, because the balance is once more established.
There are clear targets for employment, intermediate targets and employment targets for older people. Moreover, and I would address this particular point to Mr Schmid - there is certainly a link between reducing unemployment and increasing employment!
I would like to state that employment targets are more important than unemployment targets, although both are important.
In Sweden, we have combined unemployment targets and employment targets.
This, together with an active labour market policy, means an increased supply of labour but also reduced unemployment.
It is important that we have achieved this.
It is also important that childcare be introduced as a social right taking different forms in different countries, partly in order to give men and women the chance to participate in the labour market.
The issue concerns quality at work, not just creating more jobs but creating jobs where health and safety are good, where employees have substantial influence and where opportunities for skills development and professional development are in place.
All these ingredients were present at the Stockholm Summit.
This was the first stage of a process which will go on for many years.
It was also particularly important because this first stage means that the process will be able to continue in Barcelona.
Finally, I would like to see a link with the Gothenburg Summit and the ecological dimension, which is the next step.
Link this to the open coordination method and we will achieve a coherent policy.
Mr President, acting President of the Council, I welcome the addition to the agenda of the Stockholm Summit in which sustainable development and environmentally-driven growth are to be incorporated into the Lisbon strategy.
I consider that this addition is only the decent minimum.
What in fact does it mean politically?
Might it possibly be nothing but words?
Both the Council' s decision and the Commission' s basis for discussion for sustainable development, which were presented after the Stockholm Summit, place far too great an emphasis on economic policy and on competition-driven growth.
Ecofin' s structural indicators were adopted in full but not a single environmental indicator was included, not even the Commission' s proposal for indicators on energy efficiency nor any indicators on emissions of greenhouse gases.
In this sense the Stockholm Summit was a disappointment.
The US now threatening to withdraw from the Kyoto Agreement is scandalous and the EU' s leaders must consider serious measures to show...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would first of all like to congratulate the President of the Council on the results of the Stockholm Summit.
Needless to say, we want more, but sound results have been achieved.
Despite this, I would like to underline a number of the warnings which Mr Prodi flagged.
The summit is increasingly running the risk of degenerating into a media spectacle.
We have had Mr Putin, the next time we will get President Bush and, as a result, the other topics will, of course, be pushed into the background.
I should like to ask the President of the Council the following.
Yesterday, we received a visit from Mr Sakharov' s widow in the group. Mrs Sakharov made the following statement: 'Look, in Russia, the situation at the moment is such that there are most certainly democratic institutions and there is freedom of press, but they are no longer functioning properly.'
I wanted to ask you if these kinds of concerns which are around in the European Union also came up in the meeting with Mr Putin.
My second question concerns the following.
We are all grateful for the fact that Milosevic is behind bars.
Needless to say, this is not about whether or not the Bush diplomacy has scored a victory. This is about whether the European Union can help the former Yugoslavia, namely Serbia and Montenegro, in the fight against poverty, with the economic reforms which need to take place and with offering the people a future.
Could the Council not take an initiative in this respect, also to demonstrate to the people that it is indeed worthwhile having Milosevic behind bars?
Finally, I hope that the summit in Gothenburg will not be overshadowed by the presence of President Bush, but will instead focus on enlargement.
This is supposedly the last summit of the year on enlargement.
Let us remove the obstacles.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Stockholm has highlighted at least three subjects on which I should like to comment this morning.
Regarding progress and the conditions for economic growth in Europe, I think that important signals have been given. This morning I have heard some people criticising the halt that has been called on certain forms of liberalisation.
I believe that if we look at the situation with regard to Ericsson in Sweden and Marks & Spencer or Danone in France, it is time to start asking questions about the cost of the growth that we are in the process of creating.
Mr President of the Commission, I have listened to your appeal that Europe should keep its promises, but it cannot do this if it shows the door to thousands of workers.
In that respect, Mr President of the Council, when you call for a balance between liberalisation and social responsibility, it seems to us that you are in agreement with the real concerns of our fellow citizens.
From this point of view, I believe, and this will be my second point, that any progress that can be made in restructuring our services of general interest is essential.
There is this draft framework directive.
We are waiting for it to progress further, because unless it does, what is the point of defining this draft framework when we have already liberalised every sector?
We are already well behind schedule: it is time to act and to restructure these sectors.
My second point is method.
Many people have already said this before me: Lisbon marked a certain stage, and Stockholm makes it official.
It seems to us essential that the conclusions that you adopted regarding better coordination between the Luxembourg process, the social agenda, the Lisbon process and the broad guidelines of economic policy should enable this spring Council to rediscover, or discover, its true role, that of defining policy on the basis of the preparatory work carried out by the Commission, which enables everybody to play their part, the Commission in its role as instigator, and the European Council in its role as policy maker.
Because if everyone wants to do everything, though one sometimes has the impression that it is less painful, very often it is also less effective.
Then again, in using these methods, it seems to us that, if we want to take into consideration this social responsibility that you have talked about, Mr President, we shall also have to modify our indicators.
We are not entirely clear about these social situations.
Admittedly, we have made some progress since Luxembourg, but what do we really know about the way added value is distributed?
What do we know about how employees are defined in terms of their mobility?
What do we know about ways of opposing these job cuts, which were supposed to be merely economic job cuts, and which are becoming financial job cuts?
This is certainly not the Europe that we want to have.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was good that Dr Trajkovski, the President of Macedonia, was in Stockholm.
He is a man who has made an all-out commitment to interethnic coexistence.
However, if you look closely at the situation in Macedonia, you cannot but conclude that the root cause of the extremist incidents lies not so much in Macedonia as in the hesitant action of the West in Kosovo.
The fact of the matter is that the minority rules in Macedonia for the Walachians, Serbs, Romas and Turks are exemplary and many countries in the region would do well to follow its example.
Secondly: the Albanian minority of around 28% naturally needs special treatment.
They have 4 ministers in key positions in this government.
What the previous government unfortunately failed to take into account was the question of higher education for these people and the need to resolve the problem of Tetovo University.
This government made a start on all this, despite the Kosovo crisis, and just as it did so, along came extremists from outside and upset everything.
I call on the Council to help this government to continue on its chosen path and to call on the opposition in Macedonia to support it.
And I call on the Member States to send money to Tetovo University so that it can start the academic year.
As far as Kosovo is concerned, I urgently call for the borders with Serbia and Macedonia to be closed to extremists.
We can probably do this with the help called for.
But UNMIC must get elections under way in Kosovo at long last, so that elected Albanian politicians can take their fate in their own hands and put the extremists in their place.
Governments in the west must realise that problems need to be monitored closely and a solution found.
If we keep stopping half way, we just give the extremists room to manoeuvre.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that those who are keen to emphasise the fact that Stockholm was only a half-hearted attempt at a summit, with a great deal of rhetoric and little in the way of results, would very much like to make us overlook the fact that, in Stockholm, a number of vital steps were taken in order to bring the European policy we have pursued back on track, both socially and ecologically.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you made reference to the Spanish Presidency in your introduction a moment ago.
I would, in turn, like to refer to the Belgian Presidency, for Stockholm has given this Belgian Presidency a number of very essential and firm mandates.
First and foremost, it was given the mandate to formulate goals with a view to taking up the fight against poverty and social exclusion in concrete terms at European level.
This is a very important mandate in my view.
In fact, I hope - and this hope is shared by my Group - that the opportunity will arise to discuss once again a poverty standard and a proper income for all citizens of this Union as part of the agenda.
Secondly, demographic development, to which you yourself have already referred.
I am pleased that the European pensions debate is at long last no longer held among the Finance Ministers within the framework of healthy government finance, but also among the Social Affairs Ministers with a view to guaranteeing everyone a proper pension.
Solidarity between the different generations, solidarity among the older generation and hence, the priority of guaranteeing the quality of pension schemes, will form an essential task and responsibility of the Belgian Presidency, admittedly after the homework in Gothenburg has been handed in.
In this framework, my Group is, in fact, giving its unqualified support to the decision to start formulating concrete goals on employment for older employees.
However, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, choices must be made in these areas too.
It is quite clear to me: this choice is not about brazenly discontinuing early retirement schemes or increasing the pensionable age, but rather about choosing to introduce flexible end-of-career schemes and to improve the quality of work.
This brings me to my final point, Mr President-in-Office: the quality of work.
Here too, we expect a great deal from the Council and the Commission, which has to provide us with indicators so as to, thanks to this open coordination, secure us not just more, but also better jobs.
Ladies and gentlemen, the quality of work, however, is not just a question of indicators and open coordination.
It is also a question of legislation.
We therefore expect an extra effort, both from the Commission and from the Council, to provide us with a revised directive on European works councils, within the framework of restructuring - which we are now experiencing once again - and to make a start on the directive on information and advice as a matter of urgency.
These too will help guarantee the quality of work, and we are relying on the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to do their bit.
Mr President, let me briefly comment on what has been said.
Firstly, I would like to thank you for the support you have expressed for the Swedish Presidency and the work which we are carrying out together with yourselves and, naturally, with the Commission, and which gave us a very good basis to work on ahead of the Stockholm Summit.
This means that we were well-placed to achieve success.
I will comment on the points you raised from two perspectives.
I want to talk firstly about foreign relations and secondly about the Lisbon Process, as my initial report was primarily structured in that way.
With regard to foreign relations, I am happy that so many people here have recognised that there is an aim on the part of the presidency to get the Union' s Member States to really work together when they are able to act together.
This is based on consensus, unanimity.
We are aware that not all of us within the Union agree on every issue, but on this issue we are agreed.
When we are able to put forward common principles, we must naturally also act together.
Naturally we attracted a great deal of attention in the media when we received President Putin as a guest.
I would not be surprised to see even greater attention from the media when we receive President Bush, but those who believe that in receiving these visitors we are seeking media attention are naturally mistaken about the fundamental work of the Union.
We have an obligation, we have a right, to take the initiative in our relations both with the United States and Russia.
Relations must be deepened and developed, and dialogue must be open.
It must be honest and it must be critical, but we must naturally, on the basis of our size and our strength, carry out this dialogue with very, very great self-confidence.
This is what this is about.
I am pleased that you realise that, during the Swedish Presidency, we are seeking to highlight joint action in foreign affairs also within the European Union and within the framework of the Council.
This is far from unimportant.
Now, a few words on the Lisbon Process.
Let me comment on the discussion on deregulation and liberalisation.
I am the Prime Minister of a country which has opened up many markets, which has liberalised and deregulated.
I primarily see positive effects of this, but I would be a very poor politician if I did not also recognise the difficulties in carrying out such a process.
This is a very large and fundamental reorganisation.
It is far from simple.
I have very great respect for the colleagues who, in their respective countries, are to begin this process in a number of central areas and deal with the political debate which many of us have already had in our countries.
It is no easy debate.
I believe that it would be an incredibly great mistake to force through decisions and so create a situation where these fundamental changes in many countries would immediately lead to extremely strong national opposition.
Therefore, I believe that the method we are using in the Lisbon Process is superior for this type of fundamental change in financial and political conditions.
I say this as a response to Mr Poettering of the Conservative Group, as I can see how the process will develop over time.
The process is heading in the right direction, and we are implementing it in such a way that we have the support of national political opinion in each country.
We can never ignore this.
I also wish to state that I myself do not wish to see deregulation and liberalisation unless the advantages created and the increased growth achieved are used to give ordinary people the chance to live better and richer lives.
We constantly have to maintain this balance.
Here I am talking to those who said that we have not produced any initiatives to combat unemployment.
Our work in this respect is characterised by the fact that unemployment is best combated by economic growth and economic development.
Without increased production, we will have no opportunities to successfully combat unemployment.
We can create various programmes, reduce working hours, carry out a large number of different initiatives - but for those people who are most hard pressed, this will always be a defensive programme.
If we are to be proactive in addressing unemployment, we must do so by increasing the cake by developing the economy.
This is why we have drawn up guidelines in Stockholm.
Several speakers have mentioned enlargement of the Union.
We are currently negotiating intensively with the active participation of the Commission.
As far as I can judge, the negotiations are successful, but they are not easy.
My task as President-in-Office of the Council is to ensure that the Union' s regulations are highlighted in the negotiations and that we run the negotiations so as to achieve a change in legislation, markets and political systems in the countries now seeking to join the Union.
This change must make their accession as painless and successful as possible.
These negotiations are difficult and we are in the middle of them.
I am hopeful that, in the negotiations in the spring during the Swedish Presidency, we shall achieve success that we will be able to describe as a breakthrough.
Regarding openness, the presidency and Parliament are in alliance.
I hope that we succeed.
I myself would agree with the criticism which Bertel Haarder makes of the situation.
These are not reasonable conditions for political work, and we have to create greater openness if our citizens are also to have a greater chance of becoming directly involved in what forms the basis of the political decisions.
I would also like to discuss the prior conditions for Sweden, as a small country, being able to contribute to the issue of EMU and other issues: but I do not intend to take up your time over this.
I will be happy to talk about this question again in a bilateral context.
What is important for us now is to jointly ensure that the Union' s economy is in as good a condition as possible on the day, in almost a year' s time, when the single European currency is introduced.
We all have an interest in this, whether we are participating in the currency union from the start or whether we will be joining later.
Success, which is what we are seeking, is to the advantage of the entire European economy.
Mr President, thank you once more for your many constructive contributions and points of view.
I would also like to thank the Commission for working so well with us in the run-up to the Stockholm Summit.
I look forward to meeting Parliament again following the Gothenburg Summit, where I hope we will be able to say that we have taken a step forward on enlargement, even though a great deal of work will remain to be done on that point.
Mr President, I shall be very brief in my reply because it differs only slightly from what Prime Minister Persson said.
The reaction to this summit of tempered optimism but awareness that difficult objectives have been achieved has been common to almost all of today's speeches, as has commitment to meeting the need for future progress and the even greater need to focus on action and implementation of decisions taken.
Having said that, I do acknowledge the objections raised and comments made by many Members on the issue of decision-making processes, on the need for new decision-making processes.
Mr Brok, Mr Poettering and Mr Segni made it clear, from the different areas of the House, that the decision-making processes observed during summits and in all our work must be strictly reformed in this lengthy review process which we have undertaken, due to be completed between the end of 2003 and early 2004.
This is a clear commitment made by Parliament and all of us.
Another general point, then, was covered by many speakers: on the one hand, the conviction that globalisation is absolutely essential, and not just a necessity but an extremely positive debate for Europe, but, on the other, the justified - genuine - fear of some of the effects of globalisation.
I cannot, in this Chamber, fail to make my deep concern known to Parliament at the way the excellent economic progress and the rise in employment which have taken place in recent years in Europe have been accompanied by increased disparity in the distribution of wealth in what could ultimately be called a social injustice indicator, which does not necessarily have to be part of the globalisation package.
Quite the contrary: it is possible to rectify the situation and combine globalisation and social justice.
This is a subject which requires a great deal of thought for, all too often, we confuse the two things: we believe, that is, that globalisation, the fact that we are opening up our economies, will automatically lead to a less equitable, wider disparity in the distribution of wealth.
This does not have to be the case at all.
Furthermore, another point emerged as a common concern, linked to the forthcoming Gothenburg Summit, and that is the adoption of a unanimous position on the Kyoto Protocol.
This is certainly not an attack on the United States, merely awareness that we must act responsibly.
And, as Europeans, we must have a general sense of responsibility towards all the citizens of the world.
I would like to end with one last point, which might appear minor but which I consider to be extremely important.
It concerns one of the most important issues dealt with at the Stockholm Summit, and that is the implications of the enlargement of financial market relations and the resulting relationship between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Mrs Randzio-Plath has raised this issue and rightly so, and I would like to respond briefly right here before Parliament, for it is extremely important.
I would like to make it clear that the agreement reached in Stockholm refers to a Decision on comitology, reproducing the 1999 Decision word for word - what is known colloquially as the Aerosol case - including the statements it contains and the Commission's statement.
In this case, the Commission did not declare in Stockholm that the entire securities sector should be considered to be a sensitive sector, as requested by certain States, but it did undertake to avoid going against predominant views which might emerge within the Council in the case - and only in the case - of particularly sensitive implementing measures. In other words, in particular, the Commission will assess each case individually, and I can therefore see no reason to change the current balance between the institutions in terms of delegated powers.
Indeed, Parliament will be able to comment on the distinction between the essential elements and the technical provisions of the measures proposed by the Commission.
Clearly, this distinction must be established through the usual procedure for codecision between Parliament and the Council.
In addition, Parliament will, and must, be informed on a regular basis by the Commission of the Securities Committee's proceedings and, If the European Parliament resolves that the draft measures submitted by the Commission exceed the implementing powers provided for in the framework legislation, the Commission commits itself to expeditiously re-examine those draft measures, taking the utmost account of Parliament's position.
There it is: we have to decide on the basis of concrete legislative proposals within the framework of the codecision procedure.
I wanted to point this out because it would be a shame for the progress of such an important matter as this, decided upon at Stockholm - the most important decision taken in Stockholm - to be hampered by our procedural problems or our difficulties in adopting a common position.
This must not happen: we must proceed with all transparency, for the very reason that the European citizens expect the decisions taken by the highest assembly, that is the decisions taken by the Council, then to be rapidly implemented, or Europe's credibility will fall even more.
This will be extremely important at the Gothenburg Council.
I hope that the preparations for the forthcoming summit will be made with the same diligence and the same transparency which characterised the Stockholm preparations because, ultimately, Gothenburg is Act II of the Stockholm Council: that is, it will end the series of reforms decided upon in Lisbon, reforms whose long-term compatibility must be assessed, which is something we are no longer in the habit of doing.
But if we do not learn to do this as well, all the decisions we take will have to be revised in the future.
Mr President, it was not only courteous of the Swedish Prime Minister to come here, but also rather courageous.
As so many speakers have said, on the economic front, Stockholm was a great disappointment.
Once again Heads of Government could only agree to set theoretical deadlines for ministers to liberalise markets in the future, rather than actually set the seal on agreements that should already have been made or reach those agreements themselves.
To coin a phrase, the liberalising talk is 'all spin and no delivery'.
We are witnessing serious under-performance by standards which Europe's socialist leaders have set themselves.
It is all a far cry from the spirit of the single market when the centre right ran Europe.
One of the major failures of the Stockholm Summit was in the foreign affairs field.
With the great events taking place in the world, it was as if the Stockholm Summit was ignoring them.
For example, the General Affairs Council on 19 March decided once again not to table a critical motion in the United Nations sub-committee in Geneva, dealing with human rights abuses in China.
Until 1997, every year the European Union did so.
Now the socialists are failing, it is business as usual.
Even more important - as Mr Poettering told the House earlier on, and other speakers have referred to this - last night the PPE-DE Group heard Yelena Bonner describe the situation in Russia today: Mr Putin came to Stockholm, Mr Persson gave him a cheque for EUR 100 million, the very next week Mr Putin begins yet another crack-down on the media.
There is now no single independent media channel in Russia.
This is a scandal.
I am very disappointed indeed that Mr Persson did not take the opportunity this morning to criticise President Putin for the way in which he is repressing the media in Russia, the way in which democracy is being rolled back.
This is our great neighbour to the east.
We must deal with it on a practical and political basis, but with frankness and determination.
God help us if the socialists had run Europe during the cold war.
(Loud applause from the right)
Mr President, God help us if the conservatives ever run Europe again.
I wish to concentrate on two issues which I know Parliament considers to be of the utmost importance, namely the Galileo project and the future of postal services.
Having the opportunity to speak in this debate gives me the chance to welcome not only the Council's conclusions on the creation of a single European sky, but its determination to submit proposals on slot allocation at Community airports to Parliament by June.
With regard to Galileo it is worth remembering that this programme was actually instigated by the Council in March 1998.
This commitment was emphasised by the Cologne Council and Feira when it was stated that strategic decisions had to be taken by December 2000.
But then, to be blunt, the Council, no doubt under pressure from finance ministers, got cold feet.
I accept that the cost of Galileo is around EUR 3 billion, which means the involvement of the private sector is essential, but the benefits to Europe in both economic and social terms will be immense.
We have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector.
What we need now is a political commitment from the Member States not only to push ahead with Galileo, but to push ahead in a positive and determined way, working alongside the private sector.
Earlier in the day Mr Poettering criticised the Council for not giving a timetable for the liberalisation of postal services.
I actually agree with the Council on this and would remind not only Mr Poettering, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, of the position Parliament took at its first reading on postal services a couple of months ago.
By an overwhelming majority it voted for a controlled, gradual liberalisation down to 150 000 with no end-date for liberalisation.
So when I read in the Stockholm conclusions that the Council wishes to work with Parliament, I welcome this.
But I would remind the Council that Parliament's position is clear, unambiguous and has been arrived at with a clear political consensus across political divides.
On post Parliament does not have a problem. The Council does.
This solution is clear: accept Parliament's position, abandon the extreme policies put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein and I am sure we can have an agreement on the future of postal services within days.
Mr President, I should like to begin by pointing out on the positive side that the Stockholm European Council has emphasised the strategy drawn up in Lisbon, and has even added to and strengthened it in certain concrete matters.
The importance placed on the Social Agenda is certainly very positive, particularly regarding the social security and health care systems, the setting of employment rates, the willingness to cut public subsidies (although I would have liked us to have gone further), the development of new technologies, or the decision to create a European Food Authority.
In contrast, as regards the liberalisation processes, Mr Prodi, serious asymmetries are being created within the European Union, and this urgently requires draft legislation to regulate intra-Community investments, as almost all the Parliamentary Groups reminded Mr Bolkestein yesterday.
I shall finish by referring in this context to the intention of creating a single European sky that has been put forward by both the presidency of the Council and that of the Commission, and I should like to say to Mr Prodi that we trust that the Commission will act in this matter with the determination and prudence needed in view of the commitments undertaken, and in any case in accordance with the Community acquis.
Part of the Community acquis too, Mr Prodi, is the Gibraltar clause, which does not date back to the eighteenth century but to a 1987 agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain, within which we must push forward in order to finalise this agreement in Gothenburg.
President.
As it is time to proceed to the vote, the debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
Mr President, I wish to inform the Bureau that, as a result of the initiative adopted by Parliament for the release of the Portuguese citizens being held hostage in Cabinda, one of these hostages was released yesterday. I wish to say, Mr President, that Parliament' s initiative played an important role in this hostage being released and that we must continue to do all that we can to ensure that the remaining Portuguese hostages in Cabinda are also finally released.
I welcome the progress made thus far.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
Mr President, normally any corrigenda to the various language versions are announced before the vote commences.
I understand that corrections are needed to the Spanish version.
Is the Bureau aware of this or not?
If it is, I would be grateful if they could be announced.
According to my information, there is a point in the Spanish version which has not been brought into line with the basic English version.
Mr President, I intervene in the same sense as my colleague to stress that in the draft resolution in the Blak report - and of course I am intervening after checking with the rapporteur - I want to state for the record first that it is the English version that is authentic. Secondly, in conclusion number 8(ii), under the title Flax, there should be a language correction not only in the Spanish but also in most other languages: where in English it says 'competent authorities' it should be translated in Spanish as 'autoridades competentes' , and the same in all the other languages.
Mr President, I agree that the English version is the authentic one, and with regard to Mr Izquierdo' s last statement I must say that for us 'autoridades competentes' [competent authorities] and 'autoridades de control' [controlling authorities] is still the same thing, in both cases they are the Autonomous Communities, but if the English version speaks of 'competent authorities' we agree it should be so.
Mr President, I want to reiterate that this proposal was negotiated in Spanish and in English and that therefore the only thing Mr PomÃ©s' s intervention is trying to do is generate confusion.
I maintain that the corresponding Spanish translation of the English text is 'autoridades competentes' , because that is the truth and that is what is correct.
Mr President, I think there has been a problem with the translations into Spanish, because in the Folias report too, there are clear differences between the English text, which is the authentic one, and the Spanish text.
In particular, I should like the translation of Section 19 to be reviewed.
There may be problems in general, but particularly Section 19 in Spanish is totally different from the English original.
This proposal for a regulation seeks to temporarily stabilise the degressivity of specific aid to Portugal for cereals, by maintaining the same level of aid for the 2001/2002 season as for this year.
This decision, with which we agree, was taken under the Portuguese Presidency of the EU, and seeks to maintain the cofinancing of aid for one year, thereby compensating for the collapse in income of Portuguese farmers.
Nevertheless, given the pressures from the CAP on farmers' incomes and bearing in mind the needs of Portuguese farmers, stabilising degressivity should cover the whole period of the current financial framework, in other words, until the 2005/2006 season.
Furthermore, an upper limit must be imposed for the stabilisation of cofinanced aid, twice the limit of the simplified system, for example, as a means of making savings that could finance either the extension of stabilisation or the creation of support mechanisms for the production of protein crops, or the establishment of a conversion programme for alternative crops to cereals, in order to make the best use of land that cannot be so intensively farmed.
It is worth pointing out that many small farmers in Portugal are prevented from receiving proper aid for not selling all of their produce.
These farmers should be able to use their produce for on-farm consumption, which would guarantee their right to aid, if, for example, they base their application on the income brackets of their farms.
Trakatellis report (A5-0104/2001)
Mr President, as the UK Labour delegation spokesperson on health, I would like to give an explanation of vote on the Trakatellis report.
Although there are many good features in this report which deserve support - and we support them - given the voting list method of voting en bloc we have followed the PSE position throughout.
However, I would like to make it clear that the proposal for the centre mentioned in the Trakatellis report gives us great concern.
We feel that this proposal is ill-thought through, the cost implications ill-considered and the legal implications could possibly delay all that is good in this report.
As I said last night, and I will say again, health is an issue which connects with the citizen.
Therefore, it is important that we get this proposal through as quickly as possible.
I look forward to the second reading.
Mr President, as the elected representative of the Pensioners' Party to this Parliament, I was very happy to vote for the Trakatellis report, a very important report.
I was worried about what I was going to say in my explanation of vote because I did not dream at all last night, and I was very heavy eyed when I woke up.
However, precisely because I was very tired, I closed my eyes a little while ago and had a vision.
I saw Mrs Trakatellis as if in a dream.
However, she looked like a pill, and there was writing on the pill which said "for use against cardiovascular diseases", while other types of pills, also Trakatellis pills, bore the words "for use against neuro-psychiatric disorders", "for use against children's diseases", etc.
I therefore saw Mrs Trakatellis' important report as the sole means of curing the diseases of all the citizens of Europe.
Congratulations Mrs Trakatellis!
We consider that questions concerning public health and health care must be determined at national and regional level.
We therefore do not wish to develop the work of the EU in the area into something which increasingly controls the actions of nations in more and more detail.
We consider that with an increased budget and the foundation of a new Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre, the Trakatellis report is heading in such a direction.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Following recent events and their serious impact on public health and the food chain, such as "mad cows" , dioxin, the depleted uranium bombs dropped on Yugoslavia and a host of other incidents, we find it very hard to believe the EU's professed interest in, or the sincerity of, its declarations of good intent regarding public health.
The EU has confirmed beyond all doubt that any intervention on its part is designed mainly to allay fears, not deal with the problems which its very policies are creating for large swathes of the population.
The EU's intentions in the particularly sensitive area of public health are clearly set out in the conclusions of the recent Council summit in Stockholm.
Thus, it declares war on much that the workers have fought for (by calling for spending cuts, budgetary discipline, personal responsibility etc.) and, in the same breath, announces that it intends to "modernise the European social model" which, in the health sector, translates into more private health services and greater personal responsibility for individual needs, thereby benefiting private-sector initiative and the huge economic interests at work in the health sector and social systems.
In its specific action plan in the public health sector for 2001-2006, the ÃU caters to the aims and needs of big business and the monopolies in the health sector.
It is no accident that there is no mention or specification whatsoever of the state' s obligation in any area or for any aspect of these issues.
This strategy on the part of the ÃU makes health totally dependent on the laws of the market, cost considerations, profits and returns.
Health systems are now seen as a drain on public funds - rather than an investment in human resources - which need to adhere to the terms of budgetary discipline.
In Community-speak, this means cutting back on health spending, shifting the responsibility and the cost on to the people, strengthening private initiative and turning health care into a profit-making activity, the aim being to convert the health sector into a 'competitive market' and secure the best possible terms for the powerful monopolies to win market shares and achieve market penetration while, at the same time, reducing employment and social rights and everything the workers have fought for in the health sector to the lowest common denominator and cutting back on public spending in this sector.
The European Parliament' s rapporteur takes the same line as the Commission.
Thus, despite quite rightly referring to serious and persistent health problems, he makes no mention of the real social causes of or the circumstances which aggravate the health and threaten the lives of our citizens, such as deteriorating working conditions, alternating and night shifts, the dramatic drop in the standard of living of large swathes of the population, the spread of poverty and unemployment, the repercussions of unbridled, profit-driven liberalisation of the market on the food chain, the deterioration in the environment etc.
In the rapporteur' s own words, "health should not be considered as a commodity, which can be the subject of political or financial compromises" and on this we are in perfect agreement.
Unfortunately, he then contradicts his good intentions by using his report to commend and back the EU's aggressive, anti-grass roots policy in the public health sector.
This is why we shall not be voting for the report, preferring instead to stand by the workers and help them organise their resistance movement and fight for a proper, high-quality public health service which benefits the people.
We support the rapporteur' s action on this proposal, on two points.
First, the harmonisation of the health policies of European countries would be a sensible decision, provided that it is in an upward direction, and second, the budget planned for a health policy at European Union level is ridiculously small.
Disease prevention and early diagnosis of cancers and other serious diseases, where early treatment can reduce the risks, should be one of the basic principles of the Union if it is more concerned with people than with the flow of capital and goods.
This is not the case, however.
The amendments proposed to Parliament, some of which are a step in the right direction, would not be enough, even if they were adopted, to make the policy recommended by the Commission acceptable.
A valid health policy requires resources that the Commission is refusing to provide itself with.
We have therefore abstained from voting on this report, though we have voted on certain proposals.
The 2001Â­2006 health programme is a fine theoretical document, which follows the philosophy of the public health Eurocrats, although it is somewhat cautious on some issues, specifically:
human public health is an issue which is crucial to sustainable human development. Therefore, all public and private services should exist to serve it and regional coordination and funding should clearly demonstrate the importance of human health without undermining national responsibilities;
therapeutic and diagnostic measures must not be considered to be exclusively commercial and industrial activities.
It should be noted that this component of public health has been treated as a separate commercial area and is currently controlled by multinationals, which undermines national and regional interests.
We will not, therefore, be able to have a good public health programme until we change this situation;
The programme avoids talking about factors for health in the workplace and for workers' health.
We cannot start from the premise that the direct and indirect costs of people working in poor conditions should be met by society, leaving the capitalists with the increased profits from having their employees work in such conditions.
Lastly, I must mention the need to make more progress in protecting human public health by increasing the programme' s funding, amongst other things, as stated in the amendments for which we have voted.
I voted against the Trakatellis report, my reasons, which also apply to my fellow CSU members from Bavaria, being as follows: the European Community is still not responsible for health policy and can therefore only coordinate.
Parliament calls in its text for a "Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre" (HCMC) to be set up, operated and extended.
We vehemently rejected this because this is a matter for the Member States.
In addition, there is a series of calls which go against the principle of subsidiarity, such as recommendations for school education programmes, quality standards applicable to health and training and further training.
The text adopted by Parliament also contains no specification that the limited funds available should be used in a sensible and targeted manner.
Stauner report (A5-0112/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Stauner report, although I would have liked to have been able to be more whole-hearted about it.
Why is that?
Because, when I meet the pensioner, Mr Rossi, in Bergamo, he always asks me: "What do you do at the European Parliament?", and the pensioner, Mr Verdi, asks me every afternoon: "You spend so much money: where does it all go to?", and so on and so forth all day long.
My life is one continual question from citizens and pensioners, in particular, asking what we spend Europe's money on.
What I want, therefore, is for us to ensure, in future, that we monitor all this money we spend as well. Of course, we do spend it wisely, but what on?
Let us therefore verify whether this money is used to bring practical benefit to the European citizens.
Blak report (A5-0113/001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted against the discharge to the Commission for the 1999 financial year. Why is that?
Because I hope that the Commission will make much, much greater efforts.
But to do what? To resolve the problems of pensioners and elderly people in Europe.
And how? In totally the opposite way to that which I regret to say is continuously advocated, not just by the Commission, but also in this House and by the Council.
I should like to make it clear in this explanation of vote that workers do not want to work forever: they want to reach the point where they can receive a pension soon, a good pension which is enough to live on, in order to make way for young people.
The Pensioners' Party is totally against any attempt by the European governments or Europe to extend the length of citizens' working lives. Rather, we are calling for the length of time spent working to be reduced and the length of time spent at leisure, when it is not obligatory for citizens to work, to be increased.
Naturally we have voted against giving any discharge to the European Commission.
We disapprove of both past budgets and the future budget, and of the very function of a Commission that is entirely in the service of industrial and financial groups.
Our negative votes on individual points are merely a continuation of this general lack of confidence.
Mr Blak' s report contains many points of criticism with regard to the European Union' s expenditure and the responsibility for this.
According to his recommendations, a great deal needs to change yet.
Further to this justified criticism, the logical conclusion would be for Parliament once again to vote against the discharge of the previous budget year.
Voting against is Parliament' s only means of exercising power in order to bring about change and to challenge the Council' s and the Commission' s arrogance.
Voting in favour, following a series of pleas, is not such a powerful weapon. That would be a mere signal that everything can simply stay the same, even if there is little or no change ultimately.
Does approval mean that, after a few demands and critical remarks, we will turn a blind eye to a number of fraud cases, such as the fraud case in Spain on which an OLAF report has been published recently?
I will not grant approval until these instances of fraud have been resolved, the perpetrators penalised and the money concerned paid back.
Until such time, it is not wise to trust to the good intentions of the new European Commission which took up office in the autumn of 1999.
To my great surprise, the otherwise so critical rapporteur now proposes to grant approval. I do not share his view on this.
I voted against discharge for the following reasons: I welcome the explanation given to plenary by the Commissioner for budgets on the FlÃ©chard case on 3 April 2001.
However, this alone is not tantamount to a fresh start in the Commission' s policy on dealing with cases of fraud.
There is no clear statement that the way in which the case was handled after January 1994 was illegal.
Nor has there been any significant change in the Commission' s inadequate information policy vis-Ã -vis Parliament compared with the 1998 discharge.
I find it unacceptable that the budgetary authority called for but, as the rapporteur details in annex 2 to his report, failed to receive 11 audit reports, including all the delegations' audit reports.
This inadequate Commission information policy is exacerbated by the framework agreement which only allows the rapporteur access to documents.
I also feel that I must abide by the resolution passed by plenary in December 2000 on the so-called Morgan report to the effect that, in future, discharge must be postponed if the documents requested have not all been submitted by the Commission.
According to the rapporteur' s own information, this applies here.
van der Laan report (A5-0108/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for this report, which regulates and comments on the granting of discharge to a number of European Union bodies, and I would like to explain why I voted for one specific heading: the heading on the budget set aside for the Committee of the Regions.
Some people - and I will tell you who, the British conservatives in particular - are calling for the Committee of the Regions to be abolished.
I do not support them.
In my opinion, the regions in Europe should be more highly valued and their importance stressed and appreciated because I feel that the future of Europe is, on the one hand, Europe, and, on the other, the regions of Europe.
The national States have to decide to take a step backwards.
We cannot have everything: therefore, let us hear less of the national States, and more of the regions and more of Europe.
SeppÃ€nen report (A5-0097/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, the SeppÃ€nen report comments on the abolition of the ECSC.
I have had a passion for Europe since I was ten years old, and my heart bleeds to read this report on how to liquidate the ECSC, the European Coal and Steel Community.
In stating that I voted for the report, I would therefore like to propose to Mr SeppÃ€nen that he should organise a day of - joyful, enjoyable - commemoration, full of hope for the future, of that major initial step which was the signing of the ECSC and Euratom Treaties.
RÃŒhle report (A5-0109/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I told you just now that I had dropped off for a moment.
Well, I had a day-dream - as opposed to a real dream - on precisely the RÃŒhle report, which gives me the opportunity to explain why I voted for the motion.
I was Gulliver-Fatuzzo, a minuscule man, and I was surrounded by giants.
Who were these giants?
They were an African, an Asian, a South American and a man from the Bahamas: in other words, they were the inhabitants of the developing countries covered by this report.
These giants bent down towards the dwarf-like Fatuzzo and said: "Listen: do you think that we are the countries which need to develop or is it that you, the peoples of Europe, the modern peoples, appear to be developed countries but, in actual fact, have tiny brains?
You are the ones who need to develop, for we are already developed enough!"
Hermange report (A5-0084/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, in my speech yesterday, I explained to Commissioner Diamantopoulou that I would like her to pass on the requests that our entire Parliament is making to the national States for there to be genuine equality in Europe for people with disabilities.
In fact, this morning, during the forty winks which I have already mentioned, I saw myself having dinner with Mrs Diamantopoulou, who has thus far not taken up the invitation I extended to her.
In any case, in my dream, I was having dinner with her, and she said to me: "Look, Mr Fatuzzo, I have succeeded in having the Italian law abolished which prevents people with disabilities who are over 65 years old receiving a disability allowance.
Look, Mr Fatuzzo, I have succeeded in getting the European Union to adopt the regulation which makes it possible for people with disabilities to move around within the Union without losing their pensions."
It was only a dream, Mr President!
The European Commission' s proposal is based on the ruling class' s familiar tack of providing so-called equal opportunities and free access to people with disabilities, as can be seen from the title of the report in question, "Towards a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities" .
The effort to mask the class aspects of the problem is obvious.
How can a child with disabilities from a poor lower-class family and a child from a rich family have equal opportunities?
It is also quite deliberate, because any positive measures proposed in the report (design standards, new services etc.) will basically be enjoyed by disabled people from the wealthy classes.
Finally, what is interesting is that the requirements of people with disabilities have been commercialised in all areas, e.g. in education, on the market for technical aids, in securing cheap labour etc. And the odd positive measure, such as access to transport, the recognition of national cards to promote freedom of movement in the Member States of the ÃU or the facility to transfer disability allowances from one state to another, does nothing to change this.
People with disabilities are the first and the most tragic victims of the policy to cut social spending on health and welfare and abolish social security systems.
Typically, not one EU text mentions the need for social spending in order to address the problems of people with disabilities and, here too, we must rely on non-governmental organisations, volunteers and the family to deal with the acute social problems of people with disabilities.
They may go on ad infinitum about new services, technical aids etc., but nowhere does it state that these will be provided free of charge or that the cost of purchasing them will be subsidised.
The only good thing is that employers are subsidised for taking on people with disabilities.
And yet, despite the fact that employment subsidy programmes have been around for years, unemployment among the disabled is nearly 70%, according to periodic studies published by independent organisations.
As far as special education and training are concerned, apart from a few generally positive but non-binding proposals relating mainly to tertiary education, the text is based on the unscientific approach of placing pupils with disabilities in mainstream schools, ostensibly with a view to integrating them into society as a whole.
The authors of the report must surely be aware of the fact that this experiment failed in Germany and France, where a series of special schools were closed at the beginning of the 1980s, only to open again at the end of the 1980s, in order to prevent a social outcry.
How can deaf, blind or paraplegic children attend lessons in downtrodden state schools, play etc. when specialists say that even special books are needed for blind and deaf children?
No one dared to apply these measures in England, because there was a huge reaction from universities, associations of the disabled etc. All the integration approach does is to cut social spending, shift the financial burden onto the family and provide the disabled with a second-rate education.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will not be voting in favour of the report.
I congratulate my French Conservative colleague, Mme Hermange, on her imaginative and constructive report.
Conservatives in the UK have voted in favour.
Member States need to be much more proactive in recognising the special needs of the disabled, and we hope that they will very much take on board the thrust as well as some of the specific ideas in this report.
However, we urge that the report must not be used as a lever to try and harmonise social security benefits across the EU: this has to remain a Member State competence.
We particularly applaud two firsts today - the appearance of the report in Braille in three languages, and the use of sign language in the debate.
The EPP/ED Group is not just talking about the needs of the disabled: we are actually doing something positive about it.
In speaking with regard to the issue of people with disabilities in Europe, we should always start with the premise that this issue is firstly and foremost a civil and human rights issue.
We have a duty not just to pontificate about rights, but to actively encourage access to education, training, employment and opportunity.
We can go back over previous resolutions and reports from this house concerning people with disabilities.
However, the same basic barriers and problems still exist.
Some Member States and some NGOs have valiantly brought forward innovative initiatives to remove the barriers and obstacles to equal opportunity for all.
However, some still see this as a specific sector rather than as a reflection of our society' s failure to give opportunity for all.
At the dawn of the 21st century, we should send a message to the world that the EU recognises the ability in all, the right to equal treatment and equal access to opportunity.
In supporting this report, I commend to members the points concerning the role of organisations dealing with disabilities and other NGOs who have been powerful advocates on their behalf, and who have listened to the voices of the people and who grasp the opportunity to change the world for the better for all of us.
We should work towards ensuring that by 2003, which is the European Year for disabled persons, we have guaranteed that the majority of those barriers have been removed.
I warmly welcome Mrs Hermange's report on a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities.
It is crucial that we in the European Parliament support such important measures to improve equal opportunities for people with disabilities.
This report calls for an equal treatment directive covering a range of areas such as employment, education and training, transport, the information society and consumer policy.
It also underlines the need to mainstream disability issues into all policies.
The EU Heads of State or Government at the Lisbon and Stockholm Summits aimed to create the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by quantitative and qualitative improvement of employment and of greater social cohesion.
However, we have a desperate shortage of skilled workers in the IT sector across the European Union.
Surely it is pure common sense to train and make use of all our citizens so that we have a more skilled workforce to fulfil this ambition.
I strongly believe that those with disabilities will be indispensable in this sector.
The manpower is available, we just need to introduce effective training and ensure there is no discrimination in allocating the jobs.
The need is there, the manpower is there - we must seize the opportunity and respond to this challenge of a new economy.
I fully support measures to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in all areas of life ranging from employment to IT.
This will not only transform the lives of many people with disabilities who will now be encouraged to play as full a role in society as everyone else, but it will also transform the economy of the European Union and make it truly the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world based on greater social cohesion.
I welcome the fact that the communication implements the process set out in Declaration 22, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which states that, when measures are drafted to create the single market, the needs of people with disabilities will be taken into account.
It refers to the 1996 communication concerning equal opportunities for people with disabilities, recognising their rights, rather than regarding them as people in need of charity.
This is a fundamental change in attitude which should be emphasised.
This initiative seeks to fill the gaps in the strategy for incorporating the rights of people with disabilities into Community policies in the fields of transport, access to public buildings and public areas, the information society, research and development and consumer policy.
The concept of people with disabilities includes all types of disability, whether physical, mental or sensory.
This is another important fundamental change.
The lack of statistics on this subject has been apparent since 1998.
In order to remedy it, Eurostat will be supplying three studies: a new module of the survey on the workforce in March 2003, the publication, at the beginning of 2001, of indicators that can be used as a basis for analysing the level of participation of disabled persons in the employment market, cultural life, and a broadening of the scope of the survey by the Community household panel on the daily obstacles perceived in each household.
The report makes a useful point in emphasising that the initial barriers to people with disabilities arise mainly during childhood.
Following the Luxembourg Charter on education for all, first priority should be given to parents where education is concerned, so as to give them the means of having a real choice, while respecting their family values and traditions.

Outcome of the European Council of 23/24 March 2001 in Stockholm including the situation in the Middle East (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the outcome of the European Council of 23/24 March 2001 in Stockholm including the situation in the Middle East.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry that we did not manage to conclude the debate this morning, as a rounded overview depended on it.
I think that the Stockholm Summit set the wrong priorities.
Too much social and education policy - matters which, according to the Treaties on European Union, are not its concern - and too little market liberalisation.
The liberalisation of the energy markets was blocked by my country and by France.
As for the liberalisation of air space, we are still wrangling over how to deal with Gibraltar airport, meaning that umpteen thousand tourists will again be left sitting in airports this summer due to delayed flights.
And all the while, Stockholm was busy setting specifications for social and education policy!
It is unacceptable.
Europe is putting the cart before the horse.
It needs to continue with its liberalisation policy so that the markets can develop in the consumers' interest.
This also qualifies as consumer and social policy because more competition means cheaper prices.
As far as social and education policy per se are concerned, we should again abide strictly by the principle of subsidiarity and leave it to the Member States to put flesh on the bones of these concepts.
Europe is not culturally homogenous, nor should it become so.
Therein lies our strength because, on the contrary, Europe thrives on its diversity.
I think that Europe should stop wasting its energy and should again focus on tasks which it is able to carry out.
The next Council in Gothenburg in June will give the Heads of State or Government an opportunity to do so.
I hope that they will make use of it for the good of Europe.
Mr President, at the beginning of this discussion, I was reminded by Mr Dupuis of the moral depths to which I had sunk with my report on Russia.
I harbour no hard feelings towards him for saying that, and I remain faithful to this dual-track policy, also politically speaking.
With regard to the Russian Federation, it is, in my opinion, very judicious always to talk in no uncertain terms, even if this involves Chechnya.
We therefore regret that the presidency in Stockholm failed immediately to refute the statements by Mr Putin, who draws parallels between the conflict in Macedonia and that in Chechnya, and did not substantiate our stance.
I believe that our Russian colleagues respond better to tough talking than evasive behaviour.
Furthermore, it appears to me to be of the utmost importance, with regard to Russia, to underline how important matters such as the northern dimension are - no need to convince Sweden of this - but also how important Kaliningrad is becoming, especially as it will form an enclave in the European Union where the rules for the inhabitants will need to be adapted in such a way that they, for example, will benefit from the Schengen acquis.
In this day and age, in which Schengen is becoming increasingly computerised, this should be child's play, and it should also be possible for the citizens of Kaliningrad to benefit from the regulation on obtaining visas.
With regard to the Balkans, I am delighted that the Serbian police had the courage to arrest Milosevic.
I hope the SFOR stabilisation force will pluck up the same courage to arrest Karadzic, for now that Belgrade has been able to take this step, we cannot afford to lag behind in Bosnia.
The Council must therefore exert pressure on all those who are responsible for SFOR to arrest Karadzic.
It is also clear that the Serbian Head of State cannot be treated differently from any other Head of State in this respect, simply because his actions have been more evil.
I believe it is absolutely vital that he should be brought to The Hague, and that Serbia should certainly not form an exception in this respect.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals made by Alexander Lamfalussy on the type of legislative process needed in connection with the implementation of the financial services package are a step in the right direction because, for the first time, a clear distinction has been made here between the law, the directive, the regulation passed by the Council and Parliament and the technical implementation of the directive.
As a result, adjustments to new developments in the technical sector can be made much more quickly than was the case in the past.
The Heads of State or Government decided that the European Economic Area should become the most modern and the most competitive economic area, and this calls for a modern legislative procedure.
If what has been thought up here later proves its worth, it can be applied in other areas during the technical legislative procedure, perhaps including agriculture.
So what exactly is the problem?
The problem is that even technical implementation, i.e. even the regulations issued on this basis, often conceal problems for our citizens.
Here policy must be able to intervene and pull these points back into the decision-making process of the policy.
When this happens, given that it is a codecision procedure, the European Parliament must have the same rights as the Council.
What was agreed in Stockholm is a good agreement between the Commission and the Council, but Parliament has still been left out, which is why we need further negotiations in order to bring about a result which will also satisfy Parliament.
Mr President, I fully subscribe to the intervention by Mr Von Wogau and I shall make some additional remarks.
The Lamfalussy report is based on one sure fact: the legislative procedure we have is too slow and prevents us from shaping legislation to market needs in time.
What the Lamfalussy report does not say is that the point where legislation on this matter normally gets bogged down is in the Council.
Therefore I think the telling-off was aimed at the wrong culprit.
Secondly, the Lamfalussy report tries to solve this problem by delegating the drawing up of enforcement measures to a stocks and shares committee in which the Council and Commission do not lose an iota of the power they had, while Parliament' s power is cut back.
In my opinion, the solution prescribed may generate a lack of confidence which, in the long term, will result in an even slower process than we have had until now.
What Parliament is asking is that when a rule of enforcement goes too far in relation to general principles, it must not be seen as a mandatory rule but as an unlawful one.
We are not asking the Commission to take our opinion into consideration; if the rule goes too far, the rule is not a rule.
That is what the theory of the mandate says, which I learnt in Roman Law, or the theory of the delegation of powers, which I learnt in Political Law.
But perhaps the most important thing in this deviation of the Lamfalussy report, which has been taken up by the Stockholm Council, is the intergovernmental deviation to the detriment of the Community method of drawing up rules, and secondly, and even more importantly, the desire to speed up the liberalisation of the internal financial services market without, at the same time, adjusting the rules and measures that provide controls or safeguards.
Under these conditions we could find ourselves with a hypermarket with no political control, in which the nation states are subordinated to semi-political decisions made by economic agents that would move with absolute freedom around the Union.
We had more or less the same discussion before the Single European Act, when fortunately Mrs Thatcher' s ideas did not triumph.
Mr President, a decision with serious consequences for Europe and its information society will be taken tomorrow.
I am counting on a 'Yes' to Galileo and on the insight of the Council of Transport Ministers.
We need a unanimous political vote and no more beating about the bush.
The critics still around should be told that the public-private partnership is feasible provided there is a clear political vote.
Military use may be possible, but it is not a prerequisite.
The infrastructure created by Galileo will have a much higher added value in the future than other previous infrastructure measures.
Technologically-minded young people in Europe will find attractive new jobs through Galileo.
Europe' s high tech industry will be at the top of the world league in this forward-looking sector.
The so-called market value of Galileo increases in indirect proportion to the start-up capital needed.
We must be able to insist on the European negotiating principle of burden sharing in this sector too.
It should not be too painful for the Member States to meet each other half way under these circumstances; on the contrary it should be a piece of cake.
We must do the job properly now!
Tomorrow will be too late!
Our biggest competitor, the USA, is laughing all the way to the bank and is delighted at every setback in Europe.
After all, we still need seven or eight years to roll out.
Presidents Persson and Prodi rightly and emphatically drew our attention to this new technological opportunity for a modern Europe at the start of this morning' s debate.
I repeat: Galileo is a gateway to a European information society and I expect the Council of Transport Ministers to perceive it as such tomorrow.
Mr President, on the Galileo project I would like to seek some clarification from the Commission and the Council on important issues which need to be addressed before the definitive phase of the project can be approved.
The Memorandum of Understanding signalling the provisional funding from private bodies of EUR 200 million needs further explanation.
Could the Commission therefore give specific examples of some of the businesses which have agreed to the funding?
Could the Commission also confirm reports that unless a firm political decision is taken on the definitive phase by June 2001, then such engagement of funding by private industry will become obsolete?
Could the Commission also comment in this regard on the lack of a political commitment to come out of the Stockholm Summit?
Surely vague rhetoric will not suffice when billions of euro are at stake and the deadline, according to the Commission's timetable, is less than three months away?
In the interests of transparency, may I call on the Commission to make absolutely clear its intentions with regard to the funding of this project and whether, in the absence of substantial private-sector interest, it will fund the project solely from the EU budget, including the EUR 220 million it will cost to maintain the project per annum?
Could the Commission also provide an up-to-date breakdown of the contributions foreseen from individual Member States?
On development, is the Commission aware that whilst the EU has been spending millions on Galileo the US has been updating its existing technology?
Could the Commission justify why Galileo will only be used for civilian purposes, as it seems absurd that the EU decides to build its own satellite navigation system, yet denies its military capacity?
In conclusion, launching satellites is a very expensive business.
We need firm assurances that investments in the Galileo project will produce an adequate return.
Fundamental questions and less than three months to go.
Unless the Commission comes forward immediately with some answers on this project, we in the EU run the risk of appearing amateurish and irresponsible.
I therefore urge the Commission and Council to consider these points.
At a cost of billions to the taxpayer, to whom we are directly responsible, we are entitled to some answers.
I have received seventeen motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Area of freedom, security and justice
The next item is the joint debate on
two oral questions to the Council (B5-0157/2001) and Commission (B5-0158/2001) by Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the annual debate 2000 on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice
and
Council and Commission statements on illegal immigration and the running aground of the "East Sea" off the French coast with around 1 000 Kurdish immigrants on board.
Mr President, today we are debating the annual report on the area of freedom, security and justice created at the Tampere Summit in October 1999.
I think we should in fact call it an area of justice, freedom and security, because justice is the cornerstone of our European Union, which sees itself as a Community of justice.
We made two important steps forward in Nice, which we welcome: first, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was adopted and should now be made legally binding and, secondly, the reform of the European Court of Justice; these are two of the piÃšces de rÃ©sistance of the Nice Treaty.
Nonetheless, Europe as a Community of justice still has a long way to go, especially as regards cross-border judicial collaboration in civil and criminal matters and - and I think this is most important - in human and civil rights, precisely because the Charter of Fundamental rights is still not binding.
And, of course, being a Community of justice also means that we require not only that candidate countries comply with the acquis communautaire, but that we implement and comply with our own resolutions and legal acts.
Hence, our main question to the Council and to the Commission is, what is the current state of play as regards the implementation of the agreements and resolutions which form part of the acquis communautaire, what is the timetable here and why are there still so many delays in this area?
The second issue is freedom.
Freedom is a product of justice.
Freedom is based on human dignity.
But, to prevent freedom from being abused, we need security, because without security and without justice, freedom is the law of the strongest.
We do not want a law of the strongest, we want a law of the weakest, which is why we need a security policy based on justice.
There are considerable deficits in the cross-border fight against crime, in collaboration in judicial matters and in the unification of law.
In this sense, I should like to call on the Council to expand Europol without delay, to make some headway at long last with parliamentary control of Europol, to finalise the establishment of the European police academy in coming weeks - here too there have been delays, even if the Commission had positive developments to report yesterday - and to ensure that there are common European border controls.
The European Parliament suggested this on my initiative three years ago.
I am grateful that a few Member States are now pressing in the Council for uniform border controls on the external borders of the European Union.
But we also want to ask the Council in this extremely important debate exactly how it sees its responsibility vis-Ã -vis the European Parliament.
We have begun excellent collaboration with the Commission and with Commissioner Vitorino but we have identified a number of clear deficits as regards cooperation in the area of justice and internal affairs.
We are holding today' s debate without a written annual report or any documents on the part of the Council on what has been done and still needs to be done in this crucial political area.
The Commission scoreboard here is exemplary.
But there is no annual report from the Council on what happened in the year 2000 in this crucial area.
I think that Parliament should be properly informed and taken into account and that Parliament needs to be more involved in the crucial area of justice and internal affairs.
We can see crucial deficits on the part of the Council here.
You cannot build a citizens' Europe and yet bypass the elected representatives of the people, namely us parliamentarians.
Finally, I should like to comment on the sensitive area of asylum law.
What we are lacking here - as in justice and internal affairs as a whole - is a strategic approach on the part of the Council.
We have a plethora of often contradictory initiatives from the individual states.
We have a multitude of individual approaches, but still no strategic approach to a common asylum policy, a common immigration policy or a division of the burden, a division of the numbers between the Member States.
We call on the Council to make good these deficits.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for inviting myself and my colleague Mrs Klingvall.
It is a great honour to be able to talk to you today.
The European Parliament is a very important player in European integration and the Swedish Presidency places great emphasis on having a good relationship with you.
We hope we have been able to demonstrate this ambition in part, particularly in meeting committees in Stockholm.
This is a very relevant area which we are discussing today.
Studies clearly show that judicial cooperation is close to the heart of European citizens.
Today, organised crime largely transcends national borders, not least because of the development of new technology.
There are justified demands and higher expectations from the European citizens that we really will deliver results, in both the field of justice and home affairs.
As you possibly know, on justice issues we currently have the heaviest legislation programme within the whole Union.
In the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions from the Tampere Summit the EU has put forward a very ambitious plan for how we are to succeed in achieving an area of freedom, security and justice.
Implementation is, as you know, now at a very intense stage.
As you also know, the Treaty on European Union lays down that each year the European Parliament is to hold a debate on the progress which has been made in the areas covered by Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
Although the Treaty only refers to the third pillar, I and my colleagues do not wish to restrict the debate to questions concerning the third pillar.
Often there is an intimate link between issues falling under the first and third pillars.
In general it can be said that the year 2000, which is what we are reporting on today, is year one of the post-Tampere period.
As I said, Tampere meant a major step forward in justice and home affairs, and a very ambitious programme was adopted.
I would like to begin by briefly mentioning some of the progress made in the field of justice during 2000.
In that year the Justice and Home Affairs Council passed around twenty legal instruments, eight of which were regulations and three conventions.
Action plans have been adopted for almost all areas of activity on justice and home affairs.
Over and above this the Council adopted over thirty conclusions, resolutions, recommendations and reports.
Progress was made on a number of issues by the very successful French and Portuguese presidencies.
Decisions were reached in several important areas in terms of combating economic crime.
A decision was passed on protection of the Euro, and at the joint meeting of JHA/Ecofin in Luxembourg on 17 October, a number of important decisions were adopted, e.g. concerning money laundering.
We took the first step in the process towards setting up Eurojust, which we consider an incredibly important aspect in the fight against organised crime.
We made major efforts in the fight against IT crime, e.g. by adopting a decision on combating child pornography on the Internet.
Furthermore, we succeeded in developing the principle of mutual recognition by adopting a programme of measures regarding mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases.
Several decisions were also passed to improve cooperation in the field of civil law, for example, on the service of documents, insolvency and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters.
Having said this I would like to focus on the question posed by Mr Posselt.
I will attempt to respond to the parts concerning justice and home affairs, while my colleague Mrs Klingvall will reply to the questions concerning asylum and immigration.
Mr President, part of the question asked concerns the dialogue between the institutions and the measures which have been planned to make this dialogue more efficient and more clearly define the relationship between the institutions, the Member States and, for example, Europol and Eurojust.
The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Conclusions have meant major changes in the field of justice and home affairs.
As I said earlier, ambitious plans have been laid down and the rate of work is increasing.
Not only the scope but also the character of cooperation has changed.
The institutions have partly taken on new roles and the way they work is being redesigned.
We are in the middle of the implementation of Tampere, and we can identify certain areas in which all the institutions are adapting to new conditions.
It is my firm conviction that setting up an area of freedom, security and justice requires close cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and it is in this spirit that the Swedish Presidency wishes to act.
The Treaty provides a clear framework for formal relations between the Council and the European Parliament when legal instruments and other instruments are being drawn up in the field of justice and home affairs.
The Council is fully aware that the ambitious work in this area also means a considerable workload for you in Parliament.
The Council' s deadlines for statements from the European Parliament must be determined by balancing considerations on the one hand of the importance of the issue being dealt with promptly and, on the other, of the workload of the European Parliament.
Here we have to jointly take responsibility for the future of the EU.
It is important that we focus on what is important and really focus our time and energy on the central issues of EU development.
The Swedish Presidency has begun discussions on the way the Council works.
At an informal Council meeting on 8 and 9 February, where we also had the pleasure of meeting Mr Watson, we all agreed that making the work of the Council more efficient is necessary if we are to achieve the targets which were laid down in Tampere.
One question which will be addressed in the overview which has begun is the constantly increasing multitude of initiatives in the area of justice and home affairs.
It is my conviction that we must achieve better predictability and coordination when it comes to new legislation initiatives.
Such an improvement would make the joint work of the institutions much easier.
I would also like to say something about the relationship between the institutions and Europol and Eurojust respectively.
It is the conviction of the presidency that Parliament' s access to and opportunities to monitor, for instance, the work of Europol, can and should be improved.
The presidency considers that this ought to be able to be arranged in practice.
There may be measures which can be taken in the short term and which may not require any regulatory changes.
When it comes to Eurojust, the Council has not yet begun to discuss how Parliament and Commission are to be involved in the work and given the opportunity to monitor operations.
It is nonetheless clear that questions concerning relations between Eurojust, the Commission and Parliament will be addressed in the negotiations.
The proposed Council decisions on which Parliament is to issue its opinion are based on the regulations in the Europol Convention, both in terms of the Commission' s participation in the work and the opportunity of Parliament to monitor it.
Where this issue, too, is concerned, I would like, however, to emphasise that we must consider the opportunity of further improving conditions for Parliament to gain access.
Before addressing the next question, I would like to emphasise our aim of maintaining good relations with you.
To emphasise this we submitted a written report to you yesterday that clearly lays out the work of the Council in the field of justice and home affairs during the past year.
Mr Posselt also mentions the principle of mutual recognition and the measures which are planned to improve the mutual recognition of judgments in the field of criminal law.
The mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases and traditional judicial cooperation have the same purpose: for cooperation between Member States to improve such that we can achieve an area of freedom, security and justice.
In December last year, in the light of the conclusions from Tampere, the Council adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition.
This programme of measures is ambitious and wide-ranging.
It contains a large number of measures which are to be implemented.
The principle of mutual recognition as expressed in the programme of measures covers decisions before the judgment, the judgment itself and decisions after the judgment.
In light of this, Sweden, together with Belgium and France, has taken the initiative for an instrument on decisions before judgments.
This concerns mutual recognition of decisions, and the freezing of assets and evidence.
The instrument aims to quickly prevent assets and evidence being hidden from the authorities investigating the crime.
When the instrument was presented, it was received positively, and negotiations will begin this spring during the Swedish Presidency.
During the spring it is likely that initiatives concerning mutual recognition and enforcement of fines will be submitted.
This will see the beginning of work in recognising and implementing the judgments themselves.
I would also like to mention cooperation in the field of civil law, particularly the work which has commenced to create a European Enforcement Order for uncontested debts.
A European Enforcement Order, unlike a national one, could be enforced in all Member States without any inter-state control.
This is the first important step towards our goals, namely for judgments in one Member State to be able to be recognised and enforced directly throughout the entire Union.
To conclude I would like to answer Mr Posselt' s questions on the implementation of legislation in our field and the issue of what we just mentioned, an annual report on implementation.
In the work in creating an area of freedom, security and justice, we are largely dependent on legal instruments which must be implemented in the national law of Member States.
A number of instruments which we agreed on at the end of the 1990s have already been able to enter into force.
Furthermore, we currently have an opportunity to implement several instruments despite the fact that they have not entered into force in all Member States.
After the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, several community legal instruments, such as regulations, have been adopted in the field of justice and home affairs.
Several of these instruments have already entered into force or are on the way to doing so.
One concrete example is what is known as the Brussels II Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters.
We initially also mentioned that we are in the process of producing an overview of our working methods at JHA.
The question of the Member States' implementation of the measures taken in the field of JHA is one of the questions addressed in this context.
I do not rule out further measures being needed if Member States are better to live up to what they have undertaken in the Council.
Some form of control of implementation may be one way of putting pressure on all of us to really fulfil our undertakings.
The presidency today has no final solutions as to what such a mechanism would look like.
The proposal referred to in the question, an annual report, may be one way but the Council will have to return to that question with more concrete information at a later date.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Council, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Posselt for having tabled the oral question that has formed the basis for this debate.
In answering the questions he has raised, I shall not focus on what was done in 2000, because an exhaustive and rigorous assessment of this subject has already been made by the representatives of the Council. First and foremost, I wish to outline the most important landmarks in the process of preparing for the Laeken European Council, which is the occasion that has been chosen for the first in-depth assessment of the results we have achieved in implementing the Tampere mandate.
1999 was a turning point in the field of justice and home affairs.
2000 marked the beginning of the implementation of the Tampere mandate.
In the Commission' s opinion, it is no exaggeration to say that we have made a good start.
We feel that we have made a proposal for a scoreboard with whose structure and content you are all familiar and I shall therefore not go into this in detail.
Through this scoreboard, however, we will be able to identify, transparently, clearly and with a sense of responsibility, the progress as well as the delays in the way we are implementing the Tampere mandate.
I shall, therefore, not be referring to the scoreboard' s content, but I do wish to begin by referring to an issue raised by Mr Posselt; that of drafting an annual budget on progress made in consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Commission takes the view that a dynamic scoreboard such as we would wish this to be responds to Mr Posselt' s concern.
I think, however, that we can improve the scoreboard in two ways: firstly, by strengthening the political dimension of the part of the process we have already completed when we introduce each revised version of the scorecard at the end of each presidency. Secondly, improvements can be made by adapting the very structure of the scoreboard in future editions, particularly in the light of the outcome of the Laeken European Council, so that the scoreboard also reflects the way in which each Member State is implementing decisions taken at European level within its own national law.
I acknowledge that, although we have made a good start, we are entitled to have conflicting feelings about the Union' s decision-making power in this field.
Here we are faced with two problems that I see no reason to hide.
The first concerns the myriad initiatives of the Member States, the reasoning behind which sometimes escapes us.
It is not my intention to question the Member States' right of initiative.
Consolidating an area of freedom, security and justice can only be achieved through close cooperation between all the Union' s institutions and also - and perhaps most importantly - between the Member States.
The Commission does share Parliament' s concerns, however, about the sometimes fragmented approach to many of the Member States' initiatives, and the danger that they will fail to provide added value to our common project.
I am not questioning the good intentions behind these initiatives, but they are sometimes rather unfocused; if they are in line with the priorities of the European common agenda, these initiatives will be welcome.
If, however, these initiatives simply serve each Member State' s internal political agenda of the day, then I am afraid that they will not help us to fulfil the very demanding programme laid down in Tampere.
Hence the Commission' s willingness to explore all avenues for improving cooperation with Member States in exercising legislative initiative.
Secondly, and it is worth saying this now, in advance of Laeken, we risk facing delays in meeting the Tampere timetable.
Unless the Council' s pace and decision making pick up, in other words, if we maintain our current speed, when we reach Laeken, we will be lagging a long way behind the objectives outlined in Tampere.
I am therefore greatly encouraged by the discussion held at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency, which I welcomed, at the informal Stockholm Council on the need to speed up the pace of decision making and the need to improve the Commission' s working methods.
The Commission is willing to play its part, under the leadership of the Swedish Presidency, in this task of discussing and streamlining the Council' s methods for taking action.
With regard to the specific questions raised by Mr Posselt, I shall be very brief.
In the field of transposing the Community acquis into national law, it must be said that, where the conventions of the third pillar are concerned, only one has been signed and ratified by all Member States and that is the Europol Convention.
None of the other conventions has, to date, been signed and ratified by all 15 Member States.
With regard to the framework decisions, it is too early to talk about their transposal because they are still very recent and there are not yet enough of them to be able to produce an assessment report.
On the second question, concerning a common immigration policy, the Commission has already contributed, in the communication it submitted to the Council and to Parliament in November of last year, to what can be considered to be the basis of such a policy, which is the creation of a European concept of immigration and of a vision for framing an immigration policy.
In this communication, we focused on two objectives. The first of these was a raft of legislative initiatives establishing a common Community acquis and the second was the launch of a process of open coordination within the Council to coordinate the management of migration flow policies.
We presented a proposal on family reunification, which I hope will be adopted during the Swedish Presidency.
We also presented a proposal on the rights and responsibilities of third-country nationals who are long-term residents.
In July, we shall be presenting a proposal on conditions for the admission of immigrants for purposes of work and, at the end of the year, we shall be presenting an additional proposal on the admission of citizens of third countries for the purpose of study, training or for other purposes.
By July of this year, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal to make the method for open coordination in the field of immigration policy operational, with a view to this being up and running in 2002, in parallel with the Swedish Presidency' s initiative to improve our statistical mechanisms in the field of immigration.
At the same time, the new Odysseus programme will enable us to launch a programme of administrative cooperation between the Member States and we hope to launch the bases of what will be the creation of a common border police force, as mentioned by Mr Posselt.
In the field of immigration, I do not think that we should ignore the prospect of a proactive policy of integrating immigrant communities into the reception societies.
We must therefore explore all the options contained in the anti-discrimination package that the Commission presented last year and, at the same time, build on the immigration component in the Lisbon strategy, confirmed in Stockholm, of combating social exclusion.
In this policy of integrating immigrants, we must be able to count on the commitment and support of the Member States' regions and local authorities.
With regard to illegal immigration, the Commission has already presented two proposals for a framework decision on the trafficking of human beings and intends to present two communications. One of these will concern the fight against illegal immigration and the other will be on repatriation policies.
I shall conclude this point by emphasising my hope that following the Conference being organised by the Belgian Presidency, we may see political agreement on the overall concept of European immigration policy at the Laeken Council, so that, from then on, no more excuses are given for the lack of a joint vision preventing us from adopting practical legislative measures.
In the field of asylum, I wish to point out that the Commission has embraced the principle of solidarity, both in its proposal on the 'European Refugee Fund' and in its proposal on 'Temporary Protection' based on the principle of 'double voluntary action' .
I hope that, under the leadership of the Swedish Presidency, we will be able to conclude a political agreement on temporary protection.
I acknowledge, however, along with Mr Posselt, that the discussions in Council have not led to much opportunity for improving the financial dimension of solidarity and prove that the process of defining any form of imposing the distribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States will not be easy.
The best solution to the problem of sharing responsibility is likely to be a common European asylum system based on the ideas outlined in the Commission' s communication of last November.
In the field of the mutual recognition of judgments, I simply wish to inform Parliament that we are working on a major package in the field of extradition and the European search and arrest warrant, as well as a package dealing with the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, specifically protective orders in investigations carried out within the fight against cybercrime.
In civil matters, by the end of the year, we will be supplementing the 'BrusselsÂ­I' initiative with a proposal for a European enforcement order in civil matters, and with additional initiatives from 'Brussels-II' on the mutual recognition of judgments in the field of family law, in domestic issues and matters concerning parental power and the issuing of proposals on the recognition of low-value claims and undisputed claims.
With regard to the interinstitutional dialogue, Mr President, the Commission wishes to confirm here that the dialogue between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament is essential to a successful outcome.
In this field, the Commission and Parliament must be given a greater role to play in the democratic control of Europol. This is another initiative that the Commission will be adopting in the course of this year.
We have an ambitious programme and I am confident that the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies will ensure that the right pace is set for us to achieve a favourable outcome at Laeken.
I should like to conclude by simply expressing the Commission' s appreciation to Parliament, and particularly to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in the person of its chairman, Mr Watson, for the way in which you have responded, sometimes with very little time, to requests concerning the Commission' s proposals and those of the Member States.
If there have been delays, they are certainly not due to a lack of proposals or opinions issued by Parliament.
Secondly, I should like to reiterate the Commission' s desire to deepen political dialogue with the European Parliament so that together we can find the best solutions, which will, in this House, enjoy the broad political support of the various European political families.
I respect the diversity of Parliament' s political and ideological opinions, but we do have a common objective, which is to convey to the people of Europe a clear political message that meets their expectations.
This is a simple message: the European institutions make a decisive contribution to confirming freedom, security and justice as inseparable values, true cornerstones laid out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and which express what we have in common and what we can be proud of.
Let us take pride in our European identity.
Mr President, Council representatives, Commissioner, as you will certainly have understood from the applause, we value your work and your efforts to find good, pragmatic solutions and work together with Parliament, as well as the progress which you have chalked up on the scoreboard.
I am delighted at the commitment of the Swedish Presidency, even if a great many problems still remain to be resolved.
But, that notwithstanding, allow me to draw your attention to three problem areas, parts of which have already been addressed, namely the deficits which we have, secondly, the solutions which we still need, because the proposals seem to bear no relation to reality and, thirdly, the uncoordinated initiatives by Member States.
I shall start with the last point. You have my support here, Commissioner.
You feel that we need a new modus operandi here.
We spend a great deal of time on parallel initiatives which very often have no legal basis and which we often suspect are nationally motivated rather than concerned with finding European solutions.
We need an efficient mechanism for pushing ahead with the positive aspects here.
The second point is that there has been a dramatic increase in both drug abuse in the European Union and in drug production, especially the production of synthetic drugs, in the European Union.
In the meantime, there are now over 5 million young people taking synthetic drugs.
The European Union has become the biggest producer and exporter of synthetic drugs in the world.
And if we look at the scoreboard, then we can see that very little action has been taken.
An initiative plan was submitted in 2000, but no further action was taken.
I would ask for this to be made a new focal point.
Finally, I should like to mention one more thing.
Where there is no bearing on reality, as in the case of family reunion ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, to analyse this year zero of the Tampere era we have, for the first time, a tool that will be extraordinarily useful, both now and in the future: the scoreboard set up by the Commission which, in future years, should include the progress made in the Council and the progress made in each of the Member States.
A comparison between the initial forecasts and the latest revision of the scoreboard shows, for instance, how we have progressed - I would say remarkably - in matters of judicial cooperation.
We have hopes for the future of Eurojust and this Parliament welcomes the decisions taken by the Council and the Member States' initiatives which, in the field of judicial cooperation, have added to the Commission proposals, thus creating a circle that should be maintained in future.
My Group also values the highly significant Commission communication on the mutual recognition of sentences in criminal matters.
We hope it will be a solid base from which to combat crime, especially those more callous and intolerable versions such as terrorism.
Ministers, we are well aware of what the European Commission has presented this last year in connection with the Tampere Agenda: it is on the scoreboard.
What we do not know is what the Council is thinking of doing with them in the immediate future.
In exchange, we have seen concrete and fragmentary proposals - I do not want to return to the debate we had in the previous sitting - from each Member State, which in this case we cannot accept at all, either now or in the future.
Today we have also talked about the shock caused by the arrival of the "East Sea" in Europe.
It shocked everyone, and I think it would have done so even more if the citizens knew that even before Tampere we had set up something which (talking of cooperation with the countries of origin) is called an action plan for northern Iraq, i.e. the Kurds.
But the citizens do not know.
Just as those of my country do not know that we have set up an action plan for Morocco, and while they keep finding the bodies of our young neighbours on their beaches they wonder what the European Union is doing.
In fact, the impression given by the press is that not even our government knows.
Laeken is going to be a new opportunity for the common immigration and asylum policy.
Please do not just reaffirm the Tampere decisions again.
Tell us how you intend to move forward.
Please do not repeat that things are on the right road.
Really convince yourselves that your decisions are good ones, and uphold them clearly and with determination and courage.
Parliament - and I am sure in this respect the citizens too - will follow.
Mr President, our efforts to create an area of freedom, security and justice are dispersed and rather incoherent.
Firstly, they are spread over half a dozen sections of the Treaties, from the third-pillar articles on intergovernmental police and judicial cooperation, to the provisions on asylum and immigration, to other scattered articles on fundamental rights, non-discrimination, EU citizenship and free movement.
In this crucial area of creating a citizens' Europe, we start with a pretty incoherent framework.
Our procedures are also inadequate; add to that the way in which Member States have showered upon us a host of uncoordinated initiatives, and it is not surprising that two years after the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, we have a lot of frenetic activity but not enough real progress.
We have big issues to deal with, from a policy on immigration, to combating racism and xenophobia, to ending the huge injustice of 20 million European residents having no right of movement, because they are third-country nationals.
On asylum policy, it is crucial that we absolutely respect humanitarian obligations and practise coherent thinking.
How can we speak derogatorily of the 1 000 Iraqi Kurds in the "East Sea" as illegal economic migrants, when NATO members, including my own Member State, are sufficiently conscious of their vulnerability to Saddam Hussein's persecution, as demonstrated in the past, to enforce a no-fly zone in northern Iraq?
We really do not have much joined-up thinking on that subject.
We must change the way we work, so as to make the area of freedom, security and justice as visible to the citizen as it is politically significant. Perhaps then we could have a debate which might attract a fuller chamber and convey something of the passion and vision that we heard from the President of the Federal Republic of Germany this morning.
Mr President, during the night of 31 March, another ship carrying illegal immigrants ran aground to the north-east of Athens, just like the Kurdish refugees on 18 February off the coast of Var, in France.
These are not national problems.
Regularly, in Gibraltar, at Calais and elsewhere, refugees are coming ashore at European ports.
They risk their lives to flee from dictatorships, conflict and misery.
However, they are likely to end up as illegal immigrants, and they know it.
One only has to look at France, where 94% of applications for asylum are rejected.
Yet the right of asylum is a fundamental and inalienable right.
There is a European fund to provide support for the consequences of receiving these people here.
In order to improve efficiency, is the Council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund?
Acting at European level means more than merely denouncing and condemning those who trade in human misery: as you have pointed out, Mrs Ludford, only an overall solution will deal with these problems, with the emphasis on a foreign policy of cooperation just as much as on a genuine policy of integration which recognises the equality of the rights of all citizens.
Does the Council therefore not think that as a matter of urgency the Union should provide itself with an effective statutory instrument in the form of a framework directive which would enable it to regularise the position of all illegal immigrants, in order to adopt a more realistic and humane attitude towards immigration.
At the present time, two mechanisms are being studied...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, we all know that words are no longer enough to condemn these situations in which whole families are thrown out of their country, like the 908 people crammed into the holds of the "East Sea" , seeking a better life, or fleeing war, violence or poverty, sometimes both.
Words should now be followed by actions.
In March, when Parliament rejected, fortunately, several Council initiatives, I wondered when we would have any Council initiatives and proposed directives drawn up in a spirit of openness towards the world, of welcome and humanity, rather than reflecting an approach concerned solely with policing and security.
Yes, Europe does have a duty to take initiatives, but not the sort of initiatives that would cause a breach of solidarity, or impose arbitrary sanctions on transport companies.
On the contrary, a common policy on immigration requires ambitious initiatives based on improving and strengthening the right of asylum, guaranteeing both that right and the right to freedom of movement, and facilities for receiving migrants with dignity and with respect for human rights.
We also need to take restrictive and punitive measures, not against the victims, but against those who are behind this human traffic.
So when shall we see an end to the expulsions, when will the situation of illegal immigrants living on European soil be regularised, and when will non-Community foreigners have the right to vote in local elections?
It is impossible to avoid answering these questions if we want to move towards a policy that is more just, more humane and more effective.
I have three remarks in connection with this question.
First of all, a comment on the semantics.
Both the Treaty and the question talk about introducing an 'area of freedom, security and justice' .
The impression might be created that freedom, security and justice did not exist in the Member States, as if our countries were a legal vacuum.
However, that is not the case.
The situation, of course, is that we have a wide range of very traditional and deeply rooted legal systems which are distinguished primarily by their extraordinary difference from one another.
It is not going too far to say that the dominant system is one based upon Roman law but, in addition, there exist of course the common law system, which is significantly different, a Germanic and even a Scandinavian legal tradition, and these legal traditions differ from one another on crucial points.
To introduce an area of freedom, security and justice is an absurdity from a semantic point of view.
However, there is also, of course, another objective, and that brings me on to my second remark, which is of a legal nature.
What we are concerned with here is the desire to establish a single area and to homogenise these legal areas in the EU style, nipping and tucking in the interests of a better fit and in such a way as to obtain one common criminal law and one common judicial area.
Finally, I have a political remark to make.
This empire building through the establishment of a legal system represents one of the most repressive systems of oppression in world history.
What has been established in the light of these words, 'freedom, security and justice' , is a system of monitoring and control without parallel in world history.
A system is being developed which suspends the crucial aspects of legal security.
Objection can also be made to this perversion of the language which should ideally, of course, reflect reality as carefully as possible. That is something it is nowhere near doing.
Mr President, how many minutes' silence have we held so far in this Parliament for the victims of ETA and in condemning terrorism?
How many people have lost their lives in attempting to tread on European soil along the Andalusian coastline, in Dover, or on the coasts of southern France or Italy?
How many women and children have been and still are exploited by organised criminal networks that - and this is the worst part - act with impunity in European territory?
We must begin to find answers to these questions now, and fast!
The fight against organised crime, terrorism, drugs or the trafficking of human beings requires new police methods, a readjustment of legislation, and the immediate adaptation of police and judicial cooperation to the new European area.
No terrorist, drug trafficker or trafficker in human beings must find shelter in a Member State.
And it is urgent, as the Commissioner has said, to set the European search and capture order in motion against these enemies of freedom and security.
I particularly wish to thank you, Commissioner, for the interest you have shown in setting this European search and capture order in motion.
In Spain a recent survey has shown that terrorism and immigration have become two of the main concerns of Spanish citizens.
These concerns also require European responses.
We are going to have two great debates in the coming months: a report on terrorism and another on immigration and asylum.
I hope that we Members of Parliament, the Commission and the Council will rise to the occasion and succeed in offering European citizens and those who legally wish to live in our territory precisely what we set forth in the recent Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, the fact of the matter is that a very ambitious and serious attempt is under way to resolve the everyday problems of European citizens, the success of which will help strengthen the political dimension of European unification, because European unification and a single European area obviously imply more than just a single market and a common currency.
Which is why we need to strengthen our citizens' sense of security, fight organised crime, strengthen police and judicial cooperation, mutually recognise court judgments, develop an integrated, viable immigration policy based on our common European values and fight racism and xenophobia in the European Union.
If we take stock of how far we have come since October 1999, we will see that there have been serious delays and setbacks in achieving our aims. This is because, on the one hand, we have an energetic Commission and a creative Commissioner and, on the other hand, a Council which is irresolute and appears unwilling even to implement what the governments themselves decide.
Instead, we are faced with fragmentary and uncoordinated initiatives on individual issues on the part of the Member States, initiatives which often fall outside the framework agreed at Tampere.
And as we know, this sort of situation causes serious problems, both to the working of the Commission, which does not have the human resources needed to respond to all these initiatives, and to the working and the agenda of the European Parliament.
Of course, the Council must be credited in 2000 with the decision to set up the refugee fund and mutually recognise civil court judgments, such as in divorce cases.
And, of course, the list of achievements in 2000 also includes the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Nice, although not, of course, in the manner which Parliament had hoped for.
I should also like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on working to strengthen the political dimension of the venture to create a common area of freedom, security and justice in the Union, especially in its endeavour to get a framework Council decision adopted during the six-month Swedish Presidency on a Commission proposal to fight the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
As far as immigration policy is concerned and the huge gap in this area, some Member States, including Greece, have decided to plug this gap with national legislation under the Tampere agenda.
Last week, the Greek government passed an immigration bill legalising and regulating the status of thousands of immigrants who entered Greece over the last ten years, thereby finding a positive solution to serious issues which the Council has stubbornly kept on the back burner.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, as the Member who has the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino and Ministers BodstrÃ¶m and Klingvall for the spirit of loyal cooperation in which they have approached the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice.
Progress has been made in finding ways to work together in a policy field in which the Treaties are anything but satisfactory.
But to say this throws some light on the difficulties we have encountered in the 18 months since the Tampere Summit: difficulties such as the need for separate legal arrangements in the first pillar and the third pillar; the need to cater for Member States which are members of Schengen and those which are not; the depressing predisposition of some Member States to pile headlong into individual initiatives before institutions have fully debated an overall approach.
The house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake.
Let us lay the most solid foundations - those of the Community framework in which architects, builders and surveyors work together in concert.
Parliament has called for an annual report on the implementation of the area of freedom, security and justice.
In welcoming the report that I have just received from the presidency, I note that it is essentially a list of actions.
What we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken.
Minister Klingvall said it is hard to comment on the case of the "East Sea" because it is a matter for individual Member States.
Arguably that may be true for 24 hours; thereafter it is a matter for all of us.
Surely, Minister, that is the whole point of the area of freedom, security and justice.
Member States must understand that this is an area in which citizens want more Europe.
We must rise to that challenge, not become bidders in a depressing downward auction of rights for our citizens or those arriving from elsewhere.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is arguably the most important development that we have seen.
We must incorporate it into the law of the Union for there is no area of freedom, security and justice without rights and there are no rights without judges.
Mr President, when the EU' s fortress policy fails, then we end up with shipwrecks such as that which occurred in France, and again in Greece, and which will probably claim many more lives.
The question is: if we really want more freedom, security and justice, what must we do in order to prevent this policy from claiming even more lives?
First, freedom is achieved by giving people a free choice of where they wish to live.
Secondly, security is given to people by pressing a passport into their hand and giving them the legal wherewithal to set up home wherever they want.
This results in more justice and greater fairness because it is the global economic conditions which the industrialised countries have forced on the world which turn many people into refugees in the first place.
Which is why I call on the Council to take prevention seriously.
A uniform modus operandi - yes, start a legalisation initiative now, because that is the only consistent policy against racism.
Mr President, the running aground of the "East Sea" on the French coast is a tragic illustration of a twofold problem: the problem of oppressed nations and the problem of the oppression of immigrants.
At the present time, the Kurdish people, scattered over several countries, are experiencing pitiless oppression which highlights the on-going struggle to force the government to respect the right to self-determination and to respect national minorities.
Moreover, these tragedies that we have seen occurring on Spanish beaches or at Dover cannot result merely in our condemning the people who ship in the illegal immigrants.
The Schengen area is a fortress which forces the victims of hunger or of political dictatorships to take illegal action.
Yet everyone knows that no amount of policing can halt the flow of people who are in fear of their lives.
Those who organise these shipments of illegal immigrants are now growing fat on these repressive laws, which in any case are a violation of the Geneva Convention.
It is time to open up the borders to the free circulation of people, just as you have done for capital.
We no longer want to see the spectacle of entire families entering Europe by paying large sums of money to risk their lives in decrepit old tubs.
Mr President, in view of the short time available, I will address the most important point first.
Mrs Klingvall has just stated that she intends to help to achieve agreement in three areas, in precisely the three areas where the European Parliament has said no, for we have voted against the reports by Mr Ceyhun, Mr Nassauer and Mr Kirkhope.
It is quite worrying that the presidency does not respect the opinion of Parliament.
I myself think that it is fairly clear after the debate today that responsibility for overall policy in this field should rest with the Commission.
Alarming figures are presented regarding population trends - Europe is shrinking.
Member States are estimated to lose 10 percent and candidate countries 20 percent.
We will see a shortage of both highly qualified and less qualified labour, and both in the short and the long term.
Our external borders are under great pressure.
The fact that Europe must be opened up to immigration of labour is a conclusion which even the toughest opposition have adopted.
However, we know nothing about how this will work - nothing about how the system will be designed, nothing about quota systems or green cards, whether these openings and solutions are only to apply to those who are highly educated or whether they will also cover those with few qualifications.
Has the Council no practical solutions in this area?
Will crime and harsh reality decide?
We look forward to the proposals which the Commission will present in this field.
The Commission appears to be the most suitable body to do this.
Mr President, I would like to thank both the ministers from Sweden, as well as the Commission, for their comments.
Some people describe Europe as a Europe which locks people out.
They term it 'Fortress Europe' .
Those of us who want to create a humane Europe, which takes into account people with a need for protection, and who are seeking a humane asylum and refugee policy use the concepts of freedom, justice and security.
I share the view of the Commission and the presidency that the current deficiencies in the field of asylum and refugees are linked to the problem that we have no common policy.
At the moment, there are different policies in different countries.
The policy we have to develop must be based on international conventions, needs for protection and family reunification.
I also noted that, when it came to carriers' liability, debated by Parliament at length during the last part-session, the presidency was to take into account the opinions of Parliament.
At least that is the way I clearly understood it.
I also think that we should distinguish between immigration of labour, and asylum and refugee policy.
The latter is based on people' s need for protection.
The former is based on the fact that we are suddenly realising that we will have a shortage of labour in the years to come, and here we are considering our need for labour.
In this context, we talk far too little about integration policy, as linked to asylum and refugee policy is an integration policy where we look after those people who come here with a need for protection.
Today, however, we are seeing these people remain largely outside society, that they do not have the same rights and that they are not utilised on the labour market.
They tend to be found among the 14 million unemployed.
Before we talk about the immigration of labour - it is possible that there may be a question of this - I would primarily like to see us emphasising integration policy and a common asylum and immigration policy.
Mr President, it is touching to hear how loyally the Swedish minister has adopted the propaganda language of the EU liturgy.
Freedom, security, justice - but there is no such thing!
Freedom in Gibraltar, for those who drown in attempting to enter the EU?
Freedom at the Polish Eastern border where the Soviet border is now physically being used as the EU' s external border in the opposite direction?
Is this freedom?
Security - when we are all being monitored by the SIS register, which knows everything, even down to whether we have any sexual peculiarities?
Justice - when all the police officers working on this say that the identity checks which will become compulsory under the Schengen Agreement will affect those who look non-European?
Mrs Klingvall, Mr BodstrÃ¶m!
There is a word for this, a rude word: - 'Fortress Europe!'
That is what you are building, precisely what you promised you would not build!
How would it be if you built in the opposite direction instead of solely going along with the federalists and power builders in this institution?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost every day we read articles in the papers about refugees stranded on the coasts of Europe.
Just last Sunday, 447 Kurdish refugees landed in Greece.
In February the "East Sea" freighter ran aground in St. Rafael in France with almost 1 000 Kurdish refugees, including over 300 children, on board.
Their Odyssey to Europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions.
Three women gave birth to children in these conditions.
The refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to Europe.
That refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the EU's segregation policy.
It is intolerable.
Europe' s borders must be open to people in need, fleeing their homeland.
Why does anyone leave their homeland?
Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland?
No one leaves their homeland willingly unless they are being persecuted and fear torture and maltreatment.
I think we should fight the reasons why they flee.
We need an active human rights policy, we need to rethink arms exports and we need to give poor countries and regions financial aid, so that their people do not need to flee.
I call on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the European Union to apply this policy and put it into practice.
Europe does not just need an economic face, it also needs a human face.
Mr President, the European Union's behaviour is inconsistent: we recognise that it is necessary to bring the citizens closer to Europe and that, in order to do this, the Union must show that it is able to guarantee rights, freedom and security, but when it comes to implementing these proposals, the Member States' governments become highly overcautious and indecisive, concerned more for their own powers than for the rights of all.
This is how we manage to adopt a Charter of Fundamental Rights and then not incorporate it into the Treaties, how we write in the Treaties that the Union must be developed as an area of freedom, security and justice, but then the good intentions are lost in conventions which are not ratified, in decisions which are not implemented and in the confusion that is created by the fragmentation of competences, initiatives and procedures.
The governments raise hopes once again at Tampere and then dash them because they are unwilling to entrust the implementation to those whose job it is to concern themselves with the Union and not the internal affairs of individual States.
Our action arrives late and is ineffective because Community initiatives come to a halt on the threshold of cooperation in matters of criminal justice, which are still dealt with on an intergovernmental basis.
We need to be more courageous in protecting the rights of the citizens.
In my opinion, there is one genuine solution which I hope will be adopted with the next Treaty: as is already the case for cooperation in matters of civil justice, every aspect of the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice must become Community responsibility.
There is nothing to fear from this solution: the distribution of competences between Union and Member States would remain the same, but the effect of having standardised procedures would ensure that policies were coherent and also that the forthcoming enlargement of the Union would not, as it is in danger of becoming, be a barrier to the timely protection of citizens' rights.
Mr President, I should like to emphasise certain issues which are no less important for being evident and having been reiterated in this debate.
First of all, I want to draw the Council' s attention to the slowness and lack of coordination of some of its decisions regarding what was approved in Tampere, and I want to stress that this situation may lead to the failure of the agenda that you yourselves decided.
What is needed is a new boost and greater political will to be able to fulfil the agenda and the objectives that are set out for us.
Secondly I also urge you to work at developing the Tampere proposals and not Member State initiatives; although such initiatives are legitimate, this Parliament considers them lacking in coherence, partial in their presentation and content, guided by each country' s own situation, and not contributing at all to the overall view needed in this matter.
Therefore, let me remind you that we already have a programme of initiatives presented by the Commission which, in my view, meets these requirements.
