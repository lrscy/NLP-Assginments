I must stress the need to combat illegal immigration and the vital importance of all the measures being taken to prevent the trade in human beings, the constant deaths in the Straits of Gibraltar, the fight against Mafia-like organisations and the exploitation of these people economically and in the workplace.
All this has our support, but we must not lose sight of the need to adopt a balanced policy on the immigration question. Therefore, with the same determination and willpower we must all, including, of course, the Council, draw up and implement policies that truly integrate these citizens that live amongst us, and thus we shall avoid racist and xenophobic acts which regrettably and shamefully take place in the European Union.
We shall avoid the tragedies that occur on the coasts of southern Spain every day, with boats laden with human beings reaching our shores and with people dying in their holds.
For this we need a clear political will and sufficient budgetary funding.
This is what I urge you to do, and I am certain that in this way we shall help build the area of freedom, security and justice we desire, and that we shall have the understanding and support of the European citizens in this important task.
Mr President, jag vill prata franska [I should now like to speak in French].
Everything was for the best in the best of all worlds.
Everyone knew that there were several million illegal immigrants in Western Europe, everyone knew that they were coming in every day, trickling through our sieve-like borders, coming from all over the world, everyone knows the routes that they take and the main countries of entry, but at least, until now, all this has been going on quietly and discreetly, so as not to disturb good bourgeois consciences and the sleep of the self-righteous.
Everyone finds their own particular satisfaction in this: this is how the pro-immigrant associations justify their existence, and the public subsidies that they enjoy.
Governments end up regularising everybody, or almost everybody, thereby demonstrating their attachment to the essential values of tolerance, human rights and openness towards others.
The bishops fill the desperately empty churches with illegal immigrants.
Trades unions and industry find, thanks to immigration, the reinforcements that they so much require to make up for European workers' lack of interest, and, of course, the bosses welcome the new labour force arriving on the market.
In short, it was an ill wind, and then suddenly, catastrophe: on 17 February, the cargo of the "East Sea" was deliberately beached on the French coast. On board were 912 illegal immigrants, of which 420 were children.
And there you are, they landed, they are there, or rather - it has to be said - they were there.
For the question we are asking now, regardless of the reasons why they were beached and the conditions in which it happened, is this: what has become of them?
They have disappeared, melted into the background, over 600 of these illegal immigrants have miraculously vanished, they have done a disappearing act.
For example, when the camp was closed by the prefect of Var, on 1 March, 449 people were supposed to have been taken into custody.
Since then, more than 200 of them have disappeared.
At Modane, the destination of the first people leaving via the FrÃ©jus Pass, of the 82 Kurds welcomed with such ceremony, 40 have vanished into thin air.
But why has this happened?
Why, when all the politicians, the various interest groups and others have all called unanimously for these immigrants to be permanently received here?
Why, when the French government has arranged everything so well, giving them an eight-day pass of safe conduct so as to allow them to complete the formalities that will enable them to obtain official status as political refugees?
Simply because these illegal immigrants preferred to use parallel secret networks for slipping into France and slipping out again.
What a psychological shock, what a cause for concern to the self-righteous.
Unfortunately, this business is purely symbolic, it is a drop in the ocean, because every month there are thousands of illegal immigrants who succeed in getting into France.
But others will follow, millions of others, who will arrive on foot and by train.
Our problem is to organise their return to their own countries so that they can live and work in those countries with dignity.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking you for an extremely interesting debate with many interesting questions, but, above all, I would like to thank you for your substantial commitment in the area of legal and home affairs.
I will attempt to summarise and comment on your viewpoints and questions.
Let me start by making it clear that we are working for a union characterised by freedom, security and justice.
None of us is interested in building a "Fortress Europe" .
Rather our work is characterised by very great dynamism, a deeper cooperation in a Europe which we also wish to see enlarged.
One of the foremost aims of the Swedish Presidency is enlargement.
It is to make this region larger, to integrate further countries into a deeper cooperation, not just for freedom, security and justice, but also for peace.
This work obviously has considerable dynamism.
We are working with countries around the Mediterranean and we are working on strengthening our cooperation with Russia and with China - to take just a few examples of the process that is going on and in which the Union is a powerful driving force in this cooperation and in the work on expanding this area.
This naturally also characterises our work on a harmonised asylum and immigration policy.
In addition, it characterises the holistic perspective that we are imposing on the harmonisation work emanating from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions reached in Tampere.
We want to have a modern immigration policy which means that not only do we work on eliminating the fundamental causes of involuntary migration but that, at the same time, we guarantee protection for those who are in need of protection.
We have all been incredibly moved and affected by the tragedies and catastrophes that we have seen come to us on our television screens.
This is a continuing and despicable trade.
It exploits people in vulnerable situations.
It is something that we must work against with considerable strength.
However, we must do so in a number of different ways - one way is not sufficient.
That is why work such as the increased cooperation with the candidate countries and the work to ensure that these countries, too, have a good legal system and a good asylum system is incredibly important with a view to preventing illegal immigration and preventing these tragedies.
We must deal with the underlying causes of involuntary migration.
Last week I was in the Balkans together with Commissioner Vitorino and the Belgian internal affairs minister, Mr Duquesne.
We met representatives of five of the Baltic states in order to discuss precisely these matters.
We accepted a far-reaching declaration incorporating this very holistic perspective that deals with both a legally secure asylum, reception and integration system and measures to achieve good border controls and an efficient visa policy.
As far as some of the practical questions are concerned with regard to what we are doing and what consideration is being given to the statements that have come from the European Parliament, allow me to shed light on just two matters.
The first of these is the issue of human trafficking.
Where this is concerned I want to make a clear distinction between human trafficking which exploits vulnerable people and what we call humanitarian acts.
Humanitarian acts must not be punishable.
We are working on a humanitarian clause concerning illegal entry.
We have decided that, where illegal residence is concerned, the existence or otherwise of the profit motive will be the key factor in determining which acts are of a specifically humanitarian character and cannot therefore be punished.
As far as the penalties are concerned: these must be severe.
We have not yet reached agreement on this, but we are currently discussing a primary proposal for a minimum penalty of six years.
Where the question of transporters' liability is concerned I wish to strongly reject what was said by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld.
Our exploratory work that is currently in progress provides a basis for reaching agreement on this in accordance with guidelines from the French Presidency.
There are two viewpoints from the European Parliament which I, as President, have also brought into the discussions.
The first issue is that transporters must not be punished where an asylum application is granted or when a person is granted residence for other reasons.
This should mean that we defer the enforcement of fines on those who come to the EU and seek asylum despite the fact that they do not have adequate documents.
Only when the asylum process is complete must those persons who are not allowed to stay be liable to pay these fines.
The second issue that was also included in the statement from the European Parliament concerns the fact that airlines and shipping companies can only be expected to discover obviously forged documents and people who lack any travel documents whatsoever.
At the same time, it is, of course, reasonable for us to demand that transporters check passports and any visas.
However, the sanctions must not be disproportionately severe.
We do not yet know whether we will arrive at a solution that is acceptable to everyone, but we are sounding out the basis for this.
Some of the contributions during the debate, such as the contributions from Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ and Baroness Ludford, dealt with the continued work.
They wondered: "What is actually happening?
You have this vision and the aim from Tampere, but what are you actually doing?"
I reported on some of the decisions taken.
I also reported on the status of the work in respect of some of the directives that are relevant.
Allow me simply to emphasise that we hope that at our meeting in May we will be able to make decisions concerning the Directive on temporary protection and the Directive on the reunification of families.
The negotiating work on these directives is currently progressing well.
It is thus our hope that we will be able to make decisions in May.
We have also come a long way in respect of launching the Eurodac system.
The test runs will be started in late summer 2001.
We believe that this is a system which will be able to give us a more effective application of the Dublin Convention.
As regards the proposal for third country nationals' rights, this has just been submitted.
However, we look forward to being able to commence work on this directive as well.
I also mentioned earlier in the debate that the Belgian Presidency will focus on immigration policy and arrange a seminar on migration in October 2001.
Spain, too, has announced a ministerial conference in respect of flows of migration from Asia in advance of its presidency.
We are working patiently, step-by-step, so as to be able to realise the scoreboard that has been proposed with a view to implementing the conclusions of the Council' s summit in Tampere.
The implementation work is still in its initial stages, but we are moving forward and naturally we want to make decisions as quickly as possible.
Mr President, criminality is becoming increasingly international.
The only way in which we can fight this tendency is for the police and the prosecuting authorities to also work more at an international level and to cooperate.
All police work involves violating the integrity of those who are suspected of a crime.
This is true both at national and at international level.
It applies to people who are sought by the authorities.
In order to be able to conduct a debate on the matter, it is important that we have the right basis.
This applies, for example, to that which Mr Gahrton mentioned - namely the SIS system, which is there for wanted persons.
Mr Gahrton said that the international SIS system charts people' s sexual orientation.
This is incorrect!
There is no such or similar sensitive information in the system.
It contains information on persons who are wanted, whether they are armed, their descriptions and other things such as information on stolen vehicles.
There is thus no such sensitive information and it is an incredibly important instrument if we are to be able to combat international criminality.
There are a number of individual crimes that cannot be controlled unless we do so internationally, such as human trafficking, financial crime, IT crime or, as Mr Pirker mentioned, drugs crime.
The only people who are served by having no international cooperation are the criminals.
As regards the matter addressed by Mr Pirker - drugs criminality - I agree that it is very important to have real action, that we go further than just spouting fine words without actually doing anything.
Two incredibly important means of achieving this have been addressed today, i.e. the development of Europol and being able to establish international cooperation through Eurojust as quickly as possible.
I would also like to point to the work that is in progress for arriving at a solution in respect of synthetic drugs.
I know that Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld has fought very hard on this matter, and hopefully we can reach some kind of political agreement in May.
Mr Watson and Mrs TerÃ³n i CusÃ­, amongst others, have taken up the issue of how we can become more effective, which is, of course, important.
It is important for instance when the proposals are put forward by the Member States and initiatives are taken on various matters.
It is important that this is done in the right way and that we do not concentrate on short-term successes, for example at domestic level.
It is in everyone' s interest for the cooperation to work and be effective.
Everyone stands to gain, including from the domestic point of view, if it works as it should.
The same applies to the cooperation between the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.
If this does not work it will create a negative impression.
Our citizens will lose confidence in us and without the confidence of our citizens the EU will have no foundation, as a result of which the EU would not work either.
Consequently it is important that this very constructive and important debate continues in the same way as it has done today.
Finally, I would like to thank you all once again for this and for allowing me to come here.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for the commitment they have shown to pursuing the very challenging and demanding agenda of Tampere, and also to testify to and praise the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to achieve concrete results during the first half of this year.
It is quite clear from the Swedish Presidency that there is a real concern to have a balanced approach to policies in this area - a balance between those initiatives dealing with the repressive aspects and those which have a pro-active aim of encouraging a positive view of asylum immigration in our societies.
Therefore, I hope that at the end of the Swedish Presidency we will have concrete and good results on the basis of which to proceed.
Very briefly, to touch upon two points: first, on the action plan for Iraq, I share the view that it is extremely difficult to implement this action plan.
The sooner we get a more detailed assessment of the concrete results of such an action plan, the better.
We also have to bear in mind that one candidate country, Turkey, is a neighbouring country of Iraq.
So we should engage Turkey more seriously in the debate on the Kurdish situation and on the effect of illegal immigration in the area.
My second point is to say to Mr Pirker that I did not touch upon the issue of drugs in my presentation, because there was no question tabled about it.
However, I would draw the attention of Parliament to the fact that we are implementing the 2000-2004 Action Plan.
There has been a very important Swedish initiative on synthetic drugs.
We had an open debate in the Council on drugs and the Commission intends to present two main instruments: one, the framework decision for harmonisation of criminal law in fighting drug trafficking, will be presented next month.
The second one is to put before the Council and Parliament what we call a follow-up table for the action plan on drugs.
In that follow-up table we will include all the actions that need to be taken by the Union, and also identify all concrete actions that should be taken by individual Member States.
So we are not neglecting the drugs issue.
We did not touch upon that point, because you did not refer to it in the formal questions, but I am glad to announce to you our programme as far as combating drugs is concerned.
My final wish and hope is that maybe next year we will have a more cheerful debate on the state of play in the area of freedom, security and justice.
Let us all work together to that end.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 16 May.
UN conference on least-developed countries
The next item is the following two oral questions:
B5-0155/2001, by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Council, on the third UN conference on least-developed countries,
B5-0156/2001, by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on the third UN conference on least-developed countries.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lamy, on the eve of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which will be taking place in the European Parliament in Brussels in the middle of May, I think it is crucial that we debate and confirm the strategy the European Union should adopt on this matter and on that occasion.
That is the precise purpose of the oral questions to the Council and the Commission that I am presenting today.
I also hope to make a contribution to this with the proposal for a resolution that I am tabling.
We are all - I hope - aware of the tragic situation these countries are experiencing.
They have a per capita GDP 100 times lower than that of the developed countries. They have a real growth rate of almost zero, if we take account of population growth, the fall in the price of raw products by around 30% in 1998-1999, a life expectancy of no more than 51 years, an illiteracy rate of around 50%, and the list could go on endlessly.
The worst aspect of this is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel, because many of these countries, around one-third, are still suffering from endless conflicts that sap all available resources, as well as those that are not available.
I therefore feel that this conference must do more than simply repeat the diagnosis that is made so often and neither should it be a mere list, exhaustive or not, of intentions that systematically go unfulfilled.
It is crucial that practical measures are adopted in the context of an overall strategy, which sets a new international economic order, strategies that are designed to comply with and strengthen the 1986 United Nations declaration, which recognises the right to sustainable development as an undeniable human right.
It is also crucial that the European Union and each of the Member States adopt a position clearly endorsing this right by fighting to ensure that the current trend to reduce financial aid by the industrialised countries is reversed and that a timetable is set to increase aid by 0.7% of GDP, by acting in such a way that the 1992 Rio de Janeiro commitments are reiterated, by contributing to the definitive writing-off of the debt that is clearly smothering these countries, by making themselves available and taking action on conflict prevention, and by paying particular attention to arms trafficking and combating this trade.
Finally, the Union and the Member States must adopt a position by abandoning the approach of focusing everything on the liberalisation of the markets and by genuinely working for a profound change to the rules and provisions of the WTO that penalise these countries.
On this subject, we must remember that only 12 developing countries are represented in Geneva.
Furthermore, as I stated in my proposal for a resolution, we must also bear in mind that access to the markets is not, in itself, a sufficient condition for guaranteeing economic growth and that economic growth, in itself, does not automatically lead to an equitable form of development either.
Therefore, just as important, if not more important, than these countries having access to the markets, we must also ensure that they are self-sufficient and have a secure supply of food, hence the law that helps them to protect their production and their rural population.
In this context, I wish to say a few words about the 'everything but arms' initiative, which we will have the opportunity to discuss in depth in a forthcoming part-session, even if the Council has taken the unacceptable decision to ignore this Parliament.
I would simply like to emphasise that this is an initiative to be welcomed, although it is of limited scope and although it contains some aspects that need to be fine-tuned.
Since it is merely the first step, as has been said, it must be supplemented with various other types of measure such as those that I have just outlined.
Lastly, at a time when the need to fight poverty is being so greatly emphasised, I think I should emphasise two more specific objectives that are worth repeating: health and education.
As I stated in my proposal for a resolution, the industrialised countries must make a decisive contribution to the development of programmes in these fields.
Above all, as we accepted recently in this House, we must ensure that the right of the countries most affected by AIDS and other diseases to manufacture and sell the necessary drugs or to import them free from copyright costs is recognised.
On these and other aspects, many of which are developed further in the resolution that I have tabled, we now await the words of the Council and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the guidelines for participation in the UN' s third conference on the least developed countries, which the Council adopted on 22 December 2000, the European Union confirms its firm intention to do everything to ensure that the UN Action Plan for sustainable development in the least developed countries and for the progressive incorporation of these countries into the global economy contains practical and operational political guidelines and measures that are based on three factors.
Firstly, active and responsible participation by national authorities, civil society, the private sector and local players in the least developed countries.
Secondly, a worldwide partnership for the least developed countries, which means, amongst other things, mobilising the entire international community and increasing the coordination between everyone working on development issues at international, regional and national level.
Thirdly, an effective evaluation of the results of the Action Plan that was adopted in 1990 and an analysis of the needs and expectations of the least developed countries as established during the preparations for the conference.
Within the framework of the Union' s development assistance policy a very great part of the assistance is devoted to precisely these least developed countries, particularly through the ACP/EU conventions.
I would remind you that 40 of the 49 least developed countries are also included in the group of ACP countries.
The Union feels that the elimination of poverty in these countries should be the central aim of the conference.
The Union supports the reinforced HIPC initiative and its implementation, i.e. in accordance with the terms confirmed in Cologne in 1999, which enables more countries to get debt relief faster and increases the focus on the fight against poverty, i.e. the idea that the resources that are released by debt write-offs within HIPC are to be used to fight poverty.
The Union cannot accept the commitments and/or obligations in respect of debt write-offs that go beyond the terms that apply under the HIPC initiative.
This means that any claims for a moratorium on debt payments before the debtor countries reach the so-called end point, and/or 100 percent debt is written off at this point, cannot be accepted.
Poor countries that do not qualify for debt relief in accordance with the terms that apply to the HIPC initiative but which are having payment difficulties are instead advised to attempt to renegotiate their debt with the Paris Club, the London Club or another relevant creditor.
The resources that are released under the HIPC initiative are to be used to fight poverty in accordance with the countries' own poverty strategies.
On 28 February 2001 the Council approved a Regulation extending exemption from duty with no restriction on quantity to include all products originating from the 49 least developed countries in the world with the exception of arms and ammunition - what is known is the 'Everything but arms' initiative.
The Regulation became applicable on 5 March this year.
Discussion of this matter began with the Commission putting forward a proposal in October last year.
I am pleased to be able to confirm that the main principles of the Commission' s proposal were expressly retained in the final text adopted, i.e. that the Community should take meaningful measures to improve the economic situation in the least developed countries by guaranteeing free access to its markets for all such products, even if this would mean additional costs for the Community.
In nearly all cases this access was established from 5 March this year.
Only in the matter of bananas, sugar and rice was it established that this should enter into force at a later date.
However, the crucial factor was that a particular period and timetable for full access to the market was agreed for these products.
The market for bananas will be fully liberalised from 2006 and that for sugar and rice from July 2009 and September 2009 respectively.
During this period duty on these three products will be reduced and duty-free quotas will be established for sugar and rice.
The Regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries.
However, it also has an even greater political and economic significance in respect of the preparations for the next round of negotiations in the WTO.
The fact that in this regard it is, in the first instance, development priorities that have formed the basis for a decision on a trade matter has incredibly great symbolic value.
The decision shows our partners in the WTO negotiations - both developing countries and industrial countries - that the Union is serious in its commitment to incorporate development issues into these negotiations.
It shows that we will enter into the negotiations with the firm intention not just of serving our own interests, but also the interests of the most needy members of the global society, particularly the least developed countries.
It shows that the Union fully accepts a moral and economic responsibility in accordance with the Union' s position as the world' s biggest trading bloc.
Mr President, as the President of the Council has just pointed out, this third UN conference on LDCs will take place in Brussels in May.
The aim of this conference will be first of all to assess the results of the action programme which was launched in 1990, to take stock of what has been done in the meantime in the way of development aid, debt reduction, investment and trade.
Another aim will be to draw up a new action programme for the next ten years, and we have agreed, in a joint agreement with the United Nations, that this conference should also give its attention to a certain number of measures having immediate effect, so that it will not yield to the temptation of taking refuge in too many generalities.
Preparations for this conference are underway.
Obviously, as joint host, the European Union has a special interest in making this conference a success: teams from the Commission and a certain number of Commissioners are working on it together.
We shall try to ensure that a programme of sound action emerges from this conference so as to give a framework of encouragement to the development efforts of these 49 or 50 countries, once again trying to make it all as specific as possible.
It is with this in mind that we have ensured - and we at the Commission would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for this - that the decisions taken on the basis of this initiative, 'Everything but arms' , are taken in good time so that this initiative can constitute an achievement of the May conference.
That is probably, at the present time, the most visible issue and measure that this conference will have helped to raise and accelerate, and that is no mean achievement We must now try to use this conference as a lever to encourage other trading partners in the world to improve market access for exports from the least-developed countries.
Although we are so keen on this initiative, that is not because we think it is sufficient in itself.
It is clear that, without an appropriate environment and other aid efforts, the vast majority of the LDCs are incapable, on their own, of taking advantage of commercial openings.
We must therefore supplement this strong signal, this effort to which we have committed ourselves, by other measures aimed at effectively increasing the export capacity of the countries in question, and helping them to become integrated into the multilateral worldwide trading system.
We therefore intend to supplement this initiative by other measures, a certain number of which are connected with trade, by technical assistance as regards the administrative capacity of these countries, and by increasing what we do in the context of the integrated fund which links us with the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, in a technical assistance project which deals with commercial issues in Geneva.
Having said that, there are also other trade mechanisms which we should look at, in order to satisfy ourselves that they are not holding back or unduly restricting the opening up of markets to the least developed countries.
I am thinking, in particular, of all the rules on health and plant health, or of various obstacles to trade, where we should not reduce the standards that we have set, because our own public want to keep them, but where we could ensure that our efforts to provide technical assistance are effectively targeted so that they enable those countries to comply with them.
I am thinking, in particular, of all aspects of health and plant health.
We believe that these conditions for access to the market will help to improve the volume of foreign investment in those countries, provided that they are accompanied by an effective increase in their export capacity, and we should like to take the opportunity of this conference to go further in improving the promotion of investment in those countries, in particular by better use of the existing multilateral mechanisms, perhaps by using more actively what is already available in the way of guarantees for investment in least developed countries.
This being the case, let us not hide behind speeches that are too politically correct.
We must also be clear.
It is up to these countries themselves to create an environment that is more investment-friendly, by means of internal policies which we can support, and advise on, but which are, after all, the result of internal policy decisions which are sometimes difficult to take, and we are not responsible for this difficulty in taking decisions.
From this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear.
We must remember that these measures that I have just spoken about, which come into effect immediately, are only part of the result.
They have to be there in order to lend a certain amount of credibility to the action programme for the next ten years.
This action programme will serve as an itinerary.
I believe that it is very important to have an itinerary in this area, and it must be one that we can control together.
In fact I believe - and my Commission colleagues share this view - that it is only by exerting stronger collective pressure that we shall be able to speed up the abolition of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development in these countries, so that one of these days perhaps we shall be able, to quote Mr Miranda' s expression, to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Mr President, I want to welcome Mr Miranda's initiative in asking this question and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on his splendid initiative on 'Everything but arms', which we were associated with in Parliament, but did not have very much to do with.
It must be pointed out that the poorest and the least developed countries must be given special attention and, in the process, elimination of extreme poverty should be the primary goal.
According to UNCTAD calculations, while the gross domestic product of 49 LDCs rose by no more than 0.9% per year in real terms between 1990 and 1998, worldwide GDP grew by more than 2.5% per year.
Good governance is a key issue in the LDCs.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that there are many countries which are nominally democratic, but where, owing to their lack of an effective and fair legal system, there is no freedom for their people.
We in this Parliament should promote the rule of law as an essential criterion when we look at good governance criteria.
It is a matter of record also that the proportion of our aid budgets that goes to the LDCs has fallen while the proportion that goes to middle-ranking countries, such as Morocco and Algeria, has risen.
This is absolutely wrong.
The aid budget must concentrate on the poorest.
That is what our citizens expect and require.
Using the aid budget as some sort of underhand immigration policy is wrong.
Have an anti-immigration policy, by all means, but be honest about it.
We must not rob the poorest countries to achieve our own political ends.
Drastic reductions in the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries are urgently needed as action taken so far under the HIPC initiative will, as a result of falling raw material prices, be completely inadequate for any sustained financial relief.
I must also stress the need to guarantee funds to be set up or topped up in order to provide incentives for greater private investment and for the implementation of measures to encourage small loan arrangements, such as those introduced by the Gramien Bank in Bangladesh.
Finally, we must do everything we can to prevent conflict.
Conflict prevention is a key to helping the LDCs grow.
Mr President, as others have already suggested, the facts speak for themselves.
Most of the 640 million people who live in the Least Developed Countries, just over one-tenth of the world's entire population, are struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day.
Their average life expectancy is 50 years.
Half of them are illiterate and two-thirds of the world's children, most of them little girls, are not in any kind of primary education.
LDCs have seen a severe drop in capital flows, down 45% since 1990; and official development assistance continues to go down, having fallen by 30% since 1990.
As the President-in-Office has said, the HIPC initiative is yielding very slow results and coming in too late.
Too many LDCs have totally unsustainable debt burdens.
Many LDCs, such as Zambia for example, where I was recently, are still spending twice as much on debt servicing as they are on health and education.
This UN Conference therefore has to be about a new deal for LDCs; one that promotes pro-poor economic growth, poverty reduction and sustainable development.
There will be, as Mr Lamy knows, a thematic session on trade, which I know he will expect to be used by the LDCs as a platform in preparation for the Qatar ministerial meeting.
I am sure they will give ample evidence of the fall in commodity prices - which have fallen by 30% from 1998 to 1999 - and we will need to acknowledge that globalisation and liberalisation have had very mixed results.
Everything but arms represents significant progress.
I wonder whether Commissioner Lamy would be able to predict that other countries such as the US or Japan might be prepared to follow his excellent lead.
I think I see him smile, and this might present us with some difficulties.
At this point it would be interesting to hear from Commissioner Lamy which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms, as the title of this initiative is a bit perplexing.
Finally, this Conference is about analysing what we can do that is deliverable for the least developed countries when millions of people are unable to treat pneumonia, diarrhoea, TB or AIDS; when you have no medicines to give to your sick child or your dying wife; when your child is at school under a tree trying to learn to write its name with a twig.
Mr President, the gap with the poorest countries is widening instead of narrowing.
Over the past decade, aid to developing countries has fallen by 24% and that to the poorest by as much as 45%.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
The UN Conference is pointless if it remains bogged down in fine promises and vague declarations.
The poorest countries only benefit from concrete and binding agreements.
Trade concessions on their own are not sufficient.
The rich countries must ease their burden of debt by a substantial amount.
Repayment means that in many countries, any form of development is frustrated even before it gets off the ground.
It is of the utmost importance that we should pursue a separate discharge policy for each developing country individually.
It is entirely reasonable to prescribe conditions in our debt and aid policy with regard to the fight against poverty, sound administration and sound management of public finance.
Debt relief has no meaning if debts keep mounting up.
The European Commission' s policy should therefore be aimed at developing capacity and sensible financial management.
Only then can countries develop education and health care; only then can investments be stimulated.
In many of the poorest developing countries, power, as well as available resources, are very badly distributed.
If political and economic power are not distinctly separated, only corruption can reign supreme.
It is hopeless to fight poverty if countries remain trapped in violent conflict.
Let us call a spade a spade: tyranny and unbounded greed on the part of irresponsible leaders are just as important in terms of causing inadequate development as is a drop in aid.
The chasm between rich and poor can only be bridged if our aid effort is stepped up considerably and if the countries are better governed.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to confine myself to a small number of questions.
How honest are we, in fact, when we claim that we mainly fight poverty in the least developed countries?
Our fellow MEPs have illustrated this amply.
Furthermore, we find that our aid does not even reach the poorest in the poor countries - and surely that is what all this is about - for they remain in poverty.
How coherent is our own policy?
How honest are we when we claim that we are quite willing to import everything, except weapons, from the poor countries?
Is this not, in the first instance, an act of goodwill to include the southern countries in a new WTO round?
I wonder about that, for I note that we remain caught up in our own incoherence.
I would like to quote the delay of imports of sugar as a case in point: that is nothing but a disgrace!
Must we really continue to support our own sugar production?
Surely there is no reason for doing that!
Mr President, on the subject of aid to developing countries, and in particular to those known as the least-developed countries, what are the facts?
We discovered these facts just now.
The mandate for the third UN conference covers, in particular, public development aid, debt and trade.
In that case, we must not try to evade the following conclusion, namely that the commitments made for the preceding decade have not been fulfilled.
It has often been said, but it is necessary to repeat it, that the decrease in the flow of public development aid is unacceptable.
It has dwindled by almost half during the last decade, falling to only 0.05% of the GDP of the donor countries, far below the 0.7% objective set by the UN.
In Europe, only the northern countries are meeting this commitment.
Moreover, the proportion of this public development aid that is spent on economic infrastructure and the production sector has also been reduced.
What does the future hold for these countries, if they cannot achieve a level of development which will enable them to make choices that are truly independent?
There is no need to seek further afield for the reasons for the results that have been obtained.
The mere mention of the fall in life expectancy to 51 years gives an indication of the size of the disaster.
Behind the experts' reports there are men and women who are living in extreme poverty: 614 million people, or one tenth of the world' s population, who live on less than two dollars a day.
Worse that this, as UNCTAD reports, the least-developed countries are caught in a downward spiral and a vicious circle of economic regression, social tensions and violence, which all reinforce one another.
Thus the proportion of their GDP accounted for by the manufacturing sector has not increased, and in some cases it has even decreased.
The LDCs are still, in many cases, exporters of only one or two basic products.
Production capacity has been reduced in some countries.
For example, the committee that is preparing for the third conference has even noted that very often the industries created to supply the internal market have been forced out of the market by the increasingly keen competition from imports which is the result of liberalising trade.
The third UN conference must not be just another ritual gathering, and I believe that the European Union, which is to some extent hosting the summit, should help to make sure that it does not turn into one.
Europe' s political authority is achieved from its capacity to stand up to an all-consuming globalisation governed only by the laws of commerce and of money.
The effectiveness of its development policy is measured by practical action, and there are avenues which still need to be explored as a matter of urgency, such as debt cancellation, the need for urgent action to recognise the right of countries hit by AIDS to manufacture and sell the necessary medicines, the need for high-quality public education services to contribute to the crucial development of human capabilities, and the need to help these countries to become self-sufficient in food.
I believe that development cannot be summed up simply as the organisation of trading relations...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the question which arises is: what is preventing the developed countries from helping the poor countries more effectively?
The percentage of the GDP dedicated by the wealthy States to the development of poor countries is increasingly small.
We know that, in many cases, these same wealthy countries flood the poor countries with toxic waste or allow shady businesses to operate in tourism as well.
Our Group has put forward a proposal for the reinsertion of students from those countries who have studied in European universities and wish to start work in their country of origin. This would prevent that brain drain which is currently holding back development to such a degree.
It might cost little to treat a sick person and even less to prevent the illness, but AIDS is continuing to spread because of a lack of political will and economic commitment.
Globalisation is proving to be a tragedy for all those who are poor and is certainly not increasing the prosperity of the wealthy.
Mr President, I really do hope that the Commission will help ensure that there is no hiding behind mere words with, as a result, resolutions being adopted that consist of non-binding statements in the form of recycled wordings to which the Member States have agreed at other international meetings.
If arrangements are to be of immediate effect, as the Commission wishes, the EU must appreciate that the HIPC agreement is quite inadequate.
There is a need for an international agreement aimed at genuinely releasing the developing countries from their debts by, for example, integrating the international objectives on poverty so that a sustainable debt is defined on the basis of the countries' need to combat poverty.
At present, a sustainable debt is defined in the HIPC initiative on the basis of non-documented sustainability values, and most of those countries that have obtained debt relief are spending more on debt repayment than on health and education.
In short, the EU ought to promote coherence in development policy and supplement this with effective support for developing the infrastructure of the developing countries so that they can carve out a place for themselves on the world market.
There are enough tasks to get to grips with.
These are already well defined. What we now need is not more words, but action; and action which hopefully does not end up like the 'Everything but Arms' initiative in which the Commission produced a fine proposal which, unfortunately, was completely destroyed by the Council which postponed the agreement on rice, sugar and bananas until the year 2009.
It is simply scandalous and something we cannot live with here in the European Union.
Mr President, the fact that only one of the 50 poorest countries, namely Botswana, has managed to get out of the poverty trap over the last 25 years proves that the basic system is flawed.
Providing ostensibly social aid and even slashing these countries' debts are only cosmetic measures with no long-term effects.
Multinational groups have established a system of exploitation against these countries in collaboration with former colonial powers and other industrialised countries, which is every bit as cruel as it was in the colonial era.
It is amazing that often the countries richest in raw materials have the poorest population.
Take the example of Angola.
It is obvious that this system has been implemented on purpose.
The African country richest in raw materials was once the biggest coffee exporter in the world with enough money to feed its 12 million people easily.
Mr President, the decision to grant the poorest countries access to the European market is a good start.
Let us hope that the rest of the industrialised world will follow our lead.
But we need much more than that, and the health initiative for the least developed countries - "All but AIDS" - is a case in point.
95% of people suffering from AIDS live in developing countries.
Also, diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis claim too many victims annually.
Healthcare in the poorest countries is seriously underfunded.
It appears that the least developed countries are spending as little as USD 8 per person on healthcare.
According to the WHO, this figure should be 8 or 9 times higher.
That is why the European Union should have the courage to take unilateral initiatives at the third UN Conference in May.
I would like to list a few of these initiatives.
European aid in the field of healthcare should be discontinued, so that the poorest countries, such as India, can buy medicines against AIDS cheaply using our aid money.
Secondly, the EU should ask the Member States to abolish the export tax on medicines for poverty-associated illnesses.
Thirdly, aid for basic healthcare should be doubled in the 2001 Community budget.
Half of that amount should be earmarked for the least developed countries.
Fourthly, European legislation on orphan medicines should be tailored to the needs of the developing countries, so that the pharmaceutical industry in Europe is encouraged to also produce medicines for the poor countries, such as medicines against AIDS, malaria, etc.
Fifthly, we should openly declare our support for Brazil and South Africa as soon as charges are brought against them.
Sixthly, we should defend the position on cheap medicines and the right to parallel imports, even in international forums, and should ask the TRIPS agreement to be adapted accordingly.
My seventh, and last, suggestion would be for all EU Member States to join forces to set up an international health and poverty fund, a fund from which an international, strategic long-term approach can be financed.
Europe should also free up extra monies for this fund.
Such a coherent initiative - "All but AIDS" - would be a fantastic contribution on the part of the Commission, and would send out a clear message that we, alongside "Everything but Arms" , can take a unilateral step ourselves.
Such a unilateral step coming from Europe would have far greater impact, precisely in the new Bush era, than all kinds of general declarations.
We need tangible results.
I am convinced that the EU and Mr Lamy are extremely well placed to achieve these.
Mr President, I would like to thank the members for the important contributions that have been made to this debate.
I would also like to thank Mr Miranda in particular for giving us the opportunity through his question to discuss the important issues that are to be dealt with at the third conference on least developed countries, which will take place in Brussels next month, in a careful and penetrative way.
I hope that this conference will provide opportunity to answer the very relevant and central question put by Mrs Maes, namely how honest we actually are in our efforts to assist the least developed countries.
It is precisely this to which we hope the conference in Brussels will provide very definite answers, not just fine words.
I have great respect for Mrs SandbÃŠk' s description of the 'Everything but arms' decision, but I still see this decision as an important step along the way.
This is an opportunity to show that the Union is honest in its efforts to genuinely assist the least developed countries.
It is an important first step that has been taken and one which, as I pointed out in my introduction, shows that the Union is genuinely prepared to let development aspects control its priorities in trade matters.
I agree that it would be desirable to go even further, but do not let us diminish this first step.
In conclusion, I will simply answer Mr Deva by saying that I am pleased that he mentions the matter of conflict prevention as an important part of our continued efforts when it comes to assisting the least developed countries.
The Swedish Presidency has made conflict prevention one of its core issues.
We at the Council have also asked if we may come back to this Chamber later this spring to discuss conflict prevention.
Moreover, conflict prevention will be an important issue at the European Council' s conference in Gothenburg in June.
I hope that this will provide an important reminder that the prevention of conflicts and efforts to help the least developed countries are very closely related.
Mr President, I would like to make three comments in response to the debate.
The first has to do with the issue the President-in-Office of the Council has just addressed.
Like most of you, I think that development results from an, at times very mysterious, alchemy, the ingredients of which are easy to name but whose mixture is difficult to achieve.
Like Mr Deva and the President-in-Office, I think that peace is probably the decisive ingredient ahead of such elements as the fight against corruption.
There are many others but I hope we can avoid giving the impression that the least-developed countries have a monopoly over such difficulties and troubles.
I think we ourselves do not always come out unscathed.
Mrs SandbÃŠk, the 'Everything but arms' initiative is a concrete action for which we had to battle hard, with the complicity of our chairman and friend, Leif Pagrotski, to obtain a qualified majority.
What would you have said had we failed in our attempt?
These concrete decisions have been taken and are now going to be implemented.
Mrs Kinnock wanted to know which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms.
The list has not been finalised.
I think that the conference on the LDCs will enable us to exert a bit of pressure.
Chile and New Zealand have displayed positive tendencies.
We are well aware that, at least at this stage, Japan will not fall into line as regards the totality of its imports, especially because of its rice problems.
Nonetheless, as regards industrial rates, it has already taken measures which are in the right direction.
Finally, the United States will have to review its system of generalised preferences this year and, thanks to the various lobbying methods at our disposal in Congress, we will see to it that, when it does, it will have our initiative engraved in its memory.
I would like to dispel any impression that we have in some way bought the agreement of least-developed countries so as to organise a round of commercial negotiations which is in our interest but not theirs.
Such an impression is totally without foundation.
In the first place, this round is of interest to LDCs, even to the extent that, between the law of the jungle of unregulated international exchange and a round of commercial negotiations which will establish new rules, their choice seems to be made.
Secondly, it is a question of giving credence to our own position and, Mrs Maes, of showing that, within the framework of our general policy, we are capable, without any equivalent concession, of taking it upon ourselves to resolve internal political difficulties in order to move towards what we have to do.
My third and final comment has to do with access to medicines.
This point was brought up by Mr Miranda, Mrs Boudjenah and Mr van den Berg.
As I responded yesterday in this very House to a question by Mrs Carlotti on this subject, we have, within the Commission, put on the table a comprehensive action plan covering not only the problems of finance in terms of development aid and those of additional incentives for public research, but also problems relating to the commercial aspects associated with intellectual property and the availability of medicines.
This general plan is now on the table.
You are aware of it. It is available for you to read.
It will be debated in the General Affairs Council on 14 May in sufficient time for the conclusions of this Council to be presented at the conference on LDCs which will take place at the end of May.
So you see that, from this standpoint, all of us, including the presidency which, as the President-in-Office has just pointed out, is making this a priority, have tried to ensure that a certain number of Commission proposals are transformed into action after they have passed before the Council and Parliament, so that we can look ahead to this conference at least with an easy conscience.
I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time to the Council (B5-0163/2001).
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Question No 1 by (H-0248/01)
Subject: Crisis in the Balkans As developments in the Balkans crisis have revealed, recognition of the borders of many countries in the region is a matter of direct or indirect contention.
A case in point is the border between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Serbia, on which the two countries themselves have agreed but which Albanian groups in FYROM itself and in Kosovo refuse to accept.
What is the Council's view of these current developments and, in particular, what is its position on the acceptance of borders as a stabilising force in the Balkans crisis?
Question No 2 by (H-0259/01)
Subject: Uncontrolled activity of extremist organisations in southern Serbia Terrorist activity by Albanian extremists in southern Serbia and FYROM, even within the KFOR-monitored zone, is out of control.
Terrorist operations and fighting, even involving the use of heavy weaponry, are reported on an almost daily basis.
The Yugoslav peace plan for the Presevo Valley has, in principle, received a favourable response.
Does the Council agree that the above peace plan constitutes a sufficient basis for talks?
What measures will it take to facilitate the opening of talks between the political leaders of the Albanian-speaking population of southern Serbia and the Yugoslav leadership?
Question No 3 by (H-0306/01)
Subject: Situation in FYROM and danger of a general conflagration in the Balkans The armed and murderous attacks against FYROM by the illegal mercenary army of the UCK which has been strengthened and armed by NATO have intensified and are now threatening to further destabilise the Balkans, causing a general conflagration.
Far from promoting stability, the presence of KFOR troops in FYROM actually causes further destabilisation. This is confirmed by media reports that armed mercenaries are crossing over from the German and American sectors unimpeded.
All these attacks and developments are the result of the 'divide and rule' policy pursued by NATO and the EU, a policy which is advanced by inciting and exploiting nationalism and splinter groups and tendencies with the aim of setting up protectorates in the region in order better to exploit its wealth and peoples.
What specific steps does the Council intend to take to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99, to safeguard the territorial inviolability of FYROM and to put an end to all foreign interference in the Balkans?
The Council has repeatedly expressed its deep concern at the great tensions and extensive violence in southern Serbia and the increased number of incidents in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia particularly close to the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - incidents that the Council strongly condemned in its conclusions of 26 February.
On the same occasion the Council repeated that it stands firmly by the principle that all the borders in the area are inviolable.
Since then the European Union has been actively engaged in attempting to solve the crisis in close cooperation with the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO/KFOR and the authorities in FYROM.
The Council has also stated that it is prepared to continue to give practical support to the efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict with full respect for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
With a view to this the Union welcomes the High Representative Mr Solana' s decision to station further significant numbers of observers - up to 30 - from the Union' s observation mission in southern Serbia, this since at the Council' s conference (General Affairs) on 19 March, following contact with NATO and following the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the parties, he assessed that the safety of the observers was carefully guaranteed.
In its conclusions of 19 March the Council supported the initiative by the authorities in Belgrade to find a peaceful and permanent solution to the current situation in southern Serbia.
This initiative, which was presented to the European Union Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy by Serbia' s Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Covic, and the Foreign Minister of the Yugoslav Federation, Mr Svilanovic, is considered to form a suitable basis for continued activity.
At this time the Commission announced that it would double its financial support in the Presevo Valley.
This support now amounts to nearly EUR 2 million.
The Commission is also considering what contributions can be made to Serbia in the long term in accordance with the EUR 240 million programme in 2001.
As confirmation of the Council' s commitment the honourable Members of Parliament should be aware of the fact that a representative of the High Representative Javier Solana actively participated - together with a representative of the Secretary-General of NATO - in the negotiations which, on 13 March 2001, resulted in the Serbian and Albanian representatives signing the cease-fire agreement and to a dialogue being started between the Yugoslav-Serbian authorities and the Presevo Albanian representatives on 23 March.
The Council welcomed Javier Solana' s status report, submitted on 19 March, concerning further EU measures in respect of south-east Serbia and urged him to continue his work on an EU strategy for this region in cooperation with the presidency and the Commission in order to support the process in the region and contribute to international efforts in reaching a peaceful solution.
The Council reacted quickly and clearly to the serious incidents in FYROM that took place recently.
The ministerial troika visited Skopje on 22 March and Mr Solana visited FYROM on a further two occasions, on 20 and 26-27 March.
The Council entirely rejects the tendentious and unfounded allegations in the honourable Member of Parliament' s question No 306 concerning the role of NATO and KFOR in the crisis in FYROM.
The EU position is clearly stated in the declaration by the European Council issued in Stockholm on 23 March.
I am here on behalf of Mr Papayannakis.
I would like to thank the Council of Ministers for its answer, which I think was good in many ways.
I have a supplementary question which concerns the demands that are now being made by the Albanian minority in Macedonia for increased influence and some form of self-rule or federation within Macedonia.
Does the Council of Ministers have any viewpoint on the demands being put forward by the Albanian minority in Macedonia?
As I said in my introduction, the basis for any solution of the conflicts that we are now seeing must be a respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.
This was also concluded by both the Council and the European Council on several occasions.
However, it is, of course, very important to bring about an intensification of the interethnic dialogue in various ways.
One of the reasons why we have had a continual presence of Union representatives in the region in recent weeks is precisely in order to be able to promote this interethnic dialogue within the framework of the respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.
In general terms, the Union - in the Council' s opinion - should continue to do everything to promote this dialogue, whilst always having these fundamental principles in mind.
Mr President, I shall overlook the fact that your reply was something of a "Lord have mercy" to Javier Solana.
You mentioned his name five times and maybe it is better to leave him out of it when we are discussing the Balkans.
But to get back to the point of my question.
Your standpoint has one positive aspect - the Council' s determination not to violate all the borders in the area.
What I should like to ask, just to clarify matters and to stop playing with words, is: do we assume and do we mean that the borders of the whole of Yugoslavia, a Yugoslavia with no more Milosevic, a Yugoslavia with Milosevic in prison, also include Kosovo?
I raise this with all due respect for the comments made to the effect that, if this problem is not resolved, we shall have continuing instability in the area.
I do not know whether this was a hymn of praise to Mr Solana.
If it was a hymn, it was to something that I would regard as a very active policy by the Union to attempt to help solve one of the most serious conflicts on our continent.
I must say that although we are seeing a lot of human suffering in the areas in question, I still believe that the Union' s very active work has helped limit the suffering and that now, following some very difficult weeks, we can actually see a light in an otherwise very gloomy situation.
I would therefore like to say that we in the Union - which also includes Mr Solana, who has really worked hard on this matter together with Mr Patten and the Swedish Presidency - can really be proud of what we have achieved, although it is not yet sufficient.
Mr President, may I say that I am totally dissatisfied with the Council representative' s reply. First of all, I asked a straightforward question.
What is being done about applying Security Council Resolution 1244?
This resolution makes provision for Kosovo to be a province of Serbia, KLA criminals to be disarmed and the borders to be guarded by Yugoslavian forces, whereas it was the presence of KFOR, with the blessing of the European Union and ÃÃÃÃ, which facilitated both the attacks in southern Serbia, in the Presevo valley, and the invasion of KLA criminals into FYROM.
And the question here, Mr President, is who gave Robertson, the NATO secretary-general, the right to move in and pressurise the FYROM government into negotiating with these criminals?
And Mr Solana did the same.
Is this what they mean by their determination to guard the borders?
Tell us once and for all, is Kosovo a Serbian province or an independent state?
And then, Mr President, I was struck by the presidency' s statement that Presevo...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I realise that Mr Korakas is not satisfied with my answer.
On behalf of the Council I must once again reject some of the allegations in Mr Korakas' question as tendentious.
Who is it that must ensure that the UN Security Council' s resolutions are observed?
Obviously it is the UN' s Security Council, but there are many international organisations which are cooperating in order to do this within the framework of the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council.
The Union is one of the most important players in this respect and I hope and believe that the Union will continue to be active.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am worried about events spiralling out of control in the Balkans.
I would like to raise the matter of the forthcoming debate in the Bulgarian national assembly on the free passage of NATO forces without the need for prior approval by parliament, the first time this has been allowed in a non-NATO country.
There is also talk of leaving unmanned American aeroplanes on Bulgarian territory.
What I am wondering is, does ÃÃÃÃ intend to use Bulgaria against FYROM in the same way as it used FYROM against Yugoslavia?
At the same time, people protesting in Bulgaria against the country' s involvement with NATO are being persecuted and protestors from the new "Che Guevara" movement have been arrested and tried on charges of hooliganism.
All this indicates the risk of a crisis spreading in Bulgaria.
I should like to ask if the Council has faced up to such a possibility and thought out any action.
The honourable Member is clinging onto speculation regarding which the Council cannot comment further.
Allow me simply to express a hope that the collective efforts that the Union is making together with others to restrict the conflict and to bring about a development towards stability and democracy will produce results such that the honourable Member' s speculation need not become reality.
I would like to assist the President-in-Office of the Council by addressing my fellow Members from Greece and asking them if they would tell us about the rumours which are doing the rounds on the application for Greece' s accession to Yugoslavia.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Question No 4 by (H-0290/01):
Subject: International Criminal Court Will the Council indicate its position on the slow ratification process of the proposed International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that it cannot be formally established until 60 countries have ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and that, in February 2001, Dominica became the 29th State to ratify the Statute?
Question no 5 by (H-0299/01):
Subject: International Criminal Court In its answer dated 24 October 2000 to Oral Question H-0763/00 concerning the process for the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Council Presidency stated that it was also possible to envisage substantial progress being made in the near future, since eight more Member States were quietly confident that ratification would take place before the end of the year.
However, the first three months of 2001 have now elapsed, but only four more Member States have ratified the Statute.
Furthermore, the Council also stated in its answer that three other Member States had reiterated their intention to ratify (sic) but had noted that some procedural or constitutional problems still remained.
Can the Council indicate the type of procedural or constitutional problems to be solved by the Member States, the progress made in the ratification procedures in each of the Member States which have not yet ratified the Statute (Denmark, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and its assessment of the likelihood that the ratification process will be concluded in those seven Member States by 18 July 2001, a date which will mark the third (!) anniversary of the conclusion of the Rome Conference?
The European Union feels that a culture of immunity from prosecution cannot be tolerated, particularly where gross violations of international law such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are concerned.
Where the national courts cannot or will not act, the international community has the ultimate responsibility for guaranteeing that justice is done.
The Union therefore considers it necessary for the International Criminal Court to be set up within the near future in order to increase respect for international humanitarian rights and human rights.
By abolishing immunity from prosecution, the Court will reinforce the rule of law and justice and contribute to consolidating world peace.
The Union strongly recommends that the International Criminal Court be set up in the near future.
With this aim in mind the Union started international efforts to encourage as many states as possible to sign up to the Rome Statute before the deadline expired on 31 December 2000.
The Union has also undertaken to encourage the countries with associate membership of the Union to sign or ratify the Statute and the Union is offering its expertise in this area to all interested countries.
Moreover, the Union is firmly resolved to give its support to the actual setting up of the Court.
The Union expects the Rome Statute to enter into force in the near future, when the 60 ratifications required have been achieved, including ratification by all the Union' s Member States.
Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and Finland have already ratified the Rome Statute.
The other Member States have all started the ratification process and in the majority of cases it should soon be completed, depending on the national procedure.
In this context it should be noted that the implementation of the Rome Statute in national legislation is a demanding task which, in a number of cases, even requires constitutional amendments.
The situation concerning the ratification of the Rome Statute in the Union is regularly taken up by the presidency at meetings of the Council' s working group on international law.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and would like to give him some information of which he may not be aware.
The Irish government has stated its intention to hold a referendum on 31 May 2001 to ratify the International Criminal Court and to alter our constitution for that.
I should like to know what positive or proactive action is being taken by the presidency to ensure that not only the existing Member States within the EU, but also those countries with associate membership numbering 27 in total, which could help bring us up above the 60 countries required for formal ratification and the enforcement of this International Criminal Court, actually ratify.
Following on from that, I know it may not be his exact role within this House, but he may be able to enlighten us as regards the Swedish difficulties that may arise with regard to ratification of the International Criminal Court.
As I mentioned in my answer the Union has undertaken to help all the countries that are associated with the Union to ensure that they can sign or ratify the Statute.
In addition, we are offering technical expertise.
I am therefore convinced that with this commitment the Union will contribute not just to the fifteen Member States being able to participate fully in this important instrument as soon as possible, but also the associate countries.
The Member asked about any national difficulties in the case of my own country, Sweden.
As I said in my introduction, it is a fairly extensive process in many countries - including my own.
However, I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable Member that Sweden will be able to deposit the ratification instrument during the period for which we hold the presidency, so that we, too, can join the ranks of countries that have already ratified the Statute - and that as quickly as possible.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I somehow get the impression that we are going to have to worm information out of you.
Mr Crowley has given us the good news that the Irish government has stated its intention to ratify the International Criminal Court.
You have also just given us the good news that Sweden will do likewise by the end of the next six-month period.
Could you give us some good news about the five remaining countries, which are Portugal, Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark?
You spoke of a long process, but three years is an awfully long time!
I thought the purpose of this Question Time was precisely to demand answers from the Council, which is why I am very pleased to be able to answer Mr Dupuis' s question further.
Where Portugal is concerned, I know that the Portuguese are hoping to be able to complete the process when some essential supplements have been made to the Portuguese constitution before the summer recess.
As far as Denmark is concerned, the matter was taken up for first reading in the Danish Parliament as long ago as last autumn.
It is expected that the second and third readings will be able to take place before the summer recess.
Greece reports that it needs to amend its penal law.
It is expected that these changes will take a few months more.
They have not yet ventured to give an exact date for ratification.
In Great Britain the speed depends very much on whether parliament has sufficient time - I am sure that the honourable Member is aware of the discussions that are going on in the United Kingdom concerning a possible parliamentary election - but the British hope that they will still be able to adopt the necessary legislation during the current parliamentary session.
Finally, in the Netherlands, a two-thirds majority is needed in parliament. However, it is hoped that the necessary legislation will be able to be adopted within a short time.
As I said in my answer - I was trying to save a bit of time, but I am very happy to elaborate on it - I am convinced that all the Member States of the Union will have carried out the necessary ratification in the not-too-distant future.
I wanted to ask the President-in-Office about Greece.
However, he has replied, so perhaps there is no point.
So I shall simply take this opportunity to say to Mr Dupuis, in connection with the previous question, you should show some respect, you really should.
One might accuse him of wanting to join Mr Le Pen' s party - after all, they are already in the same group.
He should show some respect and not use such figures of speech.
Question No 6 by (H-0251/01):
Subject: Charter of Fundamental Rights The Swedish Minister of State told the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 13 February 2001 that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, although 'solemnly proclaimed' was not regarded by the Council as being binding in all respects.
In order to avoid legal uncertainty and political confusion, would the President-in-Office specify which elements the Council considers binding and which not'.
The Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
At this stage the three institutions have recognised the political value of the document within the Union' s framework of action.
If the objective is to make existing rights more visible, however, certain of the rights that are proclaimed in the Charter are already found in international conventions or in national constitutional traditions.
The fact that these rights are set out in the Charter does not change the legal value they have irrespective of the existence of the Charter, since the basis of their observance in Union law rests on Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union.
The fact that the rights have been formulated in the Charter thus does not affect their value.
Regarding the question of whether the Charter is to be regarded as legally binding in all respects, in December 2000 - as the honourable Member knows - the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice approved a declaration concerning the future of the Union which specifies that the question of the status of the Charter is one of the issues to be taken up in conjunction with the preparatory work to be carried out before 2004.
It was agreed that when this work has been carried out a new Intergovernmental Conference would be convened to discuss the status of the Charter, amongst other things.
The Minister will be aware that the Court of Justice is already deploying the Charter quite broadly in its jurisprudence.
My worry is that we face a situation where the Commission, Parliament and the Court think of the Charter as binding but the Council does not, creating a situation that can only result in political and legal confusion.
Will he promise that the Council will at least keep the impact of the Charter closely under scrutiny and review its status on a continuing basis?
The Council has a duty to follow, discuss and monitor the question of the status of the Charter.
This was decided by the European Council in Nice and obviously the Council will abide by that decision.
Allow me to remind you that the various articles of the Charter are in part based on a number of rights taken from existing instruments.
A number of these rights are already "legally deployable" , i.e. they may form a suitable basis for a decision by a legal body, however, not by virtue of the fact that they are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but because they are taken from other instruments.
The Charter also contains a number of articles that are rather an expression of general political aims, for example Articles 37 and 38 concerning environmental and consumer protection.
These are not designed in such a way as to be legally deployable immediately.
However, I agree with the Member that it is an important task of the Council, Parliament and the Commission to continue to monitor this question in accordance with what was said at the European Council summit in Nice.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened to you very carefully, but I believe many MEPs and many European citizens have been left with a bad taste in our mouths in view of the results of the last summit, held in Nice, where the Charter of Human Rights was not approved, and I do not know why the representatives of the Member States' governments did not want to approve it.
But the fact is that I asked a question on a concrete case of human rights, relating to the use of Euskera [Basque] - the so-called lingua navarrorum - in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, and the Commission replied that as language rights are a subject not in force in the Charter of Human Rights at a European level, complaints can only be made at the level of national institutions and courts.
I should like to ask you if you agree with this kind of explanation or whether we European citizens have a right to greater protection by the European institutions.
The Council is not in a position to judge the application in the particular case taken up by the Member.
Allow me to mention two things.
Firstly: you stated that the Charter has not been adopted.
The answer is that it has been solemnly proclaimed.
Secondly: where minority languages are concerned, another important institution - which is also geographically close to Parliament - namely the Council of Europe, has drawn up a convention on the status of minority languages.
I regard this as also illustrating the importance of the fact that in a discussion of the Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights we also consider other important instruments in this area, e.g. the Council of Europe' s Convention on Human Rights.
Mr President, could I ask the President-in-Office once again to restate so everybody can hear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a non-binding political declaration as approved by the Heads of State and Heads of Government in Nice.
If the Court of Justice or any other court in the European Union is using it to bind Member States, individuals or associations to an interpretation of that charter, then they are incorrect in law, in justice and in legal interpretation.
The only Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms which can be utilised in the Member State courts or even in the Court of Justice, as authoritative rather than binding, is the European Convention on Human Rights which is a Council of Europe document.
The Member requests repetition.
I don' t like repeating myself, but I am at Parliament' s service.
Allow me to explain as follows: from our viewpoint the Charter is a political declaration and is only politically binding.
However, large parts of the content of the Charter are already found in binding conventions, primarily the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Charter neither adds to nor detracts from these conventions in any way, but it is significant as clarification and as a political manifesto.
Question No 7 by (H-0252/01):
Subject: Letter Of Intent/Framework Agreement What progress has been made with the Letter Of Intent/Framework Agreement, signed last summer by six Member State governments, to create an internal market for the procurement of defence equipment?
In July 1998 the defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Great Britain and my own country Sweden signed a Declaration Of Intent concerning measures to ease structural change in the European defence industry.
Two years later, in July 2000, these six states signed the Framework Agreement on measures to facilitate structural change in the European defence industry and the ways in which it operates.
The honourable Member of Parliament raises the issue of what has been achieved as regards the Declaration Of Intent and the Framework Agreement.
The Council has no role to play in the cooperation that has been established between the six states and is therefore not in a position to be able to provide direct information concerning the situation and what has been achieved in this area.
I understand the technicalities and thank the Minister for that.
But would the Council be in favour of repealing Article 296 of the EC Treaty, in other words, disallowing the exemption from the single market provisions and so introducing competition into defence procurement?
The Council has not had opportunity to discuss this matter.
Again, I am not in a position to be able to give any direct answer to the question put by the honourable Member of Parliament.
Mr President, I often receive queries from citizens wishing to carry weapons in Europe.
These people are hunters and marksmen travelling to competitions.
There are huge discrepancies in the rules here.
These are serious complaints and we are being asked why the internal market does not function in this area.
Do you intend to take any initiatives here?
No, we do not.
Mr President, I wish to take the opportunity of the President-in-Office' s presence in this debate to ask him whether he is aware that the Spanish public company, Santa Barbara, has just been sold to the U.S. company, General Dynamics, having refused an alternative offer from a German company, despite the fact that Santa Barbara actually has a contract to build hundreds of 'Leopard' tanks that are patented in Germany.
The Spanish government' s decision is in clear breach of existing agreements to develop the European defence industry, which are the subject of this question.
I should like to know whether you agree with this action by the Spanish government, which has sold a publicly owned company to a company from the United States?
The President of the Council is not in a position to comment on the individual case brought up by the honourable Member of Parliament.
Allow me simply to state very briefly the legal position of this agreement because I happen to be a citizen of a country that is one of the signatories.
The Framework Agreement is now subject to ratification by the signatory states.
It has not yet entered into force, so in this respect, too, the question that the honourable Member is asking is not relevant.
Question No 8 by (H-0253/01):
Subject: Distortion of competition resulting from national compensation schemes for military purchasing On 15 December the Belgian Federation decided to discontinue the practice of linking its military purchases to economic compensation schemes for firms in Flanders and Wallonia.
The cabinet's notification of an order for night-glasses says: 'The cabinet confirms that clauses on economic compensation will not be included in any further orders'.
Hitherto the cabinet had endeavoured, as far as possible, to place orders involving billions of francs for the armed forces with 'Belgian' firms.
These compensatory schemes were always shrouded in an atmosphere of protectionism and wheeling-and-dealing because the decision-making process did not reflect the market mechanism.
What initiative will the Council take in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to ensure that the fifteen EU Member States follow the Belgian example and put an end to any national compensatory schemes for military purchases?
The question that the honourable Member raises has never been put before the Council.
In any case, in the present circumstances the Council has no authority to monitor or intervene in national decisions concerning purchases of military equipment.
This is also in itself an answer to the follow-on question put by the previous Member.
I must thank the President of the Council for his very elaborate and extensive response which could, however, be summarised in two sentences flat.
I do not know whether to laugh or cry.
Whilst all of Europe is wondering how it should start to act as a united front in its defence policy, for example after the Kosovo war, you are coming up with this response.
I am really starting to question the Council' s validity.
You were absent during the foot-and-mouth debate, as well as during the debate on the discharge.
The discharge, as granted by the Council, was an illustration of bad craftsmanship pure and simple.
I cannot understand why you are simply fobbing us off with such a response.
Indeed, Article 296 of the Treaty on European Union imposes a few restrictions on yourselves in this respect.
However, you could also start applying Article 296(2), and you could at least ask the Commission to ensure that you have authority to act in this field.
At a time when a Member State is finally abandoning economic compensations and moving away from dubious practices, I find the Council' s response in this matter unacceptable.
I actually have nothing to add beyond what I stated in my initial answer.
I must distance myself from some of the groundless assertions made by the honourable Member and can only confirm that the Council has no authority either to monitor or to intervene in national decisions concerning purchases of military equipment.
It is the Council' s task to pursue the Treaty. That is what we do.
Question No 9 by (H-0257/01):
Subject: Mad cow problem and funding urgent measures to solve it Does the Council not believe that steps to solve this serious problem should not be impeded in the short term by the limits imposed on the CAP by the AGENDA 2000 financial perspective, pending the necessary reform of the CAP?
On 12 March the Council adopted the guidelines for the 2002 budget.
In the conclusions to these the Council confirms that it will apply the institutional agreement of 6 May 1999 in full.
However, the Council emphasises that it is important to make a sufficiently large margin available under the various ceilings in the budget plan when the budget is adopted.
As regards financial repercussions of the BSE crisis, the Council would remind you that, in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council summit in Nice, both the budget plan and the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline must be observed even if new measures or supplementary measures are required.
The Council does not consider that the budget framework on which the European Council agreed in Berlin and which was confirmed in Nice is any obstacle to effective measures being taken to deal with the problems currently facing the beef market.
This framework has not prevented the Council from agreeing on important measures in respect of public health in order to restore consumer confidence.
In particular, in February the Council adopted a common position on a Regulation establishing provisions for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Once this has been approved by the Council and European Parliament it will provide a framework for sustainable production.
The Council is currently discussing the package of measures put forward by the Commission in February, the aim of which is to deal with the disequilibrium in the market for beef within the Union in both the short term and the long term and to raise the quality.
In the financing summary accompanying the proposal the Commission shows how the financial consequences of such measures can be met within the budget plan.
At the meeting of the Ecofin Council on 12 February in conjunction with the Council' s adoption of the proposal for supplementary and amending budget 1/2001 in respect of BSE-related measures, Commissioner Schreyer said that depending on developments in the market, the Commission would consider legislative initiatives to cover the risk of further costs in the budget with a view to observing the financial frameworks of Agenda 2000.
The Council therefore feels that the Commission should be able to implement the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy without this being affected by BSE.
Mr President, I do not think that we can allow ourselves to become paralysed by the shortcomings in the political, social and economic project that Europe needs and which Europe' s citizens are demanding every time the European Union is called on to take an exceptional decision. This is what happened in Nice and what is happening again today with mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth.
The European Union and, above all, the Council, must therefore not avert their eyes from the fact that an issue as significant as reforming the CAP cannot wait until 2006 and that such a reform requires changes to the structure of the European budget and profound changes to the tight financial perspective of Agenda 2000.
Is the Council really willing to adapt Agenda 2000 should this be made necessary by serious practical problems such as mad cow disease, for example, which are affecting certain countries particularly seriously, such as my own, Galicia, thereby avoiding a situation in which, to the incomprehension and confusion of Europe' s citizens, the Union denies itself recourse to the political weapons it has at its disposal?
I would simply like to remind the honourable Member that the decision on Agenda 2000 in March 1999 also includes what is known as a mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy that is to be implemented in 2002 and 2003.
I assume that the Council will discuss the matter taken up by the Member in an appropriate way prior to this.
Question No 10 by (H-0264/01):
Subject: Tax on financial transactions versus Article 56 Article 56 of the EC Treaty reads:
'1.
Within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited.
2.
Within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on payments between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited.'
The Commission replied (H-0024/01) that it was of the opinion that a tax of general application as originally conceived by Professor Tobin ('Tobin tax'), if introduced by a Member State, was likely to be contrary to Article 56, together with Articles 12, 39, 43, 49 and the corresponding articles of the EEA Agreement and that such a tax, if introduced at Community level, was also unlikely to be possible under Article 57(2) of the EC Treaty, since that article provided for restrictive measures only in a limited number of areas.
Is the Council of the opinion that a tax on financial transactions, a 'Tobin tax', is compatible with Article 56 of the EC Treaty?
Has any Member State proposed that the Treaty be amended to facilitate a 'Tobin tax'?
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax of the type once proposed by Professor Tobin.
The Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or other initiative in the matter for discussion by the Council.
As far as Mr SjÃ¶stedt' s second question is concerned, as far as we can recall no proposal was submitted to amend Article 56 of the Treaty at the last Intergovernmental Conference.
I have two supplementary questions for the Council of Ministers.
The first concerns whether the Council shares the Commission' s assessment that the EU Treaty makes a transaction tax of the Tobin model impossible, i.e. that a Tobin tax would be prohibited under Article 56 of the EU Treaty.
Does the Council of Ministers share this view?
My second question concerns the fact that many members of the Swedish government are said to take a positive view of a Tobin tax.
Does Sweden, as a Member State, have any plans to bring up this matter in the EU' s Council of Ministers or is the positive attitude to the tax one more of principle than of practice?
The Council cannot answer Mr SjÃ¶stedt' s first question because no discussion has been held in the Council concerning the assessment by the Commission to which he refers.
As Mr SjÃ¶stedt says, it is correct that representatives of the Swedish government have stated that a Tobin tax would be an agreeable idea - wording that has been used by a trade minister known to both of us.
Before it raises a matter each presidency country should make an assessment of whether it is possible to achieve the agreement required.
The presidency assesses that at present the conditions are not in place for achieving such agreement and therefore has no plans to take up the matter for discussion.
I would like to put a question to the Council that concerns the slight tendency towards a Tobin tax that Sweden introduced between 1986 and 1991, i.e. the turnover tax on share transactions.
What was the result of this type of transaction tax?
I am not sure that it is the task of the President-in-Office of the Council to attempt to make an assessment on behalf of the Council of a tax that the honourable Member calls an attempt at a Tobin tax.
Firstly I do not believe that it is compatible with my role to attempt to make an assessment. Secondly, I do not agree with the description of this tax as an attempt at a Tobin tax.
Question No 11 by (H-0265/01):
Subject: Denmark's JHA opt-out Title IV of the EC Treaty does not apply to Denmark. Nonetheless, a number of the texts adopted under Title IV do apply to Denmark by virtue of international agreements.
The Danish government has, for example, indicated its willingness to be associated with the EURODAC regulation, the bankruptcy regulation, the Brussels I and II Regulations and the Regulation on the notification of documentation in civil and commercial cases.
The Danish position is based on the assumption that it enjoys freedom of choice with decisions on whether to be involved or not being taken on a caseÂ­byÂ­case basis.
Can the Council confirm that Denmark enjoys freedom of choice about whether to be a party to decisions taken under Title IV of the EC Treaty with the result, for example, that certain parts of decisions taken in the area of asylum and immigration can - also in the future - be acceded to by Denmark, while Denmark at the same time retains special national arrangements in other areas of asylum and immigration policy?
The Council would remind you that when the Treaty of Amsterdam was entered into the parties to the Treaty drew up a protocol concerning the position of Denmark that was appended to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Under this protocol Denmark shall not participate in the Council' s decisions on proposed measures in accordance with Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Neither shall any provisions, measures, international agreements that have been entered into by the Community in accordance with Title IV or decisions by the courts that involve an interpretation of such a provision or measure or any such decision be binding on Denmark.
However, Articles 4 and 5 state exemptions from these general rules on terms laid down there.
Where measures for extending the Schengen rules are concerned, for example, Denmark shall decide whether it is to transpose these measures in its national legislation within six months of the Council having made a decision on these.
The question has been raised as to whether it is conceivable that the content of certain measures decided on by the Community within the context of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community may be made applicable in Denmark in any other way.
No such proposal has been put before the Council at present and the Council thus has not been requested to take a position on this matter.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his selective reading from the protocol on the position of Denmark.
I have an excellent knowledge of this protocol and do not need this summing up.
The question revolves around a very central issue.
The Danish debate is about Denmark' s being able, via intergovernmental agreements, to be associated with parts of what is known as the third pillar, in other words parts of this section of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and I can tell from what the President-in-Office of the Council said that no decision has been reached.
The Council has not entered into such an agreement so far, but I am aware - and the President-in-Office can presumably confirm this - that as far as, at any rate, one particular central issue is concerned, namely the EURODAC system, negotiations between the EU institutions and Denmark are under way.
Am I to understand the answer as saying that the Council is unaware of these negotiations?
I have little to add to my original answer.
It is not possible for the President-in-Office of the Council to assess the content of a national debate such as that to which the honourable Member refers.
I have tried to explain the legal reasons for the Council' s action.
I am sorry if the honourable Member regards this as an unfortunate reading of the Treaty, but it is, in actual fact, the only thing the President-in-Office of the Council can say in answer to such a question.
Question No 12 by (H-0271/01):
Subject: Payment of Austrian investigators When the Members of the Council were preparing to end the 'sanctions' against Austria, a special working party of three wise men was set up for this purpose.
When I asked in a written question to the Commission who was paying these people and how much, the Commission said I should ask the Council.
When I put a written question to the Council, I was told that the Council did not know.
How is it possible that the Council did not know?
Does the presidency of the Council know which body paid and how much the payment was?
Do the Member States of the Council have the use of some kind of secret account from which such funds can be paid without the knowledge of the whole Council?
Last year, when answering a question, number 3304, put by the same honourable Member, the Council already had the opportunity to inform him that it had not been involved in the activities of this working party and that no demands had been made upon the Community budget.
Austria' s 14 partners in the European Union used their national budgets to cover all the expenses incurred in financing the task of assessing the situation in Austria.
Mr President, Minister, the Council of the European Union certainly did handle matters relating to the Austrian boycott.
It is quite amazing that the country to hold the presidency of the Council, which was also a member of the Council when these matters were being handled, is unaware of what was paid to the people given the task of ending sanctions.
I would like to ask the representative from Sweden, the country to hold the presidency, who was on the team made up of representatives from fourteen countries engaged in this work: do you mean you really do not know what these people were paid?
If you, as a representative of the Council do not know, then perhaps you know as a representative of Sweden?
Once again, I have to answer that I am here in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council and, because the Council has not concerned itself with the issue, I am in no position to provide any information in response to those questions put by the honourable Member.
However, I should like to point out, as an aside in this Question Time, how much Sweden and all the other countries have contributed to this matter via their national budgets.
But, as I say, the Council has no role to play in this matter, and this is a Question Time with questions to the Council.
Question No 13 by (H-0273/01):
Subject: Fundamentalist hostility to women in Saudi Arabia The laws currently in force in Saudi Arabia discriminate against women.
For instance, women are stoned for committing adultery and condemned to death for apostasy.
More than 28 women having been executed since 1990.
In its contempt for women, the State discriminates against them. They are subjected to gender apartheid, arbitrarily detained and imprisoned, and watched by the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, also known as the al-Mutawa' een.
In view of this situation, when and how does the Council intend to draw the Saudi government into dialogue on human rights for women?
The Council agrees with the honourable Member that the situation regarding women' s human rights in Saudi Arabia is far from satisfactory.
The European Union is addressing issues of human rights, including the position of women, with Saudi Arabia and other Member States of the Gulf States Cooperation Council within the framework of meetings at all levels between the EU and the GCC.
When, in 2000, Saudi Arabia took over the presidency of the GCC, two such meetings were held at ministerial level: one in the common EU-GCC council and another in conjunction with the UN' s General Assembly in September.
Human rights were also discussed at the meeting between the European Union and the GCC' s regional heads in Brussels on 23 March.
The EU will continue to emphasise to GCC members the necessity of improving the human rights situation in their countries and will continue to cooperate with the UN and international human rights organisations.
The EU will also follow up the issue of a more vigorous dialogue on human rights.
The Council would nonetheless remind you that there are no agreements or any separate political dialogue between the European Union and Saudi Arabia.
The EU and the GCC are at present negotiating a free-trade agreement.
In accordance with the European Union' s policy of incorporating the issue of human rights into agreements with third countries, respect for human rights will constitute an essential component of such an agreement.
Mr President, I should to express my thanks to the President of the Council for the precision with which he answered my question.
I should like to ask the supplementary question of whether you consider that the violation of the human rights of women that the Saudi government systematically carries out deserves to be condemned.
The answer to the honourable Member' s question is, in principle, yes.
Allow me to quote from the speech made by the presidency on 29 March at the UN Commission for Human Rights.
The European Union took this opportunity to welcome the fact that Saudi Arabia had ratified the convention relating to discrimination against women but added that 'the EU continues to be deeply concerned about reports of torture and other inhuman treatments and punishment, the increasing use of the death penalty and amputations, discriminatory laws and prohibitions of, or restrictions on, fundamental freedoms including freedom of expression, assembly, association and religion' .
In this way, the European Union made its views on the situation in Saudi Arabia in this area crystal clear.
Mr President, conflicts connected with religion seem to be a significant cause of human rights violations in the world.
Does the Council consider it necessary that the EU should appoint a special human rights representative who would ensure that human rights can be reconciled with other EU policies?
The Council has not had the opportunity to discuss any special human rights function.
I would remind you of the observatory in Vienna which is one of the EU' s tools for making sure that human rights are respected.
In particular, those issues addressed by the honourable Member are to be monitored, especially the risk of increased religious intolerance such as we are seeing in many areas of the world.
I believe the Council' s view is that the optimum working method in this area is to support the international organisations that monitor issues such as these.
Such organisations mainly exist within the framework of the United Nations.
Question No 14 by (H-0278/01):
Subject: Human rights in the Netherlands Article 2(1) (right to life) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 1 (human dignity) and Article 2 (right to life) of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights solemnly declared in Nice on 18 December 2000, as well as the position taken by the European Union on Austria 2000 when it declared itself to be a Union of Values, are basic human rights documents and political positions taken for the defence of human dignity and life.
In the light of these documents and of the political activities of the European Union, has the Council followed, been informed about and studied the consequences of the proposed law in the Netherlands concerning medically-assisted suicides which will be determined in the Dutch Senate on 10 April 2001?
The Community' s responsibility in the area of public health is laid down in Article 152 of the Treaty.
Paragraph 5, in particular, of this Article states that, 'Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.'
The Council therefore lacks competence when it comes to what is known as medically-assisted suicides.
I want to thank Mr Danielsson for that answer.
I am not in any way surprised about this clear distinction, which in itself is perfectly correct, when it comes to the EU' s areas of competence.
I would nonetheless remind you that the new draft law in the Netherlands concerning medically assisted suicides is a source of serious concern in many countries.
History has shown the danger of such a development.
I would point out that this draft law in actual fact enables children of twelve years and over, with their parents' permission, to be present at medically assisted suicides and also enables children of sixteen years and over to decide for themselves, without their parents' permission, whether or not they wish to be present.
This is an issue to which we cannot close our eyes in a Europe in which the Austria debate has raised questions concerning human dignity.
I should nonetheless like to be told whether or not the issue of this law in the Netherlands in any way affects the debate on values within the European Union.
This is obviously an important issue that Mr SacrÃ©deus is addressing, and one affecting our values.
The Council' s way of dealing with these issues must nonetheless be based on the Treaty and, as we see it, the Treaty is unambiguous on this point, for this is an issue which the fathers of the Treaty have clearly identified as one to which the subsidiarity principle is to apply.
That is to say, it is a national issue.
Question No 15 by (H-0280/01):
Subject: Northern hake fishing - discrimination inherent in the division of TACs by sea area Northern hake is found from the coast of the Basque Country to the coasts of Norway and the fishing grounds are divided up into sea areas (ICES Division IIIa, Sub-Areas IV, VI and VII and Divisions VIIIa and b).
Why is it that the proposal of the Council for the management of Northern hake stocks and its final resolution have the effect of dividing the fishing rights for this species into sea areas when the hake population is considered by the ICES as one management unit for which the ICES Advisory Committee on Fishery Management provides unified scientific advice and does not recommend its being divided up by sea area?
Does this not discriminate against fleets according to their geographical distribution and habitual fishing areas?
Would it not be fairer for fishermen to catch fish in accordance with their respective fishing quotas in one unified zone?
The Council assumes that the honourable Member is referring to the Total Allowable Catch and quotas adopted by the Council in December 2000.
Against the background of the scientific opinion from the International Marine Research Council, recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to during 2001 and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question, the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake, or what is known as the Northern stock, at 22 623 tonnes - 'and four kilos' .
On the basis of Article 15 of the Council' s Regulation No 3760/92, the Commission is, at present, considering a series of measures to promote the recovery of the stock.
The Council would call attention to the fact that the Northern stock is a biological concept.
The Member States' catch allocations are divided up on the basis of the International Marine Research Council' s administrative divisions with a view to complying with the principle of relative stability laid down in the aforesaid Regulation and in the accession document of 1985.
According to this principle, only Denmark and Sweden may fish in the area comprising the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, and only Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in those areas comprising the North Sea.
Article 161 of the 1985 accession document establishes Spain' s share of hake from the northern stock in Divisions Vb, VI, VII and VIIIab, that is to say the western waters including the Bay of Biscay, at 30 per cent.
Spain has no rights in the divisions comprising the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea.
Article 349 of the accession document restricts Portugal' s access to the Southern stock of hake.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, right from the start, the scientific assessment of the northern hake stock has been carried out on the whole stock and there are not sufficient grounds at the moment to distinguish separate components within it.
As you have said, however, the total allowable catches and quotas for 2001, which were set by the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December last year, have introduced something new: there has been a greater percentage reduction in allowable catches in the Bay of Biscay than in all the other northern hake fishing areas.
I should like to ask you what reason there was to justify this discrimination against the Bay of Biscay.
All assessments of quotas are based on scientific and biological advice.
Data from research vessels is constantly being assembled.
Reports from professional fishermen also have an important role to play in assessments.
It is these factors which form the basis for the International Marine Research Council' s recommendations, which then constitute the biological advice given to our fisheries ministers.
It is therefore basic biological facts that form the basis of the proposed measures.
There is no intention to discriminate against any category of fisherman, but when a situation arises in which a stock is judged to be close to what is referred to as commercial collapse, account cannot be taken of fishing and the distribution of fisheries during a phase in which stocks are being built up again.
Question No 16 by (H-0286/01):
Subject: Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 on equal treatment in employment Pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which lays down the principle that discrimination on the grounds of disability must be avoided, the Council consulted the European Parliament in February 2000 on the proposal for a directive on this subject.
In Article 2 thereof, the Council and Parliament agreed on the definition of direct and indirect discrimination, but those definitions seem to have been forgotten when Open Competition COM/A/12/98, the results of which are covered by the new Directive, was held.
Out of the 645 candidates entered on the reserve lists, not a single one is disabled.
Some visually impaired candidates took part in the competition, but, given the mark scheme used by the Commission, whereby twice as many marks are awarded to the written tests and to the tests involving graphics than to the reasoning and oral tests, their marks were significantly lower than those of the normally-sighted candidates.
Does not the Council see in this instance a case of indirect discrimination against this group of candidates?
The Council would remind the honourable Member that Directive 2000/78/EC is addressed to the Member States and that the date by which the Member States are to have transposed the directive into national legislation has been set at 2 December 2003.
Moreover, the open competition to which the question relates was arranged by the Commission and did not involve the Council, which cannot therefore accept responsibility for it.
Mr President, the President-in-Office says that it is not the Council's responsibility but that of the Member States.
But what is the Council if it is not the Member States?
I am not certain that is really a satisfactory answer.
He also said that it does not come into operation until 2003.
That may be so, but if we are working towards equal treatment for people with disabilities, people who are visually impaired, surely we have to start to make progress now and we cannot have an arbitrary cut-on date as opposed to a cut-off date.
I accept that what we are referring to here is the Commission, but the Council also surely has some jurisdiction over what the Commission is doing.
The Commission must have some relationship with the Council, and I would hope for a more satisfactory response.
The formal response must be the one I have just given.
I agree, however, with the honourable Member that it is very important that the Council, the Commission and Parliament do their utmost to find a variety of ways of preventing people with disabilities being discriminated against in working life.
As recently as the European Council in Stockholm, a special paragraph was introduced into the conclusions at the presidency' s initiative, clarifying the need for the Member States and the Commission to do all they can to give people with disabilities the opportunity to participate fully in working life.
That is an urgent political request which is not legally binding, but it is a further sign that the Council takes seriously the issue of principle highlighted by the honourable Member.
Question No 17 by (H-0288/01):
Subject: Fisheries and the Swedish Presidency Now that the Swedish Presidency has passed its half-way mark, will the Council outline the ways in which it has promoted the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry, on-shore and off-shore, during its present term of office?
Allow me to remind you that I had the opportunity to report on the Swedish Presidency' s priorities where fisheries are concerned in my reply to the question put during the European Parliament' s January part-session.
The presidency also had the privilege of appearing before Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries on 6 February 2001, when we gave an exhaustive presentation of our priorities within the fisheries sector.
A question concerning what the presidency has done to promote the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry is, on the one hand, very general and wide-ranging, because it does not prioritise any particular measures or policy areas.
On the other hand, it is also of limited scope because the common fisheries policy ought to include farther reaching considerations than the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry here and now.
The Swedish Presidency' s overriding priority is, and remains, that of ensuring that the fisheries sector is accorded robust and sustainable development through re-establishing a balance between fleet capacity and fishing activity, on the one hand, and accessible fishing stocks on the other.
The Swedish ministers for agriculture and fisheries explained in detail in February how important it is to take a general view of the common fisheries policy, to have a more effective policy for the fishing fleet now that the current multiannual guidance programmes have ceased to apply, to devise a strategy for integrating environmental considerations into the common fisheries policy, to apply the precautionary principle and to have multiannual strategies for establishing Total Allowable Catches.
On 20 March, the Commission submitted its green paper on the future of the multiannual guidance programmes and, on 16 March, its communication about the integration of environmental protection requirements into the multiannual guidance programmes.
A programme of measures to promote biological diversity in the fishing industry was expected to be available from 28 March, that is to say last week.
At its meeting in December 2000, the Council also began its debate on the Commission' s communication concerning the application of the precautionary principle and multiannual agreements for establishing annual allowable catches.
It is the presidency' s intention to progress as far as possible with this work at the Council' s meetings on 25 April and 18 June 2001.
We also hope that we shall be able to present parts of an integration strategy in anticipation of the European Council in Gothenburg in June.
Following the Council meeting in December 2000, work has progressed on establishing recovery plans for cod and hake in Community waters.
The Commission' s regulations on cod in the North Sea already exist, and measures regarding hake are under consideration. Moreover, we shall soon be embarking on the second phase, in which improved technical measures will be established where these species are concerned.
The Council has adopted a regulation establishing measures to be applied during 2001 for the purpose of restoring cod stocks in the Irish Sea. It will also shortly be adopting a further amendment to the regulation concerning certain technical measures designed to conserve fish stocks.
The amendment will ensure greater selectivity in fishing, as well as the protection of young fish.
The Council has also recently adopted a mandate for the Commission to negotiate a cooperation agreement on fisheries with the Russian Federation.
Mr President, due to the time constraints imposed by you, which give my colleagues a chance of having their questions answered, can I very quickly thank the President-in-Office for his response.
Perhaps the timing was not right, maybe I should table this question again in June, so that he could outline even further what the Council should have done and account for its stewardship over a six-month period.
Of course, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Green Paper on the review of the common fisheries policy, which is all important, particularly to my own country.
You will realise that, President, having been an active member of the Committee on Fisheries in the past.
It is important to redress the imbalances of the past.
The quota and the TACs which the Irish, sharing their prolific fishing grounds with the larger countries, receive was a bad deal.
I hope, over the next few months, that we will have an opportunity to impress upon our colleagues in Parliament and ministers in the various Member States the importance to us.
Due to the time constraints, I will leave it at that and not ask the Minister to give me a response in view of Mr Fitzsimons' interest.
Question No 19 by (H-0294/01):
Subject: Human-induced climate change A UN Science working party adopted a report in Shanghai last January which concluded that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.
A second group, meeting in Geneva, concluded that current rates of human-induced climate change would have irreversible impacts such as melting ice sheets, increased river flooding in Europe and increased risk of flooding in coastal areas, and erosion.
The greatest impact would be felt by those least able to protect themselves from rising sea levels, an increase in disease, and a decrease in agricultural production in the developing countries in Asia and Africa.
What is the Council's response to these conclusions?
The Council is naturally fully aware of the appalling and deeply alarming consequences of climate change, as described in the Third Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to which the honourable Member also refers.
The European Union' s positions on this issue are well documented, especially through media monitoring of the climate change issue, and the Council scarcely needs to remind you that the European Community and its Member States have played, and continue to play, a very active role in the international negotiations on climate change.
Our most important and repeatedly expressed aims in the on-going negotiations include preparing the way for a rapid ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, so that it can come into effect by 2002 at the latest, and bringing about genuine reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Practical measures are being taken within the Community too.
Of special importance in this connection is the work being done within the Commission on, for example, the European Climate Change Programme and the work based on the green paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the European Union.
Mr President, I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply mentioned the Kyoto Protocol.
What is the Council's response to the statement by President Bush that the USA has decided not to implement the Kyoto Protocol?
What does the decision mean for the world community?
What steps can be taken to make sure that the Kyoto Protocol remains the firm basis for future negotiations and action to reduce emissions?
The President-in-Office of the European Council, the Swedish Prime Minister, joined with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, in writing a letter dated 22 March 2001 to the United States President, expressing great concern about the response from the American government regarding the Kyoto Protocol.
This was then followed up by a special declaration from the European Council in Stockholm, expressing the European Council' s same deep concern.
Moreover, the President-in-Office of the Council (Environment), the Swedish Minister for the Environment, together with the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, have visited Washington during the last few days in order to express the European Union' s concern directly to the American government and to discuss how the American government might be persuaded to resume discussions of the Kyoto Protocol.
I know that the Swedish Minister for the Environment is landing in Stockholm just about now.
I have not therefore had the opportunity of receiving an assessment of the results of the visit directly from the minister, but I can assure you that the Council will do everything to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol, which is, of course, one of the most important tools of all in our work for sustainable development in Europe, does in fact become a reality and is ratified.
That brings us to the end of Question Time to the Council.
Due to lack of time, Questions Nos 20-28 will answered in writing.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.17 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Air carrier liability in the event of accidents
The next item is the report (A5-0093/2001) by Mrs Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation [COM(2000) 340 - C5-0294/2000 - 2000/0145(COD)] amending Regulation No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents.
Mr President, the liability rules with regard to international air transport have hitherto mainly been based on the Warsaw Convention dating back to 1929.
These limits are now far too low.
The majority of international air carriers recognise this and signed a voluntary contract in 1995 in which they dissociate themselves from random liability limits.
This formed the inspiration for the original (EC) Regulation No 2027/97.
This regulation was used to step up the pressure on the international community to sign the Montreal Convention in 1999, as a result of which the new all-encompassing worldwide system for liability became an established fact.
Thanks to the Montreal Convention, which is being transposed into European legislation by the present regulation, a modernised and uniform framework is being set up. This is a considerable improvement on the current international system.
I would like to highlight six points this evening.
First of all, I back the Commission' s aim, in the framework of the development of a charter for air passengers, to protect passengers' rights and to inform them of these rights.
The present transport conditions in the aviation industry are restrictive and overlook the statutory rights of the passengers.
Competition in this sector is fierce, but success and profitable operations must be based on more and better, not worse, customer service.
Some airline companies have complained to me about the fact that information to passengers involves a great deal of red tape.
You will understand that I do not share their views.
The cost and effort involved in informing passengers are considerably less than the efforts which the airline companies make to inform potential customers of new services they are offering.
Secondly, the Member States have agreed that the Community itself is signatory to the Montreal Convention.
I consider this a considerable step towards plugging the gap in the Union' s common transport policy, since we are thus recognising the fact that there is joint authority in the field of international aviation matters.
Thirdly, there was some concern as to the implications of the case which IATA brought to the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom against the British government regarding the way in which it implemented Regulation No 2027/97.
The court concluded that the regulation remained valid, but that it contained a number of elements which were incompatible with the obligations which Member States had entered into on account of previous pledges, in accordance with international conventions.
In my opinion, this objection is no longer well-founded since the regulation has been amended and brought completely into line with the new international system of liability.
Fourthly, upon drafting this report and the eighteen amendments which I recommended to the committee, I sought legal advice from various lawyers and legal experts in order to preclude any doubt which may arise in future in the legal sphere.
At the same time, I very much tried to retain the right of passengers to information.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted the amendments by general vote.
These amendments can roughly be divided into three categories.
First of all, the improvement of the committee text; secondly a simplification of the proposal and the guarantee of complete consistency with the Montreal Convention and, thirdly, a reinforcement of the provisions with regard to information to passengers.
Our committee particularly recommends that Parliament should add an annex to the regulation, containing the text of the information notice as required pursuant to Article 6(2).
That is new.
In that way, airline companies will be able to offer this information in a uniform manner.
The text clearly outlines the provisions of the regulation and is devoid of any legal jargon.
Once this regulation enters into force - which I hope will be the case by the end of next year - coinciding with the expected entry into effect of the Montreal Convention - all airline companies in the European Union will then be required to make this information available to their passengers.
The text will then be drafted in an unambiguous and understandable language which is clear to the consumer.
Airline companies from non-EU countries will nonetheless be required to produce something similar covering the liability system which they operate.
Considering the matter once more, I believe that the Union has the right to ask all carriers which sell tickets in the EU to provide their passengers with information on their rights to damages, not only with a view to acquainting the passengers with their rights, but also to allowing passengers to take out additional insurance, should this appear necessary.
I have the following comment to make to the Commission with regard to Amendment No 9 to Article 3.
In the Commission proposal, reference is made to a number of articles from the Montreal Convention. However, various relevant articles were missing.
The lawyers in the court room will love this.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and I are in favour of simplifying the text, thus avoiding any risk of omission.
Furthermore, by ratifying the Montreal Convention, the Commission recognises the Union' s authority in this matter.
Finally, I would like to recommend all eighteen amendments.
I cannot recommend Amendments Nos 19 and 20, because they imply that third countries need not meet the obligation to inform passengers, even if they buy tickets in the European Union.
I would ask you please to be disciplined this evening.
If every speaker goes one minute over, Madam, then we shall have to work an extra 40 minutes and we shall be here until 1 a.m. rather than midnight.
Nonetheless, it was a most interesting speech.
Mr President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work put in by the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on what has turned out to be an extremely complex report, and for her patience and cooperation in taking on board a number of points which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market raised in its detailed consideration of the proposals brought forward tonight.
In my remarks I would like to commend the report to the House.
I believe that it will result in an increase in protection for air passengers.
However, speaking from a personal point of view, there are one or two issues which remain unresolved to my own satisfaction.
Hence my tabling, with my colleague, Mrs Foster, of two amendments which reflect the need for these problems to be resolved.
This basically centres around the dispute which Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has alluded to, which originated in my own country, the United Kingdom, as to the validity of the original regulation to which the new proposals relate.
Until this legal dispute is satisfactorily settled it is my belief that the report should be held in abeyance.
This position is complicated by two factors.
The first is the fact that the Montreal Convention, which governs matters globally, has not yet been ratified by sufficient countries to give it binding effect.
Nor is this likely to be the situation for some years to come.
Secondly, as referred to by the rapporteur, there is the issue of extra-territoriality.
Whilst, to a certain extent, a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation, there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed, in my opinion.
We must avoid any regulatory imposition on airlines which, while quite rightly protecting passengers' interests, actually achieves exactly the opposite by imposing rules which render European companies less competitive than the rest of the industry.
Unfortunately some clauses still contained in the regulation would result in just such a scenario.
I hope the House will accept the amendments as a benefit to passengers.
I commend the report to the House in its entirety.
Mr President, I too, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, fervently congratulate Mrs Sanders-ten Holte on her report, which has certainly adopted the spirit of the amendments we brought in.
Those amendments were directed to the improvement of Regulation 2027/97 and to the consumer rights which should be asserted.
I therefore particularly want to speak in support of Amendments Nos 1, 4, 8, 13 and 18, which have that effect.
The previous speaker, from my own country - we at least carry the same passport, though we have different views - referred to the situation in the UK.
It is true that IATA brought the UK government to court in terms of the possible extension of powers beyond what the legal position allows.
Judge Jowitt ruled that conflict did indeed exist between the Regulation and the Warsaw Convention.
But I would point out to my British colleague that he agreed with the UK government that Article 234 of the Treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid.
The Regulation was therefore held to be valid.
IATA lost their challenge and no other referral has been made to the European Court of Justice on this matter.
I therefore regard this as a legal red herring and I would prefer to concentrate on the merits of Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's proposals because they will give the consumer travelling by air rights which have been lost for a long time.
The Warsaw Convention is 70 years of age.
If you now find yourself stuck in an airport, with your baggage gone, your flight delayed, or perhaps cannibalised, you get this little piece of paper which tells you what your rights are under the Warsaw Convention.
Those rights are negligible.
What we are doing here is extending a body of practice which will allow us to protect consumers.
That is what we should be doing tonight.
Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work.
As shadow rapporteur, it is always a pleasure to engage in constructive dialogue with a rapporteur receptive to the proposals and points of view presented.
It is naturally important to take account of the interests of air passengers in this issue.
I therefore think that the final outcome of the report is entirely positive.
A not insignificant proportion of the amendments adopted by the Committee come from the PPE-DE Group, and these have strengthened the position of passengers.
We already have a regulation establishing the limits of air carriers' liability to pay damages in the event of death and bodily injury.
That was a very important step in view of the level of damages which was laid down by the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and which was definitely on the low side.
The aim of the present proposal is to adapt the EU rules to the new Montreal Convention which will hopefully come into force at the end of 2002.
When the revised Regulation comes into force, European air passengers will be given significantly better protection.
When they fly with foreign carriers, they may, however, still be confronted by the fact that such carriers have a limited liability to pay damages under the Warsaw Convention because the latter will continue to apply to those countries which have not ratified the Montreal Convention.
As a result, we are faced with the difficulty that always arises in connection with international conventions, in that we shall have two overlapping systems for a transitional period.
It is therefore of the greatest importance for our Member States to ratify the Montreal Convention as soon as is reasonably possible.
Mr President, I intervene to support the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.
We enjoyed a highly fruitful collaboration within our parliamentary committee.
The amendments presented to the House were approved unanimously and incorporated suggestions from other Groups, and right from the beginning I could see that when Mrs Sanders-ten Holte was faced with a Member arguing about legal uncertainties it was clear to her that we should press on and avoid delaying tactics, because above all we had to consider passengers' interests.
Parliament has pressed on without delays, and we are attempting to give shape to our part in the Montreal Convention, which generates a number of positive features for passengers and therefore deserves the support of the European Union.
We must highlight the greater number of participating countries and the new possibilities on offer, the increase in the compensation payable in the various situations considered in the Convention, the significant introduction of matters relating to baggage and delays and the provision of information for passengers.
We think that providing passengers with information is fundamental.
It is fundamental, and perhaps it is not covered in Mrs Sanders-ten Holte' s report in as much depth as we would like, because we would like companies to reply specifically and immediately to consumers' complaints, but it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction and it will have our support.
The recommendation it makes on the amendments will also gain our acceptance on all points, and in this way our collaboration will go right to the end.
We will support all the amendments Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has proposed and we will oppose Amendments Nos 19 and 20.
We therefore consider that this work is a parliamentary job well done which will result in benefits for the citizens.
If, one day, citizens are compensated by airlines for their delays, we will have gained a lot of credibility.
Mr President, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, first of all, congratulations on this revision of the regulation. In fact, I would also like to congratulate the Commission.
As I see it, this evening, we are discussing the rights of the passenger against the backdrop of a number of problems which are, in fact, related to the quality of services offered by airline companies.
I am thinking of aspects such as delays, loss, damage, etc., not to mention accidents.
We are debating the liability in this respect and the provision of information to the consumer.
I am emphatically supporting Mrs Sanders' liability proposals and also the proposals regarding consumer information.
However, we are unlikely to be able to address the quality of that information service in the same way.
The question is also that of whether the information service has a preventive effect, especially in the case of delays and such like.
We are now in a situation where we are covered by insurance in Europe.
You could therefore say: fly in Europe and you will be covered, but taking the high-speed link might still be a better option.
Mr President, Commissioner, various modes of transport cross many national borders.
This should not lead to the constant changing of requirements and conditions.
That is why it is desirable, for the benefit of those modes of transport, that international legislation be introduced.
Consequently, rules on the position of air passengers should ideally have a global character.
The Warsaw Convention, which is still applicable, has worldwide status, and its successor, the Montreal Convention, is also being given that status.
This means that the rapporteur' s approach appeals to me a great deal.
Her commitment to directly link EU legislation to the Montreal Convention appears to be the best solution by far.
In addition, the reinforcement and clarification of the rights of passengers are, in the light of current practice, certainly no unnecessary luxury.
In short, we too believe that Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has drafted an excellent report, for which I would like to extend my warm thanks and congratulations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Finnish racing drivers are known as the Flying Finns, which is quite a different thing from the Flying Dutchman, but we who all fly a lot can also speak about flying from our own experience.
Although every air passenger can take out private insurance, it is nevertheless only reasonable that a certain basic level of compensation should be guaranteed to all in the event of an accident.
The provisions of the Montreal Convention on the loss, damage or destruction of luggage and loss or damage resulting from delays are contained in EU rules.
This is a good thing.
Generally speaking, though, I do not believe in regulation that goes too far, as airlines must be given sufficient leeway here.
If all airlines were forced into the same situation it would make it awkward to cater for the needs of different client groups.
Legislation that is suitably broad in scope must be used to safeguard the business opportunities of both the cheap carriers and those airlines that offer a greater range of services.
This is to the benefit of both companies and consumers, as any extra requirements are reflected in the price of the ticket.
This basic truth is something the consumer organisations do not always bear in mind in all their enthusiasm.
The important question for airlines is that of a special declaration being made at the time of check-in. The declaration would entitle the passenger to a level of compensation that was above the normal limit.
It will be absolutely essential to avoid excessive bureaucracy in this.
In my opinion, the requirement by airlines for the declaration to be made prior to take-off is only reasonable.
The regulation lacks clarity inasmuch as the points in the Montreal Convention referred to in it are not, however, to be found in the regulation itself.
The basic premise should be intelligible legislation, and that is not quite the case at the moment.
However, the regulation is a leap forward in terms of its content, and there is reason to rejoice that the outdated Warsaw Convention is receding from view.
The most modern laws are not a guarantee of success in one day in the life of a busy passenger, however.
You understand what I mean, do you not? Breakfast in Rome, lunch in Paris, dinner in Helsinki, and luggage in Moscow.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Sanders-ten Holte for her excellent report, which highlights the importance of rapidly implementing the Montreal Convention and of informing passengers at length about the rights it gives them.
We in the Commission fully share the tenor of the report, since it supports our intention of providing air passengers with a high level of protection in the event of an accident, it aims to modernise the rules on liability for delays and damage to baggage, and especially it aims to provide users with better information about their rights, since the greatest problem is often that the users themselves do not know what their rights are.
I am delighted to tell you that at its meeting tomorrow the Transport Council should adopt a decision to ratify the Convention and for the Community to ratify the Convention at the same time as the Member States.
Furthermore, the Community must bring Community rules on airline liability into line with those of the Montreal Convention, which is the aim of this proposal.
With regard to the amendments that have been tabled, perhaps the most important are those concerned with the information to be given to passengers on the provisions about the airlines' liability.
In its proposal, the Commission requires the companies to provide passengers with detailed information.
The report intends to strengthen the wording of the rule to oblige Community carriers to make available an information leaflet, as given in the Annex that is proposed.
This would ensure that the airlines gave passengers the necessary information in a precise manner, something that experience shows does not always happen.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 13 and 18.
The other two amendments, numbers 19 and 20, would, if approved, have the result that carriers from third countries would be exempt from the obligation to inform their passengers on the rules relating to their liability, and we therefore cannot accept this discrimination and reject both amendments.
We also have a few doubts about Amendments Nos 9 and 10, since according to them the airlines' liabilities would be governed by the relevant provisions of the Montreal Convention without the corresponding articles being specified.
The Commission proposal, however, lays down that liability shall be governed by the provisions of seven articles of the Montreal Convention, which are explicitly numbered.
Ladies and gentlemen, changing this matter could lead to a hostile reaction by some Member States, and the subsequent debate would slow down the adoption of the regulation to the detriment of the passengers.
That is why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 and 10.
We cannot accept Amendment No 11 either, since the article cannot be deleted if the text still refers to specific articles of the Montreal Convention, in line, therefore, with the previous rejection.
The Commission can, however, accept all the other amendments, which strengthen or clarify the text.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, madam rapporteur, I have summarised the Commission' s position on this report.
I should like to thank Mrs Sander-ten Holte once again for her marvellous work and support for the swift introduction of the Montreal Convention into Community law, and she is quite right, since this new incorporation will mean passing on from the international system agreed 72 years ago - which in the end was trying to restrict the airlines' liability - to another, more modern system which is aiming to do just the opposite: to give a high level of cover to the protection of passengers' rights.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0096/2001) by Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation [COM(2000) 5 - C5-0402/2000 - 2000/0023 (COD)] concerning the granting of aid for the coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is well known that, despite successive reforms, Article 73 of the Treaties remains in force, which means that coordination between the various modes of transport is still a Community obligation.
It should not be otherwise, since if this were not the case what would probably happen, given the current trends that we face every day, is that the roads would fill to bursting point with lorries.
Such coordination between the various transport modes was taking place under a Regulation that had been in force for thirty years and was beginning to seize up.
This gave the Commission an excellent opportunity to put forward this proposal, which will replace the old regulation just in time.
This is its intention and we applaud it.
We believe, however, that the Commission has displayed a certain degree of prudence in its proposal.
It has moved ahead, but rather too tentatively.
What is more, everything indicates that most of the political groups in this House are of the same opinion, since this is revealed by the content and the large number of amendments - 116 - tabled and debated in this Parliament' s Committee on Transport, almost all of them with the same message: to use this opportunity to encourage the necessary and appropriate transfer of traffic onto more environmentally friendly modes of transport.
This is a desirable objective which, I believe, has to a great extent been achieved, in view of the results of the exhaustive voting that took place in the Committee.
Therefore, as the rapporteur, I must congratulate the Members who tabled those amendments, since the results achieved - which today are put before this House as a joint effort by everybody - are the outcome of a broad consensus.
I take this opportunity to draw the Commission' s attention to this fact when it accepts or rejects our amendments.
We would like there to be a reasonable degree of identification between Parliament and the Commission.
In our debates we bore in mind facts such as the following: a vital Kyoto commitment is to cut our polluting gas emissions by 8% by 2010, whereas, if there is no change in the relative shares of the various transport modes, it has been predicted that in the transport sector there will be a 40% increase in these emissions over this period.
It has also been calculated that moving goods by rail needs four times less energy than by road.
Something similar could be said for transport by inland waterway.
Trains can use a greater proportion of renewable energy.
If action is not taken in time, road traffic will double between now and 2010.
Does all this mean that we have to gradually give up using roads?
Not at all.
There may be some conflict of opposing interests between the different transport modes - that is to be expected - but the strikingly obvious consequence of all this is that coordination between the various transport modes is still essential.
This is precisely the aim of the proposal we are debating today, and through it the respective shares of each transport mode may tend to be redistributed in more rational proportions.
In view of this intermodal conflict it must be recognised that the Commission has acted in a reasonably balanced manner in its proposal.
For our part, without ever losing sight of that coveted balance, we have moved ahead but only ever opening the throttle in what I would call emergencies, that is, in those objectives that should not wait any longer.
For instance, accepting that in practice transhipment between land and maritime transport, and also coastal traffic, has a significant land component and therefore should not be ignored in this directive.
Emphasising real, sustained progress, and also research and development.
Enhancing combined transport, the de minimis concept for avoiding bureaucracy, and the contractual relationship for ensuring the transfer of traffic from one mode to another that is more beneficial.
To end with, what can be said about external costs?
It is a fact that there are highly competent consultants who have argued, for instance, that external costs, including traffic congestion, are shooting up to account for 10% of the gross domestic product of Europe, a figure which may be debatable but which is astounding all the same.
In view of this we believe that the Commission should tackle this problem now.
We urge the Commission to prepare a proposal taking into account the value of such external costs so that they can then be internalised, and then we will have taken a giant step forwards in this matter.
.
(NL) Mr President, I will take the floor on behalf of the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr Blokland.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has assessed the Commission proposal in terms of competitive aspects and competitive neutrality.
The point of departure is that a shift towards more sustainable transport should, first of all, occur by providing an honest account of the cost per mode of transport.
However, the external effects and specific infrastructural costs are not yet included in the price for the consumer.
That is why the Member States must be able to offer compensation to the competing modes of transport.
This opportunity, in the shape of compensation, is offered in the present proposal for a regulation.
In its recommendation, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made a strong case for honest competition.
For this purpose, it has asked for the definitions of specific infrastructural costs and external effects to be worded more accurately.
Additionally, the description of the term "common interest" deserves attention.
