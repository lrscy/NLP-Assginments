So we need broader thinking to develop the transatlantic partnership before 2004.
It is time to get away from the humdrum bulk-carrier idea; something rather more visionary, I suspect, would be required at this stage.
First, we should stake out the ground for a broader transatlantic partnership.
Why not make sure we can re-energise the transatlantic business dialogue?
It is in some difficulty.
Why not think of an annual Atlantic Summit, which would bring together the EU, the US and NATO, because politics, economics and security policy are increasingly interlinked.
Secondly, we should follow the ideas of the Houston Declaration of the US Congress and the European Parliament and involve the parliamentary community more in the summit process.
Last and not least, we should use the summit with George W. Bush to draw up an agenda for the period until 2004, to establish a deeper transatlantic partnership and to fulfil the aims that both the Council and the Commission have said they want to achieve.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ever since the end of the Second World War the transatlantic relationship has been of crucial importance.
It has proved essential for peace and stability in Europe and the wider world.
I understand President Bush will be attending the Gothenburg Summit. Together with my group I hope Mr Bush will be made aware that obviously, we believe our relationship should be one of equals.
Our dialogue must be frank and sincere. We need not be brutal, but we do have to make our concerns clear, as they have been outlined in both speeches.
In a world where globalisation in constantly increasing, it is worrying that the Bush Administration is glorying in unilateralism.
The first sign of this was the United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto Agreement on climate change. There have been other more recent moves such as the threat made by the United States to withdraw from the OECDs common actions regarding tax havens.
In our view, this type of policy runs counter to the quest for a stable and secure international order.
Secondly, I also believe that we must convey our disquiet at the level of unilateralism currently demonstrated with regard to certain issues which concern us both. These include the peace process in the Middle East, and also the way in which America has put the brakes on the process of detente between North and South Korea.
I would like to comment on the missile defence shield plan, a product of the Star Wars programme.
This is extremely worrying as it could affect our security.
I think that we must tell our American colleagues quite clearly that the way to increase global security is to combat poverty and combat instability in poor countries. We must not build new barriers between the rich and the poor.
The creation of a missile defence shield will only lead to an increase in the number of missiles. This would go against all the efforts made since the ABM Treaty to reduce the number of missiles in the world.
There is also another issue we feel we should discuss with our United States' allies. We believe we should act together in relation to the UN, not adopt unilateral measures.
In the specific case of the Human Rights Commission, we should start from the premise that all countries stand for election.
Sometimes one is chosen, sometimes another. There is no scope for the introduction of retaliatory measures such as the suspension of a debt which has already expired and been unilaterally reduced.
Lastly, I would like to say that a fortnight ago I had the opportunity of leading a visit by my group to Congress in Washington. We feel we need to make direct contact, regardless of what we are told.
It was a very positive visit; we were able to address the House of Representatives' Sub-Committee on European Affairs.
The dialogue was as it should be: frank, direct and sometimes tough. Nonetheless, we believe that this should become part of our future.
I would therefore like to conclude saying that my group regrets that at the eleventh hour the authorities in the United States have been unable to confirm a meeting that is important both for establishing and for maintaining mutual trust. This affects you, Mr President, as rapporteur for the Echelon Committee.
Mr President, I listened with great interest to the long and sustained shipping metaphor of the Commissioner, who can now lay claim to be a master mariner of sorts.
Whether it is his bulk carrier or the speedboat version that is commended by Mr Elles, I certainly think that the Commissioner's focus on deepening the relationship and on being more strategic - even if there is argument on detail - is, in broad terms very welcome.
My group subscribes to the broad detail of the resolution, so I will not rehearse the issues.
I agree with the observations of colleagues about fears of a drift in certain cases towards unilateralism, some of the points about bilateral versus multilateral trade and issues about Kyoto, the Echelon Committee, the death penalty, and so on.
I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be.
We have developed both informally and formally a considerable dialogue with aspects of the legislative process in the US, but as a parliamentary process it remains sub-optimal.
We need to do a lot more work on that.
Our unique contribution as parliamentarians to the quality of this dialogue will be in establishing a better quality of relationship, in particular with our counterparts in the US Congress.
It seems to me that our mission in this regard is, both in Washington DC and in Strasbourg and Brussels, to create the playing field in which the Lamys and Zellecks - or others, depending on whether we are dealing with security and defence, or whatever - can actually play.
Because it is clear, certainly in the case of Congress, that they are a major influence on the role of the US executive, and we here are a growing influence on the executive, although we still regret the pillar system that marginalises us in areas of foreign policy or in fighting crime, and so on.
But there is a role here, and we need to do more work on that as a unique parliamentary contribution to the playing field in which executives can deliver the goods.
In that sense, I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that.
The second point I would like to mention concerns globalisation: we have noted the sclerotic effect of either Congress or ourselves legislating first and discovering that the ends do not match.
We need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation, but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is.
Is it soft law or hard law?
Self-regulation or co-regulation?
We need now to look for some degree of legislative creativity, so that there is no sclerotic dysfunction: wanting to do the right thing, but by chance arriving at another dispute.
Finally, we should put disputes in perspective, as the Commissioner has sought to do.
Even bananas, Boeing, beef, etc. represent no more than 2% of the flow of transatlantic trade.
Of course, they have a high priority, but they are not the whole story and we must focus on the whole story.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, transatlantic relations seem to have drifted into quite a difficult situation.
In my opinion, we could even speak of a sort of crisis.
I welcomed Mrs Lindh' s suggestion that we can also express criticism when there is cause to do so.
We can undoubtedly learn from the United States some other time, when there is occasion to do so, so this is not a question of anti-Americanism, but one of factual discussion.
It would seem to me that what unites the European Union and the United States above all is the fact that together we are responsible, to a considerable extent, for global development, as together we make up the world' s largest trading blocs.
I believe that in future, transatlantic relations should ensure that solutions to problems that are caused by the social inequality in the world are evolved and that together we seek the right tools to promote sustainable development.
In this regard the Council and the Commission are also to be praised for the fact that during the Stockholm Summit Prime Minister Persson and President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, sent a letter to the President of the United States that emphasised the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and stated in particular that its policy on climate is an essential ingredient in our understanding of transatlantic relations, and no minor issue.
This is my free interpretation of the matter at least.
The Commissioner' s excellent comparison with a super-tanker is something I would like to take up on more or less the same lines.
I might imagine that this tanker of ours ought to have the world' s best environmentally friendly technology, and, as Mr Cox said, it should at least have a double bottom, its engine should be very powerful and its fuel as clean as possible - preferably solar energy, if possible, Commissioner.
I would also like to say that if the United States wishes to become the world' s last open-air museum of old technology - and I stress the word 'old' - as it is refusing to start developing climate-friendly solutions, something we cannot do anything about, the European Union must, despite that, become the world' s leading region in this regard, and we can nevertheless invite the United States to join us in implementing this climate policy, which is one that also makes for good business.
I would finally like to say a few words about security policy.
My group is very concerned that in the United States there is an intention to use global resources for a missile defence system.
We think that is likely to increase the threat to peace worldwide and that the European Union should have no part in it. Instead, try and convince the USA that security in the world is to be furthered by means of solutions based on the worldwide promotion of socially and ecologically sustainable development.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we seem to have reached a turning point in transatlantic relations.
First there is the legacy of the Clinton era.
Even if we leave aside the serious trade differences, the emblematic banana dispute, the beef hormone dispute, the GMO dispute and a dozen others that are being or have already been examined by the WTO, we can see that in recent years, Washington had already shown growing signs of unilateralism, one of the stigmata of the superpower complex.
Opposition to the Treaty banning anti-personnel mines, opposition to the Charter on the Rights of the Child, opposition to the establishment of an International Criminal Court that might, one day, have to judge an American citizen, a casual approach to politics and financial blackmail of the United Nations, an economic blockade, in fact a military operation that violates international law, the Echelon affair, the Colombia plan - the list is endless.
Moreover, we have hardly had a chance to hold a dialogue with our transatlantic interlocutors about certain decisions that Europeans regard as shocking in a civilised society, such as the death penalty and the refusal to grant universal access to medicines to combat AIDS.
Yet we have to admit that the Bush Administration' s first decisions have a more serious impact than anything we have ever seen so far.
We were concerned enough when we heard the new President' s advisor on security, Mrs Condoleezza Rice, describe her vision of the new distribution of labour between Americans and Europeans for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, when she pointed out with as much perspicacity as elegance that it was not the GIs' job to take children to nursery school.
Frankly, we can only describe the refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol and the promotion of the missile defence shield as irresponsible, not only towards Europe but towards mankind as a whole.
In view of this escalation, are we condemned to pro forma protests before settling for realism?
I think not.
A Europe that is open to dialogue but adheres firmly to the principles of a civilised and responsible international community will find allies among the public opinion of the five continents and even in the US Congress and among a number of states.
Commissioner, of course we are not trying to promote a sense of anti-Americanism or indulge in aggressive rhetoric towards a partner who is indispensable in today's world. We simply want to set out the clear political resolve of the Fifteen and their united front towards objectives that could meet the expectations not only of Europeans but of all those, in whatever part of the world, who wish to free themselves from the unipolar system in which they are increasingly being confined.
We must approach the issue of transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States in the context of the U.S. administration having redefined its strategy.
This is to be expected, since elections there have put a new president and a new administration into office and our obligation is to closely observe the signs reaching us from across the Atlantic.
The basic feature that, I think, distinguishes the present administration from the previous one, in terms of foreign policy, centres on a return to the priority of consolidating and developing systems of alliances with those countries that show a desire to act in harmony with the Americans. This replaces the previous model, which consisted of acting on the basis of a multilateral approach sustained through a process of ongoing negotiations, intended to establish and define multilateral and universal rules, standards and values, taking the lead, of course, from the American institutions.
This is not the right time to analyse the practical military, diplomatic and economic consequences that this return to more traditional geopolitical concepts by the United States may involve.
We should, however, bear in mind that the concept of democratic administration led to a proactive type of action, one consequence of which was the U.S. administration taking greater responsibility for and greater involvement in the details of almost daily crisis management in some part of the world.
This is a concept which we feel is being abandoned. Now that this interventionist approach is being reviewed, we are beginning to agree with the Commission and the strategic direction of its document "New impulse for EU-US Relations" .
What the European Union must now do is take advantage of the arrival in office of a new US administration to review the way in which transatlantic relations are conducted and to set strict priorities to ensure that the new transatlantic agenda is more productive and constructive in terms of achieving practical results.
Just like the Commission, we also feel that the Union' s leaders must reach agreement on a limited number of strategic themes.
They must also ensure a high level of political engagement, in order to prevent the relationship' s processes becoming too bureaucratic and cumbersome.
It is amazing how often holding frequent meetings and summits with heavily laden agendas has achieved nothing but the dilution of interests and a lack of vision and clear objectives.
Let us commit ourselves, then, to a renewed transatlantic cooperation, in which the European Union and the United States are able to work effectively, together and to their mutual benefit, on the various global challenges that we inevitably have to face.
Mr President, dark clouds are gathering over the Atlantic and they are storm clouds.
I am not thinking only of the spiral of violence that American society feeds on and of which the string of capital punishments is only one symptom among others.
In fact this society, which is based on genocide and whose values constantly give way to the law of the jungle that has been christened 'liberalism' , can only survive by violence; that, in the end, is something that does not concern us.
What does concern us, however, is the custom of American policy to do what it wants where it wants in the world and to disregard all the international rules, including those it imposes on others.
I am thinking here of the Kyoto agreements.
Nor should we forget Washington's refusal to sign the agreement on nuclear testing, which the United States regards as applying to all states except itself, and a whole range of other agreements that show that Washington wants to tie down every state in the world without being bound in any way itself.
Let us also remember the scandalous Echelon affair, which shows that Big Brother intends to keep watch over the entire planet while not accepting any right of inspection itself, as proved also by the insolent and scandalous reception recently given to our committee of inquiry into the network that brought his imperial highness to power.
Worst of all, we are behaving like a rabbit fascinated by the boa constrictor or snake about to bite it and we are obeying this imperial policy; my last hope is that France will resist this general tendency of the world to grovel.
Mr President, I think that today we are making history, and that the European Union and the United States are the two leading characters in the play unfolding before our eyes.
There is much more to unite us than to divide us.
Clearly, however, our opinions do differ in a number of areas.
Both the Commission and the Council recognise this. The purpose of the Transatlantic Dialogue is precisely to provide an opportunity to tackle these.
We must discuss the Kyoto Protocol, and also the missile shield, which will affect our finances as well as our security.
We ought to talk about the death penalty, and consider the issue of drugs too.
In tackling this problem we must assume shared responsibility and comply with international law.
We must also consider the subject of globalisation, as the Commissioner has mentioned. I think it is incumbent upon the United States and Europe to ensure that the outcome of these discussions proves positive rather than negative.
We should also stress the importance of developing trade.
We must welcome the initiative taken by the US at the Quebec Summit with a view to creating a free trade area for the Americas. We should be delighted that they reached the conclusion that this trade initiative should have a democratic basis.
We have enshrined this in our cooperation agreements with third countries. As was made clear yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Mr Patten' s presence, these agreements include a democratic clause and have already been in existence for ten years.
Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to pose one single question, and that is whether the Bush Administration is going to continue the Clinton Administration' s practice of exempting European companies from the application of Article III of the Helms-Burton law. I should like to know if this matter is to be discussed at the Transatlantic Summit.
The Bonn Declaration was most welcome in that it committed the European Union and the United States of America to a full and equal partnership, and of course the EU and the US are both partners and competitors, particularly in trade matters.
It is important to stress the scale of the economic relationship currently worth USD 2 billion a day, but where there is competition there will inevitably be some areas of conflict and friction, and part of the nature of the relationship is to try and contain that friction.
I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disputes.
It says that we should consult before legislating, negotiate before litigating, compensate before retaliating and comply at any rate.
That might be a lofty target but one worth aiming for.
I want to comment too on Commissioner Patten's very welcome statement that he did not see any connection between being European and anti-Americanism.
He is absolutely right.
To be European is also to encompass a generous inclusivity about people's notions very different from our own.
There are of course important outstanding trade disputes, the foreign sales tax one in particular, and it was worrying, to say the least, that President Clinton's last speech before he left office contained some barely veiled threats about the future of the Airbus deal and a possible dispute.
Finally I want to commend the part of the resolution that welcomes the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue on which this Parliament has set such great store, and I very much hope we want that to continue and be strengthened as part of a constructive and good-tempered dialogue.
Mr President, the starting point for this debate was the US rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.
So I welcome the strong language in our compromise resolution on this.
But we need more than words.
We want the Commission to look at possible EU actions in response to a continued US refusal to respond to climate change, including action at the WTO, on the grounds that by not internalising its external energy costs, US goods are receiving an unfair government subsidy, which is against the rules of world trade.
But it is not just Kyoto.
Let us look as well at this intent to tear up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
This "Son of Star Wars" system threatens a massive new arms race.
Asking the US to consult before proceeding is not enough.
We need to state very clearly that the EU calls on the US to give up this initiative and pledges itself and its Member States not to take part in this project on any level.
If the US spent just a fraction of the resources it currently spends on missile defence on defending itself against climate change instead, the world would be a much safer place.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the American trade representative Bob Zoelleck made this House an unequivocal but positive offer in the competent committees via the Kangaroo Group, namely that we jointly devise an open trade policy for increasing prosperity throughout the world, including in developing countries.
I think that we should take up this offer and start looking at trade policy as a way of broadening transatlantic relations as a whole.
We all know that NATO will still need to play a major role in the collective defence of Europe for a long time to come.
We seem, understandably, to have lost all awareness of common security since 1990, which is why we need to ensure that relations between the United States of America and Europe are strengthened in every other political field.
We should take up this offer by the US Administration.
In doing so, we should also further the opportunity for relations between our House and the American Congress, provided that we can make our contribution here.
You only need look at the difficulties we have experienced with data protection over recent years, because we have no jointly agreed legislation for global economic areas, to see just how far the transatlantic legislators' dialogue needs to go.
I should like, if I may, to address one last point: the United States are now the only superpower in the world and they approach foreign policy problems as such.
Their relations with Russia are predicated on this global position, while Europe defines its position from a regional standpoint and sees it in the context of the enlargement process.
But that should not mean that we pass up the opportunity to pursue a joint strategic approach in this region.
I have a feeling that we have not pursued a joint policy in connection with Ukraine over recent weeks.
Now that the westward looking government has been ousted and Chernomyrdin has taken over as governor with the title ambassador to Kiev, it is obvious that we have made strategic blunders which we must not underestimate and which - to my chagrin - we have not discussed even once in the General Council this week.
Madam President, in addition to what the leader of our group, BarÃ³n Crespo, said, I should like to make some observations in the context of the equal transatlantic dialogue on matters of international security.
Firstly, our Socialist group is concerned about, and opposed to, the unilateral plans of President Bush to invest trillions in the high-tech weapons industry via a missile defence system, hence both jeopardising the ABM Treaty and possibly provoking a new arms race.
It is of fundamental importance that we should oppose the arms race.
We want multilateral cooperation and agreements, and support for a reformed UN.
We want Europe and America to work together to that end.
Unilateral action by either Europe or the US is an anachronism in an age when we are jointly responsible in our global village.
It is precisely that joint responsibility which will lead us in Europe to share and take responsibility within NATO, via the rapid intervention force, via the payment of some 80% of the costs of reconstruction in the Balkans.
Conversely we therefore ask the US to cooperate in conflict prevention and development aid, and to pay its contributions to the UN, because as Social-Democrats we see that some 100 conflicts in our global village are being caused by poverty, underdevelopment and ethnicity.
The best security shield is the battle against poverty.
That battle is the best guarantee of security against fundamentalist terror of an ethnic or religious nature, warlords and rogue states.
We need a new, wide-ranging attitude to security and we hope that at the forthcoming meeting in Gothenburg, the Commission and the Council will make that attitude a central item on the agenda, in the open, frank, free and confident dialogue with President Bush.
That is the route we should like to take.
Mr President, the EU-US partnership is of crucial importance.
We are each other' s largest trading partners and by cooperating the EU and the US can play a decisive role in tackling international trade issues.
Now that Europe is on its way towards greater unanimity in the foreign and security field too, the necessity of working together will grow even greater.
In fields like environmental protection and limiting CO2 emissions cooperation will be decisive.
In the Dutch press, there was an appeal to President Bush in letter form from what the author himself called "the profitable part of American industry" asking the president not to listen only to inefficient companies when environmental decisions were involved.
Robust environmental legislation makes companies more innovative, more technology-oriented and more efficient.
At yesterday' s Kangaroo Group lunch, Mr Zoellic said that in his view and that of his government not every problem in the private sector needs to be solved by the government.
If I combine both things, it may be possible to reach new agreements with the US.
Whether an agreement is called Kyoto or New York is a matter of supreme indifference to us.
But we must get down to work together.
My final point concerns parliamentary relations.
For some years, we have been enjoying better relations.
The Legislators Dialogue has gained momentum and has begun to bear fruit.
However, since a new Congress has taken office with all the changes in personnel that that involves, it seems difficult to make real contacts.
The collective memory on the US side appears to have been erased.
We are starting completely from scratch.
That is all the more regrettable since our trade disputes could have been effectively prevented by the "early warning" system within the TABD and the Legislators Dialogue.
It is still too early to express real concern.
See my observation as part of a European "early warning" system.
A light is on, but it is not yet red.
But what will happen in a world where the word of a superpower is no longer worth the paper it is written on?
Mr President, I will focus on the single area of environmental issues.
There is cause for concern over the EU-US partnership in this particular area.
I appreciate the clarity with which the Swedish Presidency addressed these issues in the introduction.
Experts are increasingly unanimous on the problems of global warming and its consequences.
In addition, it is clearly the responsibility of the richer countries to reach an international agreement by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
The US has particular responsibility, as the country has by far the largest emissions.
The question is how we react.
Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position?
No, of course not. However, we should continue adopting a clear and frank stance in our dialogue with the US on these issues.
The fact that the US has not undertaken ratification must not prevent us in the EU from making progress.
We have to take the lead in the world with regard to ratification and continue the dialogue with the US in order to bring the country on board in the future.
That must be our position.
The Summit in Gothenburg is an excellent opportunity to bring up the issues - in addition to the visit by President Bush, the Gothenburg Summit also has sustainable development as its main theme.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the transatlantic dialogue must be extended to encompass global transport policy because both the USA and we Europeans bear a special responsibility for greater safety in the air and at sea, better environmental protection and fair competition and fair trade practices.
Our primary objective must be to adopt reasonable harmonised provisions in order to develop a transatlantic transport market - be it in air or sea transport - and to work towards global regulations based on harmonised regulations between the USA and Europe, for example in the area of air traffic noise.
We do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes; on the contrary, we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance, jointly and proactively.
This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration. We must try, as part of the transatlantic parliamentary dialogue, to organise specialist debates between transport experts in the American congress and the European Parliament so as to avoid political pressure between the administrations or, as the result of pressure from lobbyists, by the administrations.
We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety.
This will greatly benefit our people, avoid conflicts between the USA and Europe and could form the basis for an overall joint solution.
Mr President, I think that our debate on the transatlantic dialogue has come at a very good moment.
I need not remind Members how crucial this dialogue is with a view to achieving cooperation between equal partners, between the United States of America and the European Union.
The dialogue allows us to deal with our differences and to settle some of our old trade disputes; here I am thinking in particular of bananas, an issue we finally resolved a few weeks ago.
I want to emphasise the importance of the question of European defence, an issue I regard as extremely important, in particular now that we are dealing with a new American Administration that has already openly advertised its defence projects.
It is quite clear that President Bush's Administration is far more distrustful of the ESDP than President Clinton's was, but that does not surprise me. It took the Union several years to explain its objectives, define its means and convince its American ally that a European defence system could be developed alongside NATO.
Today we must at all costs protect this achievement of the transatlantic dialogue.
The concept of an ally must not be a one-way road.
I believe that the Union has shown itself to be entirely transparent in the way it has presented the CESP, followed by the ESDP, to the United States and I think it should make it just as clear that the United States must consult its allies on all major projects, of which the anti-missile shield project is one.
Regarding European defence policy as such, we must continue to state firmly what we want, as we always have done, and not systematically look at every European defence question in terms of NATO's reaction.
The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action, especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks.
The issue here is neither competition nor disengagement, but simply a united approach.
Mr President, I will be extremely brief as I am aware that Parliament has other business to attend to.
I agree with Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that the EU and the US have a joint global responsibility to combat poverty, reduce tensions and promote disarmament.
Discussions on US missile defence should continue.
The Gothenburg Summit will be an ideal occasion to demonstrate the points on which we agree, e.g. regarding the Balkans and the Middle East, and those on which there is no agreement, be it unilateral action within the UN, contributions to the UN, the Kyoto Protocol or environmental issues.
However, if we are to influence the US on those areas in which there is no agreement, making contact with the new administration is not enough. Instead, we also need contact with the US congress.
I wish Parliament success in this area.
I should like to inform you that I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 37 paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
VOTE
There are two amendments that we are concerned about regarding port state control.
We can partly accept both Amendments Nos 1 and 2 with the qualifications which were set out in the plenary session.
Mr Watts has requested the floor.
Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for indicating the support of the Commission, in principle, for both amendments being tabled in plenary today.
But I seek clarification on Amendment No 1.
Whilst in principle the Commission is saying it supports our demand for "black box" voyage data recorders to be fitted to all ships, can it confirm that relates not just to new ships, but also to existing and old ships?
It is an important clarification.
I would appreciate a statement from the Commissioner on that particular point.
I am not in a position to go further than the Commissioner responsible herself but I can make it clear that we accept in principle the objectives of the amendment.
We intend to follow this line during the conciliation procedure with the Council, taking into account the fact that both the proposals to which the honourable Gentleman referred are part of a unique package but we will certainly follow this line during the conciliation procedure.
(The President declared the amended common position approved)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0144/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations
[5178/1/2001 - C5-0075/2001 - 2000/0066(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Ortuondo Larrea)
In brief, we accept Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6.
We partly accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7, but I am afraid we cannot accept Amendment No 1.
(The President declared the amended common position approved)
Report (A5-0151/2001) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to and from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States as regards a uniform driver attestation
[COM(2000) 751 - C5-0638/2000 - 2000/0297(COD)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Voting time will be suspended now and resumed after the formal sitting.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)
The next item is the vote on the Conference of Presidents' proposals on the European Parliament's calendar of plenary part-sessions in 2002.
Madam President, I appreciate the tactics, but would it not be more democratic if you waited until everybody came in, sat down and took part in this vote?
It is the last one on our schedule today and it is not a coincidence that it has been taken out of turn.
No, Mrs Doyle, it is not the last vote this morning.
And I am indeed sorry that Members did not all feel it necessary to listen to Mr Schuster's excellent speech.
But that does not matter now and they are welcome to join us again.
Before the vote on block 1 by Mr Posselt and others:
Madam President, this vote is extremely important because, now that we have done away with Fridays, mini part-sessions are illegal.
If we do not need Fridays, then we do not need extra part-sessions, which is why we really must hold these votes separately and reject each mini part-session separately.
Before the vote on block 2 by the Technical Group of Independent Members:
Madam President, whenever amendments are tabled, the name of the author is given.
With regard to the Technical Group of Independent Members, I would like to make it quite clear to the House that these two blocks of amendments were tabled by the seven radical members of the group.
Thank you for that clarification.
After the vote:
Madam President, since it has now been established for two years in succession that a majority of Parliament does not want Friday to be included on the calendar of part-sessions for Strasbourg, I would ask you next year to submit a calendar on which Fridays are not included.
I think that that would be consistent with the democracy we practise in this Chamber.
Thank you, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt.
The Conference of Presidents will act as it sees fit.
I now have to join the President of Slovakia.
The voting, however, will continue.
Mr President, I have tabled a proposed oral amendment to Amendment No 9 by Mrs Figueiredo.
This proposed oral amendment, which has been agreed with the author of the original proposed amendment, Mrs Figueiredo, replaces Amendment No 9 in your documentation.
The oral amendment reads as follows: "The question of whether Community fishermen from all Member States will enjoy fishing opportunities in waters under the jurisdiction of Greenland in future should be clarified when interim controls of the agreement are being prepared" , and I should like to ask you to accept it.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0341/2001) on the report on the future objectives of education and training systems
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0128/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2001 so as to extend duty-free access without any quantitative restrictions to products originating in the least-developed countries
[COM(2000) 561 - C5-0136/2001 - 2000/0239(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Food security (C5Â­007/2001)
. (FR) The only reason we voted for this proposal for a regulation was because if we had voted against it that might have suggested agreement with those who are opposed even to this minimum aid to poor countries.
Having said that, these proposals are inadequate, cynical and hypocritical.
For anyone to pretend, for example, that this aid can 'contribute to world food security' and 'respond to emergency food situations and other food needs' when several hundred of millions of people in the world find themselves in emergency situations, if not in extreme distress, mainly because the European powers represented here in Parliament plundered them in the past, is a cheap attempt to salve their conscience.
Ludford recommendation (B5Â­340/2001)
Although this proposal is merely a statement of position and does not set out the means of imposing its recommendations, we voted for it because racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are some of the worst forms of barbarism still alive in society today.
Our vote is also the expression of our solidarity with all those who are fighting this scourge, as also with its victims, in particular on the territory of the European Union, which has the sad privilege of having produced its most despicable forms and is still affected by it today.
Area of freedom, security and justice (B5-339/2001)
The proposal for a recommendation on the position of the European Union at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance contains a number of positive points.
But there is, indeed, 'no room for complacency' in Europe.
In fact, 50 years after the Holocaust, certain member countries played an active part in the genocide in Rwanda and many European minorities, such as gypsies, are still being persecuted today.
The centuries of slavery and colonisation weigh heavy in the history of the member countries.
However, many countries continue to be pressurised and remain dependent and immigration policies give cause for concern.
We have expressed our views on this before.
The criminalisation of immigrants is a real scandal against people who are fleeing from political or economic oppression.
If we are actively to combat racism and xenophobia, we must respect the right of asylum, formulate a policy for regularising the status of all those without the necessary papers in Europe and grant nationals of third countries the right to vote and stand at all elections.
Those are a few of the measures with which we can fight racism and xenophobia effectively.
If it wants to satisfy the citizens' needs, the European Union must finally decide to cancel the debt and impose the Tobin tax.
The World Conference against Racism, Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and Intolerance can and must be seen as a unique opportunity to undertake an in-depth examination of these disturbing phenomena and to adopt measures that could put an end to them.
It is nevertheless crucial that we do not conceal the fact that many of the intolerant attitudes seen in our societies are caused by feelings of insecurity resulting from situations created by the collective redundancies of thousands of workers, by the increasing lack of job security and by the loss of rights.
Nevertheless, given the reduction in funds that the European Union and the Member States give to the LDCs and the general lack of support for their development, we might easily conclude that the only chance of survival for many men and women from these countries is to emigrate to the 'rich' countries.
Furthermore, given that barriers to the movement of immigrant workers in the European Union are being continually erected, and this is a situation that could now be changed to some extent in order to attract the technical specialists that we are lacking, and that problems are systematically created for the family reunification of these citizens, it is hard to believe that we are contributing to their integration.
We shall be voting in favour of this resolution, but we feel that, in addition to declaring politically correct intentions, we must take action.
This is why the European Union must set an example.
I abstained on the vote because no mention or condemnation was made of the recent attempt of the French Parliament to brand and outlaw certain Bible Protestants in France as sectarian.
The intolerance of the State and the courts of France against these Protestants should have been mentioned and condemned.
The EU Parliament too often closes its eyes to the persecution of such Protestants within its bounds.
In the resolution it has just adopted on questions relating to the police, justice and the free movement of persons, the European Parliament is once again calling for the complete 'communitarisation' of immigration policy and all related policies, such as asylum and temporary protection.
Meanwhile we must once again repeat the point that although European coordination is obviously essential, the people of each country must have the sovereign power to make the final decision determining who may remain on its territory.
The Treaty of Amsterdam had already transferred these matters to a Community framework by taking them away from the national parliaments, but with two vital derogations from the usual procedures: the Commission must share its power of initiative to propose texts with the Member States during a transitional period fixed at not more than five years after the entry into force of Amsterdam (i.e. until 1 May 2004); the Council will take its decisions not by a qualified majority but unanimously for at least five years, which means that for the time being each country retains its sovereign decision-making power.
These are the two derogations to which the European Parliament's resolution for which we voted today is most strongly opposed: it disputes that the Member States have any right to propose texts, on the pretext that they would exercise this power in an uncoordinated manner; it wishes the qualified majority system to apply more widely (or perhaps totally; this is not made quite clear), a wish that would largely be granted by the Treaty of Nice if it is ratified.
We take the opposite position: if it came to the point that immigration questions were decided by a majority, that would take the power away from the countries and put it in the hands of uncontrollable lobbies, or perhaps even to one member country that was better placed than the others in the decision-making procedures.
For the good of Europe these powers, the power of proposal and of decision, should remain among the sovereign competences of each nation.
In particular, direct decision-making power should be returned to the national parliaments.
The motion for a resolution itself recognises that 'the Member States and the Council are not succeeding in implementing a common policy in the areas of asylum and immigration' .
As for national policies, instead of becoming more flexible they are more and more restrictive.
Within the European Union, capital has been able to move freely for a long time now, as have goods.
But not people.
That is tantamount to admitting that this European Union was not made for people but for capital and those who possess it.
Obviously, we voted against this motion for a resolution.
We repeat our demand for the total freedom of establishment and movement for all those who live and work in one of the European Union countries and their entitlement to the same political, legal and social rights as citizens of the Community.
- (SV) I have voted against the motion for a resolution.
This initiative and its classification are, in my view, the wrong way for the European Parliament to handle such a fundamental constitutional issue as the entire EU decision mechanism, including the proposal to abolish the pillar structure in the area of justice in favour of the Community method with full co-determination for the European Parliament.
The Posselt report has not been before the Standing Committee on the Constitution, which is a clear omission.
In point 33, for example, the wording is very unclear and also poorly supported on such an important issue as whether the European Union should establish its own force for European border protection.
GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report (A5-0133/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I would like to address Mr GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, if I may, for, last night, the great Italian fashion designer Valentino phoned me. "Hello.
Is Mr Fatuzzo there?"
"Speaking," I replied.
"Mr Fatuzzo," said Valentino, "we Italian, French and European fashion designers are extremely concerned.
"What about?" I asked him.
"We are concerned about Mrs Laura GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez' report on product safety because, you see, our products, our clothes are dangerous.
We consider them dangerous because they are sexy, provocative and fascinating."
"That is true," I said, "but why are you phoning me? I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party."
"Because," Mr Valentino replied, "as you know, pensioners sometimes suffer from heart problems and so your votes are even more dangerous for them.
Please help us!"
I therefore voted for the motion in order to prevent safety criteria being applied to clothes.
The removal of borders and the achievement of the single market on 1 January 1993 highlighted the existence of a market of more than 370 million consumers, for which accompanying rules had to be drawn up to guarantee them a number of rights.
Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety (DGPS) was drawn up to that end.
Although the general approach of the directive adopted in 1992 proved satisfactory, the objectives set out in it were not all achieved because of the lack of clarity or gaps in some of its provisions.
The proposal is interesting overall, but several highly important amendments that Parliament had adopted at first reading, in particular the amendments on the safety of services, the precautionary principle, product monitoring and the European product safety network were not incorporated.
The responsible parliamentary committee therefore decided, justifiably, to table them again.
Conversely, the common position does include Parliament's amendments on charity shops in a recital that stipulates that, in relation to charitable activities, it may prove impossible to provide information on the origin of a product and the risks it might contain.
The Council has also introduced certain innovations in relation to the Commission's initial proposal, in particular:
Modification of the definitions of 'product' and 'safe product' to clarify the scope of the directive, especially in regard to services;
Introduction, again for the sake of clarification, of additional definitions relating to 'serious risk' and 'withdrawal' ;
Introduction of a three-stage procedure, with the right of appeal to the regulatory committee, in order to define European standards;
Additional provisions to encourage producers and distributors to become more involved in the voluntary sector.
These proposals go in the right direction.
Product safety must be taken into consideration when the rules governing the single market are adopted.
That is a vital condition for restoring consumer confidence, which has been somewhat shaken by the scandals of all kinds that have blown up recently.
It is vital to the sound operation of the single market.
Amending this directive is, therefore, a step in the right direction.
The Council common position, adopted on 12 February 2001, accepted 21 of the 30 amendments tabled by the European Parliament. Nevertheless, it left out important issues which the rapporteur has referred back to the European Parliament for second reading, and for which we have voted.
First and foremost, the introduction of the precautionary principle in the marketing of products and in measures to be taken in risk management.
This is a general principle, used by public authorities and must be referred to explicitly with regard to the powers and obligations of Member States.
Furthermore, the Council common position abandons the idea of a total ban on exporting products that present serious risks, despite clarifying the concept of partial bans or no bans whatsoever, without presenting any criteria for choosing which ban to apply.
We should, therefore, reinstate the European Commission' s original proposal.
Lastly, another important issue is safety in the field of services.
As the rapporteur says, the Commission must present rapid proposals for the safety of services.
The Commission must identify the needs and priorities for Community action in this field, and the responsibilities of service providers, taking account of the clarifications of the common position on the scope of application of the present directive.
On this topic the interests of industry continue to clash with those of the consumer and the environment.
Most companies no longer oppose the idea that protecting consumers against unsafe products is desirable.
In the single European market they are prepared to withdraw products that damage their good reputation.
On the other hand, when it is a matter of concrete measures by government, they are quick to complain that these restrict their freedom excessively, and exert pressure on Parliament to reject them.
Initially the Commission quite rightly claimed the right to decree a complete export ban on dangerous products.
It is madness that companies based in our countries should try to earn money from products that we consider unsafe for European consumers.
The Council seriously curbed those powers, probably under pressure from protesting companies who lobby their own national governments to protect the country' s exports.
I support the rapporteur in her aim of maintaining those powers and in addition of taking more safety measures before 2003.
It is reprehensible that good decisions by Parliament require 314 at second reading and as a result can often not be maintained in the face of opposition by the Council.
.
As a British member I was very concerned when the proposed directive was first discussed in the Environment Committee that it would inflict severe financial and bureaucratic damage on the flourishing British and Irish charity shop industry - largely unknown elsewhere in the EU - which raises so much money for good causes, and is also extremely sound environmentally by recycling and reusing large quantities of second-hand goods, which it then makes available cheaply to the consumer in its retail outlets.
I was therefore delighted that the common position of the Council returned to this House for a second reading incorporates the exemptions required for charity shops, inspired by my original amendment, from the need to keep records of the identity of purchasers of, in particular, second-hand electrical and electronic goods which constitute only a small part of their overall business.
This was a victory for common sense and has pleased the industry and my London constituents, and I thank the rapporteur and Commission for this derogation.
. I welcome this report on general product safety which offers yet further proof of Europe working for our citizens.
People across Europe are becoming increasingly worried about the safety of consumer products, such as children's toys.
We in the European Parliament are addressing this concern in a sensible, common-sense manner.
There were fears that the British tradition of charity shops would be threatened by these proposals.
I am pleased that Labour MEPs worked to prevent these from being affected by this directive.
It is ludicrous to think that the average charity shop, flea market or car boot sale can provide the authorities with information about product risks and product origin for second-hand goods acquired from the general public.
Overall, this directive is an enormous step forward in ensuring a consistent and high level of consumer protection.
It also creates the efficient functioning of the single market to benefit people, not just business.
We must not allow hidden dangers to consumers to creep in unseen through the back door.
I urge this House to move ahead from these proposals to look at the safety of services and the liability of service providers and to adopt the precautionary principle.
Public confidence in the safety of products has taken a real knock in recent years following a number of scares, especially in children's toys.
Only by taking a safety first attitude - and being seen to take a safety first attitude - can public confidence be restored.
Watts report (A5-0140/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, with regard to Mr Watts' report on shipboard living and working conditions, I received a 'phone call from an old friend, the purser, Mr Augusto Fazio, who used to sail with me - and still sails - between New York and the Bahamas.
He complained: "Working conditions on board ships are hard and tiresome.
We have to work during the day and at night and we are poorly paid.
I would like Europe genuinely to concern itself more - it is already taking an interest but not enough - in our pay and also in our pensions, for I am approaching retirement age".
I therefore welcomed Mr Watts' report and was happy to vote for the motion.
The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of improved European rules governing safety at sea.
We have voted in favour of increasing the number of inspections, of refusing all ships sailing with blacklisted flags access to EU ports and of requiring all new ships to be fitted with black boxes, as they are called.
Many accidents involving pollution could have been avoided by means of better safety.
We have seen all too many accidents in the last couple of years.
There was the loss of the tanker, Erika, off the Brittany coast in December 1999, resulting in considerable oil pollution, and the loss of the Italian chemical tanker, Ievoli Sun.
Most recently, we have seen an extensive oil spill in the Baltic.
The oil spill in the Baltic could have been avoided. Better European rules were needed.
The ship owners do not think that a black box has anything to do with safety.
However, that is not the case.
A black box is very useful in the investigation after two ships have collided, as happened, for example, in the Baltic.
If we become better at discovering the causes of accidents, we also become better at preventing them.
We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO.
The EU must take the lead in the IMO by adopting better rules.
We cannot compromise on safety.
We must have safety so that fish, birds and people can use the sea without being covered in oil and chemicals.
Even though the Commission's proposals aim to strengthen port state control by increasing the number of inspections and adopting more rigorous procedures, we wonder what has become of the governments' political resolve to prevent further oil slicks, 16 months after the shipwreck of the Erika.
The legislation must be applied by all the Member States, including Belgium, Portugal, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.
Moreover, adequate resources must be earmarked for these controls, which in concrete terms means hiring more inspectors, widening their powers and areas of control, especially in regard to respect for social security rules and the living and working conditions of the crews.
The proposal to equip as many vessels as possible, from oil tankers to bulk carriers and passenger ships, with VDRs or 'black boxes' is a positive one, but this must not exempt the states from carrying out the necessary inspections.
It will also be necessary to create as soon as possible a team of European inspectors and coast-guards and allocate them adequate financial, human and material resources.
Furthermore, the Council's proposals on 'black-list' flags are still too timid.
It must take a much firmer stance against flags of convenience, especially those from Member States and from the islands of Kerguelen and Wallis and Futuna Islands.
We must require their suppression and ban all vessels that do not respect these rules from sailing in Community waters.
Eighteen months after the shipwreck of the Erika, need we remind anyone of the distress, the suffering, the anger of the people living along our Atlantic Coast, whose maritime and tourist activities have been so hard hit?
Need we remind anyone how long it took to pay out compensation, which in many cases has still not been received, and how inadequate that compensation was?
The day after this tragic accident, speaking in this Chamber, I proposed adopting the following broad policy guidelines:
The 'polluter cleans up' principle: will we leave it to the communities, to the citizens who are the victims, to clean up our coast?
The 'polluter pays' principle: we must underline the liability of the ship-owners and operators in this type of disaster.
Rapid and complete compensation of the victims.
Maintenance of the Community fleet and shipyards at an acceptable level, rather than allowing fleets to develop in our seas and our ports over which we have no control, which fly flags of convenience that are quite untraceable.
Strengthening the Community legislation providing for the inspection and classification of ships operating in Community waters and a ban on dangerous ships.
Eighteen months later, what has become of the measures we called for?
We welcome the proposals on which Parliament voted today and which go in the right direction.
The Watts report is concerned with strengthening port state control and with rigorous inspections and procedures. We support the rapporteur's calls for the use of voyage data recorders.
In the Ortuondo report, we welcome the more stringent legislation on ship-classification societies.
We also note with interest the progress of the 'Erika II package' , which we await impatiently.
Yet we are still far from taking the necessary measures in regard to compensating the victims, applying the principle of the 'polluter cleans up' , restoring the balance of sea transport between the various Community ports and encouraging the maintenance and development of our merchant fleets.
The overcrowding of European ports, especially in the Channel and the North Sea, makes these measures all the more urgent.
Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0144/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, with regard to the Ortuondo Larrea report on the safety inspection of ships, I have to say that, although I voted for the motion, I would have preferred the classification societies appointed by the governments to inspect ships and to give the ships that sail our seas and the seas outside the Mediterranean free reign, to be assisted in carrying out these inspections by pensioner sailors, pensioner quartermasters, pensioner engine room officials and pensioner chief stewards, who have a wealth of experience and are highly qualified to assess whether ships are truly safe.
President.
At last, I understand what is going on!
In fact, I was wondering whether there was a plant in the audience that was not really a plant!
Now I understand!
Today we are voting, at second reading, on the Ortuondo Larrea report on classification societies.
Some of the amendments are heading in the right direction by proposing a strict ban on the Administration employing recognised organisations if they have economic interests in the management or properties of ships, or by reaffirming the need for coherence between the European standards and the IMO.
We cannot accept some others, which seek to reduce the financial liabilities.
They only aim to ensure that for the rules of competition between states, regardless of the scale of the consequences due to errors or negligence of the recognised organisation.
Liability must be full and complete and the court or tribunal must judge and decide freely, on the basis of the real nature of each disaster.
As often happens, the report proposes improvements in transparency or harmonisation, but limits their actual scope by not making provision for adequate financial sanctions.
This package to increase safety at sea is a reaction to the accident with the Erika on 12 December 1999.
Despite the fact that a plethora of Parliament's proposed amendments have been adopted, such as the exclusion of classification societies with some form of business, personal or family links to the shipowner or operator, greater transparency by requiring classification societies to ensure that all relevant information is made available to all interested parties on their websites, scrutiny of classification societies where the accident rate recorded by the ships classed is excessively high, the Council and Parliament still disagree on two very important points, which is why a conciliation procedure would appear to be in order if the recommendations before us, which we support, are accepted.
Firstly: the European Parliament proposed that ceilings should be placed on the financial liability of classification societies in the event of an accident caused by wilful act, omission or gross negligence in their survey work.
The Council was in favour of a regulation which allowed the Member States to set the maximum amounts payable, with the amounts set by Parliament here as minimum, not maximum amounts.
Secondly: the Council has not accepted that there should be regular, mutual consultations between recognised organisations with a view to guaranteeing that their technical standards are equivalent to the provisions of IMO Resolution A.837 (29) and that the Commission should be provided with regular reports on fundamental progress made on these standards and their willingness to cooperate with port state control administrations.
As my group is positive that a common standpoint can be found for both outstanding problems, we feel that a conciliation procedure would be in order.
van Dam report (A5-0151/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, as you can see, sometimes the Pensioners' Party gains fresh support from people as important as the Members of the European Parliament, even if only for explanations of vote on individual measures.
I hope that Mr van Dam's report will receive just as much support.
I voted for this report, which establishes a regulation on the safety of the carriage of goods by road and the safety of drivers who drive international heavy goods vehicles in Europe.
The report also says that it is essential for the salaries and working conditions of drivers in Europe to be standardised, so as not to distort competition.
However, that means that, in order to prevent distortion of competition, the rules governing pension contributions should also be standardised, and drivers' pensions should be standardised too.
Therefore, what is stopping us from giving the European Union the competence to regulate the salaries and pensions of all Europeans?

The report on which this proposal is based 'shows that a number of EU transport firms use a variety of underhand means for using cheap vehicles and staff from third countries. The costs of both equipment and staff are significantly lower than in the EU.'
That means that a number of road transport firms employ underpaid drivers, working in precarious conditions, for transport outside the country in which they are based.
What worries the rapporteur most, however, is not the situation of the drivers, their excessively low wages or unacceptable working conditions, but the resulting 'distortions of competition' .
The proposed solution is the compulsory introduction of a 'uniform driver attestation' in all the EU Member States.
It would have been preferable to make the hauliers pay the same wages, whether or not the driver is an EU national.
The best way to combat 'social dumping' would have been to impose a minimum wage aligned with that of the country where it is highest.
Yet the European authorities prefer to impose a uniform administrative document throughout the European Union, rather than making the hauliers pay decent wages and provide decent working conditions for all their drivers, whatever their country of origin.
This shows that the envisaged reform is not concerned with the workers, which is why we abstained.
The Van Dam report on the eventual introduction of a uniform attestation for all drivers engaged in road transport within the territory of the Community is a positive step.
However, we do not take the same stance as the rapporteur, who is in favour of 'fair competition' in this sector.
The single market liberalised the carriage of goods by road.
The companies then used a variety of underhand means for using cheap equipment and staff from third countries.
A certain complacency has arisen in this field, similar to that found in transport by sea.
The road hauliers' search for profit at any price leads to the over-exploitation of labour, which seriously increases the risk factor of this mode of transport.
We emphasise the need to harmonise labour law for drivers travelling within the Community territory at the most favourable levels achieved, beginning with their training, working hours and working conditions, pay and pensions.
Moreover, it is imperative for the Member States to recruit enough monitors and inspectors to ensure respect for existing legislation.
It is mainly for these reasons that we are voting for this report.
Calendar of part-sessions
Since we have no special preferences regarding the duration of part-sessions, we abstained from the vote on the proposed calendar.
Yet we do believe that whatever the majority that emerges from Members' votes, the employees of the European Parliament, officials and others, must not be made to suffer in any way from this decision, and in particular must not have their salaries reduced.
There is no reason to penalise the staff simply because of the way the Members choose to work, i.e. their own convenience.
.
(NL) On behalf of the Netherlands delegation I wish to report that we have voted in favour of abolition of Friday sittings, on the assumption that a thorough reform of our parliamentary work is necessary, to allow more time for legislative work.
We hope that our decision will be seen as a pragmatic and not a moral one.
Stihler report (A5- 150/2001)
Madam President, this was an extremely important report.
Right across Europe, the abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is a growing problem.
In Ireland the level of alcohol abuse by young people has grown dramatically over the years.
One of the things we need to look at is the whole advertising campaign by the alcohol industry.
The alcohol industry portrays alcohol as something that is necessary to enjoy life.
It portrays the abuse of alcohol as something that is acceptable in society.
Yet when you look at what happens in society - not just to young people but also to older people - one of the major problems we have is the abuse of alcohol, which contributes to violence in the home, violence on the streets and to serious crime.
We have to address this issue.
One of the best ways of addressing this is by looking at the advertising industry.
For example, there is a restriction on cigarette advertising on television, yet there is no restriction on alcohol advertising on television.
There is something seriously wrong here.
Yes, smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers.
But alcohol causes major problems throughout society, from health problems, to violence, to abuse against other people and the persons themselves.
We need to consider whether it is acceptable that the alcohol industry can advertise in such a carte blanche fashion.
It is completely unacceptable.
We need to address this.
We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol.
It is a drug and should be accepted and recognised as such.
It should not be promoted as something that is necessary to enjoy life, because it is not.
Mr President, I fully support the report on the recommendation on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents.
Who would not do so?
What is important is that recommendations are not issued for reducing the alcohol consumption of elderly people for, it is well-known, when taken in moderation, alcohol is beneficial to health.
The report proves conclusively and extensively in its introduction - inter alia - that: a) the probability of adults' developing an addiction (alcoholism) increases significantly if they start drinking as children or adolescents, b) the use/abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is increasing continuously in all the countries of the ÃU, c) many countries in the ÃU produce "alcopops", i.e. refreshments containing alcohol, which are freely sold to children and adolescents, d) there is a direct and worrying link between violence and antisocial behaviour and between road traffic accidents (deaths, disabilities) and the use of alcohol by children and adolescents.
The rapporteur is therefore quite right to raise these major issues.
However, just when you would expect fundamental proposals to combat this very serious problem, all you find is a series of amendments urging awareness-raising and recommending and encouraging producers to stop producing alcopops and bar waiters and owners to avoid selling alcoholic beverages to children and adolescents and include cheap, non-alcoholic drinks on their menus.
Advertising should be directed solely at adults, inexperienced drivers should avoid having more than 0.2% alcohol in their bloodstream and parents, associations and sports personalities should persuade children and adolescents to resist the massive onslaught by manufacturers, retailers, bar and club owners and advertisers.
At the same time, we should rely on these people to act altruistically and to stop selling or advertising alcohol to children.
In other words, trivial, anodyne, fragmentary proposals which, at best, are ingenuous, in that they are a long way from dealing with a problem which claims the health and lives of millions of minors.
Nowhere did we find any reference to the causes of the problem or any proposal to deal with the huge financial interests which use all means, fair and foul, to manufacture, market and promote alcohol to children and adolescents.
Obviously, unless these issues are addressed, any proposal will just be an "aspirin", a simple wish list which merely perpetuates and exacerbates the problem.
Finally, we note that the introduction to the report stresses that, under no circumstances, will even these anodyne proposals - which will run off the back of economic interests and profiteering - become binding proposals or legislation; they will simply remain as recommendations to the Member States.
- (SV) We believe that the focus of alcohol policy should be decided at national level.
Issues of taxation, retail monopolies, advertising, import restrictions and age limits should all be decided by the individual Member States.
The Stihler report addresses a recommendation from the Council in this area.
As it is not a matter of legislation for Member States, we have voted for the proposal, as we share its main political stance.
We all know that alcohol consumption is high, with all of the unfortunate consequences that this entails, specifically when young people are concerned.
As a recent survey of fifteen- and sixteen-year-old adolescents revealed, the highest levels of excessive consumption are seen in Ireland, the United Kingdom and in Denmark.
It is these last two, however, together with Finland, France and Sweden, that have the highest percentages of young people who have been drunk at, or under, the age of 13.
Studies that have been carried out show a strong link between alcohol consumption and anti-social behaviour such as violence, and that immoderate consumption of alcohol is a proven factor in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, crime and road traffic accidents.
Furthermore, consumer habits acquired in youth can also affect health and set longer-term consumption patterns, which means that we must not only give a commitment to health promotion, education and information policies, but also to measures limiting alcohol consumption by children and adolescents and structural actions in the field of treating young people and helping them to better adapt to society.
The Commission' s proposal, however, is extremely superficial and starts from the premise that those who stand to benefit from alcohol sales will work to prevent greater consumption amongst children and adolescents, which is quite a utopian idea, as is well known. The rapporteur goes somewhat further in her proposals, and tries to lay down certain rules and stresses the need for more precise codes of conduct, but what is really needed is for the Member States to pay greater attention to this problem.

If we are to pursue a responsible policy we must concern ourselves with the health of Europeans, particularly the youngest among them.
Therefore, we need to be very vigilant in face of the rising alcohol consumption by children and adolescents.
That is why I voted for this recommendation of the European Parliament, which calls on the Member States to take measures to protect young people.
Action should therefore be taken in the European Community countries to raise public awareness of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and persuade children, adolescents, but also parents, to be more responsible for their actions.
Children and adolescents are particularly receptive to the messages transmitted to them and the appropriate educational action could therefore produce practical results.
We must remember that young people are the main victims of the murderous road accidents caused by alcohol abuse.
Furthermore, if the appropriate messages were disseminated to make even the youngest children aware of the dangers of excess alcohol consumption, that could prevent some of the tragedies we have seen.
At the same time, we have to distinguish between different drinks.
We know, for example, that the moderate consumption of wine can have beneficial effects on health.
That is why we certainly do not wish to condemn the producers.
Our aim is to put a stop to the excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks among young people.
Yet the producers do have a role to play.
They should not target their commercial and advertising campaigns specifically at adolescents.
We know what an impact these campaigns can have on young people, so this temptation must be suppressed in favour of preventive measures.
Lastly, we should give some thought to whether it might prove effective to affix warning labels to the products, as France is doing in relation to advertising.
The consumption of alcohol by adolescents and, alas, more and more often by children, is a real cause for concern and we must do our utmost, we who are supposed to be responsible adults, to protect young Europeans against the abuse or, as the rapporteur calls it, the harmful use of alcohol.
That is why we will vote for Mrs Stihler' s report and for most of her amendments.
I would add, however, that the protection of children and adolescents against certain abuses must be absolute.
Yes, we must protect the youth of Europe against alcoholism.
But we must also protect it against drugs, including the drugs some people dare describe as 'soft' .
We must also protect it against the actions of perverts, against the sexual practices that some left-wingers advocated in the 1970s in order to 'shock the bourgeoisies and justify their shameful paedophilia.
That is why I am surprised that a report such as Mrs Stihler' s can coexist, within this Chamber, with militant speeches in favour of decriminalising the use of cannabis or against the death penalty.
We cannot have two weights and two measures when it comes to the health, the stability and the future of our children.
Swedish alcohol policy differs from that of many other EU Member States.
The restrictive sale of alcohol, the ban on alcohol advertising and the high age limits are vital tools for limiting the damage caused by alcohol, both in young people and adults.
We want to retain this system.
Mrs Stihler' s report on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents is very detailed and an example of extensive meddling.
We are convinced that European level is not the right level at which to decide on such detailed regulations for issues such as how alcohol may be displayed in shops.
The work on reducing the damage caused by alcohol among children and young people must be adapted to the various regulations on alcohol sales of each Member State.
Therefore, we are voting against this proposal.
While I fully agree with the objectives and the measures proposed in this legislative proposal to restrict the consumption of alcohol by adolescents and young people, I cannot endorse the rapporteur's proposals that, directly or indirectly, assimilate alcohol, tobacco and drugs, or the proposals that are of a repressive nature.
The fight against alcoholism among minors should be based on education towards healthy living, information, persuasion and the active participation of the producers and retailers of alcoholic products.
The Commission's original text was more consistent with that objective than some of the amendments that were finally incorporated.
For these reasons, I preferred to abstain.
Sturdy report (A5-142/2001)
Mr President, we are constantly calling for environmentally-friendly, ecological production methods in multipurpose agriculture.
We already have a long tradition of this in Austria, where the rethinking process started in the minds of farmers and consumers a long time ago, unlike in many other countries of the EU.
We farmers in Austria are at the vanguard here and I am convinced that this approach is also the right approach for European agriculture.
I therefore support the Commission proposal, which could be integrated into a European agricultural model.
That is why I voted against the proposed amendments which seek to exceed the 90-animal limit for premium payments - I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 10, 2 and 12 - and I am sorry that they attracted a majority during the vote.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in amending the common organisation of the market in beef and veal, we have taken an urgently needed step in the right direction, i.e. towards extensifying cattle farming.
Apart from reducing beef production, I am also in favour of safeguarding a minimum wage for small holdings and increasing animal premiums.
However, the European Union still needs to be prepared for any sudden crises in the future.
It is not yet clear if the funding for this regulation from the savings made from reforms under Agenda 2000 will last.
Promoting agriculture with no upper limits and arbitrarily shifting money from the organisation of the market into rural development will upset any budget planning in the long term.
This problem has yet to be resolved.
Mr President, the matter at hand is the measures adopted as a result of the fight against BSE.
Well then, in the middle of a chat, Daisy cow says to Buttercup cow: "Have you heard?
Isn't BSE a good thing!
Maybe we will not all have to end our days as beef steaks!"
"You're right," says Buttercup to Daisy, "but I bet that all these actions and studies of the European Union governments will just lead them to say: 'These cows live too long, they receive a pension for too long and we do not have enough money.'
I bet that, when all is said and done, we will end up as steaks after all."
"I do hope not," replied the other cow.
I also hope that this will not happen.
I therefore voted for the motion.
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Commission' s proposal concerning the organisation of the market for beef.
We have also voted against Parliament' s report.
Both proposals are along the wrong lines.
The crisis in the beef sector must be used to reform the organisation of the market, not to introduce still more aid.
We have therefore voted against all amendments aimed at increasing aid.
The proposal is all too short-term. It does not limit the production of beef.
Instead, the proposal will introduce still more bureaucratic and expensive premium schemes.
Instead, the opportunity should be taken to reform the organisation of the market.
That mainly means reducing prices. The crisis in the beef sector is not only about structural inequality in the market for beef, but undoubtedly also about a lack of consumer confidence in food safety.
The crisis is therefore a good reason for embarking upon a fundamental reform of agricultural policy.
For a long time the European institutions encouraged, thanks to subsidies, the kind of intensive farming and cattle rearing that suits the interests of the agro-food industry.
Intensive breeding and the massive use of animal and bone meal led to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Even after it was clearly established that animal and bone meal was responsible for propagating this disease, the European institutions continued to conceal this evil and to hand out subsidies to promote consumption and marketing.
Faced with the scale of the disaster, the European authorities eventually and belatedly changed their approach.
Under cover of financing measures to make up for the errors of the preceding period, they rushed into a policy of 'purchase for destruction' , which it is difficult to reconcile with the European budget.
Now, after having encouraged intensive farming, they are trying to 'boost' extensive rearing and 'organic farming' .
We abstained on this report, which in effect asks for a full discharge for a chaotic 'agricultural policy' , in which the only factor that remains constant is the payment of substantial amounts in the form of subsidies that are often only of limited benefit to the small farmers and are of far greater benefit to the beef and veal industry and the capitalist firms that are prospering in the sector of animal feed and meat processing and marketing.
The beef and veal sector was heavily penalised in the last CAP reform because the fall in prices was not fully compensated through direct aid, which only compensates for between 30% and 50% of the fall in produce prices.
Furthermore, the BSE crisis, followed by the crisis of foot-and-mouth disease, caused a fall in consumption and a further fall in produce prices.
Portuguese producers are still suffering from the ban on beef and veal exports.
Given this crisis scenario, the Commission presented a plan of 7 proposals designed to redress the imbalances in the sector.
Instead of presenting a well thought out and coherent proposal, the Commission presented a proposal that is loosely defined and whose sole aim is to make budgetary savings.
Whilst the Sturdy report shares the Commission' s reasoning, it nevertheless puts forward some interesting ideas, for example on the slaughter of calves and increasing aid.
Nevertheless, it rejects the Commission' s proposal for strict compliance with the limit of 90 animals per holding and the future creation of a system of individual premium rights, which are positive proposals that might not only combat the tendency towards more intensive farming, but also support the implementation of a system of aid adjustment.
In any event, if the current system remains in place, we must guarantee that if rights are bypassed, the proportional reduction of the premium will not affect producers owning fewer than 15 animals.
Furthermore, the Commission' s proposal on reducing stocking density from 2.0 to 1.9 Livestock Units per hectare of forage area would, in Portugal, cause annual penalties totalling ESC 300 million to be imposed - for 9000 premiums - which would mainly affect small and medium-sized family holdings.
On this issue, the rapporteur goes even further than the Commission, recommending the creation of new premiums for greater reductions in stocking density.
For all of these reasons, we did not vote in favour of this report and chose to abstain.
The European Commission is still clearing up after BSE.
Having failed to deal with the root cause of the disease in 1990, which is what Jacques Delors and his gang refused to do so as not to interrupt the triumphant march, firstly towards the single market and then towards the euro, we have since adopted numerous financial and technical stop-gap measures to ward off the never-ending effects of what has been a disaster in health, trade and financial terms.
This is the case of the new measure for the COM in beef and veal, which is the subject of Mr Sturdy' s excellent report.
In order to save the market which it brought to the brink of collapse, the Commission is going back to its ideological Malthusianism.
The special premiums for male cattle and suckler cows would once again be limited to 90 animals or 1.8 LU per hectare.
The supply of beef would thus be limited in order to adapt to the drop in demand.
Every Member State will set an individual ceiling for each of its farmers.
Mr Sturdy is proposing a series of amendments to maintain farmers' income, particularly for farmers involved in extensive farming.
The report recommends, for instance, that the premium for steers be increased, and there are also calls to promote beef and veal by proposing an increase in the current budget of EUR 10 million, which is insufficient.
To cap it all, a 'Special Purchase Scheme' is proposed for cattle over 30 months old, so that they can be stored and sold off at some point, like the terminally ill who have themselves frozen, in the hope that they can be resuscitated when a cure has been discovered.
When we know that public stocks are increasing by 50 000 tonnes each month, that the Commission had already bought back 175 000 tonnes in April and that the beef sector used appropriations worth EUR 7 billion in 2001, you can see the scale of the financial disaster that Jacques Delors' team made inevitable when it turned its back at the first signs of the BSE crisis.
And the new measures proposed by Brussels, which are, moreover, completely ineffective, are seeking to further increase the debt by EUR 1 million. The matter is still not over.
We voted in favour of Amendments Nos 1, 10, 2 and 12, not so much because we agree with a policy of highly intensive production under the CAP, which must be reviewed for the sake of farmers, consumers, environmental protection and food quality, but because we think that loosely-defined restrictions, in this case on the number of male cattle that can benefit from the beef special premium, imposed in isolation from an overall and coherent reform, make no sense and create unfair situations in comparison to the premiums established for other types of agricultural and animal production, which remain unchanged.
I have voted against the Sturdy proposal.
The reason is that the proposal is based on the continued false principle of patching up and mending a non-transparent agricultural policy in the EU instead of taking a joint and radical hold of the issue.
Problems are moved to new areas or are not addressed at all.
The report is also based on increased economic commitment for the EU and the taxpayers in the area of food production, in this case in order to promote increased sales of beef to consumers.

The Doha summit is approaching and is due to take place in November 2001.
After the failure of Seattle, Doha must be a success for the WTO, and if this is to happen, the United States is not to be counted on.
Never in history has the hub of an empire conceded its hegemony to its far-flung outposts.
The American superpower is giving up none of its claims, especially now it has the Texan, Mr Bush, in office, the man who perpetrated genocide on the children of Iraq.
Who, apart from Europe then, can give in?
And this is exactly what is happening.
First of all, we have reformed the CAP in order to cave in to the demands of the US Administration in the Uruguay Round negotiations.
As consensus must be reached at Doha, however, giving in to the United States and the Cairns Group by abandoning our farmers to the productivist and ultraliberal global market is not an adequate approach.
We also need the agreement of the poorest African and Asian countries, which also opposed consensus in Seattle.
This is the whole point of the new Council regulation, which concedes our customs duties on bananas, sugar and rice for the 48 least developed countries.
Between 2006 and 2009, these three products will become entirely duty free.
In the meantime, customs duties will be reduced by 20%, 50% and 80% by 2009.
Sudan will, therefore, be able to send us its sugar, free from customs barriers, by virtue of the fact that it is a poor country.
Sudan is nevertheless able to find the resources to bomb its own villages that stand in the way of its oil wells and is also choosing to starve its inhabitants in the south of the country.
The Council regulation, based on the slogan 'everything but arms' , is therefore, the height of hypocrisy because the additional income that Sudan, for example, will make as a result of the additional exports that we are giving it the opportunity to make, will buy it additional arms with which to fight the Christians in the south of the country.
The real problem, however, is the generosity of the socialists and the Christians, as combined in the person of our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy.
Christian Europe is offering fundamentalist Sudan, which is of symbolic importance, the financial means to increase the martyrdom of its Christians in the south of the country.
This is all the more shocking because the 48 LDCs will act as intermediaries, flooding Europe with bananas, sugar and rice from countries other than those benefiting from a wide range of preferences.
A precedent has already been set with garlic from China, for example, which is appearing in Europe via Malaysia, Jordan and other Trojan horse countries.
If we understand, however, that European integration is itself nothing more than a Trojan horse, in place to establish the ideological and trading empire centred on the United States, with outposts in every corner of the world, then we see that Mr Miranda has produced the report of a loyal servant of that country' s blueprint for the world.

The beef and veal sector has been doubly hit by disaster. 'Mad cow disease' was followed by foot-and-mouth disease; the fall in domestic consumption as a result of much exaggerated consumer fears is now joined by a serious decline in our exports to third countries.
While millions of animals have gone up in smoke, the slaughterhouses are running idle and the stock-farmers are suffering severely, both from the loss of outlets and from the falls in prices and morale in face of this crisis that has turned their world upside down and given rise to unjustified consumer distrust.
Two types of measures can be identified in the 'seven point plan' presented by the Commission to deal with this crisis.
First, there are the emergency measures to manage the markets and to try and restore the balance between supply and demand. One example is the proposal to set up a special purchase scheme and not to apply the ceiling for buying into intervention.
We approve of these measures, while recommending avoidance of buying into intervention for storage purposes, which would merely defer the problem to a later date. It would be better to provide food aid whenever this can be done without destabilising the beneficiary countries' markets.
Secondly, there are long-term measures to rather radically amend the COM or even to change the nature of the CAP.
These measures are not all bad, but they should not be decided too hastily. Some of them, however, are quite frankly bad, such as the introduction of a system of individual rights for the special premium for male bovine animals, which would introduce a cumbersome and bureaucratic quota system, or reducing the density factor, which would probably not produce the desired extensification but would certainly reduce the income of farmers, something they certainly do not need.
We endorse most of the amendments tabled by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which fortunately rectified the Commission' s regrettable tendency to amalgamate emergency measures to deal with the turmoil in the beef sector with the surreptitious reform of the COM, contrary to the Berlin agreement.
We do not deny the need for reform, but this reform must not be improvised in this way or brought in on the sly.
.
(NL) We voted against the whole Sturdy report and most amendments to it, including those of the ELDR and the Green group, because they are in favour of an increase in subsidies and promote intensive, animal-unfriendly husbandry.
The collapse of the beef market is not the fault of external causes, but is directly connected with the way in which production and trade are organised in the livestock sector and with the way in which crises such as BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are being combated in the EU, with the support of the sector.
The sector is therefore now experiencing the consequence of what we regard as the normal operation of market forces.
There is no reason for further increasing subsidies.
Mr Sturdy' s proposal to take the pressure off the market by organising subsidies in such a way that instead of beef more veal is produced - from crated calves, that is - is the height of cynicism.
Langenhagen report (A5-0129/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I was the only person to vote against the Langenhagen report, which regulates approves the Agreement on fisheries with Greenland.
Why did I vote against the motion, Mr President?
I voted against the motion because the Pensioners' Party does not approve of the fact that the States of the European Union go and fish other waters.
We should let every State catch its own fish!
I do not agree with the system whereby we pay in order to receive authorisation to fish the waters of other States.
This is not just because, as is well-known, I uphold the rights of fish and I have a good relationship with fish from all over the world, but, indeed, because I feel that the European Union should change its policy on fishing in the territories and seas of others.
Miranda report (A5-0128/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, as usual, Mr Poettering had a wry smile on his lips when he came into the Hemicycle.
How, therefore, could we not smile the smile of Riley while we talk of rice, the subject of Mr Miranda's report?
It is precisely the treatment of rice in this report that concerns me.
I voted against the report because, while I fully support the opening-up of European markets to underdeveloped countries, I do not feel that this should apply to the rice markets.
In Italy, particularly in the provinces of Novara, Vercelli, Pavia and Milan, rice is the basic source of income of a great many farmers.
I therefore totally oppose the opening-up of the rice markets to all the world markets.
And now, "Bon appÃ©tit," Mr President.
I hope there will be a good risotto on the menu.
We are not against the decision aimed at 'giving unrestricted access for all LDC products except arms and munitions to EU markets' because there is no reason to impose customs duties at the European Union' s borders on products from the poorest countries.
It is clear, however, that this measure, which is presented as benefiting the poorest countries, will mainly benefit the multinationals established in those countries, which are generally the only companies to produce and sell on the international market.
It is a sign of the hypocrisy and pretence in this field that there are only three products for which implementation of this decision is deferred: bananas, sugar and rice, i.e. the three products for which production and marketing is in the hands of powerful trusts, each fighting the other for control of the international market.
That makes it all the more clear that the implied suggestions that this measure may help the poorest countries to 'develop their technological capability so as to be able to export finished products as well' , in other words that these countries have a chance to develop, are simply a con.
That is why we abstained.
The report rightly notes that the gap between the 48 poorest countries and the others 'grew even wider' .
The development of these countries, in which a large section of mankind lives in indescribable conditions, would require a distribution of wealth at international level that is totally incompatible with a world economic system based on inequality, exploitation and the plundering of the poor countries for the profit of the capitalists in the rich countries.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Situation of Turkish prisoners
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation of Turkish prisoners.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council welcomes this opportunity to discuss the situation in Turkish prisons and notes with satisfaction that the European Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, is heavily engaged in this issue.
The visit to Ankara from 30 April to 1 May by members of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee showed that the European Parliament has an important role to play.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament should continue their joint efforts to stimulate the Turkish government into continued political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen Criteria and take measures to bring the hunger strikes to an end.
The Council deeply regrets the fact that these hunger strikes in various prisons across Turkey continue to lead to the loss of human life.
This is a major human tragedy.
Therefore, the Council has pressed the Turkish authorities to take suitable steps to avoid further deaths.
We have also encouraged Turkey to make changes to the law and take concrete action to follow the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
Discussions with the Turkish government are ongoing, particularly within the framework of our deeper political dialogue.
Meetings took place in Stockholm on 14 March and in Brussels on 26 April.
The coming Association Council with Turkey on 26 June will also cover human rights issues.
In addition to these contacts, a dialogue is underway with the Turkish government through the local representatives of the Presidency and Member State representations in Ankara.
Meetings have been held with the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice, with the prison situation high on the agenda.
The Council notes with satisfaction that the Turkish government decided at an early stage to co-operate with the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which has visited Turkey three times so far due to the current situation and the hunger strikes.
Changes to legislation have entered into force, or will do so shortly, aimed at reducing the isolation of prisoners.
It is necessary for these reforms to be generously and correctly applied in practice, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
The Council strongly hopes that these measures now being carried out by the Turkish government will bring the hunger strikes to an end.
In this confusing situation, it also feels necessary to appeal to the hunger strikers and their families to react so that no human life is lost.
The Council will continue to monitor the development carefully in dialogue with the Turkish government and voluntary organisations.
In this context, the Council would point out that the Accession Partnership for Turkey, which was adopted by the Council in March, contains prison reforms as a priority area which Turkey needs to address to meet the political Copenhagen Criteria.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today's debate on the situation in Turkish prisons.
Parliamentary representatives, the presidency and the Commission have all endeavoured over recent weeks to resolve this serious humanitarian problem.
The forthcoming visit of the prisons by a delegation from the European Parliament will give new impetus to the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey.
The Commission deeply regrets that 22 people have already died during the hunger strike in Turkey, while many others are suffering terribly.
Their condition is worsening day by day.
Many will be staring death in the face if no way is found of ending this hunger strike.
Quite apart from where the organisers stand politically, the Commission feels that the current situation gives serious cause for concern on humanitarian grounds.
The situation in Turkish prisons was one of the main topics of conversation between me and the Turkish foreign minister in Brussels yesterday morning.
It was clear from what was said that the Turkish government feels that action is needed in order to avoid more deaths.
In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Turkish parliament has already passed an amendment to Article 16 of the Turkish anti-terrorist law.
The main point of this new regulation is that it allows prisoners to take part in social activities while serving their sentence.
We must call on Turkey today to ensure that the new regulation is implemented as quickly as possible, so that the conditions of detention in the prisons actually improve.
The Turkish foreign minister also informed me that two other bills are being drafted which will guarantee that sentences are properly executed.
One of these two laws makes provision for a new penal monitoring committee made up of representatives from Turkish NGOs.
The second law requires that a judge oversee the execution of sentences.
Both laws have already been adopted by the committee on legal affairs of the Turkish parliament and are due to be debated in the Turkish national assembly very soon.
I should like to stress that the Commission attaches great importance to further judicial and penal reform.
The Commission supports the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, as we set out quite clearly in the accession partnership.
The situation in Turkish prisons was a cause of concern to the Commission even before the unrest broke out and the hunger strike began.
The Commission repeats the call it made to the Turkish government on 21 March 2001, i.e. that it take all appropriate measures to prevent further deaths.
Suitable medical care must also be provided.
The Turkish government and Parliament should continue to work together to speed up the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey.
We expect human rights to be respected everywhere in any country wanting to become a member of the European Union, including in its prisons.
The Commission also urges the organisers of the hunger strike to distance themselves immediately from any action or demands which might lead to further loss of life.
Those who have taken it upon themselves to represent the interests of detainees should prove first and foremost that they no longer intend to risk the lives or welfare of the detainees.
In every situation, care must be taken to avoid endangering human life or health for reasons of political expediency.
The Commission is certain that further loss of life can be prevented and that the conditions of detention in Turkish prisons can be improved if everyone involved, including the organisers of the hunger strike, acts with restraint and a sense of responsibility.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to thank the Council and the Commission for agreeing to update us on this delicate and painful issue of the Turkish prisons.
The situation is highly critical and, as the President of the Council pointed out, it has already cost 22 lives and may cost many more.
At the same time our Parliament does not want to intervene too hastily.
Several initiatives, from different sides, have been taken with a view to resolving the situation: by the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, and, on a personal basis, by the chairman of our parliamentary delegation that visited Ankara and met all the actors involved in this singular conflict.
Our objective is to support these initiatives; we do not want to interfere to no purpose but to demonstrate the European Parliament's enduring interest and vigilance in relation to human rights and everything that concerns our Turkish partner.
Turkey has been going through difficult times since the beginning of this year.
The very serious financial crisis put paid to some extent to the economic recovery plan that was already under way.
The European Union is supporting and underpinning the IMF action to promote the implementation of the vigorous measures that Minister Kemal DerviÂº resolutely adopted.
At the end of the summer we will have an opportunity to look at the results of this policy and to evaluate the national programme to adapt the Community acquis, which the Ankara government recently adopted.
Over the same period of time, however, the Turkish prisons have been the scene of riots that were suppressed by particularly bloody means, followed by hunger strikes that turned into death fasts.
We are aware that this creates an extremely difficult situation for the Turkish authorities.
The leaders of the movement belong to fanatical extremist organisations that do not hesitate to play with the lives of their militants, or even their families, for political propaganda purposes.
Oddly enough, this movement sprang up when the prisoners concerned were about to be moved from the overcrowded prisons into which they were crammed under shameful conditions into modern prisons that complied with the Council of Europe's recommendations.
During the 1970s and 1980s, similar events occurred in our own democracies, although on a lesser scale.
While we do not underestimate the difficulties we do, therefore, emphasise the importance of rapidly finding a solution to the humanitarian aspect of the crisis, to bring an end to the daily deaths, without giving in to what is plainly an unacceptable form of political blackmail.
A delegation from our Parliament will be visiting the Turkish prisons in early June to try to evaluate the situation on the ground objectively and make recommendations on a longer-term prison policy.
It is very much to be hoped that this humanitarian problem can be settled in the meantime.
As Mr Verheugen said, this could be helped by speeding up the modernisation of the Turkish penal code and penitentiary code as also by adopting measures to calm down the situation in the new prisons.
At the same time, I am convinced that these would be regarded as a significant expression of Turkey' s resolve to move closer to the European model.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as the Commissioner and President-in-Office have pointed out, we are dealing here not with a country which is far flung from Europe, but with a candidate country with a whole host of serious problems.
It has economic problems which people are trying to resolve - and good luck to them - and we in the European Union shall support the reforms.
To all intents and purposes, Turkey is still both unwilling and unable to reform the political system - as the president of the republic and the military have both pointed out.
Hardly any progress whatsoever has been made on the so-called Kurdish question, i.e. the question of minorities, and the situation in the prisons is horrendous.
You would think that a government with so many problems would at least try to resolve the most pressing and urgent problems.
I recently made a short visit to Turkey with Mr Cohn-Bendit.
I personally was only there very briefly, but it was time enough to see that this is a dialogue between two people who are either hard of hearing or stone deaf; I refer to the organisers of the hunger strike on the one hand, who should end or at least suspend the hunger strike, and the Turkish government on the other.
If the European Parliament delegation just announced is to make any sense or have any chance of success, then both sides need to be willing to find a compromise or, at the very least, to stop what they are doing.
We all know that reform is needed in the Turkish prisons.
But the various proposals made - and this is a mild criticism of the work of the Council of Europe and its anti-torture committee - must not lose sight of the underlying problem.
Turkey is a country which, because of its laws, still generates a lot of political prisoners; that is the problem.
There are not so many political prisoners because there are so many assassination attempts, there are so many political prisoners because the laws in Turkey make political prisoners out of so many people - and that should be the starting point.
Secondly, even where people become prisoners or political prisoners as the result of terrorist activities - which I do not condone but which I cannot deny - solitary confinement must be abolished or at least reduced to what is humanly bearable.
The Commissioner announced a series of measures which Turkey intends to implement.
I spoke with the Turkish justice minister in January and these issues were already being discussed.
But the point with the monitoring system, with Article 16 and with the system of a judge to oversee how sentences are executed in Turkey is, how is all this going to be implemented?
The same law can be applied in a humane manner, with due respect for human rights, or it can be applied in a way which tends towards isolation and solitary confinement.
I call on Turkey to give us, the European Parliament, and Europe a chance to help it overcome this problem, but Turkey must also show willing.
Those of us who have studied the matter closely are certainly able to welcome the real progress that is nevertheless being made by Turkey to reform its prison system.
We also share something of the suffering of the political prisoners and their families who have chosen to starve themselves to death.
The Turkish judicial and penal system is in transition from a regime of retribution and oppression to a more western approach, where prisoners are penalised but not persecuted.
The European Union should assist this reform process by supporting financially and also technically certainly carefully selected confidence-building measures, without which the fasting will not cease.
These measures include training of judicial officials, prison officers and gendarmes, ensuring first-class medical services, improving conditions for prison visits and installing the independent scrutiny of the prison system and protecting lawyers.
Solitary confinement must be the exception and not the norm.
Prison rules must be applied scrupulously and the arbitrary treatment of all prisoners must stop.
Mr President, allow me to start by making a basic observation.
Prison reforms are the hardest reforms of all to implement, not just in countries like Turkey, but in our own countries as well.
We all know that.
Prisons are always the Achilles heel, the weak point of a democracy.
Even in the highly developed democracies of the European Union, the situation in the prisons is far from rosy, let alone democratic.
Applied to Turkey, this means that the situation in the prisons in a country which, culturally speaking, still has to find its democratic feet, is a mirror image of this contradiction in terms.
That is why I think it is very important to establish one thing: I do not know if it was the Council or the Commission which said that it called on Turkey to be generous in its application of the law.
I think that, legally, this is the wrong approach.
The law is one thing and generosity is another.
To my mind, what is contradictory about reform in Turkey is that, basically, it leaves reform up to the prison administration, which then has the opportunity to apply it as it sees fit.
With the situation as it is, this does nothing to inspire confidence in prisoners with painful experiences of the prison administration and the prison guards.
That is the problem.
How to create trust?
Which his why I think - and we established this on our trip - that we need to find a solution quickly because the prisoners have changed their standpoint.
They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands.
Isolation cells to be opened at once, new arrangements to be made for visits by relatives and lawyers at once, medical attention from doctors of their choice, these are more or less their immediate demands in order to call off the hunger strike.
That is why we call on Turkey, first, to be generous in implementing what is yet to come and to start by opening cells and doors so that the hunger strike can end.
Secondly, to instigate a dialogue with the prisoners so as to clarify exactly what they want.
It is important to recognise that.
Thirdly - and essentially in my view - Turkey must make it clear that it is ready in the dialogue to acknowledge these people as people.
On the other hand, we say to the organisations organising this strike that the decision to end the strike must be taken by the prisoners, not by some party leader or other.
That is our demand because it is these people who are risking their lives, not the leaders in Brussels, who still have plenty to eat and drink.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hunger strike by Turkish prisoners and their relatives has been going on for months and has cost many people their lives.
The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die.
The European Parliament must take a decisive stand if it is to be taken seriously as a negotiating partner.
We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons.
We must not forget human values.
The European Union must insist that human rights are respected.
The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement.
Now prisoners sentenced under the anti-terrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities.
My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities.
All prisoners must be treated equally.
I cannot stand by while prisoners are tortured and maltreated in solitary confinement and exposed to the arbitrary treatment of the guards without witnesses.
People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world.
And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction.
We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths.
On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, I therefore call on the Turkish government and the prisoners' organisations to reach an agreement through political dialogue.
Dialogue will allow a social consensus to be reached, while force will only be answered with force.
My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs.
But we would all like to help put an end to this situation.
If Turkey wants to be accepted in the European Union, it must stand up for democratic, humane values in the penal system.
Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners.
My wish is for agreement, for internal peace and for an end to hatred which opens up deep wounds.
That is why we must speak out.
Mr President, in my group "Europe" , in quotation marks, quite often stands for a meddlesome attitude.
However, that does not apply to the item on the agenda on the situation of Turkish prisoners.
Quite rightly the Council, the Commission and Parliament are jointly examining the issue, since the Republic of Turkey after all enjoys the status of a candidate country.
In order to actually join, such a candidate must meet the Copenhagen criteria.
An important European demand in this connection is that there should be a constitutional state.
In view of the continuing serious accusations about the Turkish prison system, this thorny national problem therefore demands European attention.
The recent introduction of the new F type prison in Turkey forms an extra complication.
It led to a veritable deluge of complaints and even mass hunger strikes.
On the basis of my Christian belief I certainly reject the final political weapon of voluntary death by starvation.
This view of life, however, also requires a humane treatment of prisoners within a constitutional framework.
The above considerations lead me to agree wholeheartedly with the institution of an ad hoc delegation of Parliament on the Turkish prison system.
As a member of this delegation, I trust we shall receive the full cooperation of the Turkish authorities on our visit at the beginning of June, in the hope that the European Parliament by applying the principle of hearing both sides of the argument can contribute to ending the tragedy of the hunger strikers.
Mr President, my contribution to the debate concerns the Christian groups in Turkey which are punished disproportionately severely and are detained in Turkish jails precisely because of their ethnic origin and their faith.
There they experience many difficulties.
They are badly treated, not only by the management of the prisons, but also by their fellow-prisoners and are scarcely given any protection.
Turkey has some 62 million inhabitants, 99% of whom are Muslims and less than half a per cent Christian.
The largest group of Christians are citizens belonging to the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.
Then in Western Turkey there are the Greek Orthodox Christians.
And although the Turkish constitution respects freedom of religion, courses run by the Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches have been closed on a massive scale, as have the courses of the Syrian Orthodox Church.
The Armenian Christian community particularly is constantly subject to new attacks.
Not so long ago, a Christian bookshop in Eastern Turkey was besieged by armed soldiers, as a result of which one person was killed and 26 wounded.
The only crime was the selling of Bibles.
According to the spokesman of the Armenian patriarch in the last few years 40 plots of land belonging to the Christian Armenian church have been confiscated by the Turkish state.
Anyone protesting is imprisoned and as a non-Muslim treated badly in the prisons.
The Syrian Orthodox Church is treated even more harshly and as a result of the intimidation more than 100 000 Syrian Orthodox citizens have left Southern Turkey, some of them to Western Europe.
In the province for which I am politically responsible, there are 9 000 Syrian Orthodox Christians and they have lost over 800 villages in Southern Turkey.
Those people who have stayed are intimidated, imprisoned and badly treated.
I am not an opponent of Turkey' s accession into the European Union, but I must say that if this mistreatment of Christians in Turkey continues, I may yet come out against Turkey' s membership.
Mr President, may I start by thanking the Council and Commission for their information because I assume that they are doing a great deal, even though the newspapers have very little to say on the subject.
Today I spoke on the telephone with a journalist from a Bavarian newspaper in Istanbul.
Unfortunately, she told me that not only was the Turkish government ignoring some of the deaths in the Turkish prisons, but that Turkish society was barely interested either.
In these circumstances it is, of course, very difficult to make people in Turkey understand why we debate these problems here in the European Parliament.
But the Turkish public needs to know that it is unacceptable in a state under the rule of law for people to die in its prisons without anyone doing anything.
Therefore, because we take Turkey seriously, because we want Turkey to have a chance in the future in the European Union, we also want Turkey to behave as we would expect our own Member States to behave.
Having said which, it is really very, very sad and disturbing to note that ...
(Demonstrators forced their way into the Chamber chanting loudly; protests from numerous members)
Mr Ceyhun, it is fair to say you do not usually create so much excitement with your speeches.
Mr President, I shall not take advantage of the situation by taking up more time.
I assume that I have about half a minute left and shall wrap my speech up straight away.
Naturally, I regret this incident.
I have no problem with any sort of demonstration, but people could at least show some respect for Parliament's work, rather than obstruct it, just when we are trying to end the situation as peacefully as possible and stop people from dying.
I shall say no more.
As far as the problem itself is concerned, this incident just goes to show how difficult things are.
I can only appeal on Turkey, as my fellow member Daniel Cohn-Bendit has already done.
It would be possible to induce certain people to stop what they are doing if Turkey showed willing on the three points listed by Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
I hope that Turkey will, at last, take these efforts seriously and show a little willing and stop being so stubborn, because otherwise no-one in Europe is prepared to tolerate Turkey's behaviour.
And it is Turkey's reputation that stands to suffer most.
Mr President, could you please find out how these three people even got in here?
We have such a strict security system, that we have trouble gaining admittance for our own citizens who come here with good intentions.
These people could not have got in without being let in.
The fact that the Communists stood up when they came in shows where they came from.
Please look into this very carefully and check who signed the slip.
Well, the Members remained admirably calm when the demonstration was taking place.
Let us not have a row now.
We do not know how they got in but it will be fully investigated.
The President will, of course, be informed and an investigation will be held.
As luck would have it there was a discussion at the Bureau meeting on Monday on tightening security.
Unfortunately no action has yet been taken.
Mr President, with all due respect, I cannot subscribe to your view.
It is not the political aspect which bothers me. I should like to point out that when my press officer wanted to step into the Chamber, he was stopped straight away.
And rightly so.
But I fail to understand how three or four people who have absolutely nothing to do with this Parliament can simply walk in.
Secondly: when foreign minister Cem was with us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we had a similar incident which only just stopped short of an actual attack on the minister.
Irrespective of the country involved, it is no laughing matter for Parliament when the security bureaucracy in this House - and I use the word bureaucracy advisedly - stops members at every turn but is unable to prevent this sort of incident when Turkey is the subject of debate, when you would expect them to, given that there has already been one such incident.
It is a scandal.
This needs to be taken more seriously, not the political aspects but what can be done here.
Next time it will a president who is interrupted or attacked while making a speech.
I should like to know what that will do for the European Parliament's reputation.
You must have misunderstood me, Mr Swoboda.
Of course, I take the incident extremely seriously.
I just do not think there is any point in getting excited in the Chamber.
The matter will be reported to the President, and the appropriate authorities will be asked to take action.
As I said, we had a discussion about our security system in the Bureau on Monday and the Secretary-General is currently preparing a report on how it might be.
There is, however, one problem.
I happen to be a member of the Committee on Budgets but if I may use this platform for propaganda, the Budgets Committee is blocking the release of resources for the security services.
We have about 15 posts blocked.
So, if you want to know why we are short on security staff, ask the Committee on Budgets.
Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have taken part in the debate for a useful discussion.
I think it shows great, constructive involvement in the situation in Turkey.
I believe that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission must continue their joint efforts.
Our central message to the Turkish government must be extremely clear on this point: immediate measures are required to avoid more casualties.
In this context, I would like to take this opportunity to give the visit to Turkey by Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Swoboda at the end of April/beginning of May the recognition it deserves.
I believe it is exactly this type of initiative which is needed to focus attention on the acute nature of the current situation, to clearly and objectively report to the people of Europe what is happening.
On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank you for this work.
I also agree with what Mr Swoboda said about the importance of looking at the political system which produces a prison system of the kind found in Turkey.
Of course we have to tackle the practical issues and examine the harsh prison conditions, but we also have to look at the bigger picture: the political system and the economic situation.
This is why I, as President-in-Office of the Council, have become involved in supporting the IMF and World Bank' s work to help the Turkish government achieve economic recovery, as we believe that this could also create the basis for advances such as better conditions in Turkish prisons.
I therefore look forward to continued close dialogue with Parliament.
The Council will continue to present itself very clearly to the Turkish government.
The Swedish Presidency, and no doubt the next countries to hold the presidency, will be very clear in their dealings locally with the Turkish government.
Hopefully, we will soon achieve concrete results in what is an important issue for us, namely the unacceptable situation in Turkish prisons.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February Albanian extremists took control of the village of Tanusevci on the border between Kosovo and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which caused violent clashes between extremists and FYROM' s army and police force.
In the middle of March, unrest spread to the town of Tetovo in western FYROM when uniformed men took the villages to the north of the town and then fired on the town at random.
The FYROM army launched a counter-offensive against the occupied villages which ended on 1 April.
However, later that month, the extremists renewed fighting in villages north-west of the town of Kumanovo, and the fighting is still continuing.
There is clearly a risk of out and out civil war, and the European Union has worked hard to prevent such a development.
The European Union reacted almost immediately to the fighting around Tanusevci and Tetovo by issuing declarations condemning the violence and urging all the parties involved to cease the violence immediately.
Intensive diplomatic activity commenced in Skopje to support the FYROM government, the country' s sovereignty and its territorial integrity.
At local level, the EU Presidency set up close contacts with the key players.
The FYROM government was urged to act with restraint against the extremists, and the leaders of the major Albanian parties were urged to openly distance themselves from and isolate the extremists, while the Slavic-Macedonian opposition parties were urged not to exploit the situation to whip up nationalistic feelings against the Albanian minority.
From the outset, efforts were also made, through the country' s media, to get over to the general public the EU' s message of distancing themselves from the extremists.
Then, intensive shuttle diplomacy was also started.
Foreign Minister Kerim was invited to discussions with the EU' s President-in-Office and High Representative Solana in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 19 March.
The following day, an EU Troika of political directors travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje, and at the end of the same week the EU Troika of foreign ministers travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje and Pristina to emphasise their support for the government and their condemnation of the extremists' actions.
One result of the visits was that the Troika got the Albanian leaders in FYROM and Kosovo to sign declarations publicly distancing themselves from the violent methods of the extremists and instead urging them to put forward their demands in political forums and in accordance with democratic procedures.
As a further sign of the EU' s support for FYROM' s political leaders, President Trajkovski was invited to the European Council in Stockholm on 23 March.
Here, he had the opportunity to present his views on the vulnerable position of the country to the entire European Council.
In order to underpin the political support financially, a review was carried out of the EU' s aid to FYROM for this year.
Intensive work was done by both the Commission and the EU Member States to, for example, make up the financial deficit for the new university in Tetovo, offering teaching in Albanian, and to try to rapidly implement measures to rebuild houses destroyed in the villages north of Tetovo and support other projects to strengthen inter-ethnic cohesion in the country.
As everyone is no doubt aware, on 9 April, following almost a year of negotiations, FYROM was the first country in the western Balkans to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
The agreement is a key step in FYROM' s rapprochement with the EU, and the signing was also an important symbol of the EU' s support for the country.
Like other countries in the western Balkans, FYROM is currently seen as a potential candidate for EU membership.
However, the unrest in FYROM has made it clear that there is a real need to improve the position and rights of the Albanians and other minorities in the country.
In conjunction with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the FYROM government launched an action plan for reforms to speed up the comprehensive adaptation required by the agreement, but also to intensify the inter-ethnic dialogue and strengthen the position of minorities.
Unfortunately, we have to say that the practical reforms have made slow progress.
So far, all that has been achieved is avoiding a declaration of a state of war, postponing the public census until October and setting a date of 27 January 2002 for new parliamentary elections.
However, the main success is that, after intensive negotiations and pressure from the international community, a broad coalition government has been set up which will function as the political basis for the difficult but necessary decisions which have to be taken in the near future.
The Council believes that there are measures which the government should and could implement immediately.
These include starting a third TV channel for minority languages, introducing the long-overdue act on strengthening local self-determination and ratifying the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages.
In the medium term, and ahead of next year' s election, the government must also make the necessary constitutional changes to even out the differences between the position of the Slavic-Macedonian population and that of other minorities in the country, and also take the action necessary to strengthen the representation of the minorities within the administration.
Today, the Troika of EU foreign ministers is returning to Skopje to promote this message.
Foreign Minister Mrs Lindh travelled straight from this House to Skopje.
At this meeting, the new coalition government will be invited to report on its progress and ongoing action plans in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 25 - 26 June.
In other words, FYROM is facing a difficult but necessary process of reform, and time is running out if a new civil war is to be avoided.
It is important to point out that the main responsibility lies with FYROM' s leaders.
The EU has an important supporting role to play, and the Council, along with High Representative Solana and, especially, the Presidency at central and local level, intends to continue its support for this process.
We also believe that there is a vital role for Parliament and its party groups.
In the period up to the end of June, the coalition government will need support and encouragement, as well as the exercise of pressure, to be able to implement the necessary reforms and, at the same time, keep the fragile government coalition intact.
The Council believes that it would be invaluable if Parliament' s party groups could contact their partners in FYROM and support them in this process, if this is not already happening.
It is still possible to avoid all-out civil war in FYROM.
We must ensure that we make the most of this chance.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the efforts of the Macedonian leadership, which culminated in the formation of a larger coalition government on Sunday, and hopes that this new government will achieve tangible results in the dialogue between the parties.
As you know, this dialogue started a few weeks ago in cooperation with the European Union.
We shall also continue to support the new government in promoting tolerance and restraint and applying the principle of "dialogue not force" in order to settle differences of opinion.
My colleague Chris Patten and the presidency will transmit this message to the new government and the president of the country when the troika of ministers of the European Union visits Skopje today.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April.
This was a very important and, without doubt, an historic step towards stability in the Balkans as a whole.
Macedonia is the first country in the region to sign such an agreement.
The second agreement with Croatia was initialled in Brussels last month.
The agreement is symbolic of the close relations between the Union and Macedonia and will provide a basis for fast rapprochement with the European Union.
The most important aspects of the agreement are the creation of free trade zone between the Community and Macedonia within ten years of the date on which the agreement enters into force, the start of political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation, an undertaking by the Macedonian authorities to harmonise their laws with EC law, especially provisions relating to the internal market, and cooperation on justice and home affairs.
The agreement makes it quite clear that Macedonia has European prospects.
These prospects now need to be given tangible form.
The agreement does not therefore represent the end of a process, it represents the beginning of a difficult process for this country.
It is now up to Macedonia to prove to the European Union that it has the will to fulfil the underlying criteria and, most importantly, this country must now show that it is in a position to resolve conflicts between ethnic groups through political dialogue rather than by force.
The EU shall continue to give its unrestricted support.
The Commission condemns the renewed acts of terrorism in northern Macedonia and urges all the members of the Albanian minority to leave it to the two official Albanian parties to explain the demands of this ethnic minority within a democratic forum, either with the new government or with the special committee chaired by President Trajkovski.
The European Union is already doing its best to facilitate this dialogue.
As the members of the European Parliament know, we are in an extremely critical phase in the history of Macedonia.
The European Union shall continue to express its solidarity with this country and its confidence in its people.
As far as we are concerned, the major objective of stabilising the Balkans cannot be achieved unless the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Macedonia are guaranteed.
However, the basic effort needs to be made by the people themselves and their political leaders.
They themselves are responsible for the future of their country.
In all events, we shall promote continuing dialogue leading to tangible results.
We are positive that a peaceful and democratic process which attends to the legitimate concerns of the minorities is the only way to set Macedonia on course for Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes active support for the peace process in Macedonia.
For the very first time over recent months we have seen the Council and Commission starting to act in concert in the case of the former Yugoslavia; everyone has the same take on the situation and we have joint action as a result.
We just have to bear in mind that we cannot turn our back on this country once the fighting abates and the shooting stops.
On the contrary, we must monitor the situation continuously and closely, by which I mean on the ground.
The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993.
We have constantly discussed all the problems with our Macedonian counterparts and the Macedonian government.
We have called on them time and again not to underestimate the simmering ethnic conflict and to do everything to prevent such conflict from breaking out.
For years little was done and that is a pity.
If the truth be told, this problem was criminally neglected for years.
But now this last government has got down to business over the last two and a half years and has done much to help the Albanian people and get things moving.
And then, just when we have important ministers of Albanian origin with important portfolios, just when a real solution has been found to the question of Albanian education and the problem of Tetovo University, at that precise moment, hostilities break out.
And we simply have to concede that they have been imported from outside.
I am surprised that none of the previous speakers, from either the Council or the Commission, reminded us that these hostilities were imported from outside.
That is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country.
Elections were held in Kosovo last year.
If elections had been held in Kosovo this spring, we would probably have been able to prevent this unrest in the neighbouring country.
But we have no proof of that.
Now we have a situation in which Mr Hekkerup, without talking to us here in Parliament - I do not know if he has spoken to the Commission, but he has certainly never spoken to us; we pay for the administration of UNMIK, we are the main payers, but no-one asks us what should be done down there - is designing a constitution which neither the Serbs nor the Albanians support 100%.
It may well be a very good constitution.
But if a constitution is announced in May and a vote is held on it in November, that gives seven months for the extremists to again find plenty of cause for unrest.
It is just not on.
You have to learn from your mistakes.
Perhaps they should have asked their counterparts in the European Parliament.
We could have told them.
So I think that mistakes were made.
We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward.
Now back to Macedonia.
The visitors in the gallery will have noticed that it says "Situation ARYM" up there.
In English it would be "Situation FYROM".
This is none other than the country of Macedonia, whose neighbours are refusing it its name.
It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
FYROM and ARYM are in fact temporary aids and should soon be consigned to the dustbin of history.
We welcome the formation of the all-party coalition and hope that it will succeed in moving towards ethnic cohabitation.
We hope that none of the parties will pursue separatist or nationalistic agendas.
