As regards the common space of freedom, security and justice, I should like to draw your attention to the signing of an agreement between Europol and the Russian Ministry of the Interior.
This is a significant confirmation of our joint determination to press ahead with implementation of the plan of action against organised crime.
In the same context, we were also pleased to record the start of talks at a technical level on issues relating to the liberalisation of visa requirements, and took note of the willingness of both sides to introduce measures to relax the requirements for the issuing of visas under the existing legislation.
We also underscored the importance of rapid conclusion of the Readmission Agreement.
The meeting gave the European Union the opportunity to confirm its conviction that internal security is complementary to justice and respect for human rights, and that the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia continues to be based on shared values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression.
As regards the common space of external security, the joint declaration on cooperation in the area of crisis management was a clear sign of the willingness of the European Union and the Russian Federation to work together in this area of vital interest for Europe.
I believe that this, too, should be recorded as one of the successes of the Rome Summit as regards the creation of a common space of external security.
The Russian proposal for closer cooperation in the field of civil protection and the management of natural disasters will be considered in more detail and converted at the earliest possible date into agreements that will enable the Union and Russia to cooperate and strengthen their joint response to future emergencies.
An initial step may be the establishment of direct contact between the competent bodies in Brussels and Moscow.
The possibility of similar cooperation is also to be explored by the relevant multilateral bodies in relation to weapons of mass destruction.
As regards the common space of research and education, the Summit opened a new chapter in bilateral cooperation, which had been bolstered by the Russian Federationâs joining the Bologna Process, an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism promoting agreements in the field of the mutual recognition of academic qualifications and the harmonisation of university curricula.
The Bologna Process paves the way for forms of effective intergovernmental cooperation in the field of the harmonisation of academic qualifications, which is an initial step towards the creation of a common space for university teaching.
Moreover, the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation will make it possible for the Russians to take part in European research programmes.
Lastly, the question was explored of the functioning of the Permanent Partnership Council, with the aim of finding a solution based on the values of efficiency and flexibility that reconciles Russiaâs desire for discussions of greater depth and reach in matters of common interest with the principle that the decision-making processes of the EU must remain autonomous.
I hope that, by building on this foundation, we shall soon be able to reach an agreement that will make it possible to put the Permanent Partnership Council into operation.
As regards international issues, in addition to the debates imposed by current events in Iran, Iraq and the Middle East, on which the two sides are in broad agreement and essentially share the same goals, we also raised the question of the situation in Moldova, in particular, on account of a number of imminent deadlines relating to the Transnistria crisis in which the Russian Federation has a crucial role to play: the definitive withdrawal of Russian military hardware by 31 December, and progress in the five-way negotiations and in the work of the Constitutional Committee responsible for drafting a new model of state for Moldova.
We believe that Russia should honour its commitment punctually, without any further postponements.
Russia confirmed the undertaking to withdraw, but observed that, since the negotiations for the resolution of the Transnistria crisis had made little headway, further endeavours would be needed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I think I can say that the Rome Summit was not altogether easy but it was an important moment in the consolidation of our overall relationship with the Russian Federation and enabled us to make progress in the creation of the four common spaces.
It was certainly a valuable occasion for an extensive exchange of views on international issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the preparatory political dialogue for this summit, which took place on 28 October in Moscow, I considered it necessary and right to describe the state of our relations as follows: we have very many action plans but hardly any action.
We have grand strategies but small deeds.
We have visions but little practice.
That is my assessment, and the Russian side agreed with it.
The common intent that came out of that preparatory meeting was to become rather more practical in our relations and perhaps to develop fewer great new ideas, but instead to try for once actually to put into practice the ideas we already have.
I agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council has already said here.
In that respect, the Rome Summit was really almost the beginning of a new form of cooperation because really very precise and clear results were achieved.
Of course, the summit in many respects confirmed the complexity of relations between the European Union and Russia.
We reaffirmed the interest of both sides in fostering long-term integration by creating a number of common spaces both within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and in the context of the Wider Europe initiative.
I think it is very important that the concept of the common economic space was given really concrete form at the summit and that the High Level Group was in fact able to make concrete proposals, such as the start of a common programme for the approximation of laws and facilitation of trade.
That will now be put into practice very quickly and will be made easier by Russiaâs impending accession to the WTO, which we anticipate for 2004.
The Commission is very much in favour of Russia joining the WTO, not least in order to drive forward and consolidate economic reform in Russia.
We have extended the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, seeing it as one of the most important factors for the growth of our cooperation, building on Russiaâs significant scientific and research capacities.
Russia is also becoming increasingly involved in European Union initiatives to promote cooperation in research and education.
The President-in-Office of the Council has already drawn attention to the signing of the agreement between Europol and the Russian interior ministry.
The Commission welcomes that because it will encourage cooperation in fighting terrorism and organised crime.
There will be a joint declaration on cooperation in political and security matters.
Those are quite clearly areas of common interest.
We have also, however, seen that there are things that separate the European Union and Russia today and that there are subjects on which we need to intensify our efforts in order to make progress and arrive at common results.
I will begin with environmental problems.
It is quite clear that we need to do more to deal with common challenges jointly such as climate change.
So far as the Kyoto Protocol is concerned, I see the situation roughly as follows. It is probably realistic to assume that progress in Russiaâs preparation for when it will sign the Kyoto Protocol will run parallel to its progress on joining the WTO.
Although there is no formal link, it is quite realistic to think that there will be some parallelism between the two processes.
It is also most important that we should be able to reach agreement on matters of safety for maritime shipping and of nuclear safety.
The Commission sees a need for talks concerning Russiaâs OSCE obligation to withdraw troops from Transnistria by the end of this year and on extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the acceding Member States.
So far as Transnistria in particular is concerned, I think we can expect significantly more pressure from Russia to get OSCE policy implemented.
In the matter of , the freezing of a large proportion of shares has created much instability and uncertainty on financial markets, and the Commission has made clear, both in the political dialogue in Moscow and at the summit in Rome, that the Russian authorities must in every case apply the laws fairly and without discrimination, observing the principle of proportionality.
In relation to Chechnya, we found that the security situation there has deteriorated further since the constitutional referendum in March and the presidential elections in October.
The European Union has issued two statements expressing its concern about allegations of ballot rigging.
The facts make clear that a political solution to the problem has still not been found.
We will continue to press for a more workable political solution, but that will not be possible without full respect for human rights.
That also includes those responsible for serious human rights violations being called to account.
For obvious reasons, the Commission raised the question of humanitarian aid both in the political dialogue and at the summit and noted that humanitarian aid is being hampered by the fact that our personnel are unable to be active on the ground.
Talks on this subject have not resulted in a satisfactory outcome as yet.
I would like to stress, however, that the Commission still considers it a priority to be present in the region itself with its resources and personnel in order to be able to provide assistance when and where it is needed.
We are, after all, the largest provider of humanitarian aid in this conflict.
What conclusions can we draw from all this?
Firstly, if we want to build a genuine strategic partnership, the European Unionâs policy towards Russia must be balanced and consistent.
Selecting topics that are only to the advantage of one partner is not a sufficient basis for a strategic partnership.
Secondly, we must also try to ensure that the Member States and the Union as a whole pursue jointly defined objectives.
Questions of visa policy and of a readmission agreement that we want to conclude with our partner Russia ought to be discussed as a common objective under the Unionâs umbrella.
Let me be perfectly clear: I do not think it is helpful when individual Member States pursue their own policies with Russia in these matters before we have a common policy.
Thirdly, relations between the Union and Russia are of the utmost importance for the future of both partners.
We must not allow initiatives that would be to the advantage of both sides, such as extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or cooperation in fighting crime and in environmental matters, to come to grief because of bureaucratic obstacles.
It is therefore very important for the European Union and Russia to call the Permanent Partnership Council into being in order to intensify cooperation between respective ministers.
Fourthly and lastly, we should place particular stress on developing a tailored concept, together with Russia as part of our new neighbourhood policy, which will give expression to the importance of the special relationship and the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia and provide the space to substantially improve and deepen that relationship.
I am pleased to be able to say in conclusion that talks have shown that Russia is willing to cooperate in the context of the European Unionâs new neighbourhood policy and that we can therefore meaningfully combine our existing strategy with the new neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following European Union enlargement on 1 May 2004 we will have an additional frontier with Russia, not only through Finland, but also through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and our relations with Russia will be even more important.
We are very clear when we say that we want to seek a strategic partnership with Russia, because we know that relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for peace and stability on our continent in the twenty-first century.
I would like to thank my fellow Member Arie Oostlander most sincerely for negotiating a text with the other groups.
We have here a text from six groups that reflects our opinion.
We expressly recognise the progress that Russia has made on the road to democracy, but it is also a sign of partnership that the deficits we see are addressed openly.
The President-in-Office has spoken of the elections in Russia, and elections can only take place if society is free from fear.
Elections can only take place if people have enough information.
Elections can only take place if the political system is fair.
Elections can only take place where there is the rule of law.
That is where there are deficits.
We have reports that Russian citizens are afraid to protest when they find the state behaving wrongly.
In our legal order, it is taken for granted that we can protest against any administrative act, at whatever level.
That is why it is important for democratic development in Russia and for stability in Russia â stability is unthinkable without freedom, without democracy â that Russia should make progress in making democracy and the rule of law a reality.
Chechnya is an open wound in Europe, not just in Russia.
We must insist that the Chechen people are not equated with terrorists or bandits, but that the Chechen people are granted autonomy within the Russian Federation, as is the case with Tatarstan, for example.
It would be a tragedy if, in the necessary fight against terrorism in the world â and we are resolutely for the fight against terrorism â, the Chechen people were ultimately to pay the price of terrorism.
I say quite calmly, but my words are addressed to the Council and the Commission, that if we hold a summit with Russia and issue a declaration, then the most important topical issue cannot be left out of the official document.
My plea for the future is therefore that we do this, and I expressly acknowledge that the Council Presidency said something about it in its statement of 8 October.
However, it is also important that we agree on a common policy and therefore on a formulation when meeting with the Russian president.
We support the inclusion of Russia in the Bologna process.
We need scientific and cultural exchange with Russia to prevent Russia turning away from Europe as it has often done in its history.
We want partnership, we want a Russia that is turned towards Europe, and we must include young people in particular here.
We urge Russia finally to sign and ratify the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia and we promise our future Member States Estonia and Latvia support in that, because their concerns are our concerns, the concerns of the European Union.
We call upon Russia finally to take the necessary steps.
We want to be Russiaâs partner, and if we criticise one thing or another, we do so because we want to see democracy made a reality in Russia and because we want to live in peace, friendship and partnership with the Russian people.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is becoming an ever more important partner of ours and that importance is increasing all the time.
Russian culture is perhaps Russiaâs greatest asset, and yet we know little about it.
It is a major asset for Europe.
My group is worried by the situation in Chechnya, and it does not seem to be improving.
We are in favour of the political solution that Moscow also supports, but the results still seem poor.
We fear a civil war and that the conflict will spread outside Chechnya, to a region where there are already any number of good reasons for a conflict.
We want the Russians to know that this is harming the development of relations between us and that is a big issue.
We demand the implementation of human rights.
Should there not be a joint Chechnya conference?
We need aid organisations here quickly.
We do not know very much about the case, at least not everything, but the method of arrest gives cause for alarm.
What we think is important is that laws are obeyed and that openness, which is vital, is practised, but, of course, we know that there is a lot of shady business going on in the transfer of Soviet property into the hands of just a few and crimes have been committed.
Membership of the World Trade Organisation is very important, as is acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol.
Both these will help not just Russiaâs development but the growth of its democracy.
We also need cooperation on energy; that is the toughest sort of cooperation and the most important.
In my opinion, we should combine our transport, telecommunications and energy networks with theirs.
This would be the deed of the decade and would create a solid basis for cooperation between us.
Â Â  Mr President, when Peter the Great wanted to make Russia more Western, he dressed up the Russian aristocracy in Western European clothes and moved the capital of Russia westwards from Moscow to St Petersburg.
President Putin's westward-looking government has described the European Union as its 'natural political partner', and until recently Russia has appeared to dress in the clothes of Europe: the clothes of free trade, the clothes of political and civil rights, the clothes of infant democracy.
The ELDR Group welcomed this EU-Russia summit.
We are right to look for political and economic spaces where our two societies can work together.
Under the right circumstances, we welcome closer economic relations between the European Union and Russia.
Easier travel is a necessary and important part of making this work.
Russia and the Union share a common security environment and a high degree of mutual interdependence, so we are right to seek to make our joint borders more secure and our shared hemisphere more safe.
We welcome Russia's ambitions to join the WTO and this may be possible, even if it is made more difficult by recent events.
However, Europe is right to rail against Russian repression and governmental meddling in the lives of its neighbours.
The issue of Chechnya will not go away, nor will Russia's refusal to ratify Kyoto.
It is not enough to wear the clothes of Europe.
Closer relations should carry the price of full subscription to modern European values, and at the very least we must continue to be critical and frank.
At this summit, Mr President-in-Office, our position was badly compromised by those charged with representing us.
The presidency's ill-considered comments on Chechnya and on the arrest and detention of Mikhail Khodorkovsky were out of line.
MrÂ Berlusconi speaks for Europe and he should choose his words with care.
His own presidency drafted a declaration last month that was strongly critical of Russian conduct in Chechnya.
However, not only was there no reference to Chechnya in the summit communiquÃ©, but the President of the Council even thought it appropriate to contradict Europe's affirmed position with an improvised display of bluster worthy of a cheap lawyer.
In any case, why should we deny the difficulties of the Russian minorities in the Baltic states?
They are nothing compared to the persecution of the Chechens.
Internal security may be complementary to justice and human rights, as the President-in-Office said, but as practised in Chechnya it is not.
We have condemned Russian action in Chechnya and the attempt to intimidate sources of political opposition in Russia for good reason.
Despite their European clothes, it is not clear that Mr Putin's government shares our values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of expression.
If it does, why is Mr Khodorkovsky in jail?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am very pleased about todayâs debate within our Parliament on the latest summit between the European Union and Russia.
This is, in a sense, a response to the declarations issued by MrÂ Berlusconi on Chechnya at the end of the summit, declarations that justified the Russian policy of military intervention in the region.
Such statements do not reflect the positions agreed by the Fifteen, and my group vigorously condemns these declarations.
Europe has expressed its disagreement with this justification, but can that be considered enough?
I do not think so.
I deplore the very relative importance accorded by the Council and the Commission to the issue of Chechnya, as well as the lukewarm nature of the condemnations of the Kremlin during the summit.
Daily life in Chechnya is still an ordeal for the civilian population. Lack of security, disappearances and human rights violations for which the Russian military forces are responsible continue with complete impunity.
Over and over again, Moscow uses the fight against terrorism as an argument for justifying everything.
That is unacceptable, even if it is, of course, necessary strongly to condemn the attacks by groups of Chechen extremists.
In the opinion of the independent NGO observers, the would-be democratic election held on 5Â October was a sham.
My group questions the legitimacy of such a consultation, aimed solely at convincing the international community that the situation in the region has been normalised and that the people have been able to exercise their sovereignty.
In fact, there is no such sovereignty.
It is a matter of urgency that the EU should finally condemn Russia, clearly and in no uncertain terms, for its handling of the war in Chechnya.
It will not be possible for the reconstruction of this wounded country to begin until after the Russian forces have withdrawn and full peace has been brought to the region.
Only genuine political negotiations may enable the way to be opened to a process of democratisation and reconstruction, in which Europe must play a major role by exercising much stronger pressure upon Russia.
Why not in the framework of the partnership agreements?
Another possibility might consist in supporting the UNâs provisional administration plan in Chechnya.
Such an attitude should not be interpreted as going against Russia or the development of the partnership between the European Union and Russia but, instead, as placing ourselves at the service of a peace and security awaited by both peoples.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think that, when we talk of Russia, we are all obliged to turn something of a blind eye, or I at least have the impression that, since the fall of the Wall and the collapse of the Soviet regime, everyone feels obliged to turn a blind eye.
At the time, we were very pleased about the democratic development under MrÂ Yeltsin, and we obviously did not see the unbelievable corruption developing in Russia.
Today, we are very pleased about the advances under MrÂ Putin, and we do not see the deliberate farce of the media monopoly.
I shall not for the moment talk about the arbitrary arrests and of Chechnya, to both of which I shall return at the end of my speech.
Why are matters like this?
Because the fact is that Russia is a huge power at our borders, and no one knows exactly how to take the bull by the horns, all the more so because everyone wants to have Russia on its side.
MrÂ Poettering, I know it is difficult to criticise oneâs friends when they make mistakes.
You knew, moreover, how it pained me to see my Foreign Minister constantly beside MrÂ Putin defending a just position concerning Iraq.
In other words, the Chechens were sacrificed for Iraq.
On the other hand, it is obvious that the Americans were doing exactly the same thing.
If the Americans said âyesâ to Iraq, it is because the Chechens no longer interested them either.
It is therefore the same situation on both sides.
I believe there is a fundamental problem here.
If we believe â on the pretext that we need, as indeed we do, a strategic link with the Russians â that we have to indulge them, then we are mistaken.
We are mistaken, moreover, because the results will never be commensurate with what we expect.
We say âyesâ to the democratic process in Russia, but when extremely significant problems arise and the President in charge of Europe is happy to say to MrÂ Putin, âBut what you are doing in Chechnya is fine; your arresting people is not a problem; as for the media monopoly, that too is fineâ, then the evil has been done, notwithstanding the host of resolutions you may subsequently produce.
Moreover, the evil has been done for a long time to come, because no one in Russia will dream of saying, âYes, that is true.
There is the European Parliament.
Yes, that is true, there is MrÂ Verheugen and the Commissionâ.
These things do not count, because they know that, when problems arise, the need to manage them will carry the day. âWe need you, MrÂ Putin.â
To summarise, any fuss made by Parliament and the Commission does not bother them, which means that, when it comes down to it, the situation in Russia will not change.
That is why I tell you that, if we do not clearly denounce the massacre of a whole people that is being organised in Chechnya, MrÂ Putin will never listen to us.
When MrÂ Putin moralises, perhaps with good reason, about Iraq, he does not think about what we are saying, because it is of no consequence to him.
He is using Iraq as a tool, as he needs to use everything as a tool, in order to establish his power in Russia: a totalitarian power.
Â Â  â Mr President, Paragraph 10 of the joint resolution is close to my heart.
In it, Parliament has asked the Council and the Commission once again to take the fate of Arjan Erkel, the abducted staff member of , to heart.
His father has visited me, and many other fellow MEPs, here in Strasbourg.
Let us put ourselves in his heartrending situation.
I have three children of my own.
This is why I am totally behind Parliamentâs urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to emphatically urge the Russian authorities to provide a clarification of this long-lasting abduction, which has now lasted for more than 460 days, and to sort this matter out.
Last night, an authoritative Dutch paper reported that in the Council meeting of the Foreign Ministers, some harsh words were being exchanged about the Italian Presidency protecting President Putin.
I am very pleased to hear it.
I also welcome the newspaper report to the effect that the Council has agreed to Commissioner Pattenâs proposal to set down in writing an unambiguous policy for the EUâs relations with the Russian Federation.
Needless to say, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am highly intrigued by the way in which the Council mandates the European Commission to make a recommendation to it concerning EU-Russia relations.
Does the Commission have any idea when we can look forward to its ideas taking effect?
One thing with regard to the Chechen tragedy is evident: on no account can this be described as providing a basis for common values shared by the European Union and Russia.
Similarly, the case is causing us great concern.
When high representatives of the European Institutions attempt to cover up, or even justify, these two situations, they encourage the Kremlin to follow the wrong political course.
This does not at all serve the interests of Russian society, or those of the European Union, for that matter.
In short, Moscow should not be left in any doubt about what Brussels exactly stands for in the mutual relationship, including where the European Union has its priorities: a good neighbourly relationship which presupposes joint action with regard to problems such as cross-border crime, nuclear risks and illegal migration; the promotion of human rights and the constitutional state, as well as urgent improvement of the nigh hopeless situation in Chechnya; joint action with regard to so-called âfrozen conflictsâ in the southern Caucasus and a solution to the issue of Transnistria; deepening and broadening complementary trade and economic interests.
True European commitment should be met by Russian reciprocity.
Putin and his cronies will therefore need to abandon the traditional attitude of wanting to operate both within and outside of the partnership.
You cannot be in it and out of it at the same time.
This should, above all, be the clear message from Brussels to Moscow at this time.
Â Â  â Mr President, the approach that Mr Berlusconi has taken to this issue of human rights and the need for Russian politics to adapt to the canons of our concept of democracy has been dictated, I believe, not just by deeply-felt ideals, which we all share, but also by a healthy realism and a strategic view of European interests, if we adopt General De Gaulleâs prophetic vision of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals.
Indeed, from a strategic viewpoint, how could we not recognise that it is in the vital interests of the Russian Federation, a country that we all regard as an essential partner for the European Union, to stabilise a region that is crucial as regards access to the oil from the Caucasus?
It is certainly no coincidence that the Chechen guerrillasâ primary target is not Russian military posts but the infrastructure of the oil industry.
It is fair to ask, therefore, what interests, apart from ethno-religious motives, lie behind Chechen terrorism and what drives them on.
Should we not think about the danger posed by the constantly smouldering fuse of the most aggressive and extremist armed factions of international Islamic fundamentalism?
Is it or is it not true that, in November 1998 in Islamabad, the eighteenth assembly of the Islamic Group of Pakistan indicated Chechnya as one of the main axes for the worldwide , together with other areas like Kosovo?
As for human rights, I would remind you that one need only download the images disseminated throughout the world by Osama bin Ladenâs networks from the Internet to see the severed heads of Russian soldiers.
This, too, is a matter of human rights, if I am not mistaken.
Â Â  â Mr President, how can one not share in the commitment to defend human rights or to uphold the right of peoples to self-determination?
How can one not defend the right of the Chechen people to express their own opinion?
That is why I stand behind the words of the President-in-Office of the Council and support the position of the European Peopleâs Party.
Nevertheless, although I endorse the general thrust of the compromise resolution on which this House is to vote tomorrow, I cannot agree on one point, where it gives a specious and inaccurate interpretation of the position expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union â something that a few Members have also done in this House.
The truth is not what is maintained in this report; the truth is not what Mr Watson has said or what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said; the truth is what the GUE/NGL Members have said.
I refer back to the well-known press conference that has been mentioned, because it is only fair that we should also remember what the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Putin, said, to the effect that during the talks, the awkward questions and the doubts about our policy came from Mr Berlusconi himself.
This was written by an agency that is certainly not in line with the governmentâs positions.
The press agencies still maintain that it was the Italian Prime Minister who raised the Chechen question.
I therefore believe that what happened at the summit should be interpreted very carefully and accurately, especially the spirit and willingness that characterised the efforts of the current Presidency of the European Union.
Any other interpretation will be open to use for political ends, especially within Italy.
Â Â  â Mr President, let me begin with three statements: the war in Chechnya is not Mr Putinâs private affair; the war in Chechnya is not a war against terrorism; and the war in Chechnya still spawns daily acts of violence on a massive scale against the human rights of the civil population.
We can only talk to President Putin about advancing the partnership between the European Union and Russia on the basis of these three premises.
For this reason, we strongly support the criticism contained in the resolution on which Parliament will vote tomorrow directed at the current President-in-Office of the European Union, for the inadmissible statements made by Mr Berlusconi supporting Mr Putinâs policy in Chechnya.
These statementsÂ âÂ and I am addressing the under-secretary, Mr Antonione â were utterly unacceptable and totally devoid of any connection with the policy expressed by the European Union up to now.
As Mr Poettering has reminded us, the European Union regards Chechnya as an open wound.
Mr Berlusconiâs affinities and personal friendships cannot and must not jeopardise the rigor with which Europe must demand that President Putin put an immediate end to the abuses and violence in Chechnya and seek a political solution to that conflict.
Mr President, 3000 deaths since the beginning of the year, 300 people missing, 50 mass graves discovered and elections known to be a farce: this is the balance of the war in Chechnya, and a story of long-standing impunity: the Italian Presidency really ought to call President Putin to account over this.
We would have expected some words of regret from Mr Antonione about what has happened and some plain speaking about what will happen in future.
We note, Mr President, that these words have not yet come.
Â Â  Mr President, despite the progress that has been made, our relationship with Russia still seems to be burdened with mistrust, as we have heard in this Chamber.
If we are seeking integration and a peaceful Europe, we will not be able to do it without, let alone against, Russia.
Russia is and will remain an important political, economic and military factor in the world.
We need cooperation, not confrontation.
Russia could be an even more effective strategic partner and good neighbour if the EU states would look beyond supplies of oil and natural gas and if the EU would do more to help strengthen economic and social stability, which are essential if democracy is to take shape and develop in a country.
The problem of Chechnya is a serious one, but there is only a political solution and we ought to show more commitment in achieving one.
If the USA has a strategic interest in maintaining tension on Russiaâs southern borders, that is its own affair.
It cannot be in the interests of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that none of us questions the strategic importance of the European Union-Russia relationship.
What we are criticising â and our criticisms are directed at both the Council and the Commission, which have both been pressing ahead with the same policy â is an uncritical policy towards Russia, a thoroughly blind policy that does not see the decline in the freedom of the press, which does not see the decline in the independence of the judiciary â the case of Mr Khordokovsky is a clear example â a policy that pretends that a little country called Chechnya just does not exist.
Has there not been a massacre in Chechnya?
Two hundred and fifty thousand people â how often do we have to say this? â out of one million people equals extermination and something very close to genocide.
This is not tolerable; it is not tolerable that the Commission has not had the courage to send its Commissioner for humanitarian aid to Chechnya and that Mr Prodi has not been there either.
There is something I must say, and I hope Mr Antonione will pass it on to Mr Berlusconi: it is unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi should call that a myth, and I think many in this Parliament and in the European Union expect Mr Berlusconi to correct what he has said when he comes to this House during the next part-session in December.
What is at stake is the dignity of the dead and of those who are still alive in Chechnya, and the dignity of this Parliament and of the whole European Union and its citizens.
As for the future, we can do what we did for Yugoslavia: pretend that the Caucasus issue does not exist.
The Chechnya problem is a colonial problem and must be resolved as such.
What is happening in Chechnya is infinitely worse than what was done in Algeria and in so many other countries in Africa.
The way forward, then, is for Chechnya to join the European Union, and for Georgia, which is another strategic part of the European Union, to join too.
This should be the programme carried forward by the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  â Mr President, Parliament has, in the past, adopted a two-track policy with regard to Russia, and it has done so with total conviction.
This translates, on the one hand, into cooperation, where possible, across the board, particularly in all the areas where it can help bring about the cultural change in Russia in order to move towards a constitutional state and more democratic relations.
This also, however, entails criticism, where necessary.
This is why we must state our opinions in no uncertain terms.
This policy, therefore, embraces not just one, but both elements.
Listening to the President-in-Office of the Council, I have to say that we in this House have already achieved many of the things he lists, and now they are again included in the resolution.
Why is it that you now sound so very different from what we remember from the summit?
What strikes me in particular, is that you have specifically mentioned Moldova, and the timeframe for the withdrawal of the troops.
You have also spoken about Arjan Erkel.
I am very indebted to you for raising this issue and bringing it here today.
That is extremely important.
From the press and your statement, however, it seems that Chechnya has not been given much attention.
You have given a justification for this.
Yet, this is very dangerous, for the public at large is interested in your summit meetings and wants to know what is on the agenda, whether the ideals and values of our European citizens have been mentioned and have determined your conduct.
This is why I would have preferred what you have stated here to also have been included in your statement.
We would probably also have responded in a slightly different way.
I have to say that I find the Commissionerâs approach very clear.
For a very long time, the Russians have insisted on a very specific and practical approach, preferring cash on the nail to grand ideas.
I think that the Russians are right in this, and that we, while continuing to adopt our two-track policy, can tackle very specific issues, particularly in the area of contacts among scientists.
Cooperation with Russia in that field has not always been easy.
In my opinion, however, this scientific cooperation is extremely important in the light of Russiaâs cultural change.
I hope, therefore, that the Council will continue along these lines and that the impression that has been created by a few personal remarks will soon change, for otherwise your presidency will be placed in a bad light.
Â Â  Mr President, it is more than three years since President Putin came to office and it is time to take stock.
What has happened since then?
The FSB secret service, the successor to the KGB and which Mr Putin once ran, is now three times larger than when President Putin came to office.
Politics has been increasingly neutralised.
The same is true of the media.
There are hardly any really independent large media left.
Now it seems to be the turn of business, to judge by the goings on surrounding the so-called oligarchies.
Those are serious danger signals in Russia itself.
Looking at Chechnya, we find that in 1999 Mr Putin unleashed the second Chechen war of the post-Soviet era, part of the most bloody election campaign in recent history, or in history at all.
This war has seen hundreds of thousands driven from their homes in Chechnya and tens of thousands murdered.
Many speak of almost one fifth of the Chechen population.
That would be as many as under Josef Stalin.
These are not trivialities, they are very serious events and Europe needs to be concerned with them, especially when an important partner is involved.
We all know that Russia cannot develop a Swiss democracy over night.
But Russia has set strict criteria for itself.
It has joined the Council of Europe.
It has entered into a special partnership with the European Union.
That means it has itself agreed to be judged by democratic standards and the rule of law and it must try to live up to those standards, but I fear it has increasingly failed to do so over the last few years.
Of course things are better today than in the days of totalitarianism, but we are currently witnessing a trend not to more but to less democracy and rule of law, as Yelena Bonner, the widow of our prize-winner Andrei Sacharov, has made clear.
So far as Chechnya is concerned, President-in-Office, I have only one thing to say: you are confining the Chechnya problem too much to the subject of terrorism.
The Italian word for what is essentially going on in Chechnya is not but .
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the contribution you have made to the discussion of this item on the agenda.
I think it is fair to underline the fact that all your speeches have touched on something which for us had been a major priority, the need to have a strategic relationship with Russia.
I believe this objective should be placed on record as a joint objective.
On the path we are treading to achieve this objective, I have noted and I appreciate the spirit of collaboration and the sincerity you have shown in your speeches, which highlight differing and critical positions on how to reach our destination.
I should like to point out the aspect which for me is the most important and most positive of all: it is, I repeat, having a strategic relationship with the Russian Federation, in view of its importance for the European Union.
I shall, of course, make sure I pass on all your observations, contributions and even criticisms, which will form an important store of information not only for our own work but also in general for the Council as a whole.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(2) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0378/2003) by Pasqualina Napoletano, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on 'Wider Europe Neighbourhood: A New Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours (COM(2003) 104 2003/2018(INI)).
Â Â  .â Mr President, this report deals with three Commission communications: the first has the title âWider EuropeÂ -Â Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours'; the second is the communication entitled 'Paving the way for a new neighbourhood instrument'; and the third is 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partnersÂ -Â Strategic guidelinesâ.
In Parliamentâs view, this new policy must involve the 25 countries of the Union as it will be soonÂ - in other words, those with which, on whatever basis, full integration with the Union has now been agreed, although at different timesÂ - and our eastern and southern neighbours.
This is a coherent proposal applying to a complex geopolitical area stretching from Russia to Morocco, which, on the basis of its history, cultural relations and geographic proximity, may be defined as a pan-European and Mediterranean region.
It is in this context that Parliament proposes soon to include the south-eastern dimension in this policy, that is, the countries of the Caucasus, and to look a little further in that direction at the other Middle Eastern countries, which cannot yet be included in this strategy.
The report concentrates on the policies to be developed, as we believe that these policies should serve today, for the present time, first and foremost to build a common security area, provided we do not think of security only in military terms.
Indeed, we are delighted that relations with neighbouring countries have been placed as the first item in the new security strategy submitted by the High Representative for European security, because our security is their security and this is an area that we can build together.
Alongside this, there are a wealth of relationships to build, which should lead us to share with the countries in question mutually beneficial policies founded on a political and institutional dialogue that is backed up with appropriate instruments.
The report thus establishes a clear distinction between this strategy and that of future enlargement, confirming without any ambiguity the decisions to close the negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria by 2007, to assess by 2004 the possibility of opening negotiations with Turkey, and the prospect of accession for all the Balkan countries.
We do not hide the fact in this report that there are other countries, such as Ukraine and Moldova, which make no secret of their aspirations to become members of the European Union.
Even though this is not the strategy that will decide their admission, we maintain that taking part in this strategy can only bring this prospect closer and will certainly not make it less likely.
The report also looks closely at the specific features of such a vast, diverse, complex area.
Russia was being discussed just now, and the document expresses our awareness that relations with Russia cannot be confined merely to a neighbourhood relationship.
You will find one paragraph, however, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy had no hesitation in adopting, where the problems of democracy and the tragedy of Chechnya are highlighted as currently being obstacles to the normalisation of our relations.
Lastly, the Action Plans provide the Commission with a flexible instrument for establishing multilateral, regional and bilateral relations with these countries, just as the cross-border instrument will serve not to build walls along the new frontiers but to achieve an understanding and an enhancement of the local dimension.
The institutional question is also addressed in the report.
These countries certainly cannot and should not share the Unionâs institutions, but we insist that, in a dialogue between equals, there must be a place for governments, parliaments, local authorities and society itself, and the report includes recommendations to this effect.
We also call for the human rights policy to be fully incorporated into this strategy.
We believe, however, that there is as yet no fixed European policy on this subject, even though the Commissionâs communication makes useful proposals and represents a step forwards.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is working with the European Commission on developing a series of new initiatives addressed to the eastern and southern neighbours of the enlarged European Union within the framework of the âWider Europeâ initiative.
These initiatives, which will be taken forward alongside the existing instruments for relations with these countries, will be tailored to fit the specific circumstances of each country concerned.
Since the beginning of the year, and even more so during our six-month term of office, the Presidency has been actively following the development of the European Union's new strategic approach to its neighbours to the east and on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
I will, of course, leave it to the Commission to illustrate the potential of this initiative in greater detail; my own intention here is just to make some brief points.
On 11 March, the Commission adopted the communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled âWider Europe â Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighboursâ, which describes the new series of neighbourhood policies that the enlarged European Union should adopt with the countries sharing its direct land and sea borders.
This is the new concept of a âring of friendsâ by which the Union offers, essentially, to share âeverything but the institutionsâ.
The communication also describes the possible measures that could be made available to neighbouring countries as incentives to adopt and apply the necessary reforms that would enable them to benefit from access to the European Union's internal market.
The new neighbourhood policy will be implemented through national and/or regional Action Plans adopted by the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal. These plans should contain specific objectives and benchmarks, in addition to an implementation timetable for the progressive application of the measures for participation in the internal market.
This will enable the Union to assess the practical implementation of these measures periodically. To do this, it will apply an ongoing monitoring mechanism to verify whether the conditions are being fulfilled and to assess the progress made by each individual country towards achieving the objectives set by the new policy, as well as the effectiveness of the Community instruments.
In the future, these Action Plans could become the main policy instruments for the Unionâs external relations with these countries, and could eventually replace the common strategies adopted thus far.
On the basis of the work carried out by the Commission and the Council, as the rapporteur has reminded us clearly, these last few months of 2003 will be devoted to the preparation of the Action Plans.
In January and February 2004, a series of exploratory consultations will be held with the interested countries, on the basis of which by the end of spring 2004 the Commission will finalise the draft Action Plans for submission to the Council for Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel.
The Action Plans that will be put to consultation with the third countries will include five elements: enhanced political cooperation, internal market, JHA cooperation, communication and environment networks and measures to facilitate people-to-people contacts.
One final point I would like to mention is that the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in Naples on 2 and 3 December will provide an important opportunity to take forward and develop the consultations with our southern neighbours.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has already informed Parliament in detail about the strategy and individual elements of the neighbourhood concept.
I do not want to repeat that today but rather to report to you on what has happened in the meantime.
Our neighbours have welcomed this initiative, all of them in fact: our East European neighbours, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and our Mediterranean neighbours.
We are already in more or less intensive contact with all of them with a view to achieving this initiativeâs objective.
The aim is to exhaust the potential for cooperation as much as possible while stopping short of membership, specifically in the field of economic cooperation, which we interpret very widely.
I must make clear to you that the Commissionâs ideas for the long term extend far beyond the idea of a free trade area.
We envisage being able to incorporate individual countries fully into our system of economic integration, including the four freedoms: movement of capital, movement of goods, movement of services and movement of persons.
That will not happen with every country simultaneously.
For some it will take longer than others, but I am confident that ultimately we really will have this large common economic area with more than a billion people and the European Union at the centre.
It is not just about economics, it is about the environment, it is about cooperation in domestic and legal policy for joint defence against dangers and threats and it is of course in return also about developing political, economic and social reforms in the countries with which we operate this strategy.
We are also expecting something from these countries.
We are not in a position to be only giving all the time, but we would like in return political and economic reforms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and protection for minorities, so that the whole area around us can achieve the same level of political and economic stability, and one day also prosperity, as the European Union itself.
I will say very precisely why.
Because we would be greatly deceiving ourselves if we believed that things can go well for us in the European Union in the long term if they do not go well for our neighbours.
It is therefore in our own interests to ensure that our neighbours can open up.
As I said, responses have been positive.
In Russia I spoke about it with the president, the foreign minister and many members of the government, the same in Ukraine, I have spoken with a number of foreign ministers from the Mediterranean countries and I will be visiting all of those countries before the middle of next year.
The Commission will be presenting concrete action plans for a whole number of countries to the Council by the middle of next year; compared with previous strategies, these will have the advantage of being joint action plans, negotiated documents, which we intend to implement jointly.
In that regard it has therefore begun quite well.
The Commission is also already working on the development of a financial instrument with which we shall also be able to underpin this neighbourhood strategy financially after 2006.
We shall after all have to be able to provide financial support for cross-border cooperation between our new Members and our new neighbours on the one hand and among the new neighbours on the other.
I am very grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report.
We are on the same wavelength.
I do still have concerns about one point, Mrs Napoletano, and I would ask you to think again whether it is really wise to say that Turkey and the western Balkan countries should be included in this initiative.
With regard to Turkey, I would like to say that Turkey would consider it an extraordinarily negative signal.
It would regard it as a downgrading if we were to say that a country which we are currently preparing for commencement of accession negotiations is now included in an initiative expressly intended for countries to which we have not extended any prospect of membership.
I must make that quite clear.
The countries included in this initiative are not considered prospective members, at least not for the foreseeable future, and in Turkeyâs case that would provoke an extraordinarily negative reaction and, Mrs Napoletano, would even endanger the reform process in Turkey.
I know you well enough to know that you certainly do not want our policy to halt the positive human rights developments in Turkey.
So please think this point over again.
As to how we should proceed, we agree that it is important that we should make clear to the public and to our neighbours what we can and what we cannot do.
We can ensure that enlargement does not create any new borders in Europe.
It would not help us at all to re-erect the iron curtain just a few hundred kilometres further east.
Neither would it help us, when the Mediterranean countries of Malta and Cyprus have joined the Union, to cut ourselves off from the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
We must offer as much cooperation as we can manage in the foreseeable future.
But we must also make clear, especially to Russia and Ukraine, that no doors are being closed here, that no unalterable decisions are being taken, but rather that a process is being set in motion which at some point will reach its goal.
Then it will be possible without more ado to set ourselves new objectives and reach out towards new horizons.
At any rate, I think it is very good â and I think we can be proud of it â that we now have an idea, perhaps for the very first time, of the political shape we want to give to Europe and its neighbourhood in the years ahead, that for the first time we have a clear strategic vision of what Europe is to look like and how it is to interact with its neighbours.
That at any rate is a great step forward.
I am extremely grateful to Parliament for being willing to go the way the Commission has proposed.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this communication is the Commissionâs response to the European Parliamentâs request to present its thoughts and ideas about new neighbours and privileged partnerships.
Many points are made, but essentially this is simply about applying the original idea behind the European Communities in a new context, namely identifying common interests to enable the Union and its neighbours to enjoy stability, respect human rights and to face future challenges together.
Commissioner Verheugen, you have just mentioned strategic visions and that is my first point.
We will also have to discuss again whether all of the visions in this paper are actually feasible and that is why we must not neglect to consider what is realistic and what will really happen in practice.
I should like to make it clear that there are a whole series of questions that the Committee on Budgets obviously wishes to clarify.
Before we initiate programmes, I think that we should consider how well the existing programmes, such as TACIS and MEDA, have worked.
I might for example remind you that we still have considerable outstanding commitments amounting to billions in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. This also prompts my question about how practicable the ideas are that have been put forward so far.
The communication explicitly mentions increased financial assistance, but we first need to know how it is envisaged to implement these programmes in practice, and I mean in each individual country, not in general.
I wish to make it clear that we support the proposal as part of this initiative to set up a New Neighbourhood Instrument to promote cross-border measures, which are proving problematic because of the different financing instruments that are currently used.
In addition, we have said that we think it would be appropriate if at least the CARDS part of funding under such a Neighbourhood Instrument could be financed for example under HeadingÂ 7.
On the basis of past experience, I think it is also important to explain in detail how the Action Plans recommended for each country differ from the Country Strategy Papers that we have today and in what respect they constitute greater added value.
I should like to make one final comment on the European constitution because we discussed it this morning: clearly, at all times in the procedure we must also ensure that Parliamentâs right to shape and decide on legislative and budgetary matters is respected when drafting these definitive strategies.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, may I first thank the rapporteur very warmly for being so willing to discuss, cooperate and compromise throughout the drafting of the report.
This also made it possible for the report to be adopted unanimously in the committee with just a few abstentions.
The enlarged EU needs to consider the practical implications of the new problems that will arise in connection with its eastern neighbours because of the new and longer external border.
We must also devote the same attention to the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
But devoting the same attention does not mean applying the same models of policies and instruments to both the East and the South, because the challenges are very different.
The States of North Africa are in general characterised by a lack of democracy, economic and structural problems, high levels of corruption, significant social tensions, high population growth and the danger of increasing Islamic fundamentalism.
As a direct consequence of this situation, together with the pitiful living conditions endured by the majority of the people there, we are forced to confront increasing illegal immigration and the danger of terrorist attacks.
A further consequence is that the potential for cooperation cannot be fully exploited.
We have of course already seen this with the resources that we enter in the budget for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA Programme, which remain unutilised.
It is important to extend the political dialogue with this region, amongst other things by including a parliamentary dimension, something with which we in Europe are of course already familiar in the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
My group therefore supports the proposal in this report to set up a parliamentary assembly of Mediterranean countries.
I am convinced that this has the potential to engender a new quality of political debate, which will deal with problems and situations of conflict openly and in a different way from the usual government negotiations.
To the east of the new external border, it is true that at first sight the problems appear to be similar: corruption, social tension and illegal trafficking in human beings.
The essential difference is, however, that these societies are avowedly in a continuing process of transformation; they see themselves as being in a transitional phase.
The path of most of these eastern neighbours will, if they so wish, lead to the EU, regardless of whether we have already officially acknowledged as much by conferring candidate status on them.
Contrary to North Africa, this does however give us an opportunity to exert greater influence to develop the rule of law and democracy, foster economic cooperation, extend the infrastructure by building trans-European networks and foster cross-border cooperation, which facilitates the everyday lives of people living on both sides of the border.
I was rather surprised that the President-in-Office mentioned unprompted the four market freedoms yet again.
I would expect this from the Commission, because it is of course in the Commission communication itself, but I had thought that the discussion in the Council would have moved on by now.
Sharing everything but the institutions essentially means that we are practically offering membership of the internal market without membership contributions.
In any case, I really cannot imagine â even as part of a very ambitious vision â our allowing freedom of movement for workers from North Africa.
At least not in my lifetime.
I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission not to awaken false hopes.
Let us not run before we can walk!
I therefore call on the Commission to implement its programme step by step and perhaps concern itself less with visions than with what it is actually possible to achieve in a manageable and realistic timeframe.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating Mrs Napoletano on the expert manner in which she has managed to marry the overall picture with the detail.
In the next few years, we in the European Union will have our hands full with the further enlargement through the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the integration of the new members from next year onwards, the development of new cohesion policy in the field of foreign and security policy and social market economy.
The speed of the actual integration will largely determine the discussion about where the EU borders will ultimately be.
It is therefore appropriate for this not to be the main theme of the present report and of the Commissionâs communication.
What is important now is to formulate policy for relations with our new neighbours for the next couple of years, and one thing should be paramount in this.
We must prevent a ring of instability from being formed around the enlarged European Union; we should, instead, create a circle of friends.
We do not want any new division.
This is why we must, from the outset, make Russia central to the new policy of good neighbourliness not only because of that countryâs not always equally positive impact on Minsk, Kiev and Chisinau, but also on account of the energy policy and, of course, because Russia is a nuclear power and a member of the UN Security Council.
When we set out the detail of the new policy of good neighbourliness, we should, as a guideline, adopt the values for which Europe stands â democracy, human rights and a functioning market economy, but this is not just about values.
It is important for the EU to extend the area where the same economic rules apply, where the campaigns against international crime and against terrorism are combined, where immigration issues are addressed and where borders are protected whilst remaining open.
This enlarged Europe must be a security community.
The Commissionâs proposals form a sound basis for formulating concrete policy with two core elements; more cross-border cooperation, and our neighboursâ participation in the important areas of EU policy, starting with trade.
Action plans form a good method of implementing this.
It is understandable that countries such as Moldavia and the Ukraine should ask why the Commissionâs plans avoid the issue of their possible EU membership.
My response to that would be that the EU now has its hands full with what is presently on the agenda, besides which such a membership application is not really in order at this moment.
Naturally, those countries have the right theoretically to apply for membership, in accordance with Article 49 of the current treaties, or Article 2 of the proposed constitution.
In principle, we should, of course, welcome the EU aspirations of many in those countries, for those are mostly the reformers.
What I would like to recommend to my friends in both countries, however, is to make optimum use of the opportunities which new EU policy is about to offer, and to work towards a level at which a credible discussion can be held about an association which can lead to possible membership.
We ourselves cannot, of course, give any guarantees, because the efforts will need to come from the countries themselves.
We should also, above all, be careful about setting any dates.
However, we should also ensure that the European Union does not labour under the illusion that Europe is becoming safer by slamming the door permanently shut.
In short, we should not raise any false expectations but we should not turn our backs on the East either.
Â Â  Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Napoletano on her wonderful work.
Europe has changed.
The map of Europe is growing and this means that we have new neighbours and we are faced with the need to create a policy for this enlarged Europe, the composition of which coincides with the Council of Europe, and also a policy of neighbourhood, and I will refer specifically to the policy which must be created in relation to the countries of the southern side of the Mediterranean.
This report does not talk about the free movement of people in the Mediterranean, but it is clear that we must establish cooperative relations with the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, which differ from us naturally in terms of demography and the level of income per capita, based on systems of cross-border cooperation, which can be summed up in four ideas: knowledge of our neighbours, understanding them, trusting them and then, when we trust each other, we will be able to establish cooperation and work together.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that the Commission communication touches on a very interesting issue and that Mrs Napoletano's report also has very good ideas and proposals.
Nonetheless, there is a general question which I think has also been touched on by other Members.
Can we reduce all the countries which surround us to the east and south to a common denominator?
Can we take the same approach to Russia, which is a major world power, as we take to countries such as Moldova, Armenia, Georgia or Azerbaijan, or as we take to the countries of northern Africa where, possibly, the main question we should raise is that of democratisation?
It is a serious question, just as the question of where Europe stops is a serious question.
Because I think Mr Verheugen was right to point out that, if we put the Western Balkans and Turkey in this category, these countries will obviously feel undervalued.
But I see that, in the proposal made by the Commissioner for external relations on the Ukraine, we are discussing the possibility of its future integration.
Why not Armenia?
Why not Georgia?
And why not even Russia, which is also in the area of the European Union and some governments have proposed as much?
That is why I fear this uniformity.
I think that we should find some common rules but, more importantly, that we should formulate global policies for the large entities around us.
I repeat that the countries of north Africa need to make a special effort on issues of democracy.
We have tolerated the violation of democracy and we have often supported it â remember events in Algeria and Egypt â due to our own strategic objectives and due to the wish for there to be stable regimes, whatever they may be.
As regards Egypt in particular, I want to say that there are a great many European citizens shut up in its gaols today and who are paying this price with their lives.
So I believe that we need to launch the issue of democracy for these countries.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the wider Europe strategy was a good idea.
This initiative is sensible and necessary, but it has been ill-conceived.
Commissioner, you know my views on this.
The wider Europe strategy is a mixture of the Barcelona Process and our plans for our eastern neighbours.
The result is a collection of instruments that in any case already exist, but there is no strategy â I would reiterate this â there is no big new idea, and that is what we need to structure our cooperation with our various neighbours, each of which has its own particular situation.
The neighbours that want to join the European Union themselves have been treated in just the same way as the countries of North Africa.
No consideration has been given to the real problems that 2004 will bring: the problems at the border, the fact that people are really worried about a new wall being erected, and the fact that there is already good cross-border cooperation there that is not being taken into account.
These regions are facing very many problems that stem from the last two world wars.
Individual groups are making huge efforts to restore understanding and then an initiative comes along that leaves them dumbfounded.
None of what is really needed in this region is included in this initiative.
I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you have acknowledged this failure, and the differentiation approach in the Commission document gives grounds for hope.
The New Neighbourhood Instrument also contains very good ideas.
I think it would be very useful if it could be in place before 2004 so that we can achieve what we need to achieve, which is to give hope to the people on the external border that they are not being forgotten.
In my opinion, general action plans are not enough here.
Above all, the Neighbourhood Instrument must be earmarked for cross-border cooperation, because that means something to the people on the ground.
In addition, a condition for inclusion in the neighbourhood concept as a whole must be to recognise and apply the democratic rule of law and to recognise human and minority rights.
All of the measures must take this into account.
I would refer here once more to Parliamentâs criticism of Russia.
The Chechnya problem is not a secondary issue.
It is the central problem in our relations with Russia.
Â Â  â I can only applaud the fact that in the framework of next yearâs enlargement, a policy of good neighbourliness is being developed.
If both our new eastern and southern neighbours can make progress in the field of economic development, security and human rights, this will ultimately be to our benefit.
Unfortunately, the proposed policy is somewhat vague in a number of essential, concrete points.
First of all, there is the issue of the common external borders and potential immigration problems.
The rapporteur hopes that the new Schengen borders will not constitute any barriers to trade, cultural exchange or regional cooperation.
This is a legitimate concern, but we must, above all, ensure that the concept as a whole does not spark off another immigration wave.
Given high unemployment and high social costs, that is probably the last thing we need.
If we see that, last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, declared in the Burkina Faso Parliament that a wider Europe entails that we, âfrom Moscow to Rabatâ â I am quoting him â will be sharing everything, apart from our institutions, then there is cause for concern.
The second problem is the position of Turkey, for during the discussion of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it transpired that the Commission does not envisage Turkey featuring in the policy of good neighbourliness, because it is an EU candidate.
That is, however, in conflict with the report, which clearly specifies that subsequent EU membership of the participating countries is not in any way ruled out.
It should, by now, be apparent to everyone that Turkeyâs chances of meeting the accession criteria next year are as good as non-existent.
Turkey is not a European country, but it is a friendly country and a military ally.
It is therefore of the utmost importance for our relations with Turkey to remain optimal and for that country to be included in the new policy of good neighbourliness from day one.
Â Â  â Mr President, this report by Mrs Napoletano is extremely important and we are pleased that certain amendments, including our own, that were adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have rounded it off and improved it further.
The role of the countries which are about to join the European Union is now crucial in promoting an effective neighbourhood policy with the countries that will remain outside our new borders.
Many of these countries also aspire to join the Union; not straight away, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, but the door is still open.
This neighbourhood policy certainly depends on us and on Brussels, but it also depends greatly on them.
As a rapporteur, I have paid close attention to Poland and I have seen how successive governments on the right and left have for years been using great initiative in addressing problems in their relations with neighbouring countries, particularly Ukraine, in the run-up to enlargement.
Many Members of this House have already mentioned problems such as cross-border traffic â local traffic that drives a considerable, albeit hidden and underground, economy â and the efforts that Poland has always made to keep Ukraine on its side, on our side, on the side of the West.
A short time ago, I was talking to some Polish colleagues who have been pursuing this policy in the Warsaw parliament.
In my view, Poland is an example of what the new countries should and will have to do so that those countries that remain outside Europeâs new borders will not feel excluded, as Mrs Napoletano has said.
I should also like to mention Moldova, perhaps the poorest country in Europe.
As the report points out, we are pursuing a rather inconsistent policy towards it.
We should help this country more, both economically and above all politically, to protect it from a growing and worrying Russian influence that is filtering in through the Transdniestrian enclave.
This is an appeal that we have heard from many friends that our group has in that country, and one that we very much hope will be answered.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should first like to say that MrsÂ Napoletanoâs report is quite excellent, not only because she is a member of my group, but also because she has put a great deal of work into the report.
I am also delighted that Commissioner Verheugen has taken over the wider Europe dossier, because I am convinced that he will oversee it just as successfully as he did enlargement itself.
The Commissioner touched on a key issue, namely how we should treat the candidate countries in this strategy, the countries that have a prospect of membership.
I understand his fears.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that the wording that we have chosen is right, and we can certainly continue to work on this.
This House is divided into three distinct camps on this issue.
There are those who say that this is our golden opportunity to bid a permanent, or at least prolonged, farewell to Turkey and perhaps also the Balkan countries as candidates and to push them into a different category.
And there is the Commissionerâs proposal to leave them out of this initiative.
MrsÂ Napoletanoâs report, that we adopted by a majority in the committee â we will of course see what the result of the vote is here in the House tomorrow â rules out neither one nor the other.
I understand what the Commissioner said, but we do not know what will be decided in 2004.
If, for example, we do not open negotiations with Turkey, then it would be in a different, perhaps even worse position than other countries, with whom we would be reinforcing the wider Europe concept of building good relations with our neighbours.
In the Balkans, which, like Turkey, I know very well, we have countries with whom we are not going to be able to talk about membership for years to come.
If, obviously on the basis of the Commissionâs work, we can together give Croatia a clear signal that we can negotiate â and I hope we can â then we are actually saying to all of the Balkan countries: there is nothing stopping you joining the European Union if you meet the same conditions as Croatia.
In the meantime, I think it would be very sensible â and this also supports MrsÂ Napoletano â for us to involve them in this initiative.
It may be possible to create a special status precisely for those countries that have definite membership prospects, so as to make it clear to them that the one does not exclude the other.
I fully support MrsÂ Napoletanoâs report, as it stands.
Â Â  â Mr President, after the votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Napoletanoâs report can surely be adopted by us all.
On the other hand, the report has become too broad in scope and too detailed.
The basic problem with it is the way it confuses concepts, which is due to the fact that the Commission has combined the Wider Europe policy and relations with our neighbours in the same initiative.
In practice the Wider Europe policy covers relations with our eastern neighbours which are in Europe.
Our southern neighbours on the other hand are the non-European countries of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has endeavoured to clarify concepts with its Amendments 15 and 16.
The Union would have a Wider Europe policy which would be supplemented by our policies known as the Northern and Southern Dimension.
The new Neighbourhood Policy and the new Neighbourhood Instrument would be implemented in respect of all our neighbours, in the east, south and north.
I hope these amendments will be adopted.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office, there are two points that we need to take into account here.
Firstly, we need to have good relations with our neighbours because it is in the interest of our foreign policy to do so.
Secondly, how can this be arranged so that it is commensurate with the interests and capacities of the European Union?
These two aspects need to be considered together.
We must realise, after all, that to a large extent everyone has their own here.
How can we develop an automatic procedure to bring these countries â or a number of these countries â almost directly into the European Union?
If we continue, covertly, to operate the system, then we will be well on the way to destroying the European Union, because the European Union cannot cope with this.
We are currently undergoing the arduous process of producing a constitution, which may just be capable of setting out a reasonable way to organise the internal affairs of a Union of 25 or 27 countries.
MrÂ Verheugen, what will we do with Turkey if it does not meet the conditions for opening negotiations in 2004?
Surely in that case we will have to make a second offer, alongside full membership, at least for a certain period of time.
That is why I think it is absolutely essential for the wider Europe concept to be improved in respect of our neighbouring countries in Europe, making it a âEuropean Economic Area plusâ.
This would create a second multilateral ring of countries with whom we maintain close relations, but where full membership is not the only option.
This consequence of a multilateral order has not so far been elucidated sufficiently clearly by the Commission.
We must ensure that this also includes those countries whose future may lie in the Union, but which will not be able to become members of the European Union in the next ten years, for whatever reason, and we must ensure that they are not left out.
This applies to some of the countries of the western Balkans, just as it does to Moldova, Ukraine or, for example, Turkey, if a decision of the kind that I have just described were to be made next year.
Obviously this also means that we need another strategy, but one that is equally weighty â I do not wish the Members from southern Europe to misunderstand us â for the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean countries.
The objective in this case is not to provide a possible opening to membership, but to forge a close neighbourly relationship of a different nature.
In any case, the discussions so far both in this House and in the Commission have lacked the necessary systematic approach that will make this a viable policy in practice.
Â Â  â Mr President, firstly I wish to congratulate MrsÂ Napoletano on her excellent work.
I am pleased that in her report she has treated the east and the south equally.
It is and must be in the interests of the EU to have balanced neighbourhood relations along all its external borders.
A major challenge for us is that we do not build a fortress around us whilst strengthening shared values and the workings of the internal market.
That is why the approach outlined in the communication on Wider Europe, with its emphasis on interdependence, is especially welcome.
We must not limit growth in prosperity just to the area within the Unionâs borders.
Promoting democracy, good governance, human rights and sustainable development in its neighbouring countries works to everyoneâs benefit.
On a practical level, border region cooperation will open up new opportunities for investment and innovation on both sides and will reinforce direct cooperation between people.
This will increase regional prosperity and stability.
We should follow the example set by forms of cooperation that work, such as that which exists between Finland and Russia, and for neighbourhood policy to actually get some wind in its sails we have to set aside adequate resources.
Â Â  Mr President, when the wider Europe neighbourhood concept was first floated, I was largely sceptical of the bunching together of countries as disparate as Libya and Russia in one document.
However, as the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur for the Ukrainian section, I now believe that sufficient differentiation has been achieved in Mrs Napoletano's report to produce a politically coherent document which provides a constructive approach through action plans for the challenges which lie ahead over the next five years as we digest the economic and political consequences of a Europe of 25 countries and as the EU borders move eastward.
I particularly welcome the recognition of Ukraine's potential for eventual membership and the mention of Article 49.
This could equally apply to Moldova, which is desperate to be given a helping hand by the EU to sort out the Transnistria question be granted access to the stabilisation and association process.
Russia will be key here and I welcome the recent summit which aims to develop our relations with the strategic partner country through a series of four common spaces.
Although I strongly condemn human rights abuses in Chechnya, I believe we have a vested interest in a stable Russia under the firm leadership of President Putin and a common cause in fighting international terrorism.
However, with due respect for the rule of law, it is a pity that criminal law is being used to rein in the power of the oligarchs, whereas a financial settlement to redress the questionable privatisation of the early 90s would have been far preferable.
I also welcome extending the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS.
Belarus remains a problem, but we must engage in limited but constructive engagements in areas of mutual concern.
I was delighted by the fact that my budget amendment to increase funding to the victims of Chernobyl was passed by this House.
Lastly, I agree with Mr Gahler that European public opinion would not support freedom of movement for the peoples of north Africa for the foreseeable future.
Â Â  Mr President, the initiative of the Commission and of the European Union in general on a broader Europe is a right step if we are to unify and communitise our policy.
The excellent report by Mrs Napoletano shapes an interesting political strategy framework for the actual area encircling the European Union.
This strategy allows both planning and objectives; at the same time, however, it maintains the flexibility needed for each area around us, based on its peculiarities.
Our basic priorities are predicated on good relations, peace and economic and political cooperation.
We entertain no thoughts whatsoever of new walls or new divisions.
The Commission document proposes the economic element.
The report by Mrs Napoletano proposes the political element, which means initiatives for peace in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Balkans and elsewhere.
However, as the European Parliament, we too can take initiatives by stepping up our efforts.
Within this framework, I believe and I propose that, as it has done in order to cooperate with other regions, the European Parliament should appoint a joint parliamentary committee with the countries of the Black Sea Cooperation, which already has a parliamentary conference, intergovernmental cooperation, a development bank, a permanent secretariat and, most importantly of all, to which 13 countries belong.
They include members and candidate members of the European Union, the countries of the Caucasus, the Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and, generally speaking, countries with a particular political interest in the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are now in the middle of the greatest ever enlargement of the European Union.
In a year or so, Bulgaria and Romania will join, and membership negotiations are being entered into with Turkey and Croatia.
This has given rise to increased interest in the EU in the world around us.
We can expect new applications for membership and new requests for close cooperation in the future.
I think we should be proud of this interest in participating in European cooperation.
It also means that we can support, and make demands upon, surrounding countries so that they respect human freedoms and rights, comply with the principles of the state governed by law and observe basic economic principles of free trade.
I personally do not understand the talk of European borders now needing to be defined.
The EU must, in the future, be open to new members from our part of the world, irrespective of whether or not they follow old school mapsâ demarcation of the European continent.
With modern technology and telecommunications, the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and the Caucasus are becoming evermore imaginary frontiers, while, in other parts of the world, freedom, human rights and democracy â and, naturally, their opposite, oppression â are becoming evermore real for us all.
Moldova is a small and poor country in the EUâs future border area.
I believe that a proposed stabilisation pact comprising Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova would not be a successful solution.
Moldova belongs historically and culturally to South-Eastern Europe.
It is my hope that the Commission will try to establish a form of cooperation with Moldova that takes account of this and opens the way to future Moldovan membership of the EU once Romania and Bulgaria have joined.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, after the second world war, the people of Europe had the vision of integrating their countries, and more than 50 years on the EU is the result.
Today our great Europe needs to have the vision of a neighbourhood policy, in the East and in the South, and I am grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report, which provides many ideas.
We have a whole arsenal of instruments with which to put flesh on the bones of this neighbourhood policy: economic, political and technological.
We should also use the other institutions, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which have a contribution to make to this neighbourhood policy.
I believe that a strategy of neighbourhood agreements for individual countries or groups of countries might be helpful, like the Schuman declaration of 1951, only then it was for coal and steel.
It is a model that we can still use today for sectoral agreements with our neighbours.
A technological agreement with North Africa on solar hydrogen, for example, would be of huge importance for both us and them.
We do not want a fortress Europe, but an open Europe, and this policy should help us to achieve this.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the Commissionâs proposal and Mrs Napoletanoâs report.
As I understand it, it is a question of recognising that enlargement is not, cannot be and will not be the Unionâs only instrument for structuring Europe and the Euro-Mediterranean region.
That is the issue.
Enlargement will have a limit.
Twelve new countries are going to join; we also have Turkey and others will join in the future.
Once that limit has been reached, we must not be able to say that we lack the political, economic, security, cultural or human instruments to structure Europe.
In other words, we are giving shape to a more extensive architecture which complements the instrument of enlargement and which also requires the deepening which the Constitution we are currently dealing with represents.
If we do not create these new policies of good neighbourly relations, we would be falling short and, at the end of the day, we are taking up proposals made by people with a profound knowledge of the European situation, whom I naturally support.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to warmly welcome the proposal from the Commission and the report Mrs Napoletano has produced.
There is breathtaking ambition involved here.
It would be quite easy for the European Union to say it has enough on its hands dealing with enlargement and bedding down the enlargement process.
However, it would be extremely short-sighted to do that, and the current idea of pushing forward with a policy in the context of developing near neighbours is extremely important.
I was struck this morning by something the Irish President said when talking about near neighbours - people who live next to each other but do not know each other, at either a local or an international level.
That ignorance of each other breeds fear and distrust and eventually will breed conflict.
Therefore, this near neighbourhood policy is extremely important, not only for our security but also for the security of those countries who are our neighbours.
Let us not go down the road of saying we cannot have freedom of movement from North Africa.
We have freedom of movement from North Africa, we simply do not recognise it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report on the difficult neighbourhood issue.
It is good that it emphasises the importance of the political, social and economic stability of our neighbouring regions for our security, and I might even say our future.
For that reason, I warmly support the idea of a common free trade area.
That way we can promote democratic development.
Our maturity, however, is measured by our skill in averting and preventing conflicts.
We must support the Commissionâs idea of Neighbourhood Programmes.
Let what we export be stability, so that we do not have to re-import instability.
Let us remember, however, that there are not just gulfs between countries but gulfs too within states, and these are growing all the time.
That is a real yardstick for measuring the success of our societies, including our very own.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to comment on just a few issues.
Firstly, differentiation, which is of course a key component of the Commission proposal.
Our approach is based entirely on differentiation, which means that each country is treated individually.
It is not a multilateral project, but a bilateral one, tailor-made for everyone, and that is why Russia is not treated in the same way as Libya; that would simply be impossible and quite frankly it would be foolish even to attempt to do so.
This also means that the scope and substance of the common ground will vary quite considerably, at least at the outset.
At some point in the distant future it may be possible for all of the trains to call at the same station, but for a long time there will be differentiation.
Obviously, the idea of our concluding a free movement of workers agreement with the countries of North Africa in the foreseeable future is just as inconceivable to me as it is to MrÂ Gahler. But no one has mentioned this possibility either.
My final point is this: several speakers complained of a lack of conceptual clarity and consistency.
I am rather surprised by this.
I think that the concept is actually quite clear.
We want to have a policy that is designed for all those countries that will be our next-door neighbours after enlargement, whether through shared land or sea borders.
As Romano Prodi rightly said, these countries stretch from Russia to Morocco.
Obviously it would be an easy matter to draft an overall strategy for all European countries and all neighbouring countries outside Europe, who are not Members of the European Union, by quite simply combining the strategies and policies that are already in place â in fact I could do this over the coming weekend if you wished.
But it would do nothing to change the fact that we would have to apply different instruments in the western Balkans and Turkey, for example, from the ones that we need to apply in say Libya or Syria, because our objectives in respect of the western Balkans and Turkey are quite different.
MrÂ Brokâs attempt is honourable, and I will not hold it against him either â I know exactly what he wanted.
MrÂ Brok will certainly agree with me when I say that writing an alternative to accession for Turkey in a formal Council or Commission document at this stage would amount to announcing the end of the common strategic approach.
You can certainly demand this, MrÂ Brok, but the Commission is unable to comply.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  Certainly, words like ânew impetusâ declare the ambition of having closer relations.
There is talk of a âCommon Spaceâ, but with no common construction.
We are, indeed, a long way from such a space, listening to MrÂ Prodi talk about political and progressive integration into the economic and social structures of the European Union.
The question may be asked as to whether the word âneighbourhoodâ has not replaced that of âpartnershipâ.
The EUâs objective is the integration, pure and simple, of these countries into the sizeable European market, but without any financial compensation in terms of the aid from which the candidate countries for accession benefited, even if the conditions were drastic and unjust.
Another aspect is that the Commissionâs entire communication is characterised by a very security-minded approach to relations.
This is far from the hope of an EU open to the world.
Freedom of movement for goods and capital, but not for people, is not only inhumane but also totally illusory and cynical.
If the EU wishes to respond to the expectations that continue to be placed upon it by many peoples and to establish a notion of the world radically different from that of the United States, there is every reason for forging new links with our neighbours, particularly our Mediterranean ones.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Northern dimension.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first Action Plan for the Northern Dimension in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union for 2000â2003, adopted by the Feira European Council on 19 and 20 June 2000, will expire by the end of this year.
Therefore, in order to pursue the Northern Dimension policies beyond 2003, intensive preparatory work was launched a year ago.
In particular, I recall that the guidelines for a new Action Plan were set out at the Ministerial Conference on the Northern Dimension and the Arctic Window in Greenland in August 2002, and the subsequent Foreign Ministersâ Conference in Luxembourg in October of that year.
In line with these guidelines, the Commission established contacts with all the relevant actors, including regional organisations and associations and representatives of the private sector, with a view to preparing a working document on the new Action Plan.
On 11 June this year, the Commission submitted to the Council the working document âThe Second Northern Dimension Action Plan, 2004-2006â, which incorporated a number of suggestions presented by the relevant actors and took into account experience gained with the first action plan as well as the new demands for the coming years.
This document was then examined by the Council on 29 September 2003 and later endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 October 2003 in Brussels.
On that occasion, it was underlined by the Heads of State or Government that the Northern Dimension will assume increasing importance in the context of the Unionâs enlargement and will have an important contribution to make in carrying forward the Union's new neighbourhood policy throughout the region.
The Action Plan for 2004â2006 lays down the guidelines for the next three years.
In this respect, it guarantees the continuation of the Northern Dimension of the Unionâs policies, defined in the document as a âhorizontal concept that applies within the existing financial and institutional framework in the relevant regionâ.
The Northern Dimension is particularly important for certain priority sectors in which potential added value is greatest, such as the economy, business, infrastructure, human resources, education, culture, scientific research, health, the environment, nuclear safety, natural resources, cross-border cooperation and regional development, as well as justice and home affairs.
The common framework for the promotion of political dialogue and practical cooperation that the Northern Dimension provides will cover a broad, diverse geographical area around the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic.
Special consideration will be given to regions with specific needs, such as Kaliningrad and the Arctic region.
In the context of the Northern Dimension, increased interaction at all levels between Russia and the EU will therefore be essential.
The Commission will keep its overall leading role but all relevant actors, whether at national, regional or local levels, from the business community or from civil society generally, will be called upon to play an active part.
Specific activities in the five broad priority sectors just mentionedÂ - the economy and infrastructure; education, culture, research and health; the environment, nuclear safety and natural resources; cross-border cooperation and regional development; justice and home affairs â need to be carried forward in a cooperative spirit based on inclusive participation for all, subsidiarity and complementarity, with an effective division of labour and overall coordination and monitoring.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Northern Dimension of the European Unionâs external relations and cross-border activities is an important policy area for the Commission and it will become even more so with the forthcoming enlargement.
The Commission continues to work actively on the Northern Dimension.
In parallel to implementing the measures in the First Northern Dimension Action Plan, the Commission has played a decisive role in drafting the Second Action Plan for the region. This Second Action Plan covers the period 2004-2006.
As a follow-up to the preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency last year, the Commission carried out an open and integrated consultation process in the first half of 2003, involving the most important partners.
This proved to be a very useful exercise.
The Commission also took account of the European Parliamentâs resolution of 16Â January 2003.
In June 2003, the Commission transmitted its proposals for the Second Action Plan to the Council.
After discussing these, the Council adopted the final version of the document, which was approved by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels of 16 and 17Â October 2003.
The main objective of the Second Action Plan is, in the interests of both sides, to provide an instrument for regional cooperation with our neighbours, the Russian Federation.
In addition, the intention is for the Northern Dimension to address the opportunities and challenges that might arise from the forthcoming enlargement.
In other words, it is intended to contribute to promoting stability and prosperity in this region, both inside and outside the borders of the European Union.
The Northern Dimension policy will also contribute directly to achieving the aims that we have just discussed in our debate on a wider Europe and the new neighbourhood.
Finally, the new Action Plan will make a contribution to the sustainable development of the Arctic region and the indigenous peoples who live there.
In addition, the Commission has been working hard on the continued implementation of the First Action Plan.
It should of course be concluded by the end of this year.
In this context, several of the results that have been achieved most recently are worthy of mention, for example: the implementation of the first projects in the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment Programme in the Russian Federation and the extension of cross-border cooperation as part of the drafting of the first neighbourhood programmes following the Commission communication of July 2003.
Neither should we forget the large number of projects and specific initiatives implemented by the Commission that have already been completed or are still underway as part of Community programmes, which also contribute to making the Northern Dimension a reality.
The 2003 Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the Northern Dimension Action Plan will provide a complete overview of all of the sectors in the First Action Plan.
The Commission will be publishing this report in the coming weeks.
Finally, we should also remember the significant contribution made by other players, for example the Member States, regional organisations and regional and local authorities.
Only with the active support of all of the stakeholders in the region can the Northern Dimension be a complete success.
This is an aspect that we have particularly highlighted in the Second Action Plan.
The Commission will obviously continue to keep Parliament informed about the implementation of the initiative, and we hope that Parliament will play an active part in the monitoring and review initiatives that will take place in the near future.
Â Â  â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, one can, if need be, always relate good and bad news on the topic of the Northern Dimension.
The good news is that the Council and the Commission say the Northern Dimension is alive and well.
The bad news is that nothing much is happening within its framework, except that Parliament, the Council and the Commission are vying with one another to try and extend and at the same time dilute the concept, so that soon it will surely cover the whole of the northern hemisphere.
In the region of the Baltic basin and northwestern Russia, however, there are things happening all the time in which the European Union should also be economically involved.
The issue of maritime security, or non-security, is one of them.
The Union is enlarging and in four months the border between Russia and the Union will have doubled in length.
The agreement over Kaliningrad is in danger of becoming a major quarrel as no one seems to be telling Lithuania what is happening or if anything is happening at all.
It was amusing to read in the minutes of the EU-Russia Summit about a fast-track feasibility study being made by the end of 2003.
That is now six weeks away and the Lithuanians, at least according to what their former president said yesterday, know nothing about it.
The northern gas pipeline is probably going to start being built within two or three years which is to go from the Arctic Ocean, past Finland and via the Baltic to Central Europe.
Its route from the Arctic to the Baltic lacks infrastructure and it will also presumably pass through primal forest that needs protecting.
The Russians will not manage alone in this.
A big fuss is made from time to time in the Union about the risks associated with nuclear waste and nuclear power stations in northwestern Russia.
Within the framework of the TACIS programme, however, there is a substantial amount of unused resources set aside for nuclear safety projects â some EUR 180 million.
Why, then, are these not used for cleaning up nuclear waste in the sea at Litsa Guba and Murmansk, by which I mean decommissioned nuclear submarine reactors and nuclear waste on the shoreline, or ensuring that the power stations at Sosnovibor and Kandalaksha are safe to use?
The Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, which is coordinated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is an excellent tool.
It should also be used elsewhere than in just one project.
The St Petersburg Southwestern Wastewater Treatment Plant is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to what is needed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Northern dimension still remains on virtually only a verbal level is by no means the fault of the Community.
I point the finger at Finlandâs present and former governments, for example, for which cooperation in the neighbouring regions does not seem to have been or be worth the bother of initiating any powerful lobbying to spur the European Union into action.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists like to thank the Commission and the Council for the EUâs Northern Dimension having become an ongoing and consistent part of European Union policy.
Its continuity is demonstrated by the fact that we are discussing the Second Action Plan.
The Northern Dimension, however, as was said earlier on, has been criticised as being shapeless and accused of lacking in anything concrete.
This forthcoming programme for the period 2002 â 2006 will hopefully eliminate these problems.
The programme promises to put in place a coherent operational framework for all Northern Dimension policy by creating strategic objectives and priorities.
The Northern Dimension will not acquire sufficient credibility until it helps to improve the life of people in the EUâs northern regions and those areas bordering on them.
This means developing the economy by exploiting the potential offered by trade and the sustainable use of natural resources.
In northern regions environmental questions are also vitally important.
After enlargement the Baltic will become an internal sea of the EU, and its protection will require swift action not only in the European Union but also in Russia.
It is good news that the Russian Prime Minister on his visit to Finland this week gave his support to European Union efforts to discontinue the use in the Baltic Sea of single-hulled oil tankers.
Environmental cooperation must be continued in order to improve nuclear safety, and wildlife in the Arctic also calls for special attention.
Plans and agreements made in the area of health and social protection must also be turned into projects of concrete cooperation.
The New Neighbours initiative, which was being discussed here just a short while ago, will give strength to the EUâs Northern Dimension.
Added value will be afforded in particular by the new financial instrument proposed in it which, for example, will reduce bureaucracy in border cooperation.
The Northern Dimension nevertheless also needs sufficient new financial resources for it to be implemented.
Â Â  â Mr President, enlargement of the European Union will strengthen the Northern Dimension.
When the Baltic countries and Poland, which have been major partners in EU external relations, join the Union they will give the Northern Dimension strength both in the EUâs internal development work and its external relations.
The enlarging EU is reorganising external relations with its eastern and southern neighbours by creating the Wider Europe and new Neighbourhood Policy.
The Northern Dimensionâs future crucially depends on how well we can link it with this wider scenario.
Within the framework of the Wider Europe Policy, the EU will still enlarge and develop its relations with its European neighbours.
Added to that are the Northern Dimension and the Southern Dimension aspects of EU policy, which also extend outside Europe.
It is natural that the New Neighbourhood Policy and the new neighbourhood cooperation finance scheme should also be implemented in northern regions.
It is precisely in the north that the new finance scheme could be applied as a pilot project before it is adopted generally, as is proposed in MrsÂ Napoletanoâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the EUâs Northern Dimension is not the Unionâs internal market policy but a neighbouring regions and foreign policy.
The question is above all about cooperation with those areas of Russia which are close to the EUâs borders.
As far as our group is concerned, we wish to focus attention on the word âcooperation.â
There is a need to foster cooperation among people as well as just companies.
Besides money we also have to export social welfare and democracy to the northern neighbouring regions.
Our group supports projects to prevent the sexual exploitation of women and children and to combat the disease and social problems that poverty brings with it.
Poverty causes sickness.
We are not pleased with the way the Commission has handled the issue of the EUâs Northern Dimension.
It has to be more than just a policy on Russia.
The Commission has been unable to create any substance to the projects recorded in the programmes. The same unfortunately has to be said for the countries to hold the presidency this year.
Neither Greece nor Italy mentioned the Northern dimension in their list of priorities.
They have pulled homewards in the direction of the Mediterranean, even though the country to hold the presidency has an obligation to create projects throughout the Union as a whole.
Prime Minister Berlusconi has been interested more in Russiaâs warmongering dimension rather than peace, ordinary cooperation with people and their social well-being.
There is a danger that the special features of the EUâs Northern Dimension will be trampled underfoot by the new Wider Europe â Neighbourhood Policy.
Nature dictates different preconditions for life in the north from those further south and those regions need their own distinctive policy.
The draft resolution jointly proposed by the political groups is comprehensive and only needs implementing, which is the Commissionâs responsibility.
Â Â  â Mr President, with âbigâ issues like Italyâs domestic policy dominating the EU debate, other points of the compass can get pushed into a corner.
It is for such reasons that the Northern Dimension is still awaiting its big breakthrough.
Its importance is revealed, however, when we look for example at the risks associated with nuclear power in our neighbouring country, Russia, or its recent internal policy.
The stability of Wider Europe depends, furthermore, very much on whether we can achieve effective regional and cross-border cooperation.
As has been said here, when the EU enlarges, the Baltic Sea will grow in importance and hopefully at the same time so will opportunities for more solid cooperation in order to enhance its ecological and political future.
I would just like to remind everyone here of the perils associated with Russian oil consignments, which are very much on the increase.
This action plan is a useful survey of the key regional challenges but it is completely lacking in any strategic view of the areas of focus that should be promoted, in particular concrete and measurable short- and mid-term objectives, or how cooperation with the various intergovernmental, NGO and other existing forums should be exploited to achieve them.
Finally I would like to raise the separate matter of the status of the EUâs only aboriginal people, the Sami.
They should have considerably more political influence than they do.
The original means of livelihood and way of life of the Sami should be protected, which also means resolving local issues of land ownership and use in a manner that is satisfactory, as hard as that might be or painful to do.
Will is the crucial element here too, however.
Â Â  Mr President, I hesitate to intrude on what is almost an all-Finnish debate, but I would like to welcome this second action plan and draw attention to two points.
I was privileged to attend on behalf of Parliament all three ministerial meetings that helped prepare this action plan, and there are two points which seem to have been overlooked.
The Northern Dimension has to do with EU-Russia relations, but it also has to do with something much wider than that across the whole of the high north and the Arctic.
We held one of the ministerial meetings in Ilulissat, Greenland, and I thought the window on the Arctic had been highlighted, but it seems instead to have been slammed shut.
The Arctic environment and its people concern us all.
They are part of a global challenge which we have to answer and which we ignore at our absolute peril.
We had the chance in the EU to show leadership in this by working with and through the Arctic Council and also, more importantly, by forging a partnership with the US in this area of the globe where we could work together.
The second point that is missing is that of parliamentary and representative involvement at all levels.
The first ministerial meeting foresaw the creation of a Northern Dimension forum.
I was at a Nordic Council parliamentarians meeting yesterday in Warsaw, where the same point was made.
We need parliamentary involvement at all levels to champion, advocate, scrutinise and move this policy forward so that it does not remain a phantom policy but becomes a reality.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should first like to turn to MrÂ Suominen.
You are of course quite right that the Baltic basin is one of the most dynamic regions in Europe, if not the most dynamic of all, economically speaking.
But it is also a fact that after 1Â May 2004 all of the countries bordering the Baltic Sea will be Members of the European Union apart from Russia.
There will only be one single Baltic Sea country that is not in the European Union and that will be the Russian Federation.
All of the others will be in.
All matters relating to Baltic policy will in the future be EU-Russia policy.
There is no escaping this.
I think that in this respect the initiatives that we have developed vis-Ã -vis the Russian Federation significantly strengthen the Northern Dimension.
Then you mentioned Kaliningrad. I admit that I am more than surprised by what you said here!
The issue of access to and from Kaliningrad was not negotiated by the EU and Russia, but first by the EU and Lithuania and then with Russia.
Each individual step was agreed with Lithuania.
The study on the possibility of a fast train link is something that we arranged with Lithuania, and the Commission negotiated the conditions for such a study in great detail with the Lithuanian Government.
I personally informed the Lithuanian President about the results of this work.
The Lithuanian President cannot have told you that he was not aware of it!
That is quite impossible.
I would ask you to check your information once more, because I am very keen to avoid the impression being given here that we are doing anything that affects Lithuaniaâs sovereignty in direct relation to Russia.
We are not negotiating anything with Russia that affects the sovereignty of Lithuania, our future Member State.
I can offer you full reassurance here.
There is no one who is more attentive to this than I am and I found the comments that you made on this quite astounding, to put it mildly.
As far as the Arctic region is concerned, which was addressed at the end, I should like to point out that the Second Action Plan, which I have reported on to you, makes specific provision for a major new initiative and activity on the Arctic Window; this will be one of the two major activities in this plan.
This is decided; it is down in black and white.
I do not quite understand therefore how you can say that the window has been slammed shut again, because the opposite is the case.
The window is in fact wide open and I can promise you that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that all of the opportunities offered by this initiative are fully exploited.
Â Â  I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
Â Â  . ArticleÂ 2(2) of the Schengen Convention states that where public policy or national security so require, a Contracting Party may, after consulting other Contracting Parties, decide that for a limited period national border checks appropriate to the situation will be carried out at internal borders.
If public policy or national security require immediate action, the Contracting Party concerned shall take the necessary measures and shall inform the other Contracting Parties thereof at the earliest opportunity
For the application of these provisions, the Schengen Executive Committee of 20Â December 1995 adopted the decision on the procedure for applying ArticleÂ 2(2) of the Schengen Convention.
In line with the aforementioned texts, that is to say OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p.133, the Joint Action of 26Â May 1997 with regard to cooperation on law and order and security (OJ L 147, 5.6.1997, p.1) and the Council Conclusions of 13Â July 1997 on security at European Council meetings and other comparable events (document 10916/01 JAAI 82), the Italian Presidency promoted a draft Council resolution on security at European Council meetings and other comparable events.
The draft resolution does not abolish the civil liberties laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7Â December 2000 (OJ C 364, 18.12.2000, p.1); in particular, it contains specific provisions regarding protection of personal data for exchange.
Â Â  I thank the Minister for his reply, which troubles me of course.
I would like to ask him the following supplementary question: what is the fate of this draft resolution; in other words, has it been accepted in principle by the other 14 and which are the basic provisions contained in this proposal for a resolution?
Â Â  . I am not in a position to reply in detail regarding these further points.
I will therefore, if necessary, send a written answer to MrÂ Alavanos concerning his further requests.
Â Â  The Council has not received any information from the Member States regarding the implementation of Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust.
The Council would like to draw the honourable Memberâs attention to the fact that the decision does not require Member States to communicate such information to the Council.
It is, nevertheless, aware of the fact that the Commission is drawing up a report on the implementation of Decision 2002/187/JHA; it has been informed that the Commission intends to present this report to the Council by the end of the year.
Since there is a lack of information on the rules for national transposition, the Council cannot provide the honourable Member with details of the national rules defining the status and the powers of the nations that are members of Eurojust during the period from the entry into force of the decision to date.
The Italian Council Presidency did, however, organise a meeting on the issue, which took place in Rome on 13 and 14 November 2003.
Â Â  â As far as we are aware, only eight Member States have replied to date, whereas the planned deadline for replies was 6Â September.
The issue is extremely tricky because, in the meantime, Eurojust is operational and personal data, some of which is very sensitive, is being exchanged.
I believe that the problem, regarding Eurojust, is that the cart has been put before the horse, that is to say that this bureaucratic structure to aid cooperation has been created without rules and guarantees and without making sure that these rules could be complied with by the deadlines laid down.
It is enough to mention the MÃ¶llemann caseÂ âÂ in which Eurojust was involved, with data exchangeÂ âÂ of a German Liberal representative who committed suicide precisely whilst a police and judicial operation was under way involving several Member States.
The question remains: what rules did the German delegate apply in exchanging information in the MÃ¶llemann case, since Eurojust maintains that German rules were applied, whilst the Germans claim that Eurojust rules were applied?
As you can see, MrÂ Antonione, there is a problem that urgently needs resolving.
The 6Â September deadline was not respected: urgent measures are called for.
Â Â  As has already been stated, in October in response to oral questions H-0544/03 and H-0549/03 on the same issue, the Council is aware of the trial and detention of five Cuban citizens residing in Florida since 2001 and the concerns that have also been voiced by human rights NGOs, not least, as regards the conditions of detention.
The Council has not discussed the conditions of the trial.
As regards the general attitude of the Council and the Commission regarding Cuba, I refer the honourable Member to our debate in this House at the beginning of September.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question does not relate either to the trial of the Cuban prisoners or to their current detention.
My question essentially relates to respect for the rights of families, who are being prevented from seeing these prisoners, despite the fact that these rights are enshrined in international law and in the law of the United States.
It relates specifically to two women, who for more than four years have not been authorised to visit their husbands, and to a very painful situation which is once again being reported on in the media: today one of the wives has once again been refused a visa to enter the United States in order to see her husband.
What I want to know is whether the Council considers this to be an issue worthy of its attention or not.
Â Â  I must apologise to the honourable Member because, clearly, my reply was not appropriate, so to speak, given the requests.
I will commit to carrying out further checks and to replyingÂ âÂ as far as I am in a position to do soÂ âÂ in writing to the honourable Member.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must insist on this issue, since in October the President-in-Office of the Council promised us that he would reply in writing to all the questions we presented, and this has not happened.
So far we have not received any reply.
I would like â also with regard to this issue â to table a supplementary question, since when there has been a situation of insufficient respect for rights, you have quite rightly acted as the Council in relation to Cuba, but nevertheless, in relation to this other very serious violation of the rights of families, the Council has taken no action.
My supplementary question is this: have you put this specific issue which we raised a month ago on the families of the five Cuban prisoners who are in Miami to the Council?
Â Â  As regards the International Criminal Court, the Council would point out the importance that the Union attaches to preserving the integrity of the Rome Statute.
We must leave no stone unturned in our endeavours to promote universal signature of the Rome Statute and its full enforcement though national legislation.
The Member States should become party to the agreement on the privileges and immunity of the Court and ensure that national implementing legislation is enforced.
They should also refrain from making statements expressing reservations that are permitted under ArticleÂ 120 of the Rome Statute.
To this end, the Union has promoted a whole raft of initiativesÂ âÂ political dialogue and other initiativesÂ âÂ to persuade third countries, including the United States, to sign the Rome Statute.
The Union believes that universal signing-up to the Rome Statute is essential for the International Criminal Court to be fully effective and, to this end, considers that initiatives should be encouraged, which increase acceptance of the Statute, provided that they are consistent with the letter and spirit of the document.
The Council would like to mention that it has, on every possible occasionÂ âÂ common positions of the Union, guidelines and various initiatives undertaken by third countriesÂ âÂ clearly and consistently stressed its position as regards bilateral agreements on non-surrender negotiated or concluded with the United States.
The Member States to whom the USA has proposed agreements of this kind immediately asked for a common approach from the Union on these proposals within the framework of the Council.
Since the beginning of the process, the Council has identified a clear political objective for this common approach.
The basis for any solution that takes into account the concerns of the United States must preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute and must not jeopardise the functioning of the International Criminal Court.
I would refer you, in particular, to the Union guidelines annexed to the Council conclusions of 30Â September 2002, in which the Council confirmed that, according to the current wording, signing bilateral agreements with the United States would be incompatible with the obligations that the Statute of the International Criminal Court imposes on States Parties, as it could also be incompatible with other international agreements to which the said countries are also States Parties.
Furthermore, the solution adopted should provide for an appropriate system, which would mean that anyone who has committed a crime falling within the remit of the Court could not go unpunished.
This system should ensure that national judges conduct appropriate investigations into persons brought before the International Criminal Court and, where there is sufficient proof, set the appropriate legal proceedings in motion.
In any case, the solution adopted as regards the citizenship of those people who are not to be surrendered should only affect people who do not have citizenship of a State Party to the International Criminal Court.
As regards the scope, this should only cover people that are in the territory of the State to which the application has been made because they have been sent there by another State, and being surrendered cannot be interpreted in such a way as to include transit.
As was confirmed by the Council in the common position of JuneÂ 2003, the Member States are continuing, where appropriate, to draw the attention of third countries to the Council Conclusions of 30Â September 2002 on the International Criminal Court and on the Union principles annexed to it, regarding proposals for agreements and conventions relating to the conditions for surrendering persons to the Court.
It states that the 10 accession countries supported the Unionâs common position of JuneÂ 2003, to which the associate countries, such as Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and the EFTA countries, also conformed.
As regards Guantanamo Bay, as the European Parliament knows from the replies given by the Council to a series of written questions on this issue, the Council has not formally discussed this subject with the United States.
I must say, moreover, as an aside, that, just yesterday, in the meeting held between the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the US Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell we were able to raise this issue as well and to discuss it directly with him.
I will, of course, delay going into greater detail on this aspect because it was raised only yesterday.
In this regard, it must be assumed that the protection of the rights and interests of the citizens of Member States outside the Union is, according to the Vienna Convention on consulate relations, the sole competence of the individual Member State concerned.
The Member States whose citizens are detained in Guantanamo Bay, are, therefore, adopting measures, which they deem necessary to ensure that their citizensâ rights are respected in the context of the relevant bilateral agreements with the United States.
The Council is not in a position to provide details on the nature of these measures and any requests for information should be addressed to the Member States concerned.
As regards the question on the United Statesâ request for passengersâ personal data, the Council is taking the grave concerns voiced by Parliament, most recently in the resolution adopted on 9Â October 2003, very seriously.
The Council has fully supported the Commission in its sustained efforts to achieve a definitive solution which complies with the clear provisions of the law by the end of the year.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Council for its answer and I now have a supplementary question.
In the light of the deplorable attempts by the US to undermine the International Criminal Court and the rights of the Guantanamo detainees to a fair trial, will the Council raise these matters with the US administration at every opportunity and place them on the agenda for the next US-EU summit?
Â Â  . I am not currently in a position to make such a commitment because, as you know MrÂ Andreasen, it clearly depends on the other Member States of the Council as well.
I can tell you that on this matter there has already been, as I had occasion to mention just now, an exchange of opinions during yesterdayâs lunch and during the Troikameeting I therefore believe that such an issue could also be resumed in light of the commitments made publicly by Colin Powell when replying in a press conference to a journalist, to the effect that, on his return to the US, he would look into the issue further and attempt to remedy any difficult situations.
I hope that there will be a positive development and that it will no longer be necessary to address this issue.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, questions 5 and 6 will be taken together:
What new, effective steps does the Council intend to take to establish full international recognition for a Palestinian State, cohabiting with the State of Israel, in view of the crisis affecting the âroad mapâ put forward by the âquartetâ, while the destructive and humiliating occupation of Palestine by the Israeli army continues, and with it the inability of a subjugated and weakened Palestinian Authority to exercise its full authority over groups which support violent action against the occupation?
On 16 October 2003, a number of Israeli and Palestinian representatives meeting in Jordan agreed in principle on a peace plan to resolve the dispute between Israel and Palestine, injecting new life into the peace process.
The draft, which sets out a number of solutions to basic issues arising between the two countries, is due to be signed in Geneva at the beginning of November 2003 under the aegis of the Swiss Government. The draft has met with the approval of many European countries.
Has the Council adopted a stance regarding the proposed peace plan?
Does it believe that the draft will provide fresh impetus and be a suitable accompaniment to the âRoad Mapâ for peace in the Middle East, as recently indicated by Dominique de Villepin, French Foreign Minister?
Will the EU be represented at negotiations in Geneva for adoption of the peace plan and what view does the Council take of the dismissive attitude already adopted by the Israeli Prime Minister, ArielÂ Sharon?
Â Â  On 16 and 17Â OctoberÂ 2003, the European Council examined the state of the peace process in the Middle East, discussing possible ways forward.
It was stressed that the European Union expresses its firm commitment to the clear objective of two StatesÂ âÂ Israel and a viable, and democratic Palestinian StateÂ âÂ living side by side in peace and security in the framework of comprehensive peace in the Middle East, as laid out in the road map.
Furthermore, the European Union reiterated its determination to contribute to all aspects of the implementation of the road map and stressed the importance and urgency of setting up a credible and effective third-party monitoring mechanism.
The European Council said that it is deeply concerned by the situation in the region and noted that, despite support given by the international community to the quest for a just and lasting solution, insufficient effort has been made by the concerned parties to seize the opportunity for peace set down in the road map, underscored by the recent Quartet Ministerial Statement issued on 26Â September 2003.
On the contrary, rising violence is bringing increasing suffering and death for both the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples and putting at risk security in the region and beyond.
The European Council therefore called on both parties, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, to live up to the commitments they undertook at the Aqaba summit on 4Â JuneÂ 2003.
The European Council urged all sides in the region to immediately implement policies conducive to dialogue and negotiations.
The EU relationship with those who take steps to the contrary will be inevitably affected by such behaviour.
The Union will take every opportunity to make these positions accepted by both sides.
The EU-Israel Association Council, which took place on 17 and 18Â NovemberÂ 2003, gave the Union a good opportunity to give a clear political message to the Israeli Government.
In particular, the Union stressed its concern at the route of the so-called security fence and the continued expansion of settlements, and reiterated the need for Israel, in the fight against terrorism, to avoid civilian casualties and destruction so as not to exacerbate the plight of the Palestinian people.
Furthermore, the Council stressed the importance of the Union playing an active role in the peace process.
As regards the specific question from MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the Council believes that the Geneva Agreement is a positive contribution to the debate on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, in accordance with the Unionâs position in this regard, expressed most recently by the European Council of 16 and 17Â OctoberÂ 2003.
The European Council welcomed initiatives from civil society on both sides and said that it is ready to further assist in the effort to promote , confidence-building and the search for a lasting peace.
The steps for reaching a definitive, comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict are set out on the Quartetâs road map.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have acknowledged that the Roadmap is in serious crisis.
Everybody seems to acknowledge this.
And this is helping the radicals on both sides to achieve their objective, which is that the Roadmap be broken, and we want the Council now to establish something which you have mentioned: the specific repercussions which have to be applied to those who do not comply with the Roadmap.
We would like you to explain to us what these repercussions would be.
Â Â  .
I am not in a position to go into details on what measures might be adopted where there is non-compliance with what the European Union has called for; I can only say that the policy and the will are there.
Clearly, decisions as to the specific, practical stance to be taken must be taken when the time comes, not least as regards any choices made subsequently by the countries that have not complied with our requests.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
Of course, I noticed the repetition of the objectives and commitments we have heard numerous times, together with an impression of the tragic situation in the area.
I would like to ask more specifically: does the Council believe the observations in Israel during the meeting of the Association Council to be sufficient?
Does the European Union see that there is at the moment any margin for its greater involvement within the framework of the road map or in supporting the Geneva initiative?
I should like to hear something more specific, which is also why I tabled the question.
Â Â  . I am sorry to disappoint the honourable Member but my reply is basically what I am currently in a position to say.
I cannot make any other commitments other than what I stated in my reply to your question.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Ortuondo Larrea, for tabling this question.
The Council would, first of all, like to stress that, in the discussions of December 2002, particular attention was given to structural measures for fleets that needed to be adapted to reflect the reform of the common fisheries policy.
In this regard, the Council was fully aware of the need to ensure consistency between the restructuring policy for the sector and other aspects of the common fisheries policy, in particular the objective of achieving a stable, enduring balance between the capacity of the fleet and the fishing opportunities available in and outside Community waters.
As a result, the decision adopted in December 2002 on aid seeks to concentrate Community financial support on a series of measures that the Council deemed to be a priority within the new framework.
As regards constructing new vessels, Regulation NoÂ 2369/2002 states that public aid in this sector will continue to be available up until the end of 2004, but, from now on, will be given for fishing vessels not exceeding 400Â GT.
Leaving aside the issue of whether certain fisheries activities carried out with fishing vessels not exceeding 400Â GT are sufficiently profitable, it must be stressed that the Council regulation does not allow for construction aid, for the types of shipping vessels that you mentioned, MrÂ Ortuondo Larrea, equal to that laid down for shipping vessels under 400Â GT.
Nevertheless, as regards direct investment for safety at sea, working conditions and the quality of products, Regulation NoÂ 2369/2002 provides for aid for equipment and modernisation after 2004 without applying the 400Â GT limit.
Any similar measure to the one suggested by MrÂ Ortuondo Larrea would, however, require a proposal from the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply.
Certainly I am in favour of respecting the idea that a minimum stock of all possible species of fish should be maintained in order to guarantee their survival and continuity, and the fishermen themselves are the first to have an interest in this resource not being exhausted, since it represents their way of life.
That is why I raised the question of whether, while respecting the fishing effort, while respecting the maximum catches laid down, it would be possible to also authorise financial aid for the renewal of fishing vessels which, as a result of their specific characteristics, cannot have less than 400 GT.
I am grateful for the information you have given me, but I do not know whether this covers the needs for the modernisation of the fleet for all types of fisheries.
In this regard, I would like to stress that we cannot treat seafaring workers as second-class workers.
The renewal of the fleet is something vital not only for the survival of companies, not only for the environment, but also for safety and the working conditions of workers.
Â Â  . I must remind the honourable Member that the Council cannot adopt a position on the way individual criminal cases are dealt with by Member States.
Â Â  I base my supplementary question on Article 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that: 'Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.
Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.'
Member States must adhere to directives laid down by the EU, and France is clearly contravening, rather than adhering to, directives that are laid down in law.
Would the Council representative therefore pursue this matter in the Council and consider bringing France before the Court of Human Rights?
Â Â  . I must repeat what I have already said: the Council cannot adopt a position on the way individual criminal cases are dealt with in Member States.
This is the case on this occasion too, always assuming that the situation is as MrÂ EurigÂ Wyn claims, which is not certain.
The position cannot change.
Â Â  I believe the Council is wrong here.
The Nice Treaty laid down provisions that followed on from the time the Council took action against Austria for breaching fundamental rights.
France is clearly breaching national fundamental rights here.
There is now provision in the Nice Treaty for action to be taken against France.
I believe that there is an obligation on the Council and the European Union as a whole to ensure that France respects fundamental rights.
Clearly that is not being done in this case.
Â Â  I will make a note of the comments made by the author of this supplementary question.
Frankly, I believe that the position that I have expressed is correct, but given the further request, I will undertake to check if the situation should be other than what seems correct to me.
If necessary, I will make a further investigation but, as I understand the situation at present, I can only confirm what I have already said.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in view of your reply, rather than asking the question I had planned to ask, I am simply going to make a suggestion: read Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty and then reply.
Â Â  The Council is very concerned about the situation in Chechnya, in particular as regards human rights, and it regularly stresses the need for a genuine reconciliation in its meetings with the Russian authorities.
The Council has, on many occasions, stressed to the Russian authorities the important role of international organisations in promoting and implementing a process for a political solution in the region.
Furthermore, it has called on the Russian authorities to independently investigate violations of human rights perpetrated by both sides and to bring those allegedly responsible for such acts to trial.
On 8Â OctoberÂ 2003, the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on the presidential elections in Chechnya.
The Union expressed serious doubts about the fairness of the electoral process and grave concerns at the conditions in which the elections took place, but it also expressed the hope that these elections would lead to significant subsequent efforts to achieve a genuine reconciliation and peace.
On a domestic level, the Union has discussed Chechnya in many meetings at all levels.
In all recent political dialogue meetings with Russia, Chechnya was on the agenda: the meeting of political leaders of 12Â September in Moscow, the EU-Russia Cooperation Committeeof 20Â October, the Ministerial of 28Â October in Moscow.
The issue was also raised at the EU-Russia Summit of 6Â November 2003 in Rome.
Â Â  It is deplorable that the vested interests of America and the European Union have allowed this issue to be pushed off the international agenda and turned into an internal Russian issue, which it clearly is not.
During the Irish presidency, I would like to see the Council give support to the Irish, because in the national parliament the European Affairs Committee has actually appointed a rapporteur on Russia to look at the issue of Chechnya.
During the Irish presidency there will be two meetings, the first in Dublin, during the visit by the Foreign Minister, the second the EU-Russia summit to be held in May.
The Council needs to put strong pressure on the European Union.
We need the EU to push at Council level for unfettered international human rights monitoring of Chechnya.
This issue has to be put back on the international agenda.
It is completely unacceptable that over 150 000 people have died over the last decade and appalling human rights abuses are taking place.
People are willing to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the interests of oil and resources.
Â Â  I would remind the honourable Members that this is a Question Time and not a time for statements.
Â Â  . Of course, the Council shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member as regards fire safety in hotels and the need to adopt effective measures in order to conform to Council Recommendation 86/666/EEC.
The Council would like to draw attention to the Commission report of 27Â June 2001 (COM(2001) 348), on application of the aforementioned recommendation, which examines the state of its implementation in Member States.
The Council believes that the recommendation and the Commission report constitute a sufficient basis for Member States to assess to what extent further specific provisions could be called for, including the treatment of fire safety equipment in order to further improve fire safety in hotels.
Â Â  My question has been partially answered, President-in-Office, because you talked about the current recommendation.
The problem, however, is that the recommendation does not include any provisions about the need for safety glass.
It deals with the maintenance of the equipment, but in this incident a young child nearly had a very serious accident because he fell through the glass.
You are coming to the end of your presidency.
Will you ask the Irish presidency and the Commission to look at the provisions of this recommendation to see if they cover all the things that they need to?
For example, this should be toughened safety glass as it would be in the UK but apparently not in Spain.
It is not covered by the recommendation at the moment, nor by health and safety directives.
This safety glass issue is currently a grey area and therefore I would ask you to take the issue up with the Irish presidency and the Commission.
Â Â  . I will take good note of these comments, which I believe to be important contributions.
I would ask the honourable Member, if possible, to present a brief memorandum on the issue in question, which could be more useful for the Commission than for the next PresidencyÂ âÂ in so far as measures are adopted by the Commission, with the full cooperation of the CouncilÂ âÂ precisely so that we can deal proactively with some situations that have, perhaps, not yet been looked into because the potential for real tragedy has been overlooked in particular cases.
Â Â  The Council does not have an opinion on the point raised by the honourable Member.
This issue relates to the Intergovernmental Conference, in which the Council, as an institution, does not play any part.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I suppose I must thank you for your answer, but I cannot say I am happy with it.
If anyone has a role now, it is the Italian Presidency.
Europe Minister MrÂ Buttiglioni is one of the members of the Italian Government most committed to having the Preamble to the Constitution specify the religious, cultural and historical heritage.
The Italian Presidency, which is represented in the Chamber, presses the issue of specifying the fact that Europeâs religious heritage has Judaeo-Christian roots.
I would therefore expect them to be able to envisage wording that refers to Biblical roots or the Biblical heritage.
In that way, scope would be given for Christians, Jews and Muslims all to feel affirmed by this Constitution.
Non-believers too could feel that the Bible is a literary and cultural treasure for the whole of Europe.
Is it not important for the Italian Presidency to find a solution that satisfies everyone?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am well aware that an Intergovernmental Conference is currently underway, which, as we know, consists of the Council.
One of the questions on the agenda concerns Christian values and the issue of what message should be given in the preamble about the values underlying the European constitution.
It would certainly be helpful for us to know what the Italian Presidencyâs position is on this matter.
Â Â  I believe that I have already answered the previous question with sufficient clarity in saying that the Council, as such, does not adopt a position on issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference.
Once again, this has to be my answer.
Â Â  In its statement of 21Â October, the Union, welcoming the appointment of MrÂ Mesa Gisbert as the new constitutional representative, stressed that it would continue to provide assistance and aid to Bolivia in order to strengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and to establish a climate that is more favourable to social progress and economic development.
The Union has been and will continue to be a significant source of investment, trade and development aid for Bolivia.
As one of the major beneficiaries of Community aid in South America, Bolivia has received more than EURÂ 500 million since 1976.
Between 1996 and 2002, European Community undertakings reached a total of almost EURÂ 200 million, whilst payments reached EURÂ 183 million.
These figures include financial, technical and economic cooperation, food security, humanitarian aid, cooperation with non-governmental organisations and in the field of human rights, and other horizontal budget lines.
The national strategy document sets the total provision of European Community financial, technical and economic cooperation at EURÂ 126 million for the period 2000 and 2006.
At the recent meeting of the consultative group, which took place in Paris on 8 and 9Â October, international donors made further commitments.
Nevertheless, in the current phase, it has not been possible to give a precise picture of the general commitments and the various forms they have taken, such as loans, subsidies, debt cancellation and swaps.
On the other hand, the European Union, like other donors, also stressed the need to tackle the causes of the crisis at its roots.
According to the Union, this calls for further provisions to ensure that the poorest and most marginal groups of society have access to services, including reinforcement of land rights and greater political participation of indigenous peoples.
The European Union welcomes the commitment made by the Bolivian Government to combat corruption and intends to stress the importance of swiftly approving anti-corruption legislation and of more effective application of the current legislation.
Furthermore, a healthy institutional structure is an essential condition for an efficient, transparent and fair provision of public services.
The fact that reform of the public sector remained almost at a standstill last year has, however, raised some concerns.
Reform of the public sector needs to be stepped up at national and local authority level.
The European Union and Bolivia have behind them a long history of close, fruitful cooperation.
Now, the Union is ready to further enhance its support of the government and the people of Bolivia.
To this end, it intends to give greater support than ever to the Bolivian Government, in order to enhance good governance and to reduce and prevent conflicts through strengthening democratic institutions.
The competent authorities are currently looking into specific measures.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for the full explanation you have given me on the aid to the Bolivian Government.
The President has referred to the European Unionâs intention to focus its attention on the causes of the crisis.
It appears that these causes relate above all to the liberalisation and modernisation requirements in a country which has very serious structural problems, as a result of the international situation.
Specifically, my supplementary question is whether, in view of the failure of SÃ¡nchez de Losadaâs experiment in liberalisation, following the formulae of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Union and all the international institutions currently governing world economics have considered the consequences of the failure of these policies which we are imposing on them and the need to reconsider a new type of policy with regard to countries such as Bolivia.
Â Â  There has not yet been a critical assessment that has given us any reason to adopt alternative measures to those taken thus far.
We believe that in-depth study of these issuesÂ âÂ and thus tackling the roots of the problemÂ âÂ will allow us to understand better how to act with a policy guideline which has yielded good results in other situations and which we believe can be a useful instrument as regards the situation in Bolivia too.
In the case in point, it is all too clear that these detailed questions will have to be looked at specifically.
Â Â  I would request your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
The President-in-Office of the Council tells us that he must leave at 7 p.m.
The agenda proposed by the Conference of Presidents and approved by plenary establishes that Question Time lasts until 7.30 p.m.
I can tell you that the President-in-Office of the Council informed us that he could not be present beyond 7 p.m. and following deliberation by the Conference of Presidents it was decided to maintain the agenda.
I cannot offer you any solution.
Today the Bureau is going to deal with the problems relating to Question Time.
A series of proposals will be examined and we will try to ensure that these problems do not arise in the future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have been in this House for some time now and even before I was elected in 1994 I worked here.
I remember, for example, the last Italian Presidency and the one before that, amongst others.
On those occasions, the Council spent the night here and Question Time was held in the night sitting.
I just wish to remind us of this.
Out of consideration for the Council we subsequently moved Question Time to the afternoon, with the result that it has not worked since.
I really would like to make a plea for Question Time to be moved back to the night sitting, enabling the Council to spend the night here in Strasbourg in the future â there may still be the odd hotel room available.
