We are well aware that there is some resistance among Commission staff, resistance of a human, social nature which we understand, as regards this redeployment.
This resistance must be broken down.
Thirdly, there is the problem of horizontal redeployment.
There are some delegations which are overworked, and some posts is which there is not enough to do, and we are not always aware of objective criteria having been used to decide on staff distribution.
Fourthly, we need a better balance, a more homogenous balance, between regular Commission staff and local agents who are less costly but who do not have, as it were, the 'central memory' of the institution.
Both types of staff are necessary and the balance between the two needs to be rationally organised.
Therefore, Commissioner, we expect you to proceed more quickly and further in this direction, which we know is the direction you wish to move in.
We shall support you in that movement, but we shall oppose you if by any chance you should drag your feet, which I am sure you will not.
The second point that I should like to mention quickly is the budgetary aspect.
The Committee on Budgets is in favour of a qualitative reform which will give rise to higher costs, because redeployment has to be paid for, but the Committee on Budgets is against any increase in staff numbers in the external services.
Costs may rise, yes, but a rise in staff numbers, no, because if we increase staffing levels this would put the brake on redeployment measures.
Mr President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur.
He has prepared a splendid report, and I am, of course, also glad that he has accepted my action plan in its entirety.
I am, in general, very much in favour of the Commission' s plans to provide its delegations with more resources, more employees and more powers but, all too often, we have seen examples of 'champagne delegations' which have spent more time in diplomatic clubs than on their real work.
In their defence, it may be said that they have had neither powers nor resources under the old system.
Many problems with aid projects are due to the fact that the projects are administered centrally from Brussels.
In the future, the work is therefore to be done out in the field.
The new system is still not in place, but 24 delegations have, for the time being, been given direct financial responsibility.
I hope that, as soon as possible, we can see the valuable experience gained in, for example, Bosnia transferred to the remainder of the delegations.
The idea of giving the delegations more duties and more responsibility does in fact operate in practice, but we have recently seen examples of fraud and irregularities in the delegations in the applicant countries.
I am thinking especially of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in this context.
The Commission must issue Parliament with supervisory reports on the delegations, but I am not asking to see the reports themselves because I appreciate that they contain sensitive personal information. What I would like to see, however, are reports on the financial aspects.
The Commission has already promised me these in connection with the 1999 discharge, and I now hope that the Commission will go on to deliver the goods.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, it is important to remember that the European Union delegations originated with the delegate controllers who were in charge of implementing the agreements made in the YaoundÃ© and LomÃ© Conventions and that their duties were therefore initially based purely on development policy.
Over the years, their range of tasks and geographical coverage have expanded considerably. Their internal structure has, however, not kept pace with this.
Now there is a need for radical reform which, despite all of the changes which the European Parliament has been calling for for years, will not be achieved through this Commission communication either.
Development policy is no longer the only area of responsibility of the EU's external service, but it is still of huge significance.
The dissolution of political blocs and the changing political processes, including in developing countries, have considerably increased the political as well as the trade and economic dimensions of its work.
This is particularly true of the development partnership with the ACP countries, into which the Cotonou Agreement has introduced new aspects.
It is precisely in this respect, however, that delegation staff lack qualifications and training; it is precisely here that there is a lack of the necessary schemes for flexible personnel deployment, which should definitely allow for the involvement of local graduates or external experts, if necessary with fixed-term contracts for a particular type of task.
In practice, however, delegations in the ACP countries have been and are being threatened with downgrading or even closure.
Many posts remain unfilled for long periods of time, without suitable local staff being considered at least temporarily.
Even the European Court of Auditors criticises this.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore sees a danger that the formation of new regional centres and the move towards regional offices - and good reasons can certainly be put forward in favour of this - could in practice lead to a thinning out of delegation structures in developing countries.
That regional offices are more economical than several individual offices is obvious.
That they are also more effective has not, however, been verified.
Here too the conceptual weakness of the Commission communication manifests itself.
From the point of view of content the Commission is still in debt.
Mr Galeote's report and the proposals of the committees which have drafted opinions will provide an excellent basis for paying it.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, may I firstly, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, thank our rapporteur. Once again he has tabled an excellent report on the external service and I hope, Commissioner, that you will listen to me and Mr Galeote Quecedo and that in the spirit of his report you will be so good as to give clear answers.
I believe - in fact we agree on this - that we need to leave history behind.
We need to consider the current functions of the delegation, based on the functions of the Union.
We have of course had Maastricht with the second pillar, the foreign and security policy, and we now have increased responsibilities in the field of world trade policy.
We therefore need to make sure that delegations are opened in all of those cities which are important political and economic partners.
This brings me back, Commissioner, to the debate of a few minutes ago.
I believe that it is precisely in Asia that we need more delegations.
Mr Galeote's report proposes Singapore and Taipei as the places where we should open delegations immediately.
Coming back to Mr Sakellariou's comments on Taipei, Taiwan is the EU's fourth largest trading partner and an example of how a society in Asia can be transformed, at its own instigation, from an authoritarian regime into a living parliamentary democracy.
This is an excellent illustration of the fact that the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights work in Asia and are even something which the countries themselves want.
That is why it is high time that we also open an office in Taiwan.
So, delegations in Singapore and Taiwan, and Mr Galeote also mentioned other regions in the world.
What I believe is important now is for you, when you send us the next document, to provide a clear list of countries and dates - in months and years - indicating where and when you think that delegations should be opened.
If there is no money then say: we need the money.
Then we will have to have a chat about it here and see whether we can have a friendly argument with Mr Bourlanges and win him over.
But we need a report in which it clearly states which countries and in which month of which year, and then we will also be able to lend you our support and build up a decent external service for the Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter we are discussing today is part of a much broader problem, one which involves not only the external image of the Community, but ultimately also the CFSP itself.
The situation of the Union' s external image has been subject to criticism from various quarters in the last few years and still requires a concerted effort to achieve a major transformation.
The interrelation of its various aspects, such as trade, development aid, economics, politics and diplomacy is increasingly apparent in today' s world and must clearly be seen, not so much as something inevitable, but above all, as an opportunity.
It is an opportunity for the European Union to improve its presence on the international scene, defending the principles of democracy and human rights, which give legitimacy to this objective.
We acknowledge that the concept of this reality underpins the Commission' s concerns to improve its external service, which have been put into practice by the adoption of various communications since 1996.
The package as a whole, however, lacks coherence and a great deal remains to be done.
I must confess that we are greatly looking forward to the Commission communication on the external service, which Commissioner Patten promised last September to send to Parliament and which, I think, needs to be a strategic framework for important future developments.
Although we must not lose sight of the fact that the issue we are considering today is actually very limited, improving and adapting the network of delegations, it has very real implications and, as I already emphasised, also affect the political and diplomatic spheres.
What is generally known as the deconcentration and decentralisation of external aid, and its rationalisation, therefore deserves our support, with the concomitant requirements for resources and technical support.
Nevertheless, I wish to state that I disagree with the almost excessively realistic aspect that still exists in certain ideas on the international role of the Union in development aid.
I would, consequently, like to stress three aspects: firstly, that of the importance of regional cooperation, which must, however, be increased to take account of political balances, processes of transition to democracy and of consolidating democracy and also of the relationship between the various countries themselves.
Another aspect linked to this is the need for coherence in fundamental guidelines, so that they do not become tied to and dependent on, sometimes almost exclusively, budgetary restrictions which are not necessarily crucial.
A further aspect is the importance of accepting certain political criteria, in particular, acknowledging the role of the various States in the processes of democratisation and in defending human rights in their own region.
We call on you to suspend the project to shut down our delegations in these countries, also bearing in mind that the cost of maintaining these delegations is a drop in the ocean.
The rapporteur, Mr Galeote Quecedo, considered these and other issues and has produced an excellent piece of work.
We therefore support his proposals for a resolution and we hope that the Commission and the Council will consider them.
Mr President, when you consider what happened under the former Commission, it might be said that there is not much to lose with this proposed decentralisation, and it is in any case crucial that something be done.
If, however, decentralisation is not accompanied by the necessary powers, it might well turn out to be a two-edged sword.
The delegations must have the right powers but so too, of course, must the headquarters itself, in the form of both knowledge and a talent for coordination.
In my view, that combination is just a touch difficult to detect at the present moment.
I am not actually too bothered about diplomatic schools and other such facilities, whatever they are called.
I am, in fact, more concerned about more substantive and practical subjects, for example women' s issues and issues relating to ICT, and I should like to illustrate what I mean about the problems in the light of these two subjects.
We most certainly have no guarantee, of course, that the delegations have any special knowledge of women' s issues and any special knowledge at all of women' s issues in relation to the developing countries.
It might be said that the Commission used not perhaps to have any such knowledge either, but Parliament did, at any rate, then have the opportunity to exercise closer supervision, and that supervisory function declines somewhat when it is farmed out to the various countries.
Nor is there any guarantee whatsoever that the delegations have any special knowledge of information technology.
Certainly, they know how to send e-mails, but information and communications technology is certainly about rather more than just sending e-mails, and when, at the same time, the Commission says that there is absolutely no necessity for any unit in the Commission with specific knowledge of this area but that it is just a question of mainstreaming and general knowledge, then one might well be anxious about how those skills are to be acquired, including in the delegations.
I would therefore hope that, in connection with the proposal to be produced by the Commission, the latter will be able to illustrate - for instance, with the help of the two examples I have quoted: women and ICT - how it is imagined that the development will take place.
Mr President, we agree with the need to strengthen the Commission's external service and support Mr Galeote's evaluation of the Commission's communication.
This report is in line with the priority shared by the majority of my group and of Parliament: to improve the European Union's presence on the international scene.
We see the development of an external service as an instrument to strengthen the EU's foreign policy, although of course we still have to educate our national services in some respects.
Among the most embarrassing experiences I have had as an MEP travelling outside the European Union were those very funny meetings with the ambassadors of Member States where the Union delegate is still seen as an external element or, at best, as a sort of trade or economic attachÃ©.
We are happy that the Galeote report includes our amendment asking the presidency-in-office to take some responsibility for verifying the willingness of Member States' embassies to cooperate with the EU delegations and enhance their role for creating a real common European voice.
An improved Commission external service will bring the greatest benefits if we manage to set up a real common foreign and political service at European level.
The first step in this direction would be to make Mr CFSP part of the Commission: this is necessary if we are to have a common voice in the world.
Mr President, Commissioner, we in our Group agree with the good report by Mr Galeote, apart from one small detail which I will mention in a moment.
When one leaves the European Union, it is shocking to experience the paradox that the Union has a strong image from the outside despite having a practically non-existent image from within.
The necessary coordination does not exist within the European Union.
It is therefore essential for the Union to put its all its weight behind the external services and coordination.
In this respect, we must accept that, with a miserly budget, we are not going to be able to achieve the image, the appropriate coordination, an unequivocal presence in the UNO, or in other international bodies, and we should therefore revise the financial perspectives in that direction.
We should also concentrate on greater coordination of the information received so that we do not have to witness such sad spectacles as the Member States giving differing opinions.
That is why it is important to take the direction indicated by Mr Galeote.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Galeote Quecedo emphasises, in his explanatory statement, one essential point which was completely neglected in the Commission communication on the development of the external service, and that is the absence of any effective functional link between the embassies of the Member States and the Community delegations.
The Commission, as our rapporteur points out, quite rightly, 'does not appear to be aware' that cooperation with Member States' diplomatic services is 'totally inadequate' .
He emphasises that the partnership programme created so that diplomats and officials from Member States could be seconded to the delegations has so far had very disappointing results: only seven national diplomats have been appointed to Community delegations under this scheme
Instead of moving towards the development of a Community external service which is completely independent from those of the Member States, which would give rise to considerable extra costs, particularly as regards training, pointless redundancies and inevitable conflicting responsibilities, the sensible thing to do would be to make use, at Community level, of the experience acquired in a bilateral context, particularly in the aid and cooperation service, the competence and expertise available within the national external services, and their familiarity with the diplomatic practices of their members.
We would then avoid the doubts, and the risk of drifting off course, which are linked to the concept of the development of a Community diplomatic service which would be composed, ex nihilo, of officials totally outside the national diplomatic services, which some people, looking at the matter from the point of view of substitution rather than complementarity, would like to see developing at the same time and completely separately.
Effectiveness and subsidiarity, on the other hand, require that we should move beyond the partnership programme and its current failure, and show some initiative and imagination, so as to create a real osmosis, at the level of human resources, between the embassies of Member States and the Community delegations, in order to encourage the development, in harmonious complementarity, of the closest possible relations with our external partners.
Mr President, it seems to me that we need to distinguish two aspirations which are contained in the Galeote report and which to some extent lead in different directions.
I refer on the one hand to the need to improve the Commission's efficiency in achieving its priority tasks and on the other hand the ambition to create some sort of EU diplomatic service.
The emphasis should be on the first of these, and this is reflected very much in paragraph 1 of the Galeote report which, and I quote: "Insists that the overriding priority for the external service of the Commission must be the efficient organisation and management of EU external assistance programmes".
At a time when enlargement of the Union is a priority - and we have large-scale pre-accession aid programmes to assist this process - it is essential that we have the right number of staff with the right qualifications delivering and monitoring this assistance.
The Commission obviously recognises the priority of reforming external assistance management, as we have seen over the last year or so.
But according to some estimates, there is a shortfall of something like 1 254 posts dealing with priority policy areas.
The Commission does not require more generalists and diplomats in its delegation, it needs competent managers, particularly those with expertise in tendering, contracting and, above all, project implementation; personnel with business experience perhaps.
I wonder if the Commission's recruitment and retirement procedures reflect this priority?
The draft Council regulation on the early retirement of some 600 officials is under consideration at the moment.
I would like to know what steps the Commission is taking to recruit the right sort of people to replace those officials who will be retiring early.
Mr President, the report by Mr Galeote identifies certain shortcomings, which the Commission has already recognised in its communication relating to the reform necessary to improve the Community' s external service and furthermore it puts forward a number of proposals aimed at achieving the best possible operation of that external service.
The importance of his work is accentuated by two factors which have arisen simultaneously in recent times. On the one hand, the role, which is increasingly recognised and accepted by the Union, which we have to play on the globalised international stage, and, on the other hand, the cooperation which we must promote in pursuit of a North-South rebalance and which finds its most obvious embodiment within the framework of the new Cotonou Agreement.
As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to support what Karin Junker said in her opinion, highlighting the essential fact that our external service contributes to the success of those countries which, through development, are seeking freedom and prosperity.
Through the amendments approved by the Committee on Development and Cooperation we ask that the rationalisation of the external service should not mean the closure of delegations in the developing countries.
The reform must take place with a view to increasing the efficiency of action rather than according to exclusively financial criteria.
To this end, the Commission must be present on the ground, the officials must have direct contact with the reality of under-development, with the development agents and the local authorities, and very much increasing support for, and support from, both local and European NGOs.
The creation of delegations with a regional scope is not an acceptable alternative to the closure of delegations in countries such as Cape Verde or Costa Rica.
We also ask that the multi-annual programmes for delegations, announced by the Commission, take account of the development objectives, that local staff be employed, that the officials have specific training and that greater coordination between the Commission delegations and the representations of the Member States be sought.
I believe it would be very positive to open a delegation in a country such as Cuba, which is a pre-candidate to the signing of the Cotonou Agreement and which has been accepted for membership by our partners in the ACP Community.
Mr President, the European Parliament should support the process of decentralising the Commission services so as to bring the European Union closer to its partners.
We are therefore in favour of increasing the number of delegations and increasing their staff numbers in line with their increased responsibilities.
However, cooperation on development should remain the priority of the delegations in developing countries, in particular as regards the planning of aid programmes.
It is important that the representatives who negotiate on behalf of the Commission should be on the spot and in direct contact with the real situation.
In order to do this they should develop relations with the local NGOs and with society in general, so that they can get to know and integrate the priority needs of communities, and not only those of governments in these indicative programmes.
In addition to consultation, we must also increase the number of local agents in the delegations.
It is vitally important that the delegation staff should have an extremely good knowledge of local conditions and should be able to speak regional languages, so as to maintain a permanent link with the various levels of the local community.
In addition, the delegations must propose special training programmes for local experts so as to encourage their recruitment.
Finally, it is urgently necessary to recruit staff who are qualified in social and environmental matters, which have so far been the poor relations of the aid and development programmes drawn up in Brussels.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Galeote, on his highly detailed and substantiated report.
Surely there can be no doubt that this is a particularly serious question which touches on a fundamental aspect of the work of the European Union, i.e. the common foreign and security policy and, hence, the active and efficient presence of the Union on the international stage and its ability to play a leading role in a consistent, coordinated manner, quite independent of any factors extraneous to Europe.
However, this objective cannot be achieved without a suitable, operational tool.
And this tool is none other than a well organised external diplomatic service, with specialised and highly trained cadres to man the Union's delegations or embassies so that, by operating within an institutionalised regulatory framework of relations with the European Parliament and the Council, they can develop into real representatives of Union policy and interests and of the interests of the Member States as a whole.
And in order for this to happen, the diplomatic services and delegations of the Union and of the Member States will need to be properly coordinated. The report anticipates this by making provision for a system of cooperation and agreement to be developed between these services.
Of course, all this needs resources and a great deal of money, which will obviously need to be provided transparently and by carefully weighting requirements and the expediency and usefulness of each item of expenditure, accompanied by a real desire to strengthen the external service so as to ensure that it has the means to fulfil its mission productively.
Finally, special attention must be paid, as the report notes, to arrangements governing relations between the external service and delegations and the European Parliament, both as regards having systemised contacts, with reports and appearances by the heads of the delegations in Parliament and its competent committees, and as regards some of the delegations taking on the job of providing assistance in connection with visits and missions by members of the European Parliament to third countries.
Mr President, I welcome the Galeote report.
It is quite appropriate that we should be reforming the Commission's foreign delegations and examining how they can perform in a much more efficient way, hopefully in the context of a much more coherent common foreign and security policy.
In that context I would like to make some very brief points.
Firstly, with regard to my own experience with the Commission's delegation offices when I was in Sri Lanka, it was excellent to have it as a backup.
It was very helpful to us in discharging our work and coordinating the various EU ambassadors in that area.
In some other experiences I have had with the Commission's external offices I sometimes felt that they can get too close to the local political administration and are somewhat reluctant to take a strong stance on policy and political issues.
It must be made absolutely clear that any of our delegation offices are there not simply to have a cosy relationship with the local administration but to represent EU policy in the wider sense.
My third point, and I am sure it has already been made by my colleague, Georg Jarzembowski, is whether the Commission would respond positively to our repeated request for the establishment of a delegation office in Taiwan.
We have pussyfooted on that issue for far too long.
We should have the courage of our convictions and I hope that the Commissioner would respond positively to the proposal that there should be an office in Taiwan sooner rather than later.
. May I first pay a very warm tribute to the high quality of the work done by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and in particular by the rapporteur Mr Galeote Quecedo who has once again done an excellent job.
We should not forget the important contribution of the Committee on Budgets, with the ever-wise Mr Bourlanges as rapporteur, the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control - I have enjoyed discussing these matters with Mr Blak - and not least the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation drafted by Mrs Junker.
All these documents are also timely as the Commission is now finalising its communication to Parliament on further developments of the external service as a follow-up to the one we presented last July.
I can assure Parliament that the recommendations made in the report are extremely important for the Commission.
I also take them as an encouraging sign that Parliament shares our ambition to make the external service an even more effective instrument of our external policy.
We will, of course, continue to report regularly to Parliament on the progress we make.
Let me offer a number of observations.
First, this Parliament stresses its wish to clarify its relations with the external delegations.
The House may remember that this point was already raised when we discussed Mr Galeote Quecedo's report on a common Community diplomacy last September.
I assured this House that although delegations are formally delegations of the Commission, we have made it absolutely clear that they should regard themselves as serving Parliament, the High Representative and the other Community institutions as well.
In response to some of the points that were made during the debate, of course it is the case that our delegations and the embassies of Member States have to coordinate their activities far more successfully.
This is something that we have debated in the Council.
The delegations should indeed help to arrange programmes for visiting parliamentary delegations and committees.
I also agree that it would be useful for heads of delegations to appear occasionally before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and other committees of Parliament when they are back in Brussels to report on recent developments in their host countries and the development of European Union policy and programmes there.
A second major concern of this Parliament is the so-called deconcentration of our operational activities.
That, as the House knows, is jargon for devolving authority and responsibility where it belongs, to the people in the field.
Parliament will remember that this move to more deconcentration was an explicit commitment of the Commission in its communication of May last year on the external assistance reform, reiterated in the July communication on the external service.
We are now in the middle of the first wave of the deconcentration exercise.
Deconcentration concepts have been established for each major programme.
Staff requirements have been assessed for each delegation.
Officials are in the process of being selected and trained.
Last, but not least, accounting and management systems are being interconnected between headquarters and the delegations concerned.
More then 20 delegations will be strengthened this year, another 30 or so next year and the remaining ones in 2003 and 2004.
I will, of course, report to this House in more detail on deconcentration later in the year, but generally speaking the work is on schedule.
There is one point that I want to emphasise very strongly.
There is nothing whatsoever to be said for deconcentration while retaining a collection of mothers-in-law in Brussels.
If one is going to deconcentrate, then that means management of programmes on the ground.
It does not mean many people second-guessing the people on the ground back in Brussels.
The problem of double emploi, the problem of whether or not we are really going to deconcentrate, is one I feel very strongly about.
As far as I am concerned and as far as the board of EuropeAid is concerned, it is imperative to ensure that among our performance indicators there is one which gives us an indication of progress made in moving all the management of projects into the delegations, where it should be.
We have seen, as somebody pointed out in the debate, the success of deconcentration in Sarajevo and I want to see that success replicated elsewhere, but deconcentration is not just a question of numbers and procedures.
To be successful it requires a real change of administrative culture in the external services of the Commission, at headquarters and in delegations.
In this respect, the rapporteur's insistence on the need to improve and develop our training programmes is very opportune.
Although I am the first to admit that there is still room for improvement in this area, serious efforts have been made and will be continued.
I had the opportunity to take a look at the training programme for our external staff and I was very impressed by it.
It covers not only policy areas such as trade and CFSP, but also practical day-to-day topics and modern management techniques.
It does, of course, need to include all the subjects which are loosely described as gender mainstreaming, to which the honourable Member referred in the debate.
In parallel, the EuropeAid Cooperation Office has set up a very ambitious training programme specifically for the deconcentration exercise.
Parliament may also be interested to know that the first pilot session of the European Diplomatic Programme, which is a common training programme for European diplomats sponsored jointly by the Member States and the Commission, has recently been assessed and deemed to be successful.
The second session is starting this autumn.
This initiative may not be based precisely on the model of a college of European diplomacy, which the Mr Galeote espoused in his report last autumn; but it is a sensible step forward.
I am also aware that the House is expecting to be fully informed by the Commission on the redeployment of human resources, regionalisation of the network and the opening or closing of delegations - a point which I want to return at the end of my remarks.
As these points still have to be decided by the College, I will merely say to the House that the recommendations made in the reports now under discussion will be carefully examined and analysed.
Finally, let me comment on the proposed action plan.
Some of its points, such as the proposal that starting in June of this year each head of delegation signs an annual declaration that adequate internal controls have been put in place, will be considered in the follow-up to the recent discharge resolution.
The House should be aware that heads of delegation already have to sign the new charter of authorising officers, which sets out the tasks entrusted to them, their obligations and their responsibilities.
Other points the House makes concerning, for example, mission statements, redeployment, new delegations, monitoring and evaluation will be tackled in the communication on the development of the external service, which we will be bringing forward shortly.
I hope the message is clear.
We take the reform and development of the external service very seriously.
I have said since I took up office that I want to see the emergence of a modern, effective and streamlined service, working as an integral part of the external relations structures of the Commission, and at the service of all the institutions of the Union.
This is still my objective, shared by my colleagues and by the senior management in the external relations services of the Commission.
But it is a long haul.
It must build on the trust and motivation of the staff, many of them working in difficult conditions far away from their colleagues at headquarters.
It requires careful planning, training and not least funding.
I trust that we can count on Parliament's support and understanding in the work still ahead of us.
One or two honourable Members asked us not to be short of ambition, to be more ambitious in what we do.
I just want to make one very obvious point to Parliament, which may be a little prosaic.
Ambition depends on two things.
First of all, ambition depends on having the money to actually implement your ambitions.
Secondly, ambition depends on being prepared to take tough political decisions in order to achieve your ambitions.
One of my ambitions, and this may be regarded by some as an eccentricity, is to try to ensure that the ambitions in the area for which I am responsible are matched by the funds that we actually have to spend on them.
I also want to see us being prepared to take the tough political decisions that are required to modernise our external service.
But with great respect to the House, it is no good the House on one side telling me that we can never close a delegation; then on the other side people tell us that we should open new delegations and the whole House agreeing that there should be a limit on the number of delegations we can have.
In the past Parliament has insisted that there should be a ceiling on the number of delegations.
I do not object to that, provided that if we have to close some delegations in order to open others, we have the understanding and support of the House.
But if we are to be ambitious, as I would like to be, there has to be an understanding between the Commission and Parliament as well as between the Commission and the Council.
We have to be absolutely open about any tough decisions we have to make.
Then all of us together have to share in taking the political responsibility for those decisions.
Please do not let us get into a situation in which everybody wants to be ambitious but nobody is actually prepared to spend the money to be ambitious or to take the necessary political decisions.
I am looking forward to this debate and to Parliament's understanding as we try together to create the sort of external service which the European Union deserves.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken on Thursday at noon.
Proposal for a Council regulation on GSP for 2002 - 2004
The next item is the Commission communication on the proposal for a Council regulation setting up a generalised system of preferences for 2002 - 2004.
Mr President, the Commission has just - and when I say 'just' , I mean only ten minutes ago - approved the proposal for a generalised system of preferences for 2002-2004 and has also decided to refer this to Parliament.
I am therefore happy to be able to comment on the proposal briefly and to place it in the double context of the common commercial policy on the one hand and the European Union' s strategy on sustainable development and the combating of poverty on the other.
The generalised Community' s system of preferences (GSP) actually lies at the intersection between these two major policies of the Union.
Those of you who are familiar with this subject know that the GSP is exclusively a tariff instrument which was created about thirty years ago, following an initiative by the European Community of the time within UNCTAD, the object of which was to reduce customs duties on industrial exports from developing countries, since its principal raison d' Ãªtre was the industrialisation of the third world.
At the time, high rates of duty were the main obstacle to trade. Of course, things have since changed to some extent, because the average level of duty has gone down.
On the other hand, the non-tariff barriers have grown in relative importance, and we are trying to deal with this question in relation to non-tariff barriers by giving a certain number of countries the financial resources to enable them to improve their institutional capacity and by concluding ad hoc technical agreements with them, such as mutual recognition agreements or agreements on veterinary or plant-health matters.
However, we must not forget that some tariff barriers are still important, even now.
I shall quote a few examples.
In the textile and agriculture sectors, developing countries often have comparatively large advantages, and there we are retaining tariff protection.
In the primary processing sector we still have the combination of zero duty on imported raw materials and significant rates of duty on processed products, those rates corresponding to the degree to which those raw materials have been used. This is known as tariff escalation, and quite rightly, because this method of calculating our tariffs has the effect of discouraging processing on the spot in the country of origin.
Then we also have certain tariff peaks which, despite the fact that we have made them less extreme - to a greater extent than they have done in the United States, for example - are still significant in some cases.
What the Commission is proposing, then, is the updating of the GSP in order to respond to three concerns.
First, there is the question of compensating for the erosion in preferential tariff margins which involves lowering the average tariff levels.
Then there is the need to simplify the system for tariff modulation, according to how sensitive the products are.
We have got rid of some categories.
There were four categories before, whereas now there are only two.
It is more simple, less complicated. It will make the work of operators and customs officers easier and will thus make it possible to raise the GSP take-up rate.
The third concern is that we need to carry out a graduation process, in other words to deal with cases in which we are withdrawing the benefits of the GSP from countries with a high GDP, for products in which their competitiveness has been demonstrated by the relative level of their share of the market.
We believe that, in these circumstances, these countries can do without the GSP for those products, in which case 'graduation' offers new prospects for exports from other, less competitive developing countries, thus giving them a potential advantage in terms of development and the struggle against poverty.
We have carried out this updating of the GSP in order to try to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to give a new, positive signal to the developing countries, to show them that we are determined to meet their expectations with regard to access to the market - this is a result of the 'Everything But Arms' initiative (EBA), hence the idea of recreating the preferential margins - and, on the other hand, the tactical ploy of retaining, with a view to the multilateral tariff-negotiations round, opportunities for additional access to the market.
I am sure we all agree that the developing countries generally, and rightly, acknowledge the special value of a concession which is given in a multilateral context, compared with a unilateral preference.
The former is certain and stable, while the latter remains uncertain.
If we take a rapid overview of the various GSP arrangements, we can see that there are four of them, the general arrangements, which apply to the countries of Asia and Latin America, the only continents not to benefit from bilateral preferential advantages like those which are reserved for the ACP countries and the Mediterranean countries.
In this area, we are respecting the economy in general, restoring the preferential margins, simplifying modulation and applying normal graduation rules.
The second arrangements are for the least developed countries, which were radically improved by the 'Everything But Arms' initiative. They are not affected by this proposal.
The third arrangements relate to social and environmental incentives, such as allocating additional tariff reductions to those countries which effectively implement the framework conventions of the International Labour Organisation and which undertake to ensure that there is sustainable management of tropical rainforests.
These additional tariff reductions have been strengthened, in the Commission' s proposal, in order to correct their current weakness. We have done this, in our proposal, by doubling the preference margin in line with social and environmental commitments.
The fourth and last arrangements are the 'drugs' arrangements for the countries of the Andean Pact and the countries of Central America.
These arrangements have been maintained and extended for a significant period of three years, until 2004.
They deserve your special attention because they fit in with the Union' s great ambition with regard to Latin America and, to some extent, the privileged alliance which links us to that continent, but also because the arrangements are the Union' s main contribution to the fight against drugs, in which these countries are both the scene of operations and the protagonists.
In my view, we should regard the drugs phenomenon in these countries as a symptom, rather than the cause, of the poor level of development that is endemic to this region.
The 'drugs' arrangements are very generous, very similar to the EBA initiative, because they consist in granting access to the Community market, at a 'zero' rate of tariff, for the most important industrial and agricultural products of these middle-income countries.
When I say 'middle-income' I mean with a per capita GDP, at current rates of exchange, of about USD 1 100 for Bolivia, and USD 4 600 for Venezuela, in other words well above the USD 700 per head in the least developed countries.
The primary objective of the 'drugs' arrangements is not to directly replace illegal coca crops, but to promote development for its own sake, to create jobs and to diversify industrial and agricultural production, an area in which these countries are falling behind to an extent which gives rise for concern and which is, in our opinion, one of the factors that encourages the expansion of the production and trafficking of drugs.
We would expect these countries to respond to the special access that we are offering them to the European market by promoting - and in particular European - direct investment, tackling corruption and battling for social justice.
What we want these countries to do is to make more use of our GSP arrangements, while implementing more effective sustainable development strategies that address the root causes of the economic problems, and drugs and violence.
This is the concept of sustainable development, which hinges on job-creating growth, social progress - entailing the effective implementation of ILO framework conventions - and environmental protection, including the sustainable management of the tropical rainforest which is a crucial aspect in this region.
We are therefore proposing to our Andean partners the very close monitoring of their efforts with regard to the diversification of their exports, the anti-drugs campaign and the promotion of these social and environmental aspects.
Some people are already somewhat alarmed by this parallel which the Commission is drawing between the generosity of the 'drugs' arrangements and the concern to evaluate the economic, social and environmental performance of our partner countries.
We must remember that it would be difficult, otherwise, to justify the special nature of the arrangements that specifically apply to Latin America, to which we are linked by a political and economic partnership that is very ambitious compared with our relationship with other countries, and Asian countries in particular, which have a comparable level of development and are also facing the task of combating drugs but do not benefit from the 'drugs' arrangements.
The only way that we can justify this difference is by subjecting these exceptional tariff preferences to standards of implementation that are acceptable to just those countries sharing our European values on sustainable development.
We believe that, as well as being good things in their own right, the encouraging of sound policies, the monitoring that is carried out by the Commission and the resulting dialogue with each country are also the counter-concession which allows the 'drugs' arrangements to escape being called into question, even by a WTO panel, on the grounds that it creates unjustified discrimination between countries benefiting from the Community GSP.
This monitoring is not, therefore, an abusive or offensive intrusion into the internal affairs of these countries.
On the contrary, in our view it is a kind of lightning conductor to deflect any complaints to the WTO by other developing countries.
We expect that at Doha our Latin American partners will be working in close cooperation with us in order to push ahead with the bilateral liberalisation and standardisation which should consolidate, rather than threaten, the 'drugs' GSP arrangements which are specific to the Andean Pact and Central America.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the EBA initiative, this proposal on the new Community GSP, which we are putting forward on the eve of Doha, confirms the priority which the Union intends to give, via the new round, to the integration of developing countries into the world economy, with the aim of achieving a fairer and more sustainable development, and the Commission needs your support in order to achieve this ambitious undertaking.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Commissioner Lamy very much for this initiative.
It is, I believe, an initiative which once again shows far-sightedness and which attempts to solve problems which we all know lie ahead before they even arise.
We all know that we can only enjoy success in world trade if we offer products and services which are also actually bought.
Hence my question: thanks to trade on the Internet we have now attained a very high level of activity internationally in the small consignments sector.
In Europe we have 18 million employers in a labour force of 250 million.
Could you envisage our putting in place appropriate measures for individual small consignments up to a certain number of euros, so that this small-scale trade is also able to develop completely freely, without barriers and without excessive bureaucracy?
I shall reply briefly to Mr RÃŒbig on two topics.
The first of these concerns the nature of the existing obstacles to imports.
Broadly speaking, there are two categories of obstacles, customs barriers, whether tariff or quantitative, and more technical barriers.
As far as tariff barriers and quantitative barriers and concerned, I believe that, with the 'Everything But Arms' initiative and with the enhanced GSP which we are proposing now, the developing countries' access to our market, particularly via modern, electronic means, is satisfactory.
Then there is the question of customs procedures, and in particular the implementation of inspections related to the rules of origin.
Inasmuch as we are giving specific customs advantages, as compared with a most-favoured-nation clause, we cannot risk ignoring the existence of rules of origin and therefore of certificates, which require customs procedures.
So, on the one hand we are dealing with tariffs, but on the other hand, because we are dealing with tariffs, we need rules of origin and therefore customs procedures, so customs procedures will continue to exist.
Having said that, I should explain that these customs procedures apply subject to exemptions which are conditional upon the value of consignments, and which to some extent transactions via the Internet will not pick up.
In other words, as long as you remain below a certain number of exemptions, Internet exports can go ahead without any customs procedures.
Beyond that, I think that for the time being, unless we run into any serious and dangerous problems over rules of origin, we should retain a certain number of formalities.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lamy for his presentation.
I have a few questions.
I was very glad to hear what you said about tariff escalation.
Could say a little more about the specific actions that will be undertaken within this new GSP scheme and the particular margins that might be anticipated on that particular issue?
Secondly, regarding enhanced GSP that will, hopefully, provide an incentive for improved social and environmental performance, could you say how successful the existing scheme has been, and whether you think a doubling is going to be enough?
A doubling sounds very good, but we are starting from an extremely low base.
One can always say it is never enough but do you seriously think you have any indications that this is going to attract more people into the scheme than before?
I also have a question about the longer term.
Given as you say that the value of GSP is being eroded all the time because of the lowering of tariffs overall, what other mechanisms would you foresee in order to try to strengthen social and environmental performance among different developing countries?
The GSP, or its worth, is not going to be there for ever, as tariffs go down across the board.
Finally, could you say little more about human rights violations as a whole?
The enhanced GSP system obviously works as a system of incentives.
Have you had any thoughts about whether it might be necessary to reform the GSP, so that those who are perpetrating human rights violations, Colombia in particular, are actually excluded from the scheme across the board?
I shall reply to the various points raised by Mrs Lucas.
Regarding the problems of tariff escalation, inasmuch as we are increasing the preference margin, we are reducing, by that amount, the difference caused by tariff escalation. However, and on this point I am absolutely clear, we are not changing the tariff-escalation system to any great extent.
There will still be a zero rate for certain products.
Tariff escalation comes into play, but its impact is reduced by the preference margin that we are offering.
As for the generalised system of preferences, from the point of view of its providing an incentive for social and environmental performance, the Commission thought it would be useful to go further, in other words to double the preference already granted, because it shares what I think is the view implied by your question, i.e. that at the moment the scheme has not given rise to many specific projects.
As far as social matters are concerned, in our proposal we have introduced an innovation, to the extent that we now refer to the International Labour Organisation as regards what amounts, to some extent, to the certification of the advantages that we are granting.
This is an innovation which I would draw to your attention and which has the double effect of making the diagnosis more objective, if I can use that word, and also of giving the ILO a greater profile in this international social governance which is, as you know, one of our objectives.
On the subject of drugs we have also been innovative, because we have made provision, in the countries which benefit from the GSP, for 'drug-specific' monitoring in relation to social conditions and also in relation to environmental conditions. In the case of social conditions, this takes place with reference to the ILO framework conventions, and in the case of environmental conditions it takes place in the context of tropical rainforest management, which more or less coincides geographically with the region in question.
Therefore, from this point of view, conditionality via monitoring is increased, and I believe that I was attempting, in this proposal, to bear in mind, as you are doing, certain specific cases in which what was happening on the ground in relation to social rights did not necessarily comply with the spirit of the agreements between the Union and the countries in question.
To come to your last point, as far as preferences are concerned, whether for social performance or environmental performance, have we any alternative?
As you know, we took a decision of principle, to the effect that, when taking into consideration social and environmental questions, we should not come down too heavily on the side of sanctions, but opt instead for incentives.
We are therefore increasing the incentive here. We are making it clearer and more objective, with reference to a certain number of standards, but we are not coming down on the sanctions side.
What we already have in unilateral and bilateral form, where we have greater room to manuvre, must be translated into multilateral form, though probably in a more diluted form, in the multilateral negotiations in preparation for the Doha round, and you know what the Union' s mandate is there.
In view of the fact that the WTO is a multilateral institution, we are obliged to make certain compromises in WTO negotiations which we do not necessarily have to make in bilateral negotiations and which we do not have to make at all when it comes to unilateral measures.
Finally, on the problem of human rights violations, we are dealing with this on the basis of the specific ILO conventions, and in particular the convention on forced labour and slavery.
This proposal includes temporary withdrawal in the case of slavery or forced labour.
This was already included in the previous proposal.
We are now adding to it violations of the fundamental social standards covered by the five ILO basic conventions, so on this point we have to some extent added to what was already included and was also, as you know, applied in the case of Burma.
Mr President, thank you for your comments, Commissioner Lamy.
In making them you have already answered part of the first question which I am about to put to you.
I should like to come back once more to the system of incentives in the GSP, in the generalised system of preferences, which has of course been extended to social policy and the environment.
From what I have heard, this programme - which I consider to be very sensible - has not yet met with the desired response in the countries concerned.
At this early stage, and leaving aside the fact that the scheme does not of course impose any negative penalties, do you have any indications why the response has been so poor?
The second question is: has an assessment been made of the extent to which the large free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, which is of course planned by the USA and within which it is intended to reduce tariffs to zero would - if it ever becomes a reality - impair or stimulate trade with us in particular in the generalised system of preferences?
Has the Commission already considered this?
I have one final question on the WTO: recently it was written that people would actually welcome a decision in Qatar to open a new negotiating round in various sectors.
Can you say anything more about this?
I shall reply to the three questions from Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler.
On the first question, the current use of social or environmental incentive clauses, we have so far received four applications with reference to the social incentive clause.
These applications are from Moldavia, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia.
Of these four applications, one of them, and I believe I am right in saying it was the Moldavian application, was accepted immediately.
The others are being examined.
It is not a very long list, in fact it is a short list if you think of how many countries could be interested in the scheme in theory.
Why is it not a longer list?
In my opinion there are two reasons. The first of these is concerned with a matter of principle: a certain number of developing countries do not, as a matter of principle, wish to make a link between a commercial advantage and the observance of social standards.
This is not a unanimous position, nor is it equally firm in every country.
The spectrum is relatively broad, but it still poses problems sometimes.
We are aware of this, and it is a matter for the countries in question to decide; that is their right, their understanding of the matter, and they are sovereign.
We simply believe that, by increasing the margin and the advantage that they might gain from 'matching' these criteria, we can perhaps give some countries, who may be hesitating and who may be undecided between economic advantages and matters of principle, a nudge in what we believe to be the right direction.
On the second question, the North-South America free trade zone, at the moment negotiations are proceeding between the 34 countries of the American continent.
These negotiations have been going on for almost five years and will probably last another five.
In the short term, therefore, this is not a problem, and it does not affect the relative advantage that we give to countries in that region under the 'drugs' regime, whether in Central America, the Andes region or the member countries of the Andean Pact.
In a sense, we are each making a contribution, the United States in various forms, in particular credits and operations, while our contribution is commercial in nature.
We each have our own way of doing things and I think that, from that point of view, the negotiations on the North-South America free trade zone will not change anything very much in the short term.
In the medium and long term, it will all depend on the level of tariff preference that they achieve, and this is still an unknown factor.
As for the last question, the prospects in Qatar, as you are no doubt aware, since you are one of the specialists on this subject, we are working flat out, with a number of developing countries, with a view to improving their perception of the advantage that would accrue to them as a result of starting a new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar.
We are making quite good progress here.
For example, looking at the results of last week' s meeting of APEC trade ministers from countries bordering on the Pacific, we can see that progress has been made on this subject.
In addition, we are working, at this very moment, with the new administration in the United States of America, again at full stretch, to try to ensure that the summit between the United States and the European Union which is to take place next Thursday morning, at the European Council in Gothenburg, will be able, on this point, to give a signal that will help to demonstrate that the movement has now been launched.
Thank you Commissioner.
We all recognise that you have an extremely important portfolio to carry out on behalf of the Community at the present time.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0437/01):
Subject: Irregularities in SENSUS and EUROPOLIS projects The AVENTINUS project and its successor, the SENSUS project, have been subsidised by the Commission since 1996. Both projects seek to develop an information-exchange programme for European police and intelligence services.
Coordination is in the hands of Stephan Bodenkamp/ Christoph Klonowski of the German Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst).
On 25 May 1999, the original Decision E/1791/97 of 3 September 1997 was amended so as to enable Europol to join the project (E/696/99).
In November 1999 Europol effectively joined the ranks of SENSUS partners Gesellschaft fÃŒr multilinguale Systeme mbH (Multilingual Systems Company, Ltd) and the Italian firm Datamat.
Despite the conviction of coordinator Stephan Bodenkamp/Christoph Klonowski for forgery and the formation of the dubious SENSUS-Bundesnachrichtendienst-L&H-Sail Labs complex, Europol awarded a new contract worth 20 million euro at the beginning of 2001.
Will the Council arrange for an external audit of the AVENTINUS, SENSUS and EUROPOLIS projects to be conducted in order to eliminate irregularities and come up with a transparent project?
If not, why not?
I will be very brief.
The honourable Member is informed that the projects referred to in his question only fall within the authority of the European Commission.
Mr President, you clearly need not have rushed, for the Council' s response was indeed very brief.
It surprises me that this question should fall within the exclusive remit of the Commission, but that it was deemed admissible for this Question Time to the Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, the response illustrates that there is an urgent need for democratic control of Europol.
I am indeed familiar with Article 30 of the Treaty on European Union, but there is no denying the fact that the case file is as it stands.
It is likely that Europol uses stolen information technology, and this at the expense of a German firm which was led to the brink of bankruptcy.
The services of the German intelligence service were called in, and the case involved many tens of millions of European government money.
A Europol employee is being arrested as we speak, and other arrests may be imminent.
I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to agree on a drastic overhaul of Europol.
If not, what is the reason for that decision, and why does the Council give its blessing to police cooperation getting off to such a bad start?
Let me stress that I share Mr Staes' concern over information on irregularities within Europol.
Today' s newspapers contain articles on incidents and arrests due to the alleged irregularities.
The problems which Mr Staes brought up are certainly real.
However, once again I would point out that it is the Commission' s responsibility to deal with these issues.
I am also sure that Europol, which comes under the supervision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, has regulations on auditing and accounts, etc. which are designed in a way which makes it possible to quickly discover the type of inaccuracies and irregularities mentioned by Mr Staes.
I am glad that he has brought up this important issue and I am sorry that, as President-in-Office, I cannot provide more details, as it lies outside the competence of the Council.
However, I hope that we will jointly ensure that we avoid hearing about such incidents in the future.
Mr President-in-Office, most of us can admire the tactics and future tasks to be conducted by Europol as an organisation.
We all know that it is a very necessary organisation.
You identified a new structure for Europol in the future.
Are there any plans to bring Europol under democratic control?
The Council believes that Europol is already under democratic control. I am not aware of any proposals aimed at changing the control system for Europol.
Question No 2 by (H-0439/01):
Subject: Political dialogue meetings with Turkey In its answer to written question P-0054/01, the Council stated that Turkey would 'remove any legal provisions forbidding the use by Turkish citizens of their mother tongue in TV/radio broadcasting (short-term)'.
Turkey would also 'develop a comprehensive approach to reduce regional disparities, and in particular to improve the situation in the South-East, with a view to enhancing economic, social and cultural opportunities for all citizens (short-term)'.
What progress has been made with realising those short-term aims?
Has Turkey made a start in moving towards them?
Has it given any serious thought to how it will achieve the long-term aims stated ('ensure cultural diversity and guarantee cultural rights for all citizens')?
Will the Council urge the Turkish authorities actively to implement the review announced by them of their policy towards the Caucasus and to open the borders with Armenia?
In reply to a question from Mrs Frahm, at the meeting in February, I had the opportunity of presenting the provisions in the Accession Partnership for Turkey concerning the area brought up by Mrs Maes in her question.
As we know, the Council adopted the Accession Partnership on 8 March 2001.
Turkey' s response came in the form of a national programme for implementing the legislation adopted by the Turkish government on 19 March.
The Commission is currently examining the content of Turkey' s national programme, including looking at the extent to which it agrees with the Accession Partnership on the points brought up by Mrs Maes in her question.
The assessment will be conducted by the Commission within the framework of the progress report to be presented to the Council in the autumn.
The Council has noted that the Commission' s preliminary analysis proposes that, with regard to the political criteria, considerably more effort should be demanded in the areas of abolishing the death penalty and of cultural rights for all citizens regardless of origin.
In this context it is important to remember that the fact that something is included in the national programme for implementing legislation or that the legislation has been adopted is not sufficient.
The European Union makes greater demands than that.
It is implementation which is important, and we all know that Turkey must ensure that what is written in the programme is also put into practice.
Therefore, it is important that the various bodies for monitoring the Association Agreement really monitor the way the Turkish government is realising the undertakings contained in the programme in practice.
The Council will actively continue to urge and encourage Turkey to carry out reforms in the areas brought up by Mrs Maes, as there is much room for improvement.
Therefore, the issues taken up will continue to be top of the agenda in the improved political dialogue.
With regard to Turkey' s policy on the Southern Caucasus, and in particular links with Armenia, the Council is urging Turkey to play an active role in efforts to strengthen peace and welfare in the area.
The EU Troika, led by the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited the region in February.
After the visit, the General Affairs Council also adopted conclusions.
Consequently, the dialogue on the Southern Caucasus will regularly continue in high-level meetings with Turkey.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am naturally not entirely satisfied with your response.
That is hardly surprising.
I do have some understanding for the time aspect.
It is important for matters to be looked into thoroughly, but I share your view entirely that paper is not sufficient.
There is a saying in Dutch, 'papier is geduldig' [paper can wait], and I am certain that this proverb also exists in other languages.
Implementation is the most important aspect, and the inspectorates should therefore show a very high level of independence in order to actually monitor implementation.
Indeed, we often note that candidate countries go out of their way to create the impression that all is well.
Turkey is, in fact, unable to do this at the moment, for extremely tragic events are unfolding in Turkish prisons, and - although I do not wish to discuss this now - there are still people who are risking their lives, or having them endangered by others, on a daily basis because no dialogue is being entered into.
This approach seems to be at odds with the sound measures taken on behalf of minorities.
I hope that the Troika can be firm but fair in its conclusions.
Let me say, finally, that the Council naturally shares Mrs Maes' concern over the situation in Turkish prisons.
If I remember correctly, the hunger strikes in Turkish prisons have so far cost 23 lives.
This development, which the Council is monitoring carefully, is deeply disturbing.
The trial of the Fazilet Party is also under way.
As a judgement has not yet been made, it is too early to express an opinion on any possible consequences.
However, generally speaking it can be said that banning political parties is hardly a solution to Turkey' s political and economic problems.
On this occasion, as on previous occasions, I am grateful to be able to draw attention to this incredibly important issue, along with Mrs Maes, i.e. the way human rights are developing in Turkey.
We should all monitor this vital issue carefully in the future.
Question No 3 by (H-0444/01):
Subject: Bilingualism in Istria On 9 April 2001 the Regional Council of Istria (Croatia) adopted a regional statute which provides for parity between Italian and Croatian in all regional institutions and all procedures of administrative bodies.
Unfortunately, on 23 April 2001 these rules were suspended by the Croatian Ministry of Justice, which argued that their constitutionality had to be confirmed. This is despite the universal view that they are consistent with the spirit and letter of the Croatian constitution (or Fundamental Charter).
There is great consternation and concern at the serious problems which would be created for the Italian-speaking population, given that Italy's status as a friendly nation and founder member of the EU should ensure the existence of full Italian/Croatian bilingualism in the border areas.
Can the Council state what action it intends to take, and in what quarters, to ensure that:
the Croatian government acts to restore the suspended rules immediately, confirming their constitutionality as soon as possible;
no 'political impasse' develops which could block Croatia's further progress in establishing closer relations with the EU should the decision of the Croatian government be such as to cast doubt on Zagreb's pro-European stance;
the basic principles and 'acquis' of the EU are reaffirmed and there is no question of suspending the right of the Italian-speaking minority to recognition of its cultural identity or that right being declared unconstitutional.
Let me assure the honourable Member that respect for and protection of minorities is an important issue for the Council in general and the Swedish Presidency in particular.
Respect for and protection of minorities is a condition built into EU policy towards those countries covered by the Stabilisation and Association Process in South Eastern Europe.
Croatia is, as we all know, one of these countries.
The Stabilisation and Association Process, which will hopefully bring these countries closer to European integration, is followed and monitored carefully by the Council.
Mr PodestÃ  can rest assured that developments in the region are monitored carefully also with regard to human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.
Let me point out that the General Affairs Council of 11 June approved a progress report on the Stabilisation and Association Process, including an assessment of Croatia.
In this assessment, the Council welcomes the progress already made by the new Croatian Government since it was sworn in last year.
Important results have been achieved in many areas, but we would also highlight certain issues which require more action.
One such issue is the adoption of a new law to protect minorities.
There is already draft legislation, and I am convinced that Croatia will adopt this and implement it appropriately.
The Council is already monitoring these issues.
The particular issue of bilingualism in Istria, where there is a fairly large Italian minority, and the position with regard to the regional statute recently adopted by the regional council of Istria are currently being dealt with by Croatia' s administrative court.
We look forward to the court' s pronouncement, and we will continue to monitor the issue carefully in our dealings with Croatia.
President Danielsson, thank you for that answer and I am pleased to hear what the Council decided yesterday on the matter.
However, you leave it to me to confirm that respect for minorities is truly part of the founding spirit of the Union, as is respect for cultural diversity, and multilingualism obviously represents an immediate aspect of that.
The ominous fact is that the regional statute adopted by the Regional Council of Istria on 9 April has been suspended, giving the constitutional court a further year to check for any unconstitutionality.
Considering that this was also a principal reason for the resignation of the Croatian Minister for Integration, I am wondering whether there is an internal struggle going on to the detriment of the Italian-speaking minority, or whether, instead - and this would be even more serious - the Croatian constitution really does not protect minorities and particular cultures.
I wonder how the Croatian government can think about moving towards membership of the European Union with such attitudes.
Let me stress the value of the Stabilisation and Association Process in carefully addressing this type of question.
We know that in many places in Europe protection of minorities and their rights is a very difficult issue.
I believe that the European Union is carrying out one of its many important initiatives, as this process and this agreement, even with countries which are not yet candidates for membership, enables us to follow developments and point out where we believe that developments are not progressing in the right direction.
The report adopted by the Council yesterday allows for a certain amount of optimism.
We are now waiting for the decision of the constitutional court and we are continuing to monitor the issue carefully.
Question No 4 by(H-0446/01):
Subject: Changes in fishing effort and increase in gillnet use affecting reproductive stock The hake fishery underwent a fundamental change over the second half of the 90s, notably thanks to the appearance of large numbers of gillnet vessels, which by 1999 accounted for over 20% of landings, as opposed to only 4% in 1994.
Given that with this form of fishing the effort is measured on the basis of net length and the number of times the nets enter the sea, this shift in method has led to a significant increase in the actual fishing effort, in respect of a reproductive stock already affected by a fall in numbers to below the precautionary level over the 90s.
What action has the Council taken to limit this uncontrolled effort and its adverse effects on the reproductive stock?
Have limits been placed on the number and length of the nets which can be used at each tide?
The Council is aware of the critical situation for hake stocks in Community waters and of the impact which increased use of gillnets in hake fishing may have on these stocks.
However, there are specific technical regulations which control the use of gillnets for hake fishing or which specifically aim to limit the strain on fish which this type of equipment causes, e.g. limits to the number of nets, the length of the nets or the time they are allowed to be left in the water.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea is no doubt aware that it is the Commission' s responsibility to monitor conformity with regulations in the Common Fisheries Policy and if necessary take suitable measures and also propose new legislation for this purpose.
In this respect, I would like to call to Mr Ortuondo Larrea' s attention the emergency measures for hake stock recovery which the Commission is currently drawing up in close cooperation with Member States.
Question No 5 by (H-0453/01):
Subject: Debate on reform of the Treaties What accounts for the Swedish Presidency's virtual silence and lack of significant initiatives regarding the reform of the Treaties and the planned EU Constitution?
As the honourable Member knows, the European Council in Nice adopted a declaration which was appended to the Final Act, in which the measures which the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies would take were clearly set out.
In this context, on 7 March 2001 the Swedish Presidency, the coming Belgian Presidency, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission made a joint declaration which formally opened the debate on the future development of the EU.
The hope is that, based on a number of operational centres and a variety of contributions, a debate will be promoted which has greater scope than ever before.
The debate will be concentrated on the fundamental challenges which the European Union is facing in the decades ahead and will stimulate proposals on how these challenges are to be met rationally when it comes to policy decisions, institutions and organisation of the work.
In order to be able to create a 'citizens' forum' - a place where all the elements of the debate can be collected and made available - the website 'Future of Europe' was opened on the same day.
The first contribution to the debate was made by Swedish Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and President of the Commission Romano Prodi in order to inspire others to follow suit.
On the same day the Swedish Prime Minister wrote to his colleagues in the Member States and candidate countries, inviting them to take part, for example by contributing to the website.
The Prime Minister also sent similar letters to the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees (COSAC) and labour market partners.
Opening the debate in this way has meant that, even at this early stage, a large number of initiatives have been taken in Member States, candidate countries and by the EU institutions, in various debate forums.
So far everyone has been interested in a truly open and broad debate on the future of the European Union in the spirit of the Nice Declaration.
I am convinced that the debate will take off over the next few months as more contributions are made.
In addition, the Swedish Presidency has drawn up a status report ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg, in which facts are presented on the initiatives taken at national and European level to promote wide-ranging discussions between all parties, including representatives of national parliaments, political, economic and academic circles, civil society, etc. We also highlight in this report certain trends which we believe can be seen in the debate with regard to the next phase of preparatory work for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
When it comes to fulfilling the undertakings in the declaration on the future of the European Union, it is up to the Belgian Presidency to continue reflecting on the initiatives needed for this process to continue.
The plan is that a declaration on this issue should be adopted at the European Council in Laeken in December.
Therefore I believe that Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n' s comment regarding silence and lack of significant initiatives is incorrect.
On the contrary, the Swedish Presidency has followed the Nice Declaration fully in actively trying to stimulate an important debate on the future of the European Union through a wide range of initiatives.
I have asked this question now that the six months of the Swedish Presidency are coming to an end, aware that the Presidency of your country has not done enough to respond to the resolution on the Treaty of Nice, which you have mentioned, and to the anxieties of European society.
I believe that European society sees Nice as a total failure and I also believe that this failure, amongst other things, has led to the fact that Ireland has voted no in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice, in the face of the idleness of the Irish Government, and also, although this time in positive terms, the fact that Mr Jospin, Prime Minister of France, and Mr SchrÃ¶der, Chancellor of Germany, proposed something which seven or eight months ago they would not have dared to propose, that is, the future existence of a European Constitution.
I believe that the Swedish Presidency has not been up to the task in this fundamental debate, and it should have been the Prime Minister of Sweden who took the initiative and not the Presidents of France or Germany.
Furthermore, the Swedish Presidency has not been up to the task in relation to the essential issue of the Structural Funds, an issue which is so important for my country.
I am sorry that the honourable Member has not visited the website on the debate on the future of the European Union, which I referred to earlier.
Had he done so, he would have been able to read the contribution from the Swedish Prime Minister, in which he considers the particular issues which Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n has brought up.
He may not come to exactly the same conclusion as Mr Jospin and Mr SchrÃ¶der, but I assume that Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n does not want uniformity in the debate, but diversity.
This is exactly what you get on our website, where you can also read the opinion of the President-in-Office.
I have a follow-up question for the honourable Council representative.
You refer to the Treaty of Nice, but is it not the case that the Treaty states that if it is to be adopted, all countries must approve it in line with their constitution?
Ireland has said no to the Treaty of Nice.
If the EU follows its own rules, should it not stop following the Treaty of Nice and realise that it has failed?
The honourable Member is bringing up a separate issue.
I do not believe I referred to the Treaty of Nice in the way which Mr SjÃ¶stedt suggests.
I was referring to the declaration of the European Council in Nice on the debate on the future of the EU.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt is talking about events in Ireland, which is another important issue which I know there will be an opportunity to debate tomorrow, for example with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs when she reports on plans ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg, where the issue of events in Ireland will naturally be an important component.
Even so, let me say that the ratification process for the Treaty of Nice will continue in the various Member States for another few months, possibly even up to a year.
I note the statements from the Irish government regarding the continuing process in Ireland.
Therefore, I believe there is reason to return to this.
I believe it is far too early to say that the Treaty of Nice "has failed" as Mr SjÃ¶stedt suggests.
Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, I am sure that you know the Rules of Procedure and that you may, therefore, only ask for the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to express my great surprise at the fact that, in order to find out what is going on in Europe, I have to look at a specific Web page!
Question No 6 by (H-0456/01):
Subject: Police action during the Gothenburg Summit EU summit meetings tend to be met with popular demonstrations which, in turn, provoke repressive police action.
This happened in MalmÃ¶ when the EU Finance Ministers convened on 21 April, and it is expected to happen again during the Gothenburg summit in June, where President Bush will also be present.
It has been reported that Mr Bush will be accompanied by a large number of security staff.
It must be assumed that there has been consultation, coordination and cooperation between US security staff and Swedish security staff in preparing for the Gothenburg Summit.
Was police action in MalmÃ¶ planned and carried out as a pre-Gothenburg exercise?
Were US staff present or otherwise involved in the police operation in Malmo?
Who has final authority and responsibility for the security of the Summit participants?
Does it entirely rest with the Swedish Government, or does the US staff have any kind of autonomous authority as regards the security of President Bush and his entourage?
Police action during the European Council in Gothenburg does not fall within the competence of the Council.
That is what I call a short answer.
However, I thought that the European Council was a matter for the Presidency. It therefore surprises me that the Presidency currently has no answer to my question.
If things go well, as we and the Swedish police in Gothenburg, who appear to be prepared for a peaceful summit, hope, perhaps the issue will not become pressing.
If, however, things go badly, it would be extraordinary if the President-in-Office of the Council, who is also part of the Swedish Government, had no interest in or responsibility for this matter.
This is remarkable.
I wonder who does have responsibility.
As I assume that Herman Schmid does not require any interpretation of what I said, I would like to repeat that "police action during the European Council in Gothenburg does not fall within the competence of the Council" .
The European Council in itself is a Council issue.
I hope that Herman Schmid shares my view that police action should remain a national issue.
However, let me take this opportunity to explain that the Presidency is planning widespread activities in conjunction with the European Council in Gothenburg, which will involve dialogue with everyone who has views on the operation of the European Union.
Large sections of the Swedish Government will be on hand to meet and talk to various groups who have views on the operation of the European Union in general and the European Council in Gothenburg in particular.
The Presidency will do what is required of it, i.e. ensure that the European Council in Gothenburg is a substantial success and that it will also be a way of showing that it is possible to open up even Summit discussions and make them somewhat broader in scope than was previously the case.
Question No 7 by (H-0483/01):
Subject: Recording of details of members of the public in the SIS register in connection with the demonstrations in MalmÃ¶ Demonstrations critical of the EU and EMU took place when the ECOFIN Council met in MalmÃ¶ in April.
A demonstration by people critical of the European Union was attacked by police, more than 250 people were arrested and many were ill-treated by the police.
Those arrested had to identify themselves to the police.
The police also systematically made video recordings of peaceful demonstrators.
According to reports on Swedish radio, the Swedish security police is recording details of people who are critical of the EU ahead of the EU summit in Gothenburg.
Under the Schengen Agreement, details of people regarded as posing a threat to a country's internal security may be recorded in the SIS.
Have details of anyone been entered in the SIS because they took part in the demonstrations in MalmÃ¶ or because they are critical of the European Union?
Mr SjÃ¶stedt' s question refers to the hypothetical recording of information in the Schengen Information System (SIS).
Let me point out that in accordance with Article 105 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, responsibility lies exclusively with the Contracting Parties with regard to ensuring that reports entered into SIS are correct, up to date and legal.
In accordance with Article 104, the law applying to reports will be the national law of the reporting Contracting Party.
It should also be borne in mind that in Sweden, as in other Member States which have adopted the Schengen Agreement, there is an authority with responsibility for independent monitoring of the national Schengen Information System.
Anyone is entitled to demand that the monitoring authority check the reports in SIS which concern them and the way this information is used.
This check must be carried out in accordance with Swedish law.
Let me take off my Presidency hat just for a while and put on my Swedish hat and inform Mr SjÃ¶stedt that, for safety' s sake, I asked the same question as Mr SjÃ¶stedt about whether any people were registered in SIS by the Swedish authorities because they took part in the demonstration in MalmÃ¶ or because they are critical of the EU.
A check revealed the answer to both these questions to be an unequivocal no.
I thank the honourable Council representative for that unusually clear reply.
I am happy with this answer, as I think it is important.
I would still like to ask, perhaps with my Swedish hat on, why the Swedish Security Police has systematically videoed peaceful anti-EU demonstrators in demonstrations where no incidents whatsoever occur.
Is this in line with the usual freedom of speech and right to demonstrate?
As President-in-Office, I definitely have no authority to answer the question.
Nor do I have the authority, as a representative of the Swedish Government, to answer questions on exercising public authority.
As it has proven possible to swap hats, I also have a question.
Detailed information has been printed in the press, including GÃ¶teborgsposten, suggesting that US security services have been highly active in preparations for the Summit.
They appear to have been in position in Sweden for a number of weeks.
I do not know whether the information is incorrect, but it refers to named Gothenburg police officers. Nor have I seen any denial on their part.
Therefore, it would also be interesting to know whether events in MalmÃ¶ were also part of the preparations made with the American security services.
Can we have any information on this matter?
If not, the door is left open for speculation, which is hardly in the interests of the Swedish Government.
It is not in the interests of the Swedish Government to contribute to speculation.
Nor, however, is it in the interests of the Swedish Government to speak on issues for which independent Swedish authorities are responsible.
Question No 9 by (H-0462/01):
Subject: Danone and Marks & Spencers closures If anyone was still harbouring the illusion that there was any life left in the 'mixed economy' and the 'European social model', the brutal cynicism evinced by the announcement of closures by Danone and Marks & Spencers leave no doubt about the fact that those ideas have had their day.
Company restructuring was understandable in the context of undertakings facing real economic problems.
It is, however, utterly unacceptable on the part of healthy, wealthy undertakings who 'restructure' purely and simply in pursuit of increased capital gains.
Our governments have reacted decisively to the agricultural crises; wilful, savage action in the name of profits, resulting in the destruction of whole families - ought to elicit an equally decisive response - not least because if it does not, such action will snowball.
What are you going to do?
The Council would remind the honourable Member that the Council is not authorised to monitor the implementation of legislation and therefore is not permitted to comment on events and developments in individual companies.
However, the Community legislation which must be followed in this area concerns the following instruments: the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies, the Council Directive on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees and the Council Directive extending the latter directive to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
With regard to the criticism which may have been levelled against the Community legislation, including the criticism that company management is not forbidden from deciding to close down unprofitable sections of their companies in situations where the company as a whole is profitable or that employers which have breached the requirement for information and consultation have not been punished sufficiently, the Council would like to state that it can only act on the basis of proposals from the Commission.
If the Commission were to put forward such a proposal for consideration by the Council, which has not yet happened, the Council would be prepared to act quickly.
I would like to emphasise that the Council took a decision yesterday on the Commission' s proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in companies operating at national level in Member States.
This directive is intended to apply to areas such as the situation, structure and probable development of employment in companies and to planned decisions from the management which are expected to lead to major changes to the organisation of work or to the associated contractual links.
During the review which can now be carried out, the Council will give due attention to the recent events which the honourable Member has brought up.
Mr President, Minister, I listened carefully to the reply that you gave and I too am pleased at the decision taken yesterday by the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs.
I also noted that you attributed the responsibility of many of our current problems to the European Commission, because, as you said, the Commission has not submitted for your consideration any measures to deal with the very serious situation which we are in.
I would like you to clarify two points - the first is on effective sanctions, in the event that the rules are flouted, as happened with yesterday' s agreement.
I would like you to provide clarification on this point.
I would also like you to explain the situation of non-British employees working in establishments in the rest of Europe between 2004 and 2009.
Mr President, my last question is what can I, as an MEP, say to the employees who are shown the door by their employers, who are making a profit, when they know that the only reason why they are being laid off is to push up the profits.
Can I be satisfied by telling them that the Council cannot do anything because the Commission has not made a proposal?
I know that this is not what you believe, as a man and as a member of parliament, and I would like to have a slightly more firm commitment from yourself on this issue.
I believe that the decision taken yesterday provides exactly the answer you were looking for on the well-founded questions which you receive from employees who unlawfully lose their jobs.
The Council hopes that the Directive on information and consultation will actually become a meaningful instrument which provides a legal process for such issues in the future.
It is a directive on which we have worked hard throughout the Swedish Presidency. We therefore regard it as a major success that we actually managed to achieve agreement on this issue yesterday, which I must say I did not think would happen.
I must ask to return to your detailed questions at a later date.
The discussion in the Council went on until the very last moment yesterday.
A number of amendments were made late in the evening, and I have not yet been able to receive a full report from my colleague Mrs Sahlin, the minister responsible.
I would therefore request that I may get back to you with more precise answers to you detailed questions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, like you, welcome the decision that was taken yesterday in the Social Affairs and Employment Council to finally adopt this draft directive on information and consultation.
It is a great result for the Swedish Presidency.
There is still, however, a crucial problem which, in my view, is not simply a trifling detail and this is the problem of sanctions.
Yet, it turns out that the Council did not support the proposal made by the Commission and by Mrs Diamantopoulou, to provide for, in the form of sanctions, the overturning of decisions taken on mass redundancies, which could arise from a breach of the procedure on information and consultation and, therefore, as a result, to provide for the possibility of re-establishing the contracts of employment of employees who would have been made redundant, in breach of the European directive.
Are you willing, would the Council be willing, to re-introduce this point in the text if, at second reading, Parliament again adopts the proposal which was put forward by the Commission?
A directive without genuine sanctions that work as a deterrent would be totally ineffective and would not protect workers.
As the honourable Member no doubt understands, it is very difficult, not to say impossible, to answer the hypothetical question.
I believe that the compromise reached yesterday was quite difficult to achieve.
As I said, we have worked long and hard on this issue in the Council, and we have had many difficult discussions.
I simply cannot predict what position the Council would take in the hypothetical discussion you describe.
For the time being, let us be happy about the progress represented by yesterday' s decision.
It is certainly progress which can be further improved, but I still believe that this constitutes an important step for Europe' s workers.
As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 11 and 12 shall be taken together.
Question No 11 by (H-0469/01):
Subject: Position of the Swedish Presidency on the introduction of a tax on international financial transactions In answer to the questions put to it last month, the Council stated that it had not included the subject of the 'Tobin tax' on the agenda for the ECOFIN Council, even though Mrs Lena Hjelm-WallÃ©n, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, had declared on 23 March of this year that she approved of the 'Tobin tax'.
In recent weeks, certain Member States such as Finland have declared their support for a tax of this kind, while a number of members of parliament (from Europe, Canada and the United States) have issued an international appeal in support of the 'Tobin tax'.
In view of these recent developments, has the Council decided to include the subject on the agenda of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 19 June and to propose, at that meeting, that some of the proceeds of the 'Tobin tax' be allocated to meeting basic needs in the developing countries (access to safe drinking water, primary health care and vaccination), which would cost around USD 40 billion per year according to UNDP estimates?
The view of the Presidency and the Council on this issue remains the same as in the reply given to questions on the same subject on 19 April.
I can only briefly repeat what was said then.
We do not intend to put the issue further up the agenda for the coming Ecofin meeting.
So far no desire has been expressed on this from other parties.
Nor has the Commission put forward any proposal or other initiative on this matter for the Council to address.
Thank you for your answer.
I was expecting you to give the same answer as the one you gave in writing.
I would, however, like to point out to you that support for a Tobin-type tax is increasing. This support is coming from organisations of economists, naturally, but also from political institutions, as a result of the fact that certain positions have been taken up in the Finnish and Canadian parliaments, and again in Argentina, quite recently, even in Great Britain, and here, in the European Parliament.
It is said that this type of tax could only be effective if it were chosen and implemented by several countries or areas of the world.
This is often the argument used against it.
It is certainly true but a first step in that direction is absolutely necessary in order to clamp down on financial speculation which is sweeping the planet, whereas new resources are urgently needed for investments to help people, particularly in developing countries.
We must be aware, and you know this, that USD 1 500 billion pass through the stock exchange every day and half of these transactions are made on the European stock markets.
There is no doubt that if the European Union decided to take this step, the impact would be considerable.
Do you not think, therefore, that the Commission could at least carry out a feasibility study?
I am disappointed with the answer given by the Council, because Mrs Hjelm-Wallen, the Swedish Deputy Prime Minister, said publicly in Stockholm on 23 March 2001 that she was in favour of a Tobin tax, in spite of the usual objections.
I believe that the reasons given by Mrs Boudjenah are very well-founded.
How can we refuse to look into a tax which could be very low and which would thus not affect goods trade and investments, since it would represent 0.1%, but which, on the other hand, would enable resources of an estimated USD 50 to 250 billion to be generated, which would considerably assist developing countries to deal with their problems.
You are aware that at the Conference on LDCs which was held recently at the European Parliament in Brussels, it was shown that 43% of people in these countries do not have access to drinking water, 50% of the population is illiterate, one child in six will not live beyond five years old, and that since 1990, the debt of the LDCs has risen from USD 121 billion to USD 150 billion, despite the Cologne initiative.
I believe, therefore, that the Council should investigate the possibility of introducing this tax, particularly in preparation for the United Nations' Conference on development funding which will be held in Mexico in March 2002.
This morning I spoke to Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Mrs Hjelm-WallÃ©n, who was referred to in the question.
She is highly honoured to have become a weapon in the debate on the Tobin Tax, but she has asked me to say that the description by the honourable Member of her speech of 23 March was not complete.
She said exactly what I believe the Council has said on previous occasions, i.e. that it is easy to share many of the fundamental values behind the proposed Tobin Tax, but it is also necessary to see the many practical difficulties involved in implementing this proposal.
I believe that the feasibility studies requested have already been carried out by a number of independent institutions.
Therefore, I am convinced that it will be possible to continue discussing this issue in an objective way.
I refer you to the reply I gave earlier with regard to the formalities within the European Union.
Mr President, I am as disappointed as my colleagues at the response.
It was always possible for the Swedish Presidency itself to put the item on the agenda.
It seems to me to be another example of politicians being out of touch with ordinary people, who are well aware of the enormous support for such a tax.
Although perhaps unfeasible, it enjoys enormous support, and I find the resistance of the Council and the Commission to discussion of this tax staggering.
If it could be implemented it would end the evils of global speculation that destroy so many jobs, communities and families, while promoting a good in the form of large amounts of aid and assistance to the Third World.
Perhaps the President-in-Office could respond to my concern and tell me why the Council is so afraid of commissioning a study itself or of encouraging the Commission to do so?
At least we would have an answer if we could say that we had an independent study and it will not work.
I suspect that would not come up with such a result but, nevertheless, can I ask you whether you will look into the possibility of commissioning a study or encouraging the Commission itself to study the Tobin-type taxes, so as to see whether they are feasible and under what conditions they could work?
I think I have probably already answered this question, but I am happy to repeat my reply.
As far as the Council is aware, there are already a number of independent studies of various aspects of the Tobin Tax.
Therefore, there does not seem to be any need for further studies.
As I said, there has been no proposal in the Council to take up this issue.
The Presidency does not intend to take it up and, as I understand it, there is no proposal expected from the Commission either.
Mr President, has the Council considered other means of achieving the same goals?
We are probably in agreement on these goals.
They are essential and necessary - they stabilise the global economy and the economies of individual states and dominate and control the transfer of wealth from the north to the south.
In other words, if the Tobin tax is not the way forward, can you tell us what else has been done?
I would remind the honourable Member that in the middle of May this year - I believe it was 14-19 May - a conference was held in Brussels, at which the situation of the least developed countries was specifically discussed.
The European Union and the Council played a leading role in this.
At the conference a number of different initiatives were discussed which will help ensure that the goals described by the honourable Member are achieved.
I suggest that you look at the discussions which took place during this conference.
This will provide you with a sample of proposals for measures which will hopefully, and possibly more quickly, lead to the highly deserving goals which are supposed to be the purpose of the Tobin Tax.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am also extremely disappointed by this answer.
What you are saying is that there is no room for innovation in financial matters, in spite of the volatility of the markets, in spite of the bad reaction to the crises which have hit us recently, including the crisis in Asia.
How can we meet our commitments with regard to sustainable development which you encourage, as President-in-Office of the Council, when we know what it already costs the European Union?
What is it going to cost and how is sustainable development going to be funded in developing countries?
How are renewable energy sources going to be funded, how are we going to finance access to drinking water for the whole world, and lastly, how are we going to finance the elimination of dangerous waste?
How are we going to take action, because it appears that merely raising the issue of managing various flows of money seems, in your view, to be impossible.
In September 2002, a very important conference will be taking place in Johannesburg in South Africa, the World Conference on Sustainable Development.
Participants will be discussing the issues brought up by the honourable Member, hopefully in an in-depth and constructive manner.
At the European Council in Gothenburg at the end of this week, the Swedish Presidency will point out the need to discuss these issues within the European Union in order to develop a concrete basis allowing powerful action by the European Union on these vital issues.
I am convinced that there will be a number of opportunities, including during the run-up to the conference I mentioned, to show the European Union' s will to contribute to sustainable development in these areas.
Question No 15 by (H-0479/01):
Subject: Human rights and democratic freedoms of women in Turkey In view of the serious delay in amending the Turkish Civil Code and removing institutionalised discrimination against women, the high rate of unemployment, illiteracy and domestic violence, and in the light of the undemocratic treatment of Mrs Sema Piskinsut, a member of parliament, and her son on 29 April 2001 during the congress held by Mr Bulent Ecevit's party, when she was pressured to withdraw as a candidate for the chairmanship of the party and was subsequently removed from her post as chair of the Parliamentary Human Rights Commission, what steps will the Council take, in the context of the pre-accession process, to compel Turkey to comply with the European acquis and respect the human rights and democratic freedoms of women?
The Council is aware of the problems which the honourable Member brought up and notes that, in its status report of 8 November 2000, the Commission set out a number of equal opportunities issues which Turkey needs to address.
As the Council has already confirmed on several occasions before this meeting, human rights, including the rights of women, are an important part of the EU Accession Partnership with Turkey, which sets out the prioritised areas on which preparations for accession must be concentrated, bearing in mind the political and economic criteria for accession and the responsibilities of a Member State.
Among the medium-term priorities, the EU has particularly focused on the wording in the agreement stating that Turkey must "remove remaining forms of discrimination against women and all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation" .
I thank the Council for its reply.
Of course, I have no doubt that you are aware of the situation as regards women's rights in Turkey and that there is a problem with human rights in general, but I would have expected the Council to give a more specific response to the problems faced by women in Turkey today, especially in the form of institutionalised discrimination, i.e. legal discrimination against women.
It is a fact that no progress is being made in reforming the civil code and we know that there were numerous incidents in the committee which tried to discuss this reform.
I should also like to ask the Council how it intends to react to the fact that Turkey is being obstructive and refusing to enshrine equal opportunities in its constitution.
Women in Turkey expect the European Union to take more effective action to abolish discrimination and the inequalities which currently exist in Turkey.
The Council does not accept the type of phenomenon which you mention.
As I said in my opening reply, taking up and pointing out precisely the type of absurdity which you have explained remains a constant element of our political dialogue with Turkey.
We have a meeting with the Association Council for Turkey on 26 June. I am convinced that issues of the kind you mention will once again be brought up on that occasion.
Question No 16 by (H-0481/01):
Subject: Support for the women of Afghanistan Is the Council prepared to encourage urgent action to help improve the inhuman conditions being endured by over 11 million women in Afghanistan?
The Council fully shares the honourable Member' s concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation for large sections of the Afghan population, particularly the situation for women.
The European Union, the Commission, through ECHO and EuropeAid, and the Member States will continue to provide urgent humanitarian aid for the population of Afghanistan and for Afghan refugees abroad, where the difficult circumstances in the area allow.
However, the Taliban position on women and the many obstacles which the Taliban rÃ©gime has created for the non-governmental organisations which operate in the country make this task extremely difficult.
This is particularly true of operations aimed at improving the education and health of Afghan women.
Despite the difficulties, a few humanitarian organisations are able to support and run schools for girls.
Despite the continuing efforts of the EU and the rest of the international community, the terrible reality in Afghanistan unfortunately shows that the Taliban regime has remained impervious to argument and pressure from abroad.
The conflicts between Taliban troops and the Northern Alliance continue, despite the long-standing military deadlock.
In addition, the Taliban continue to reject the mediation efforts of the UN and others.
There is a pressing need to improve the situation with regard to humanitarian concerns and human rights, but under the conditions which I have described the outlook for improvement is unfortunately not particularly good.
The Council hopes that the sanctions based on Security Council Resolution UNSCR 1333, and which the Council has implemented through the equivalent Common Position and EC Regulation, will help to reduce external involvement and promote a negotiated settlement of the Afghan conflict.
I would also refer you to the answers to questions on Afghanistan which I have given in previous Question Times in this house.
Thank you very much for your reply.
I would like to know whether, from your experience in the Presidency of the Council, you think there may be any possibility of creating an international peace committee made up of the parties currently involved in the conflict in Afghanistan.
You have replied by giving the facts, by quoting policies on cooperation and the monitoring of human rights.
I would like you to tell Parliament about the political measures, not so much of the United Nations, but of the European Union.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what could be done?
What realistic political measure could the European Union take in order to make the tiniest contribution to improving the current conflict in Afghanistan?
Do you think the Council may be in favour of at least promoting an international peace committee made up of the parties involved?
The Council has not had the opportunity for concrete discussions on a proposed international peace commission. I cannot therefore answer your question on the Council' s behalf at this time.
However, let me stress that I believe there is a need for innovative ideas to break the deadlock in the conflict which I have tried to describe in my answer.
As I said, the Council has not adopted a stance on whether an international peace commission could be such a solution, but I promise to put forward the idea to the Council for further discussion.
I would like to emphasise that there has so far been widespread agreement in the Council that the most effective way for the EU to help improve the situation in Afghanistan is to fully back the efforts of the UN.
The EU' s approach must be to contribute to international coordination.
In many cases, the EU can and should act unilaterally, but in a situation such as that in Afghanistan coordination is required with others who are like-minded, in which case the UN is the best forum.
Therefore, I believe that we must focus our initiatives on this particular approach.
Question No 17 by (H-0482/01):
Subject: Italian election and the EU as a Union of common values Following the general election in Italy on 13 May 2001, one of the EU's largest Member States now has a government which includes representatives of parties such as the Alleanza Nazionale, heir of Italian fascism, and the separatist and anti-immigrant Lega Nord.
These parties have previously been in government in Italy but not since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.
Last year, 14 governments in the EU imposed bilateral political boycotts on Austria after the anti-immigrant FPÃ entered the new government.
Those measures were justified on the basis of Articles 6 and 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty concerning the Union's common and fundamental values.
In September, the sanctions were lifted after a group of wise men had carried out a study of Austria's conduct.
In what way does the Council consider that the Italian situation differs from the Austrian and what conclusions should be drawn in terms of precedent with regard to the application of Articles 6 and 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty?
My reply will be quite short. The Council has neither discussed nor adopted a stance on the issues brought up by Mr SacrÃ©deus and therefore cannot answer the question.
I would like to thank Mr Danielsson for his reply, which was, strictly speaking, legally and politically correct.
However, I believe we must realise that, despite Parliament being sparsely populated, much of the general public across Europe is asking these questions following the election results in Italy.
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the EU is a union of common values, as set out in Articles 6 and 7.
Even if the Swedish Presidency does not take up the issue of the formation of the new government in Italy and the conclusions drawn from previous action against Austria, I still believe that there will be various public demands which will force scrutiny of what has happened in Italy and the parties and values of the country.
Let me say the following: Is it not the case that what has happened in Italy is due to it being a large country and that in Austria to it being a small country?
I would just like to clarify what Mr SacrÃ©deus no doubt already knows.
It was not the Council which took part in deciding on measures against Austria, but a decision taken by the 14 Heads of State and Government on an ad hoc basis.
This decision only applied to bilateral exchanges - EU cooperation was not affected.
Let me point out that the Treaty of Nice - which we all know has yet to be ratified - contains proposed new legislation in Article 7 intended to be applied in situations of the kind which we had in Austria.
If anyone wishes to protest against a situation such as that described by Mr SacrÃ©deus, I would suggest that they use the mechanisms outlined in Article 7.
The Treaty has not yet been ratified, but the option possibly still exists of citing this article if anyone wishes to bring the issue up.
The Presidency has not yet received any such request.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I should first like to thank you for clarifying that the sanctions against Austria were not imposed by the Council or any other European institution.
I believe that this is very important because of course the decision of the Heads of State and Government had no legal base and was made without hearing the aggrieved party.
It was therefore an inappropriate course of action, the like of which has actually never occurred before in the European Union.
That is why I would be interested to know whether you, in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, believe that this decision against Austria was actually also the reason for the no vote in Ireland last week.
The Council has not discussed the hypothetical question brought up by the honourable Member at all.
Therefore, I cannot answer the question on behalf of the Council.
We hope that the Council' s work ahead of the introduction of the euro bears witness to its desire to effectively protect euro notes and coins against counterfeiting.
I would like to remind everyone that Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 states that the euro must be put into circulation from 1 January 2002 and that the participating Member States are responsible for ensuring that suitable sanctions are in place for counterfeiting euro notes and coins.
On 29 May 2000, the Council adopted a framework Decision on using penal and other sanctions to increase protection against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.
In order to add to and strengthen this, particularly with regard to taking action against euro counterfeiting through close cooperation between the authorities of Member States, the European Central Bank, the national central banks, Europol and in the future also Eurojust, the French government tabled, on 22 December 2000, a draft Decision on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
As the honourable Member knows, Parliament gave its opinion on the draft on 3 May 2001.
The draft, which is in the process of being approved, is linked to the draft Council Regulation on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and the draft Council Regulation extending the effects of the latter regulation.
Parliament also gave its opinion on all these regulations on 3 May 2001.
At the meeting of 29 May 2001, the Council agreed to divide the draft decision tabled last year into one draft for a Council decision and one draft for a framework decision.
The European Parliament will be urged to give its opinion on both these drafts.
At the same time, the Council agreed on conclusions regarding Europol' s role in protecting the euro, partly by providing Member States with the necessary aid to be able to carry out their work on preventing and combating euro counterfeiting.
On the subject of money laundering, the Council has, in previous answers to Parliament, clearly set out its view on the increased risk of money laundering on the introduction of the common currency and on the measures which the Council has adopted to reduce this risk.
These measures, along with the increased vigilance of the national authorities and financial institutions, are crucial to reducing the risk of money laundering on the introduction of the euro.
Mr President, we have a long catalogue of action by the Council and the Commission to deal with the problem of counterfeiting of the euro.
According to a report in the Financial Times on 22 May, Europol apparently thinks that these measures are still inadequate.
One of the particular concerns is the very high value of the 500-euro note, which is in danger of making the euro the currency of choice for counterfeiters and money launderers, because it is substantially higher in value than any other note in regular circulation in the United States, Japan or the United Kingdom.
Has the Council not considered the possibility of delaying the issuing of the 500-euro note because, with the introduction of the euro, there will be a particularly dangerous window of opportunity for counterfeiters potentially to have a field day, as millions of people around the world will never have seen these notes before.
Substantial counterfeiting will engender the severe risk of global damage to the whole credibility of, and confidence in, the euro.
The Council has had no reason to discuss possibly delaying or postponing issuing EUR 500 notes.
The Council believes that all possible measures have been taken.
I have counted the numerous different decisions taken by the Council.
I also stress that it is naturally also up to the relevant national authorities to take appropriate action against counterfeiting.
There has, then, been no concrete discussion of postponing the issue of EUR 500 notes.
Question No 21 by (H-0490/01):
Subject: Follow-up to second Interinstitutional Conference on Drugs Policy in Europe On 28-29 February 2000 the second Interinstitutional Conference on Drugs Policy in Europe was held.
Does the Council consider that it can now respond positively to the criticism made at the conference by the Europol expert, who said that cooperation was not yet effective as a result of a series of political, legislative and judicial problems, and what are the Council' s views now on the emphasis placed on the need for improved cooperation between competent national authorities and the chemical industry to ensure regular and structured supply of information on suspicious transactions in precursor chemicals and, finally, is the Council satisfied with the level of cooperation with third countries in tackling the trade in illegal drugs?

The EU action plan for drugs for the years 2000-2004 has been drawn up on the basis of debates at the Second Interinstitutional Conference on Drugs Policy in Europe which was held in Brussels in February 2000 and the EU Drugs Strategy which the European Council supported at its Summit in Helsinki in December 1999.
This action plan was also supported by the European Council at its Summit in Feira in Portugal in June 2000.
In this action plan, which is now being implemented, the Commission is urged to work with Member States to draw up a procedure for voluntary monitoring of non-scheduled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs in partnership with the chemicals industry.
The Commission is also urged to regularly report to the Council on the control of diverting illicit chemical precursors, measures which have been implemented in the previous year and measures which are proposed for the coming year.
On the basis of the Commission' s proposals, on 5 June 2001 the Council adopted a regulation amending the previous regulation laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, to extend the definition of scheduled substances to natural products which contain such substances, extend the cooperation between Member State authorities and the chemicals industry to also cover non-scheduled substances and to give the Commission responsibility for drawing up guidelines to aid the chemical industry in achieving the aim of the aforementioned cooperation.
These guidelines are to contain a regularly updated list of non-scheduled substances commonly used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, so that the industry will be able to monitor trade in such substances on a voluntary basis.
The EU is currently developing its activities in partnership chiefly with important countries of origin and transit countries in order to combat the illicit drug trade.
With regard to Latin America and the West Indies, the third top-level meeting within the framework of the cooperation and coordination mechanism has just started in Cochabamba in Bolivia.
An action plan for the EU/Central Asia will be approved in the next few weeks.
The fight against drugs has an important place in the partnership with the US within the framework of the Transatlantic Dialogue and with Russian within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Within the preparations for the accession of candidate countries, the section of the Phare Programme addressing drugs is an important element of the fight against the drug trade.
In addition, Europol has opened negotiations with 23 countries on entering into cooperation agreements.
Most cooperation systems are concentrating on measures against illicit trade in drugs, seaways, control of synthetic drugs and increased police and customs cooperation.
Mr President, I wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister for his willingness to engage with Parliament every Question Time and for his part-answer to my question.
As with all of these questions, the real substance is hidden elsewhere within the question.
In particular, I would like his views on the reflections of the Europol expert who said that there was no effective cooperation or coordination because of a series of political, legislative and judicial problems.
I thank him for his response with regard to the chemical industry and also to the agreements established in Central America, the Caribbean and Latin America and the forthcoming agreement with Asia.
But internally, within the borders of the European Union, there are continuing difficulties with regard to cooperation and coordination.
I would like a response on that.
I would like to take the questions on behalf of Mr Andrews, Mr Hyland and Mr Fitzsimons, who are at an ongoing Constitutional Affairs Committee meeting.
Mr Crowley, unfortunately, under the terms of the Rules of Procedure, I cannot allow you to take over the questions of Members who are not present.
It is difficult to give a clear answer to the more precise question from Mr Crowley.
However, in my opening reply I tried to point out that, since the conference at which the expert to whom you refer expressed such criticism, the EU and the Council have tried in various ways to implement measures intended to lead to more effective cooperation in this area.
I have also tried to describe the ways in which this is happening.
I am not in a position to make any clear statement on cause and effect.
However, I believe that the criticism from Europol' s expert to which you referred, and many other critical comments, have led to us having more effective cooperation in this area within the EU.
But I believe we all agree that a number of steps must be taken in the policy area and concerning legislation and judicial cooperation.
There is much still to do, but I believe the EU can state that important steps have been taken in recent years towards more effective cooperation in the fight against drugs.
One final reflection from the Swedish Presidency is that there is much still to be done in the areas of judicial and home affairs cooperation.
At the European Council in Gothenburg on Friday and Saturday we will be proposing that the European Council agree to press to increase the tempo regarding cooperation in the areas of justice and home affairs.
This applies not least to drugs cooperation, as progress needs to be faster on this matter.
We hope that much of the groundwork carried out by the Swedish Presidency in this area will lead to concrete decisions during the Belgian Presidency in the areas of judicial and home affairs cooperation.
I would like to ask a follow-up question regarding what the President-in-Office said about judicial cooperation.
Belgium will be taking over the presidency after Sweden.
Belgium is about to introduce legislation on drugs similar to that of the Netherlands.
My question then is this: What real conditions are there for implementing cooperation against drugs and for combating their use and trade, bearing in mind that the Netherlands has, from a Swedish point of view, a highly relaxed and easy-going liberal view of drug misuse, which means that people from across Europe are drawn to the Netherlands?
This is a policy which Belgium is now about to adopt.
Are there any real conditions for achieving results, when two countries set themselves apart in this way?
As President-in-Office, I neither can or should judge individual Member States' policy in this area.
Let me simply agree with what Mr SacrÃ©deus said regarding the difficulties of achieving effective cooperation in this area and also the desirability of making some progress.
Among the 15 Member States we have various legal traditions in this area.
During our Presidency we have, for example in an informal meeting between justice ministers and interior ministers, tried to contribute to a process in which we converge in our views in this area.
I can, with a certain amount of resignation, state that there is much still to be done.
I am sure that our Belgian friends will be perfectly able to take the discussion forwards.
I have a feeling that a number of presidencies after Belgium will also have to deal with the issue.
However, I believe that it is vital for us to achieve major successes in the areas of justice and home affairs.
As we have reached the end of the time allotted to Council' s 'Question Time' , Questions Nos 22 to 31 shall be replied to in writing.
Before suspending our sitting until 9 p.m., I must express, on behalf of the Presidency, our enormous appreciation and respect for the work undertaken here during the Swedish Presidency by the President-in-Office of the Council, Lars Danielsson, and for the pleasant, straightforward, active and objective way in which he managed to interpret the ups and downs of this Question Time and others in his dialogue with the European Parliament.
We offer him our most sincere best wishes, both on a personal level and for the Gothenburg summit.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Protection of Community forests
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0179/2001), by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy,
1. on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community' s forests against atmospheric pollution [14644/1/2000 REV 1 - C5Â­0072/2001 - 1999/0159(COD)]
2. on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on protection of the Community' s forests against fire [14645/1/2000 REV 1 - C5Â­0073/2001 - 1999/0160(COD)]
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now dealing with the second reading of Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on the protection of forests against fire and Regulation (EEC) No 3582/86 on the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution.
This latter Regulation, which established a framework for the observation, assessment and monitoring of damage to European forests, provided for a network of observation points, carrying out a periodic inventory of damage and publishing an annual report, as well as an additional network for the monitoring and control of the pilot demonstration projects.
The general tendency we have seen is an increase in the deterioration of non-coniferous species such as oak and beech and intense defoliation owing to the seriousness of atmospheric pollution, essentially in Central Europe, which also increases the acidity of the soil.
Atmospheric deposits cause serious concentrations of nitrates in the soil and increase the risk of drinking water pollution, thereby threatening the role played by forest soils in the filtration of water resources.
The budget for this Regulation in the Commission' s proposal is reduced from EUR 40 million for the first five-year period to EUR 34 million for the second five-year period, from 1997 to 2001.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is once again proposing an increase in the budgetary contribution to EUR 44 million, in line with the increase in forested area and the cost of living.
There is no doubt about the usefulness of the programme and the monitoring networks, and to strengthen them would mean a huge increase in the service which the forests offer to European society as a whole.
With regard to Regulation (EEC) No 2158 on the protection of forests against fire, an action framework was established to reduce the number of fires and the surface area affected by them, providing for the co-funding of fundamentally preventive actions.
In particular, these include the creation of protection infrastructures, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, water points, etc., as well as an improvement in systems for monitoring and identifying the causes of fires.
Article 10 of this Regulation provides for a contribution of EUR 70 million for the period 1992-1995, whereas the proposal presented for 1997-2001 considers that EUR 50 million is sufficient. In other words, EUR 10 million per year.
As well as contradicting the Council' s recommendations to the Commission in points 5 and 6 of the forestry strategy for the European Union on the possibility of improving Community measures for forest protection, this reduction goes against common sense, given that since 1995, the date of the last enlargement, the forested area has increased from 21% to 36% of the total Community area, and I fail to see the balance in having more forest to protect and less money to protect it.
The amendments therefore propose increasing the budget to EUR 77 million, which I believe to be fully justifiable, and which we must not give up on under any circumstances, since at stake is the protection of the landscape, of nature, of biodiversity, of traditional cultures and multifunctional activities and, at the end of the day, of what we see when we close our eyes and think of forests.
In Europe, 60 million hectares are stated to be at risk of fire.
The Commission' s proposal suggests EUR 0.16 per hectare. Parliament is requesting EUR 0.23 per hectare.
The difference is EUR 0.07 per hectare. Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about peanuts in relation to the protection of our forests, and we are being refused even this amount.
There is a special mention in the report, which I do not want to leave out, of the Mediterranean forests which are much more seriously affected by fire, since they are located in hot areas, with long periods of drought, and are also seriously affected by desertification.
We must pay special attention to this issue in order to adequately weigh up the different actions relating to the forests: prevention, improvement, conservation and the restoration of burnt areas and forestation.
I therefore ask the Commission to declare its acceptance of these arguments in the coming proposals so that the Members of this Parliament can accept this report at this second reading.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group is going to vote in favour and I agree with everything Mrs Redondo has said.
However, I would like to say that I consider it a failure that the financial contribution of the Regulation on the protection of Community forests against fire is being reduced from EUR 70 million to EUR 49.4 million, and that in the case of the Regulation on atmospheric pollution it is being reduced from EUR 40 million to 35.4 million.
This is a significant reduction and it is little compensation that our amendment referring to the Mediterranean forest has been accepted, given its importance in the southern countries and, in particular, in the regions affected by desertification.
If there is no genuine political will to increase, rather than reduce, the budgetary contribution, then these are mere words.
Experts from France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco and Tunisia last week spent a day at the University of Valencia, and in their conclusions they highlighted that 40% - almost half - the territory of the Mediterranean area is under threat of desertification, which, furthermore, may be aggravated by fires, erosion, pests and climate change; that the average amount of burnt land increases each year by three thousand hectares, and that in order to combat this problem they will submit - they said, the poor dreamers - these conclusions to the FAO and the European Union, since, they said, prevention policies are needed.
That is to say, investment.
Atmospheric pollution, together with other problems, also needs to be solved through investment.
In this respect we have the problem of the Kyoto Summit.
I hope, at least, that you accept Mrs Redondo' s proposal and that in future regulations you rectify this bad policy of reducing something which is initially considered correct politically, but which is then not adequately invested in.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations and discussions on these proposals for draft regulations on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution and fire have been ongoing within our institutions for almost two years.
The original purpose of these proposals was simply to change the legal basis of the existing regulations in this sector following a ruling of the European Court of Justice.
In addition, both measures expire at the end of this year.
The Commission supports the Council's common position of 26 February, which for the most part is in fact in line with your own amended proposals on this matter.
I therefore hope that Parliament will be able to accept the rapporteur's recommendation - and I should like to take this opportunity to thank her very much for her work - and also vote in favour of this common position.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Simplifying conditions for invoicing in respect of VAT
The next item is the report (A5-0149/2001) by Mrs Torres Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying, modernising and harmonising the conditions laid down for invoicing in respect of value added tax [COM(2000) 650 - C5-0008/2001 - 2000/0289(CNS)]
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it has not been possible since 1992 to achieve greater harmonisation of value added tax, the Commission quite rightly decided to go for a different solution, which is to harmonise and simplify VAT administrative practices, as a result of the work carried out by the SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) Group.
The difficulty of this proposal is finding a situation of optimal balance which makes the work of companies easier, particularly SMEs, although the directive is aimed at all business in the European Union, and yet does not lead to a loss of income or make it more difficult for tax administrations to carry out audits.
We would do well to bear in mind that income from VAT is not only a very important source of income for national budgets, it is also one of the own resources for funding the European Union budget.
I therefore propose that we basically approve the Commission' s proposal, as long as it meets three important political objectives.
First of all, the proposed harmonisation of compulsory statements in invoices would entail a considerable lightening of the administrative burden for traders operating across the European Union.
Currently, traders are faced with fifteen different sets of regulations and, in total, with twenty-five different compulsory statements.
We must, therefore, welcome the proposal to replace this patchwork of rules with a single list of compulsory statements, which will mean, in practice, that a trader would have to comply with only one set of rules for all invoices issued to customers in the EU.
Secondly, the introduction of a common framework for electronic invoicing will further lighten the administrative burden for companies, while at the same time making VAT audits more efficient.
In addition, electronic invoicing will result in savings for companies as the cost of sending and handling an electronic invoice is far lower than a paper invoice.
Thirdly, the introduction of a common set of rules for E-invoicing will also further the development of electronic commerce in Europe, not least as regards services provided by electronic means.
I therefore believe that the amendments we tabled in committee, my colleagues and I, have improved the draft directive.
Nevertheless, there are two aspects resulting from the vote taken in committee, with which I do not agree.
One aspect concerns an amendment tabled by my colleague, JosÃ© Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil on the numbering of invoices.
The Commission is proposing a single number and I propose that this number should be sequential, in one or more series.
In other words, we can adopt different series, according to the country or type of product, but always on a sequential basis.
I feel that this must have been Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil' s intention, but the version that has been adopted says exactly the opposite.
The other aspect concerns electronic signatures.
I agree with the Commission' s proposal that the authenticity of the origin and integrity of the contents of invoices must be guaranteed by means of an advanced electronic signature within the meaning of the European Parliament and Council directive on a Community legal framework for electronic signatures.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted against this proposal, or rather, tabled an amendment to remove this proposal.
I think that we should reintroduce this proposal, or in other words, that we should keep the Commission' s wording.
Why do I say this?
While it is true that electronic signatures come at a cost, this is relatively insignificant compared to the potential savings.
The level of security chosen by the Commission can currently be bought on the Belgian market for around EUR 15 per year.
This cost is expected to fall in the near future, in particular once the European Directive enters into force.
Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive to ensure that use is made of this simplified electronic signature.
We now have the opportunity to use this directive and to provide guarantees for tax administrations.
I think that this principle, proposed by the Commission, should be maintained.
What I mean is that this is a good proposal and that Parliament' s amendments are all - with the exception of these two examples - a step in the right direction. This proposal will make the life of businesses and tax administrations easier through this project.
Madam President, I have little to add to what Mrs Torres Marques has said.
I would highlight that the Commission' s proposal seems to me to be a good one.
My good friend Mrs Torres Marques has stressed this effectively.
I believe that it fulfils four of the fundamental objectives relating to simplifying administrative obligations.
As she has said, the harmonisation of the requirements for information to appear on the invoice will mean that traders operating within the single market will be subject to a single legislation, while until now they have had to know, comply with and apply fifteen different legislations.
Secondly - and the rapporteur has also highlighted this - this simplification will also mean significant savings for companies.
It is true - I agree with the rapporteur and the Commission in this respect - that the issuing of a traditional invoice is three times as expensive as the issuing of an electronic invoice.
This innovation is therefore welcome.
Thirdly, I also agree that this proposal will help to develop, strengthen and promote the electronic provision of services, which is one of the great objectives which the European Union established at Lisbon and which will be discussed tomorrow in Gothenburg.
Fourthly, I believe that this proposal, while achieving these objectives from the point of view of the simplification of formal obligations, savings in the financial costs to companies and the strengthening of electronic services, in no way jeopardises the administrative control necessary for the application of the tax.
I will not talk about some of the amendments which Mrs Torres Marques has mentioned, such as the electronic digital signature, because the author of the amendment is Mrs Kauppi, who will explain it much better than me.
However, I would like to say that the amendment which we are presenting in relation to the sequence has not in my view been properly understood by the rapporteur.
The Commission proposed that the invoice should have a single number.
What we are saying is that it should not necessarily be sequential, and there could be different sequences or collections by client or by country, in order to favour identification from the point of view of the company and, probably, also from the point of view of the administration.
I also share the rapporteur' s regret, which this Parliament makes abundantly clear every time valued added tax is discussed: the Commission lacks audacity when it comes to progressing towards a definitive system for value added tax, which would simplify it enormously and which, at a time of so many problems for European integration, would provide clear and firm backing and a clear message that we are prepared to turn value added tax into what its founder, Maurice LaurÃ©, called the first European tax.
This is a modest step, since it only involves administrative obligations, formal obligations, that is, certain secondary aspects of the tax, but it seems to me a step in the right direction.
My Group will support it.
I will end by saying that Mrs Torres Marques' s report is a good one.
The preliminary report was also a good one.
And that report has been greatly improved since passing through committee thanks to the generosity of the rapporteur, who has accepted a good number of amendments.
The procedure we are now undergoing is a consultation procedure, it is modest, but this committee - given the number of amendments it has presented - has worked very seriously on drafting this report.
I hope the Commission will respond generously to the serious work of the European Parliament' s committee.
Madam President, not every Council initiative seeking to harmonise tax rules works to the benefit of the public.
There are frequent announcements of good intentions to simplify tax rules. In actual fact, however, the measures are instead directed at keeping tax competition within the Union in check.
This is particularly true of all measures which seek to harmonise tax rates, for the simple reason that it is highly unlikely that it will be agreed to align with those countries which have lower tax rates.
Usually only the opposite approach is possible. This means that states with leaner governments and lower rates of tax are actually forced to levy taxes which they do not even need.
This Council proposal to amend Directive 77/388 should be seen in a quite different light, because the purpose of the proposed measures is actually to simplify matters for taxpayers throughout Europe.
The amendments seek above all to reduce companies' administrative costs and thus strengthen competition.
For this reason we can support these amendments which contribute to a genuine simplification of our tax legislation.
Madam President, Commissioner Bolkenstein, the administrative burdens on businesses operating in the EU must be minimised.
The Commission' s proposal and Mrs Torres Marques' excellent report promote this trend.
Administrative burdens place particular pressure on small- and medium-sized businesses which, due to their small size, have to put relatively more energy into complying with regulations than large businesses.
Our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is also already proposing, in its first amendment to the Commission' s proposal, that the national authorities which have the authority to act must always ensure that complying with this directive will not cause SMEs additional, unnecessary administrative burdens.
Simplifying Community law must always have the consequence of reducing the administrative burden on SMEs.
Bearing this in mind, it is also very important that tomorrow we will be voting on the Committee' s Amendment No 18, which I initiated, becoming part of the final opinion of Parliament.
Honourable Members, legislation renewing and modernising requirements governing invoicing must constantly take into account the opportunities offered by growing e-commerce and the new demands this makes.
A recently published Nordic study stated that by 2005 approximately 80% of company invoices will be transferred electronically.
At the moment this figure is 10%.
Billing electronically is estimated to halve the cost of invoicing in the Nordic Countries.
So the significance is far from small.
Electronic signatures, referred to in Amendment No 18, can be one way of ensuring that invoices transferred electronically are genuine and that their content has not been interfered with but it is not the only way.
The experience gained from Member States where electronic invoicing is permitted shows that the lack of electronic signatures has not caused problems for auditors or any other parties requiring this information.
Using advanced electronic signatures must not be compulsory.
It would be a retrograde step for those Member States which have already accepted electronic invoicing for some time without electronic signatures being required.
The question of the security of doing business over the Internet must not be combined with the legal requirements for Value Added Tax.
I also hope that Mrs Torres Marques will further consider her opinion before the voting tomorrow.
Madam President, it gives me great pleasure to discuss the Commission's proposal on invoicing with Parliament today.
This proposal stems from the SLIM exercise, during which traders themselves identified the current divergent rules on invoicing in Europe as a major obstacle to the smooth running of the internal market and the development of electronic commerce.
It is an important element of the new VAT strategy adopted by the Commission last June focussing, in the short term, on simplifying and modernising the present VAT system.
Two problems have been pinpointed.
Firstly, there are the 15 different sets of rules on VAT invoicing that place an enormous administrative burden on business.
Various speakers have already drawn attention to that tonight.
The compulsory set of requirements is indeed different in each Member State.
This means that when a trader makes taxable supplies to several Member States, he has to respect different obligations when drawing up invoices in each of those countries.
The second problem is that the current legal framework for electronic invoicing also differs across Europe.
In most cases it is very restrictive.
Electronic invoicing is sometimes not possible at all.
When it is allowed, it is subject to diverse technical requirements or to prior authorisation from the tax administrations.
It is therefore extremely difficult to use it in cross-border trade.
Hence the need to set up a common legal framework, for both paper and electronic invoicing.
That is why the objectives of the present proposal are the following: firstly, to create a common set of 12 obligatory VAT requirements on invoices across the European Union; secondly, to set up a common legal framework for electronic transmission and storage of invoices.
By creating a single set of rules, such a new framework will enable businesses to save on administrative costs.
Moreover, I should like to stress that this proposal will also enable tax administrations to carry out tax audits more efficiently.
I am pleased to say that this opinion is shared by the European Parliament - as evidenced by the report drawn up by the rapporteur, for which I thank her very much indeed, on of the Commission's behalf.
The Commission would like, in particular, to welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Torres Marques, as well as the helpful ideas put forward by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, in her opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Given that the Council is currently considering this proposal, and in view of the Commission's strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this stage would be for the Commission not to accept formally the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board as much as possible during the negotiations with the Council.
However, it will not be possible, I am afraid, to take into account some amendments, in particular those relating to the advanced electronic signature, which the rapporteur proposes to make optional rather than mandatory.
I should like to stress that the Commission's proposal is already a compromise between the most flexible and most restrictive legislation.
But I should also like to stress that the electronic signature is an important tool in securing the authenticity and integrity of what is, after all, a valuable commercial document granting the right to VAT deductions.
I share the argument that there is a need to postpone the date of entry into force, to enable businesses to adapt to the new rules.
But such a date could only be decided once the Council has reached agreement on the content of the proposal.
I personally am confident that such an agreement will be reached rapidly.
The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail and it will do its best to come to an agreement before the end of this year, as requested by the Stockholm Summit.
I should now like to make two remarks to Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil and Mrs Kauppi.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil has reproached the Commission for not supporting the strategy which would lead to a single VAT system.
The Commission's ambition remains that of a single point-of-origin VAT system.
But the complaints and reproaches which Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil directs at the Commission should be addressed to the Member States, since it is with them that the problem lies.
Mrs Kauppi made a remark about the costs of electronic signatures, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I remind her that the costs cannot be a real obstacle, since these signatures are inexpensive.
One can buy the cheapest ones for EUR 20 or EUR 30.
The savings in administrative costs more than outweigh initial outlay.
In conclusion, Parliament's support for this proposal is important in order to achieve a good result.
I thank Parliament and the rapporteur very much indeed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I would not normally do this but I shall now give the floor to a Member who was due to speak, but who was slightly confused as to the timetable.
I shall therefore give the floor to Mrs Laguiller.
Madam President, please accept my apologies for taking the floor after the Commissioner. I am the unwitting victim of information technology, as I had the timetable up on screen and I thought that I was due to speak at around 9.45 a.m.
Thank you for allowing me to speak.
The current situation in the fifteen countries of the European Union is, in truth, absurd. There are 15 regulations and 25 different types of compulsory statements on the invoicing of VAT, but what is unfair is the very existence of VAT, and not the way in which it is invoiced.
Although we shall be voting against this report, it is not in order to oppose harmonisation, but in order to express our opposition to the very existence of value added tax, and, more generally, to any indirect tax on consumption.
It is a particularly unfair tax, because everyone has to pay it, including those who only earn a modest wage, even those who are living on unemployment benefit.
The consumer becomes a tax payer simply by making a purchase, even if it is just a loaf of bread.
What is worse is that VAT is not calculated according to the income of the tax payer.
A billionaire will pay tax at exactly the same rate as an employee earning the lowest income.
In a country such as France, VAT makes up almost three quarters of the government' s revenue, in other words, twice the amount of tax on salaries.
This means that it is the working people within the population, those on lower incomes and resources who are paying the greater share of taxes.
It is unfair in itself, and all the more so because, with regard to State spending, on the other hand, there is a trend to increase spending to favour large employers and the wealthy, to the detriment of public services.
Whereas taxation should help to reduce the gap between the richest and the poorest, it is actually making it wider.
We are in favour of phasing out all forms of indirect taxation throughout Europe and of replacing it with a consistent increase of tax on company profits, as well as a tax on income, which increases steeply, particularly on high income from capital.
This would also have the added advantage of solving the problem of harmonising invoicing which is of concern to the Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Termination of service of Commission officials
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the assistance I have received from him and his staff.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Harbour, whom I again have had the privilege of working with; we work well together.
As many Members will realise, this is the second phase in the reform of the Commission, a reform which this whole House has endorsed previously.
If we believe in the reform process, we must endorse this second phase, which concerns the introduction, on a one-off basis, of the early retirement scheme for officials within the Commission.
A proper retirement scheme will apply at a later date, but this particular one is on a one-off basis.
If we believe in enlargement to accommodate the officials from accession countries, we must reduce the number of existing officials and do so within the existing budget.
Also, if we believe in a modern, responsive, technically competent Commission, then we must look to bring in new blood to replace some of those officials who have not adapted or coped with the new technology.
All this adds up to some people taking early retirement and to allowing new people and new blood in.
But it also adds up to some of us within this House having to take decisions, which previously were not palatable.
We have, however, to live in the real world and therefore we must take those decisions.
Turning now to the amendments, that I will be supporting all the amendments except for two submitted by Mr Ferber.
Initially I was reluctant to put my name to some of the amendments, as I was concerned that the inclusion of the other institutions might delay the implementation of the early retirement scheme.
However, my fears have proved unfounded and I am hopeful that the scheme will be implemented in the second half of this year.
It will also allow the other institutions to go ahead with implementing their own scheme.
Turning to the two amendments submitted by Mr Ferber, first of all they have come in rather late in the day. Secondly, they were never raised or discussed within the committee.
Apart from all that, I see these amendments as being submitted by a mean, narrow-minded individual who wants to put a spanner in the works.
This is the only way I can really describe it.
I cannot accept such a petty attempt to derail this whole process and I hope Parliament cannot accept such a petty attempt to derail the reform process of the Commission.
Therefore I would ask the House to support this report as it stands.
Madam President, I would like to thank Bill Miller for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work.
It is a pleasure to see our roles reversed, since he shadowed me on the report on the overall strategy for the human resource reforms that this House approved at the end of last year.
Together we have gathered the experience on what are absolutely crucial issues, both for the future of the Commission and, indeed, for the future of the European Union as a whole.
It is good, from the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee, that we are now getting on with the task of making the crucial reforms to the Staff Regulations that will be needed to implement these reforms.
We hope to carry them out thoroughly and quickly, as Commissioner Kinnock forwards them to us.
I very much echo what Bill Miller said about the importance of this measure as a one-off package.
It does need to be seen in that context.
It is encouraging that the Commission realises that this crucial step towards an entirely new human resource policy, means creating a whole new culture where people are promoted on merit, where we have a linear grading structure, where there is not an artificial ceiling for promotion, where there is much more delegated accountability.
This is part of that transitional phase and it is encouraging that the Commission wants to tackle this seriously.
