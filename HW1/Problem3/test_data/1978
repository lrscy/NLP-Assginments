But with the Neighbourhood Policy we are trying to create the best enabling environment for that.
And that is highly important: in Israel and Palestine, when we speak about the Maghreb and when we speak about the countries of Eastern Europe.
There was another question with regard to Israel's special status.
I can tell you, as I told the Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, when we met her in Lisbon, that we have a special reflection group.
The reflection group is working.
The ideas on the table are very ambitious, particularly from the Israeli side.
But, we have to see that it fits into the overall coherent framework approach of the Neighbourhood Policy.
But within that we can certainly do a lot.
And this is what we are reflecting on and discussing at the moment.
I imagine that, next year, under the next Association Council, we will hopefully come up with proposals for that.
So we have not forgotten it; we are working on it.
A last word on Georgia: many colleagues who have spoken on Georgia, including my friend Lydie Polfer, have said that the situation is very complex.
We all know that, on the one hand, there are great tensions between the opposition and the government, but, on the other hand, there might be also other tendencies there.
I therefore think it is highly important that President Saakashvili has called for presidential elections.
He has said that he will consult the population on the date for parliamentary elections.
And I do hope that the reform aspect that we have really tried to promote will go on in the future, otherwise confidence in the Georgian Government will be very much damaged if the current crisis cannot be solved in a democratic way.
But, of course, we will try to do everything to support Georgia.
My last point is on financing.
Many have said that we need more funds.
But you should know that the European Investment Fund or Investment Facility that is always mentioned is an opportunity to give more funds to those countries that need them with regard to infrastructure projects, energy, transport and so on. We have therefore said that what we have is maybe not sufficient.
Therefore, let us have more.
The debate is closed.
I would like to remind you that the Raimon Obiols i GermÃ  and Charles Tannock report will be put to the vote tomorrow morning, and that the texts submitted to close the debate on the Council and Commission statements will be put to the vote in Brussels on 29 November 2007.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - As the Chair of the Moldova delegation, I want to thank Mr Tannock for pointing out that Moldova fully corresponds to the criteria necessary for a perspective of membership codified in the Maastricht Treaty's Article 49.
Thanks also to his co-rapporteur Mr Obiols i GermÃ  for this balanced and thorough report.
Moldova is not in the neighbourhood of Europe, it is geographically in Europe and should be entitled to join the EU once the three Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled.
Although the EU-Moldova Action Plan is far from being completed, we must ask what is the next step?
More incentives are needed to motivate our partners in Europe to make painful reforms.
To achieve its aims, the financial and other resources of the ENP must be noticeably more generous.
Full ESDP missions are needed to have a realistic chance of solving the frozen conflicts in Transnistria and the Caucasus.
Presently there are no resources available to stage those missions.
Finally, it is hard to imagine policy which would fit both the countries of geographic Europe and the non-European Mediterranean countries.
Clearly, the scope of the ENP needs to be rearranged in the future.
Especially its eastern component needs better definition.
in writing. - (PT) I congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work.
The resolution we approve will consolidate Parliament's vision in this area of neighbourhood policy, developing the lines we defined in January 2006.
For that very reason it is important to approve amendments 1 and 2, which I thank Mr Tannock for presenting.
They reaffirm points we have already approved and that cannot be forgotten now, concerning our neighbourly relations on the South Atlantic border.
It is important to recall once again the particular situation of island states neighbouring our outermost regions - the Canaries, Madeira and the Azores - with which we have historic links and special close ties.
We must also therefore reiterate our request to the Commission to propose and to develop specific policies to expand the European Neighbourhood Policy as far as possible to our island neighbours in the Atlantic, close to the European continent, insofar as they highlight not only our geographic proximity but also our cultural and historic affinity and the common interest of mutual security.
Along the same lines, I would also like to take this opportunity to applaud the recent communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the future of relations between the EU and the Republic of Cape Verde.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0382/2007).
The following questions were presented.
Subject: 'Revolving door' immigration policy
Some political figures and specialists have raised the possibility of achieving an agreement between the Member States which would combine the monitoring of the Union's external borders with a new 'revolving door' immigration policy to allow legally established immigrants in the Union to return to their countries of origin without fear of encountering a closed door when returning to the EU.
Does the Council consider this approach feasible, and would it be possible to set up this policy using straightforward intergovernmental cooperation, or would it be necessary to establish new institutional mechanisms to achieve this end?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member will know, in May 2007 the Commission presented to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Committee of the Regions a communication on circular migration and mobility partnerships between the European Union and third countries.
In its communication the Commission considers circular migration to be a useful means to be developed at Community level to ensure more effective management of migration flows.
In the June 2007 conclusions on extending and enhancing the global approach to migration, the Council in turn stressed that legal migration opportunities, including well-managed circular migration, could potentially benefit all partners involved.
The Council believes that all well-managed circular migration opportunities should therefore be explored in close cooperation with all the relevant parties, with a view to the adoption of Council Conclusions not later than the end of 2007.
The need to examine these circular migration opportunities, based on the Communication from the Commission of 16 May 2007, was also reiterated in the conclusions of the June 2007 European Council.
The Council is currently examining the issue of the adoption of specific instruments and measures to facilitate circular migration, and the issue of finding out how such measures may be implemented.
The Commission has not as yet proposed any specific measures.
(ES) Mr President, I believe the Portuguese Presidency is devoting a fair amount of attention to this matter, I believe the reply was accurate.
I am aware that the Portuguese Presidency is coming to an end because this half-year is fairly short, but I do not know whether you think it will be possible for a specific proposal to be formulated before 31 December, or whether you will encourage the Commission to submit more specific proposals, especially with regard to the institutional aspects, whether the mechanisms we have today are sufficient or whether it would be appropriate to establish an institution of some kind to facilitate circular migration of this nature.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his kind words.
The presidencies are indeed always a little shorter in the second half-year, whether fortunately or unfortunately I am not sure, because of the summer holidays.
We would in fact like to make further significant progress on this matter by the end of the year, but we are also obviously dependent to some extent on the initiatives the Commission wishes to present to allow us to do so.
That would be our intention and our desire.
At this time I cannot guarantee that, however, but if possible and if we have the opportunity, we will certainly take it.
(ES) Mr President, I share the view of the Presidency of the Council on the revolving door policy for immigration and the new ideas on blue cards to attract immigrants of high calibre.
I would, however, like to ask the Presidency of the Council if it is convinced that we will be able to contain the huge inflow of immigrants to the European Union we have each year, in view of the fact that there are countries in the world whose level of development is so poor and so low.
(PT) The question I would ask on circular immigration is whether there should not be a special mechanism to provide for such immigration, particularly in terms of providing training in the countries affected.
I am thinking of doctors and nurses from Malawi who are in the UK, for example.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) In May 2007 the European Parliament and the Council approved three decisions: the decision creating the European Refugee Fund 2008-2013, the decision creating the External Borders Fund 2007-2013, and the decision creating the European Return Fund 2008-2013.
In June 2007 the Council also approved the decision creating the European Fund for the integration of third country nationals 2007-2013.
These four decisions are an integral part of the general programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows'.
In line with the objectives laid down by the European Council, the objective of this programme is the fair sharing of responsibilities among Member States with regard to the financial burden arising from the introduction of the integrated management of the EU's external borders and the implementation of common asylum and immigration policies.
The European Refugee Fund complies with the obligations set down in Article 63(2)(b) of the EC Treaty on the adoption of measures promoting a balance of effort between Member States in receiving and bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons.
The Council also seeks to promote solidarity by other means.
The Council Conclusions of 18 September 2007 on reinforcing the EU's southern maritime borders, for example, encouraged Member States to provide support on a bilateral basis to Member States facing particular pressure, stating that such support can be provided at the level of return operations, reception conditions, case working expertise or voluntarily undertaking to take responsibility for asylum seekers, refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection or unaccompanied minors.
That was a comprehensive statement of the theoretical position on burden-sharing.
We know what the instruments are, but I have to ask you candidly, when it comes to Malta, Lampedusa and the Canaries, what is the implementation?
Do you feel that, over the last six months, Council members, including those in Western Europe, have taken seriously their burden-sharing commitment regarding these places, which are in an emergency situation?
Some of our colleagues here know it and see it every day.
Nobody is identifying Portugal as being in any way apathetic on this issue, but what about the Council actively carrying out burden-sharing?
Is it being implemented?
Please give us your candid response.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I am very pleased to answer the honourable Member, and obviously I am speaking on behalf of the Portuguese Presidency in accordance with its thinking on this issue.
The honourable Member knows that migration and migration flows, especially illegal migration flows, particularly from regions to the south of Europe, represent a new problem that we did not have to face just a few years ago.
We must obviously, therefore, react to this new and unfamiliar phenomenon and must take appropriate measures.
As is always the case, however, those measures, that reaction and the instruments referred to are taking shape gradually, just as our awareness of the importance and gravity of this problem is taking shape gradually.
I have to say in this regard that the keyword in this issue for the Portuguese Presidency and for Portugal as a Member State is solidarity.
Just as we all understand that when other issues affect one or two Member States they must be seen as a problem for everyone, so too in connection with illegal migration the appropriate word is also solidarity, since we are aware that these phenomena often affect individual States in particular.
It is true that quite often all we do is talk, and it is true that we must and should do more than just talk.
However, the current awareness that the issue concerned is a global problem that affects everyone and that is everyone's responsibility is a first step.
Naturally we are confident that gradually and realistically, but also with the necessary urgency, we can continue to refer to 'solidarity' while turning it into concrete actions and measures.
That is the Presidency's role, and that is what Portugal must do as a Member State.
You will also understand that it is not up to a single Member State or a single Presidency to influence all events and all measures, as might perhaps be desired.
But I can assure you that there is a heightened and increasingly strong awareness that we must share that responsibility and give effect to that solidarity.
(MT) With all due respect, President-in-Office, I am not convinced by your reply, as while the Council of Ministers are thinking about it, there are people drowning in the Mediterranean and there are Mediterranean countries that cannot cope with the emergency; that is why I am not convinced.
I am going to ask you something specific: Malta made a proposal in the Council on the division of the burden, on burden sharing.
It asked that any immigrants saved from the sea outside EU waters - in Libya's waters, for example - should be divided among all the EU countries.
What was the Council's reply, I would like to know.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I am very familiar with that situation and I am very familiar with the issue the Government of Malta has raised in that regard, and your question is covered by the answer I have already given to a fellow Member: the Presidency is aware, and Portugal as a Member State is aware, that Portugal is also a country of the South, and we too will therefore do our utmost to ensure that the word 'solidarity' is actually put into practice while bearing in mind the difficulties and problems, which do exist, though like many cases this one also requires perseverance and persistence.
Subject: Measures to ensure decent living conditions for illegal immigrants, particularly women and children
Which measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that illegal immigrants, particularly women and children, enjoy decent temporary living conditions, so that Member States uniformly respect their international commitments?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I do not know if this is possible or within the regulations, but when the question is introduced I would like to know exactly which of the honourable Members is the author, because obviously my answer will be addressed firstly to them.
As I am sure you know, the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals lays down specific rules for the treatment of such nationals.
Article 13 of the proposal for a directive provides for safeguards as to the conditions of stay pending the return of all persons covered by the directive.
Article 15, which establishes the conditions of temporary custody, defines the treatment to be afforded to third-country nationals pending their return.
Article 15(3) states that particular attention must be paid to the situation of vulnerable persons, and specific provision is made for minors.
As you also know, the European Parliament and the Council are currently examining this proposal for a directive.
- (EL) Thank you, Mr President; allow me to repeat Mr Moraes's comments: you are theoretically answering our questions very well and in detail.
However, what is the responsibility of the Member States when we do not yet have your analyses?
Are there any international treaties and are they being applied equally to all Member States, or do some Member States, for special reasons, provide more or less?
What is the responsibility of the accession countries that serve as transit routes for illegal immigrants, mainly women and children?
During yesterday's sitting I mentioned to the Commissioner that even a 14-year-old illegal transporter of clandestine immigrants had been arrested.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I have just said that a proposal for a directive is currently under discussion between the Council and the European Parliament in which this issue is addressed.
Since the proposal for a directive has not yet been approved, I cannot say exactly what measures the directive will propose for defending and protecting the weakest individuals who need the most protection.
We shall see.
This proposal for a directive now addresses that concern to protect the weakest.
I can also clearly tell you that when we, the Portuguese Presidency, refer to the question of illegal immigration, we always say that the fight against it is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and respect for people and respect for the humanitarian tragedy underlying the phenomenon.
We should not treat people as objects, and neither the Presidency nor Portugal accepts or has ever accepted that the humanitarian dimension should not be considered or should be considered to be secondary in these situations.
This is our position in principle as the Presidency, it is our position in principle as an EU Member State, and it is a position that we will not abandon under any circumstances.
Subject: European Security Strategy
What are the results to date of implementing the European Security Strategy?
In particular, what are the results of extending the security zone to include Europe's periphery?
Is the Council satisfied with the strategies 'Peace through regional integration' and 'Regional integration through peace' on the EU's geopolitical perimeter?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, honourable Member, in the four years that have elapsed since the European Security Strategy was adopted in December 2003, the European Union's foreign and security policy has developed dynamically.
We have reacted successfully to the threats identified in the European strategy, following the main thread that informed our approach.
We have had to be more active, more coherent and also more competent.
The new threats of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, degeneration of the state and organised crime have been met by many concrete actions that reflect the range of instruments currently available to the European Union.
These include diplomatic action, civilian and military missions and trade and development activities.
We have endorsed effective multilateralism, supporting and increasing our cooperation with the United Nations in crisis management, the war against terrorism and non-proliferation.
Our operations in relation to European security and defence policy are our most visible contribution to global peace and security and demonstrate our willingness to take on global responsibilities.
Since 2003 we have initiated 16 crisis management operations, four military and 12 civilian, in various parts of the world.
These European security and defence policy operations cover three continents and range from purely military operations, including reform of the security sector and institutional development, to police missions to ensure the rule of law.
From Aceh to Ramallah, from Kinshasa to Sarajevo, the EU is putting the main catalysts for peace and stability into place.
The pressures on the Union are increasing, however.
We have just decided in principle to lead a military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic to help to draw a close to the regional consequences of the Darfur crisis.
We are also prepared to lead a police mission to ensure the rule of law in Kosovo.
From the Western Balkans and from Eastern Europe to the Mediterranean, we have worked actively for peace and stability in our neighbourhood using all the means at our disposal.
I believe that the work done by the High Representative Javier Solana, EU enlargement policy, the Barcelona process, the European Neighbourhood Policy just debated here, the EU's special representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and the Southern Caucasus and the peace process in the Middle East, as well as the EU's role as a member of the Quartet for the Middle East and the Troika for Kosovo, plus the other ESDP missions I have referred to here reflect our determination to create security in our neighbourhood.
- (EL) Thank you for your answer, Mr President.
I really feel that the European security strategy is proving more successful in missions outside the European continent than in meeting challenges arising within the EU.
I believe that situations such as that in Kosovo, the management of an emerging crisis, the policy of conditionality in FYROM, a candidate country whose political system is seriously ailing, and the Russophobia, whether justifiable or not, that preoccupies our colleagues from the countries of the former Eastern Europe - all these challenge us to form a more coherent and effective European security strategy.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) We have just had a discussion here in this plenary session on the European Neighbourhood Policy intended precisely for our partners on this continent.
I presume that a general conclusion was that, despite the difficulties that might exist and the improvements that could be introduced, this European Neighbourhood Policy that forms part of our strategy has worked well and has ensured that many of our partners and neighbours can enjoy stability, economic progress and economic and social development.
For well-known historical reasons, many of our partners are naturally now experiencing what could be called stages of transition, democratic consolidation and consolidation of the rule of law, and as is so often the case, these processes are not exempt from difficulties, upheavals or problems.
And this is perhaps true of some of those countries.
We recently spoke about Georgia, when I said here that I chaired the Association Council with Georgia some three weeks ago and had the opportunity to inform our Georgian colleagues that in the area of the economy, for example, we were pleased to note that significant progress had been made in terms of economic development, despite the problems that country has with Russia.
We must therefore be prepared for the significant progress that we expect and want, but for well-known reasons we must also sometimes expect backward steps that we sincerely hope will only be temporary, and we hope that the States and countries will rapidly return to progress and towards reinforcing the rule of law.
I must therefore tell the honourable Member in all sincerity that, although we European Union citizens sometimes tend to be very modest with regard to the capacity of our achievements and to the achievements themselves, we must be a little more friendly towards ourselves, as it were.
I think that we have achieved something despite the difficulties.
Given what the Treaties of the Union say and the content of the Reform Treaty on the issue of security and defence, and given what the President of the French Republic said here yesterday and the fact that France will be taking on the Presidency next year, could the Council tell the House if it envisages that there will be a common defence policy within the European Union in the lifetime of this Parliament, or in the next Parliament, and when it thinks that might come about?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member knows, the Council does not comment on speeches by Heads of State of European Union Member States.
Naturally, however, I have noted President Sarkozy's opinion, which is that of the Head of State of a very important EU Member State.
If we are to progress in that direction or not, towards a Europe with an enhanced defence, it will be the Council that will have to decide, and as you can imagine, I cannot anticipate the Council's decision. If that is the Council's decision - and as you know, defence is a specific area that requires very strong consensus - then naturally we will be able to go forward along that route, but the decision is obviously in the Council's hands.
I do not have a crystal ball and therefore cannot tell you how far this idea will go.
We shall see, but since it is a proposal from President Sarkozy, it will obviously be listened to very attentively, like all his proposals.
Subject: Accession negotiations with Macedonia
What is the Council's assessment of the stage reached in bringing Macedonia closer to the EU, and when does it consider that it will be possible or desirable to set a date for starting accession negotiations?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, honourable Member, the December 2005 European Council decision to grant candidate country status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was recognition of that country's reform achievements.
The European Council stated that further steps towards EU membership would have to be considered firstly in the light of the debate on the enlargement strategy, as provided for by the conclusions of the 12 December 2005 Council, which concluded with the 'renewed consensus' on enlargement that was achieved at the 14-15 December 2006 European Council; secondly, of compliance by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the Copenhagen criteria; thirdly, of the requirements of the Stabilisation and Association Process and the effective implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement; and finally, of the need for further significant progress to respond to the other issues and criteria for membership included in the Commission's Opinion and implementation of the priorities in the European Partnership.
In its interim reports the Commission has examined developments in detail.
Following the assessment of the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as set out in the Commission report of 2006, in its session of 11-12 December 2006 the Council regretted that the pace of reforms observed had slowed down in 2006.
On 14-15 December 2006 the European Council reiterated that each country's progress towards the Union would continue to depend on its efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The Council called for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to accelerate the pace of reforms in key areas and to implement the priorities identified in the European Partnership in order to move ahead in the accession process.
The fourth meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia took place on 24 July last.
Particularly important among the messages set out in the Union's common position for the Stabilisation and Association Council was its insistence that stability and the regular functioning of democratic institutions were fundamental aspects of the political criteria essential for ensuring progress towards European integration.
Institutions such as the Government, Parliament and the President must function and cooperate effectively.
They must also play their differentiated roles and interact as laid down in the Constitution.
A constructive political climate must be established and maintained so that the country can concentrate on the reforms necessary to make progress towards the Union.
Further efforts must also be made to establish confidence between the ethnic communities at all levels.
The Union recalled that sustained implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement was a key element of the political criteria.
Every effort must be made to achieve the broadest possible political agreement on the associated reforms, in full compliance with the letter and spirit of the agreement.
The meeting also recalled the importance of making progress in the areas of justice and internal affairs, particularly in combating organised crime and corruption.
At the same time the Council also recalled that regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations were an essential part of the process of EU integration.
Finally, I wish to state that the Council is examining very carefully the Commission report published on 6 November, which will be the subject of conclusions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in December next.
(DE) Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your very comprehensive reply.
I have only two brief supplementary questions.
Firstly, do you think it conceivable that a date for the opening of accession negotiations will be set in the course of next year?
Macedonia's applicant status dates from more than two years ago, and it is surely high time to think about a date.
My second supplementary question is this: what approach is being adopted?
Are attempts being made to link Macedonia's accession with that of other countries, such as Serbia, or is this country really being dealt with separately from any others?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member will understand, I cannot say whether we are or are not in a position to set a date in the coming year for starting accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Difficult and demanding conditions and criteria must be met before such negotiations can begin, so the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be further from or closer to being informed of the date for starting negotiations according to how far it meets those criteria and conditions.
What I would say, however, is that the candidate country will be better placed to answer that question than the European Union.
As regards connecting accession processes, the Presidency maintains and has always maintained that each candidate State must be judged separately on its own merits.
If the candidate State is eligible because it meets the commitments and conditions for starting accession negotiations, it should be granted that status irrespective of what might happen in parallel processes involving other candidate States.
Subject: Tiger conservation
What has the EU done, and what further measures are under consideration, in order to encourage and assist India and other relevant countries in the conservation of their tiger populations in a way that involves local people and gives them a stake in the protection of those animal populations?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, honourable Member, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES, provides the international legal framework for the conservation of tigers and other endangered species.
The EU and its Member States are strong supporters of CITES, both politically and financially.
In recent years the EU has laid particular stress on the need for greater concentration of effort in the practical application of CITES controls in order to reduce illegal slaughter and trade and to guarantee sustainable trade of species.
To underscore this need, the Commission published Recommendation No 207/425/EC of 13 July 2007, identifying a set of actions for the enforcement of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein.
Meanwhile, the species 'pantera tigris' is listed in Annex A of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1332/2005 of 9 August 2005, and is also listed in Annex I of CITES, which means that specimens of that species can only be moved in exceptional circumstances, subject to rigorous criteria.
If those criteria are to be met and any decision to authorise trade is to be possible, assurances must be forthcoming that the activity is not detrimental to the state of conservation of the species.
We would also draw your attention to the need for international cooperation and in particular for capacity building to facilitate the implementation of policies for the conservation and sustainable use of wild flora and fauna in States where such species are found.
The EU thus supported the decisions relating to Asian big cats, approved at the 14th meeting of the parties to CITES at the beginning of this year, with the aim of intensifying application and conservation efforts.
We are, furthermore, also prepared to provide assistance to India and to the other States of the distribution area in implementing these decisions.
We recognise that the effective implementation of conservation measures requires the participation of the local population.
We have stressed the need, through CITES, to ensure the support and cooperation of local and rural communities in managing wild fauna and flora resources, and consequently in combating illegal trade in them.
I thank the Presidency very much for that, and I will read the documents mentioned.
However, the problem is that the situation regarding tigers is a crisis.
There are probably only 3000 left in the wild.
They could be extinct in the wild by 2020.
The main problem is poaching, which is driven by the lucrative illegal trade in tiger skins and parts, said to stretch to Eastern Europe.
The Indian forestry authorities say they are unable to cope with poaching gangs, due to chronic underfunding.
Can the EU help with that?
Have we got specific projects?
A Chinese official said recently that it is very hard to resist pressures to open the tiger trade.
Surely the key is education on the one hand, but also giving local people an economic stake in maintaining higher levels.
What is the EU actually doing in terms of specific projects?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The honourable Member will note that I have referred extensively, at length and in detail to the international legal and judicial framework in which the European Union exists and operates.
I have also naturally expressed the Council's willingness, readiness and commitment to do its utmost within that international framework to ensure that the measures it provides for are effectively applied.
I have also said very transparently that we also recognise that we must work together with local populations that have direct contact with those endangered species.
The battle against poaching and similar illegal activities is not an easy one, as people with experience of these situations know.
They are aware that it is a difficult yet necessary battle, an assessment with which I agree.
The whole of European public opinion is with you, because what has been seen recently in connection with the illegal trade in endangered species shows that people are much more aware of the need to draw attention to these issues than they used to be.
The pressure of public opinion and the attention paid to it in connection with these situations is therefore now much greater than it was.
You can therefore obviously count on that public awareness, which is also necessary to ensure that we, the EU, and our Member States are able to act more effectively.
As I said, we must recognise that it is a difficult battle.
Mr President-in-Office, you have made it very clear that you and the Council as a whole are committed to the protection and conservation of the tiger.
The Indian Prime Minister equally has, in a number of statements, made his passionate commitment to defending the tiger clear.
As we are engaged in a bilateral negotiation with India to create a new bilateral treaty between the EU and India, do you think this is a subject we could include in that treaty and that we could go beyond our current commitments under CITES to help with education, training, conservation - the sort of measures that Baroness Ludford was talking about?
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, my question has to do with this issue but relates to a slightly different aspect.
I believe - and you rightly referred to this - that questions such as the one under discussion arouse strong feelings among the general public.
On the other hand - and you also referred to the legal position - are we in the European Union really justified in arrogating legislative or contractual powers to ourselves on every issue that deeply concerns anyone in the EU?
Or should we not exercise a little restraint in these matters?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Very well, I must confess, Mr President, that I did not fully understand the second question, perhaps because of delays in the interpreting.
As regards the question of the tiger and dialogue with India, I must say in all sincerity and frankness that it is a specific question, on which I have not reflected, but on which we will reflect in the future, and I therefore take note of the honourable Member's suggestion.
In our bilateral dialogue with India - an EU-India Summit is to be held - we may also discuss this issue of protected species and how we can better protect endangered species.
I must confess that because of the interpreting, I believe, I could not understand your second question.
(DE) Thank you very much, and my apologies for having spoken so quickly.
I was consciously trying to avoid overrunning.
I mean it is important that we deal with such concerns when they matter to the people of Europe.
On the other hand, we should also be aware of the legal limits of the Union and take care to respect these limits as far as we can.
The approach you have proposed seems interesting, but we should not leave ourselves open to the accusation that the Union is claiming competence for all global matters.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I agree with the honourable Member, the European Union cannot and should not be responsible for everything, and should not be accused of or judged for everything.
According to the Treaties, many of those aspects and responsibilities lie with the Member States, and in this case may be responsibilities both of the Member States and of the States in which these situations occur.
The European Union is not and cannot be a universal panacea, particularly since there is a principle, the principle of subsidiarity, that must always be respected.
Subject: Non-EU financial services centres
Will the Council make a statement on how it engages with non-EU financial services centres on areas of mutual concern?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, honourable Member, in the conclusions adopted in May 2006, the Council welcomed the Commission's White Paper on financial services policy from 2005 to 2010.
The Council particularly welcomed, and I quote: 'the ideas put forward with respect to the growing importance of the external dimension in financial services - namely to deepen and widen regulatory dialogues with third countries and work towards the further opening of global financial services markets'.
On the Portuguese Presidency's initiative, on 9 October last the ECOFIN Council examined the state of play regarding macroeconomic, financial and regulatory dialogues with the Union's principal partners - the United States, Japan, Russia, India and China.
The importance of these strategic dialogues was stressed during the discussion.
Such dialogues make it possible to reinforce convergence, cooperation and mutual understanding between global partners, thereby helping to facilitate access to the respective markets and to promote macroeconomic and financial stability, particularly in financial services.
The dialogues have led to significant progress concerning convergence and equivalence of accounting standards.
The Council supports the work carried out by the Commission, and considers that financial market globalisation requires increasing effort to achieve convergence and cooperation at international level, in line with the Commission and the Council's strategic vision on the need to reinforce the Lisbon Strategy's external dimension through the promotion of and an international approach to regulatory cooperation and the convergence and equivalence of standards.
Stress was also laid on how important it is for the European Union to ensure a coherent approach in this area, and it was considered that information on the development of such dialogues should continue to be forwarded to the Council on a regular basis.
I would like to thank the Council Presidency for its reply.
Is this Council Presidency aware that there is a school of thought that says that the developing world could greatly benefit from having a financial services sector?
Given Portugal's experience in Africa in particular, could I ask the Council President, if he does not have the response there in his brief, if he would cause this issue to be examined and pursued, because it may well be a way of assisting not just the developing world but in having global interchanges, which would be of great benefit to this part of the world as well.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The honourable Member is right, I do not have a written answer in my brief to give you, but I will give you my opinion.
In this respect we had a very interesting discussion this morning on globalisation, when we also discussed financial services and questions related to the turbulence on some financial markets.
One issue I consider to be fundamental in relation to Africa and which is closely linked to the Europe-Africa Summit concerns Africa's position in globalisation: should Africa be a full partner, as we believe it should, in the problems and challenges raised by globalisation, should Africa be an active partner and should it have effective instruments at its disposal so that it really can be a full partner in globalisation, or do we on the other hand want an Africa which is condemned to war, insecurity, underdevelopment and poverty?
In this context, therefore, the financial or other instruments, initiatives or mechanisms that could actually put Africa with all of us, with the European Union and with other major emerging blocs, on the agenda of the talks, debate and theme of globalisation can only be welcomed.
Thank you, President and President-in-Office for being on overtime as we all are; we appreciate that.
What do you think are the obstacles to greater progress in this area, and do you think that, as things stand, enough is being done?
Because what we are talking about is consumer confidence in the financial services sector, both within Europe and outside.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) This issue, the conduct of these dialogues and so on in this specific area, which is part of the question I was asked, has been directed by and is the responsibility of the Commission.
I also have to confess that I am not a financial specialist and therefore do not have the detailed knowledge required to give you a technical answer.
You are asking for a technical answer and I cannot give you one.
I can give you a political answer that will outline a new reality, a new problem and a new challenge, but also a new opportunity.
This problem should be and has now been examined and has been developed to an unprecedented extent.
We in the European Union too must naturally seek appropriate answers when problems arise, and the necessary instruments must also be at our disposal when it is a case of developing and making progress.
I cannot tell you specifically what obstacles may have arisen or may arise, though I can give you an idea, as I have, of what the EU's policy and the Council's responsibilities in this field have been.
Finally, I can say that it gives me great pleasure to be able to extend my stay here with you, particularly since this mandate is coming to an end.
I only have one more opportunity to be with you, so I must make the most of this experience.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex).
Question time is closed.

Trade and economic relations with Ukraine (debate)
The next item is the report by Zbigniew Zaleski, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and economic relations with Ukraine.
rapporteur. - (PL) The report illustrates the role that we envisage for Ukraine against the background of our own economic activities as well as as a partner in the context of trade with other countries.
In addition we wanted to emphasise the role that Ukraine plays in the Black Sea region, that is, its political, economic and cultural role.
I believe that economic activities and development should progress irrespective of the political ideas held by a country.
The economy must be free, state and legislative authorities should provide support, individual businessmen and groups of entrepreneurs should constitute economic entities.
The economy should be an instrument to bring good living conditions to the citizens, and this objective can be achieved by raising living standards, improving working conditions, through good education, a good justice system, including ownership rights.
We cannot allow common property to be used for individual gain.
Encouragement should be given, also motivation, for people to work honestly to bring material and other personal benefits.
If one does not have one's own good models or history, it is worth taking advantage of others' good practices and experiences, those of one's neighbours.
For this reason it is important to include Ukraine in the common market and make the know-how developed in the EU available to it.
I believe that our economic model is good, even though it is far from perfect, for example with regard to production and trade in food, but we are making constant efforts to improve ourselves.
We can offer to our neighbour from the other side of the River Bug the standards and rules that we have found to work.
What does the report cover?
It covers industry, agriculture, energy, finance, border guards, transport infrastructure, examples of non-corrupt activities, intellectual property, the natural environment, scientific cooperation and relations with neighbours.
These are parts of a single whole that we call the economy.
There are well-defined standards that form the basis of that economy and, in the report, we recommend that our partners develop such standards for themselves or abide by them.
What conditions does Ukraine have to fulfil in order to negotiate better links with the European Union?
As essential conditions, I believe, first of all, joining the World Trade Organization and, while so doing or even before, resolving the debt problem with Kyrgyzstan.
This process is already under way.
Secondly, approval of membership by the Ukrainian Parliament as quickly as possible.
Other conditions include good relations with its neighbours, that is, with Russia and Belarus, stability in its currency, the quality of financial services, developing brands in international markets and keeping to the letter of the law.
Ukraine, which has declared its desire to join the European Union, faces great, even enormous, challenges.
Namely, convincing Europe by its economic, legal, financial and political activities that it is a sufficiently committed partner for the EU to ask itself, sooner or later, would it not be worthwhile to include Ukraine in the common European entity?
Commissioner, our approaches may sometimes have been different, but I believe that we have the same objective, which is to develop a beneficial modus vivendi, a way to coexist with this important eastern neighbour.
I think, Mr President, that I have saved some time as it is already evening.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Zaleski, on this very good report.
I also want to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation with the Commission services when drafting this report.
The report is very timely.
It provides a comprehensive overview of the issues at stake in EU-Ukraine economic and trade relations.
Allow me to focus on some points that you also highlighted in your report.
We consider Ukraine a key and valuable partner in our neighbourhood strategy.
We agree with the general spirit of the present report: to bring Ukraine's economy as close as possible to the EU by means of a new enhanced agreement, of which the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement will be a key pillar.
The Commission also fully shares your views concerning the need to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine and the importance of Ukraine's accession to the WTO.
We strongly hope that Ukraine can still complete the WTO accession process this year, and we will cooperate closely with the Ukrainian Government to this end.
We consider that, once the accession package has been approved by the members of the WTO, the multilateral process of accession will have been completed.
Ukraine has set WTO accession as its priority and we are convinced that it will duly carry out its internal ratification procedures to formalise its membership.
The European Union has no interest in further delaying the launch of FTA negotiations and is ready to start as soon as the decision on the accession package has been approved by the members of the WTO.
Concerning the future FTA, we completely agree that it should be deep and comprehensive, with a strong focus on regulatory alignment.
As for economic relations with neighbouring countries, the report suggests a three-way dialogue: EU-Russia-Ukraine.
We should be very prudent not to duplicate processes on topics already covered in other forums.
Furthermore, the question arises as to whether the European Union would not risk being drawn into bilateral disputes between Russia and Ukraine.
We would also question the benefit of such an approach.
It is our policy to favour the opening-up of energy markets to competition as a means of ensuring access to secure and affordable energy.
This will be an important subject in the future FTA negotiations with Ukraine.
As for concerns on safeguarding the basic needs of the population, EU legislation on the liberalisation of the electricity and gas sector includes significant provisions with the scope to ensure protection of consumers and to safeguard their basic needs.
We intend to negotiate Ukraine's alignment with this legislation.
Concerning the suggestion to extend the GSP+ to Ukraine, I would like to underline that Ukraine does not qualify for these additional preferences and that the European Union has committed itself not to amend the basic GSP criteria on an ad hoc basis.
In addition, this would severely undermine our negotiating positions for the future FTA.
In conclusion, allow me to once again congratulate the rapporteur on his good report.
The Commission widely shares its general approach, except on the few issues that I have underlined above.
The Commission will take the report into account in its ongoing and future cooperation with Ukraine.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, although the post-electoral situation in Ukraine has not yet stabilised, those who represent democracy have won.
This is a victory not just for democracy in Ukraine, but also for the European Union itself, which supported this kind of activity.
Now, in the interests of Ukraine, the Ukrainians and the European Union, we must consolidate what has been achieved with such great difficulty in Ukraine.
It is the Ukrainians themselves who have to take the post-electoral decisions, but we can help Ukraine and, at the same time, help ourselves.
I fully support Mr Zaleski's report, and congratulate him on preparing such a document.
In my opinion there are three areas that are most important as regards bringing stability to Ukraine and also benefit to the European Union.
Firstly, energy cooperation, which is very important for both sides.
It is essential that we become involved in investment in pipelines that are in many cases in poor condition, as also in new pipelines, such as the one from Odessa - Brody - GdaÅsk, in investment in the electricity grid and in supporting energy efficiency.
We can offer our own technologies, we can create joint capital to improve energy efficiency in Ukraine, and this will also help our own energy security.
Finally, something which is obvious, improvements in nuclear power station safety in Ukraine, which is very important for Europe.
The second area is scientific cooperation.
Ukraine has considerable achievements in this area.
It is worth benefiting from them.
In addition, exchanges of students and scientists, which could reduce the deficit in the European Union, where we are short of seven hundred thousand scientists.
We should bear in mind that this is always the surest and fastest method of cooperation: science, educational institutions and students.
Thirdly, cooperation between local and regional government.
Our EU towns have a great deal to offer in this regard.
We could assist in creating full democracy on the level of local government in Ukraine, which is something that has not happened so far.
All this should be made part of a long-term aim, namely an association agreement with Ukraine.
It does not matter whether it takes 10 years or 20.
It is worth presenting Ukraine with this opportunity.
It will help Ukrainians, and it will help the European Union.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in plenary this afternoon we debated the European neighbourhood policy.
Following the enlargement round of 2004, the European Commission proposed the development of a coherent strategy towards the Union's new neighbours.
The ENP has created special links with a ring of countries that share the EU's fundamental values and aims.
Our neighbour Ukraine is firmly embedded in the ENP.
We are aware of the special geopolitical and commercial importance of Ukraine as a natural bridge between the EU on the one hand and Russia and Central Asia on the other.
Today the EU is Ukraine's main trading partner; by 2006, the volume of trade between Ukraine and the Member States of the EU had already reached EUR 26.6 billion.
We in the European Union acknowledge the great efforts that have been made in Ukraine in recent years.
The former command economy has been developed into an efficient market economy.
According to the OECD report, Ukraine's economic growth averaged 7.6% in the years from 2000 to 2006.
That is a great success.
In February 2007 we began negotiations on a new partnership and association agreement between Ukraine and the EU.
The Ukrainian aspirations to EU and NATO membership are also well documented.
For reasons of trade and economic policy, accession to the World Trade Organization is at the very top of the Ukrainian agenda.
We assume that accession to the WTO will prove possible before the end of this year.
This would also considerably broaden the scope for cooperation between the EU and Ukraine and smooth the way for negotiations on the creation of a free-trade area in the ENP framework.
The EU must treat Ukraine as a genuine partner and give it clear messages.
In this respect I can only welcome the outcome of the EU-Ukraine summit held in Kiev on 14 September 2007, where the strong and enduring relationship between the two parties was reaffirmed.
We should continue to lend vigorous support to Ukraine on its path to WTO membership, in the subsequent creation of a free-trade area, and with regard to its European aspirations.
Ukraine is a strategically and economically significant EU partner and an Eastern neighbour with an important role within and outside the region.
Relations between the EU and Ukraine have mainly developed in the direction of increasing political cooperation and gradually increasing economic integration.
The implementation of these objectives would contribute towards the further consolidation of democracy and the development of the market economy in Ukraine.
However, the success of Ukraine's development does not depend solely on the EU.
Ukraine must make a forthright decision to follow the pro-Western direction and follow it consistently.
I would like to share some thoughts about economic and trade relations between the EU and Ukraine.
First of all, the start of negotiations for a free trade area with the EU is strictly linked to Ukraine's membership of the WTO.
However, negotiations on the-free trade area would cover not just the abolition of tariffs (which is included in the negotiations with the WTO), but the more extensive convergence - the liberalisation of the services sector, institutional reforms, the harmonisation of the legal basis with the EU acquis.
Accordingly, coordinated actions between the EU and Ukraine with a view to creating the free-trade area should develop alongside Ukraine's membership of the WTO.
Secondly, more attention should be paid to the implementation of good management practice, the intensification of the public sector and the curbing of corruption.
More intense cooperation in these areas would contribute significantly towards establishing more stable economic and trade relations between the EU and Ukraine as well as strengthening the process of democratisation and increasing the prospect of Ukraine's membership of the EU.
Thirdly, it is important to point out the fact that Ukraine's producers are not yet ready to compete with the producers of EU Member States.
Therefore, transitional periods should be established, as well as supervisory institutions in order to safeguard against the negative impact on the Ukrainian economy and society.
The fourth point is that while the EU supports the liberalisation of trade with Ukraine, it must be prepared for possible difficulties arising from Ukraine's producers, especially those involved in exporting to the CIS; resistance to implementation of EU standards; attempts by functionaries to maintain the status quo and existing corruptive ties.
To facilitate successful implementation of the reforms the Ukrainian Government should inform business people and the public about the advantages of the liberalisation of trade and a free-trade area between the EU and Ukraine.
The fifth point is that the intensive development of relations between the EU and Ukraine can potentially increase Russia's political and economic pressure on Ukraine.
In that case the EU should abandon its role of passive arbitrator, as has happened quite often before, and take on the role of defender of its own interests and those of Ukraine.
There is a possibility that Russia could apply pressure on Ukraine and certain EU countries in the sphere of energy supply.
Therefore, the EU should not only make an effort to solve these problems at the highest level, but also, at the same time, seek Ukraine's involvement in the EU common energy market and ensure the security of EU and Ukrainian energy security.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) The report provides an overview of the current development of Ukraine, as an EU partner, and the tasks it still has to carry out, and it deserves praise for the number of issues covered and the depth with which they are assessed.
It is apparent from the report that the author has a deep, personal interest in Ukrainian development issues and in the shaping of its relations with the European Union, and this has of course benefited the report.
The rapporteur has carefully and considerately assessed the problems posing a threat to the successful development of Ukraine, but at the same time, if we do not call a spade a spade, it is sometimes difficult to anticipate solutions to problems.
It cannot go unremarked that in Ukraine's economy increasing numbers of economic sectors are over-regulated, state intervention is not based on laws and there is a continual increase in the creation of mutually incompatible legislation, which benefits those seeking loopholes in laws and those whose job it is to interpret legislation.
Together with the high level of bureaucracy, this significantly hampers the influx of investment into the country's economy, including that from the European Union.
The energy sector is an obvious example of this.
The European Union is interested in a transparent transport system for Ukraine's natural gas, which, like the entire energy sector in Ukraine, is over-regulated, with artificially complex structures and flows of money that are not transparent.
The European Union still does not have the data to allow it to assess the safety of Ukraine's gas transport system.
These are important issues for the European Union, which is Ukraine's largest trading partner.
It is to be hoped that Ukraine will manage to overcome the protracted political crisis and that the Ukrainian Government will in future be involved in EU talks that, on the basis of mutual interest, will make it possible to establish close cooperation.
I agree with the rapporteur that Ukraine's wish to join the European Union cannot be ignored, and here I would like to stress this once again: a clear prospect of EU membership is the most effective reform tool that the European Union can offer Ukraine.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Zaleski very warmly on his report.
I think it is a significantly different kind of report to recent ones which have been voted on in the Committee on International Trade.
Compared to the reports on bilateral trade relations of one or two years ago, like the EU-Russia or EU-Mercosur reports, it shows a lot more cautiousness with regard to the benefits of unfettered free trade.
And I think it indicates a growing consensus across the party spectrum on the importance of actively engaging in a political search for how best to submit trade rules to the principles of sustainable development.
In that respect, I think we can be pleased that we have made the most of the various delays at the WTO Doha Round, which, in a way, have allowed us to conduct this search for more fair and sustainable trade rules in our bilateral trade relations.
I therefore thank the rapporteur for actively seizing this opportunity.
Among the many positive signals that this report gives to DG Trade for their negotiations with Ukraine on a free trade agreement, I would like to highlight four points in particular.
In paragraph 10, I think the report rightly warns against relying exclusively on export orientation and export diversification in order to make trade sustainable.
Instead, it focuses on the importance of developing the domestic market as a necessary basis for any economically sustainable development.
In paragraph 13, the report suggests the need to strike a balance with regard to investors' rights.
In other words, it insists on a legal framework in Ukraine which fosters best practice in corporate social responsibility.
In paragraph 23, the report suggests a significant shift in our foreign energy supply policy by asking for multilateral rules regarding access to energy resources and by warning not to support the race for the best conditions for unilateral energy access.
Finally, in paragraph 36 the report recognises that agriculture is a special activity that cannot be treated in the same way as industrial goods and therefore justifies different tariff rules.
I very much hope that those and other points remain in the final text so that my group can very happily vote in favour of the report.
But I do just want to add that I think it is a pity to hear that DG Trade has been objecting to three key amendments proposed by the Greens and supported by the rapporteur, which call on DG Trade to start negotiations for a bilateral FTA only after the Parliament of Ukraine has given its assent to the WTO accession negotiations.
While DG Trade is certainly right that this might delay the bilateral FTA, we have to insist as parliamentarians, as we do ourselves before the conclusion of such FTAs on the part of the European Union, for the voice of the people to be taken into account on such an important matter and that includes, of course, the people of Ukraine.
We would therefore especially like to thank Mr Zaleski for not giving in to that pressure and, once again, for an excellent report.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, everyone has thanked our honourable colleague Mr Zaleski, and I shall do likewise.
His report was adopted in committee without a single dissenting vote, which shows that we can indeed produce a cross-party report if we try hard enough.
Allow me to make a few remarks.
The Ukrainian elections have taken place.
They were democratic, they were fair and they were free, but I believe they have left a host of problems unresolved.
The incumbent President has always had difficulties in his dealings with strong prime ministers, whether with Yulia Tymoshenko, whom he dismissed in 2005, or with Viktor Yanukovych in 2006 and 2007.
Although the coalition agreement concluded between Yulia Tymoshenko's alliance and the Our Ukraine bloc exists on paper as the basis of a possible new government constellation, the government has not yet been formed.
Nor do we know what will actually transpire, even though the deadline is now quite close.
If this government is formed by then, its first task, in my view, is to tackle constitutional reform, for without reform of the Constitution there is no guarantee that the internal stability of the political forces in Ukraine will suffice to avoid another fresh set of elections, especially as some people are already thinking about calling for new parliamentary elections at the time of the presidential election.
If you look at certain areas, such as economic policy, the OECD report paints a truly encouraging picture.
It tells us that Ukraine recorded average GDP growth of 8.7% between 2000 and 2006.
If you look behind these figures, however, you will see a huge trade deficit.
Ukraine has a deficit of more than EUR 4.5 billion in its trade with the countries of the CIS and a deficit of almost EUR 4.5 billion with the European Union.
In other words, there is still a real need for economic change, and the partnership agreements can and must be used for that purpose.
On the other hand, compared with the statistics of a country such as my own - the Federal Republic of Germany - the Ukrainian figures do seem magnificent.
Ukraine's unemployment rate is lower, its GDP is growing faster, its welfare expenditure on pensions is higher, and it spends a higher percentage of its GDP on education, and hence on investment in the future, than the Federal Republic of Germany.
There is therefore every reason to conclude that the country is unquestionably on the right path.
Nevertheless, I referred to problems in the economy, and there are, of course, problems in other areas too.
Russia has clearly signalled and plainly stated that its energy prices will rise by 10% with effect from 1 January 2008.
That will have a profound impact on the Ukrainian economy.
At the present time, Ukraine pays its debts to Russia with gas supplies from its own underground deposits.
We shall see how that develops.
It will become a political issue again, and it is important for the European Union to intervene to keep the peace.
The Russians are entitled to raise their prices, and it goes without saying that the Ukrainians will have to work out how to deal with the economic fallout.
Take another point, namely social policy.
During the electoral campaign, all of the parties that stood for election announced vast increases in welfare spending.
If you look at the present coalition agreement between the Tymoshenko alliance and the President's bloc, you will see that there is no mention at all of an increase in welfare expenditure.
And indeed it would be virtually impossible, given the present level of government revenue, to effect the promised spending increases.
This means that Ukrainian development is not advancing as quickly as is always asserted.
The next point to which I wish to refer is foreign policy.
During the election campaign, all parties promised to move the country closer to the European Union.
The party that has always linked this convergence with the European Union most closely with the issue of accession to NATO, namely the Our Ukraine party, was the one that suffered the heaviest losses.
An absolute majority of the Ukrainian population are opposed to membership of NATO.
I therefore ask the European Union to proceed cautiously here.
The majority of the population do not want their country to join NATO.
All the available data indicate that they do want it to join the WTO.
If we consider, against this backdrop, how the partnership agreements should now be shaped, the real needs emerge in the areas where Ukraine still has the difficulties I have listed.
Ukraine must - and here I agree entirely with Mr Zaleski - have a European perspective, a prospect of accession to the EU.
It would be good for the European Union to have a strong partner in the East, and it would also be good for Ukraine in view of its general geostrategic orientation.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, our debate on the European Union's trade and economic relations with Ukraine, the subject of Mr Zaleski's very thorough report, comes at a crucial time: parliamentary elections have taken place and the country's economic and political problems need to be tackled vigorously by an energetic new government.
I am thinking of active measures against corruption.
With winter coming, Ukraine also needs a strong government which can negotiate with Russia on the supply and transit of Russian gas.
Having read this report, I am inclined to say that Europe has made clear what it wants.
The ball is now in Ukraine's court.
The country must have not only an effective government, but also one which demonstrates a political determination to address the problems.
After five elections in as many years, the population is understandably tired of all the political squabbling.
Ukraine's politicians must henceforth be concerned less with each other and more with the country's political and economic future.
Yes, the ball is in Ukraine's court, but I will say more than that, Mr President.
The European Union has work to do too.
I agree with what our rapporteur says in Paragraph 51, that the European Neighbourhood Policy suffers from a lack of clear definitions and perspectives.
The prospect of EU membership must be extended to Ukraine in the medium or long term.
As part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union can then initiate or support the reforms needed in the country.
(PL) Mr President, Ukraine is a country with strategic importance within the European Neighbourhood Policy, and it is an important partner for the countries of the European Union.
We all hope that growth in trade between Ukraine and EU countries will strengthen economic growth and cooperation with countries in the region.
Good economic relations are advantageous to both sides.
Economic growth in Ukraine should take place in parallel with respect for democracy and for the country's laws.
I am also thinking at this point of respect for the rights of ethnic minorities and, an issue that is important for me, activities that glorify fascism and genocide should not be permitted.
We support democratic and economic processes in our eastern neighbour.
On the other hand, it would seem appropriate to avoid biased and one-sided support for any political bloc in Ukraine.
(PL) Mr President, acting as you did earlier I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Zaleski on such an insightful report concerning trade and economic relations with Ukraine.
The issue of cooperation with Ukraine is particularly important at present, and all the initiatives aimed at strengthening cooperation are a clear sign of European interest in our eastern neighbour and of openness on the part of the European Union.
The problem lies in the fact that the time when it would be appropriate to put into practice the idea of closer cooperation, going further than the European Neighbourhood Policy, which has been of little benefit to Ukraine so far, is actually coming.
It is undeniable that Ukraine still has far to go to approach the Community's economic, political and social structures.
The tasks that Ukraine faces have been thoroughly considered in the report.
Despite the fact that Ukraine can boast of its achievements as regards liberalisation of trade and capital flows, further reforms and strengthening of the Ukrainian economy, which includes membership of the WTO, are essential.
Despite the European aspirations aired during the orange revolution, Ukraine still has to make an unequivocal choice between the European option and the Russian one.
If we want Ukraine to choose the European option, we must state this clearly and we must give this our support.
The EU should express its interest in contact with Ukraine by providing active support on the one hand for changes in Ukraine and, on the other, by taking steps within the European Union aimed at a gradual transition from a neighbourhood policy to a policy of integration.
For this purpose, steps need to be taken both on the economic front and in the social and political arenas.
It would be appropriate, therefore, to support Ukraine's independence from Russia by strengthening economic ties, which means creating an EU-Ukraine free trade area, including Ukraine in the Community's power network, and possibly providing finance for the transport system.
It would also be useful to support and implement programmes to promote Ukraine in the European Union as well as the European Union in Ukraine, and also programmes to promote the development of science and education, which is an issue raised by Professor Buzek.
The most important step as regards changing the image of the European Union in the eyes of Ukrainians would be to abolish the visa requirement for travelling to the European Union, as well as a clear statement, and this is something of which everyone has spoken, that Ukraine will be able to accede to the European Union, even if this involves an extended time frame.
(LT) On 18 October in Portugal President Yushchenko announced Ukraine's intention to join the WTO this year.
Ukraine has already completed negotiations with the WTO countries, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which still insists on recovering the old debt of USD 27 million dating from Soviet times.
Ukraine's acceptance into the WTO will result in a reduction in import taxes and an increased number of importers.
However, it is important that Ukraine implements systematic economic reforms.
Despite positive changes, such as the membership of the WTO, the public mood indicates the need for serious reforms.
Ukraine is developing rapidly.
In recent years there has been significant growth in the GDP, but there is still a lot to be done in the area of economic productivity and competitiveness.
According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2007-2008, Ukraine has dropped from 69th place to 73rd.
The influence of oligarchs is decidedly negative.
Ukraine is a strategic partner, so it is important to integrate it further into such important sectors as energy and bilateral trade.
Ukraine's significant role in ensuring the security of EU energy supply should be considered comprehensively.
The possibility of integrating Ukraine in the trans-European transport networks should be encouraged, as Ukraine could play the strategic role of a transit country through which oil and gas could be supplied to Europe.
I hope that, now the Verkhovna Rada elections have taken place, Ukraine will have got on the path towards political stability.
I think the EU should continue its open door policy in respect of Ukraine.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it would clearly be in the interests of the European Union to strengthen and develop political and economic ties with Ukraine.
Ukraine, which has benefited from the continuing process of democratisation, has become one of the most promising trade partners for the European Union.
Ukraine's aspirations to become a member of the World Trade Organization deserve support.
The acceptance of Ukraine by that organisation will show, once and for all, that the country has gone from being a centrally planned economy to being a fully functioning market economy.
It is also important to accept Ukraine's aspirations to have good political and economic ties with Russia.
As Russia, in offering an agreement on a common trade area with Ukraine, is trying to gain control over that country for its own ends, it is important for the European Commission to present a decisive standpoint supporting Ukraine in its aspirations to become a member of the European Union.
Ukraine should have proper political and economic relations with Russia but, at the same time, we should support its EU aspirations.
At the start of the coming year, the solutions relating to the acceptance by Poland of the Schengen Convention will come into force.
It is important that compliance with the regulations on security as regards the borders of the European Union do not, at the same time, create a new Berlin wall for the inhabitants of Ukraine.
I hope that the European Commission will allow Poland to introduce these regulations in such a way as to make them beneficial for the inhabitants of Ukraine.
Mr President, I questioned the Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych during his visit to Parliament last March.
I confronted him with the problem of the gruesome, but lucrative and widespread illegal trade in human body parts in his country.
To my surprise, he did not deny it.
In fact he said it was a very painful issue and asked us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for help, especially with the buyers, many of whom come from the EU.
It is important to compliment the Ukraine on its honesty about this problem and we should express a strong desire to eradicate it as a trade completely incompatible with human dignity and with closer EU-Ukrainian relations.
This report is about helping the Ukraine in areas like trade.
This must include the help that the former Prime Minister asked our Parliament for.
It is a matter of urgency, as one cannot talk about further collaboration with a country where the trafficking of living and dead humans makes up a significant part of the economy.
The fight against it has to play an important role in the cooperation between the EU and the Ukraine.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to join those who have congratulated our colleague, Mr Zaleski, on his excellent report.
It is in the interests of the European Union for Ukraine to remain politically stable and to develop its economy.
A successful Ukraine could serve as a positive example for all the countries in the region and the states of the former Soviet Union, and help to reinforce democracy in the region.
The European Union must help and encourage Ukraine to bind its future not to Russia but to the European Union.
Ukraine is a European country, and its geographical location, history and cultural traditions bind it to Europe.
We must help Ukraine to become capable of applying the WTO rules.
WTO membership may lead to a free trade agreement with the European Union.
Expanding trade is a common interest for Europe and Ukraine, but there is a need for undistorted trade that also ensures the application by Ukraine of the social, employment, animal health, plant health and environmental rules.
Failing this, we will have to face many problems.
Allow me to cite Hungary as an example in this case, since Hungary shares a border with Ukraine.
In Hungary, poultry keepers have to make extraordinarily expensive investments in order to fulfil the animal welfare and environmental protection provisions.
If the free trade agreement also covered animal husbandry products, a significant proportion of Hungarian producers would relocate their production plants to Ukraine, barely 100 km from the current sites, and could continue competitive production at extraordinarily low cost.
On the other hand, all the products that they could produce avoiding the animal welfare provisions would come back into the European Union, and as the River Tisza flows from Ukraine into Hungary, we in Hungary will have to face environmental protection problems too.
I am therefore of the opinion that we must help Ukraine to apply all the international social, animal health, environmental protection and animal welfare rules as soon as possible.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(PL) Mr President, Ukraine stands today before a strategic decision: whether to make the divisions in the country permanent through the creation of an orange coalition, or to create an Our Ukraine coalition with the Party of Regions.
The decision taken in this regard will have a profound significance for future EU-Ukraine relations.
If the first option is chosen, there is a high probability that this will lead to political cooperation with the European Union as well as enormous economic tensions with Russia.
If there is a large orange-blue coalition there will be relative economic stability, but the integration of Ukraine with the EU will be significantly delayed.
I am not sure whether the EU today is in a position to provide Ukraine with assistance that would be sufficient to compensate that country for the losses brought about by a conflict with Russia.
This issue is important, in that the EU has to make a declaration now as to whether it is prepared for significant financial and political involvement in helping Ukraine.
If we do not provide an unequivocal viewpoint, we could ourselves provoke destabilisation of the internal situation in Ukraine.
I would like to congratulate Mr Zaleski on his report.
(LT) If somebody were to ask me today which of the European Neighbourhood Policy countries was the closest to the European Union, I would not hesitate to say: Ukraine.
This huge country with a population of 46 million has a right to take pride in its democratic achievements since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
It has undoubtedly developed into one of the most promising EU partners.
As a representative of the European Parliament delegation, more than a month ago I had the opportunity to observe the parliamentary elections in this country and was satisfied that there is an obvious trend towards increasing the development of democratic civic institutions, democracy is becoming an integral part of life in Ukraine, and the elections in that country are no different from those in the EU Member States.
If you look at the map, it is obvious that Ukraine's position cannot be easy (on one side there is the EU, and on the other side, Russia).
The choice is not easy, as it is not easy to give an answer to the question - 'Quo vadis, Ukraine?'
It is clear, though, that today Ukraine must make an irreversible choice.
This choice does not mean that all long-term trade and economic relations with Russia and the CIS must be severed or that Russia cannot participate in Ukraine's economy; it is rather the opposite.
However, for example, the agreement on the CIS Single Economic Space recently proposed by Russia would be more likely to jeopardise Ukraine's ambition to achieve economic independence than help realise that ambition.
I wish to point out that the EU, together with its institutions, its Member States, should offer political and diplomatic assistance to Ukraine with a view to ensuring the country's acceptance into the World Trade Organisation.
Assistance after membership of the WTO is finalised is also of great importance, such as assistance with official negotiations on the Free-Trade Agreement and a new, more detailed agreement between the EU and Ukraine.
Finally, I would like to thank my Polish colleague Mr Zaleski for his excellent report.
My best wishes to our colleagues from Ukraine in finalising the formation of the new government and commencing the important tasks that await them.
(PL) Mr President, Ukraine is a strategically important neighbour for the European Union.
It is a natural bridge linking us with Russia and Central Asia.
Since 2004, that is, since the time of the major enlargement, the EU has been Ukraine's largest trading partner.
To a great extent, the EU and Ukraine share the same economic and trading interests and, for this reason, it is sensible to go down the path of further integration of our markets in order to gain the greatest benefits.
The way to achieve this is to create a common free trade area, but first Ukraine must complete its process of accession to the WTO.
We should do everything we can, politically and diplomatically, to support Ukraine in its bid to gain this membership.
It will also be necessary to provide ongoing support to help Ukraine fulfil WTO requirements.
We should remember that, behind Ukraine, there is the mighty hand of Russia, which would once again like to dominate this part of Europe.
For this reason it is a good idea to give Ukraine the status of a market economy, which should bring that country closer to Western Europe and, as a result, should lead to membership of the European Union.
Mr Zaleski's report is a good step in this direction, and I would like to congratulate him on the report.
(DE) Mr President, allow me to begin my remarks by pointing out that this is the second debate today on a foreign-policy issue at which the Commission has not been represented by the competent Commissioner.
This morning we had our main debate on the subject of globalisation, and the competent Commissioner was not present, and this evening the members of the Commission with responsibility for this important matter are once more absent.
I have nothing against our esteemed Commissioner Borg, but it would be proper, in my view, if the Commission were represented by the Commissioner with responsibility for the subject under discussion.
I should be grateful, Mr President, if you would forward this request to the Commission for future debates, and I am sure it serves the interests of the whole college of Commissioners.
I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Zaleski for his very balanced report.
We must improve our cooperation with our Ukrainian neighbours.
That is why it is good that the European neighbourhood policy should be shaped accordingly.
That is why it is good that Ukraine should accede to the WTO.
That is why it is good that we should negotiate a partnership and cooperation agreement, and it is good that we should support the vision of a free trade area as the start of a careful unveiling of a European perspective for Ukraine.
Let me also say at this point, however, that I cannot envisage Ukrainian membership of the EU for the foreseeable future.
Improved cooperation, to which many of my fellow Members have already referred, is also an urgent requirement and can benefit both sides.
I attach particular importance to fruitful cooperation and close solidarity with our eastern neighbours.
In my view it is intolerable, for example, that Russia should make its cooperation with Ukraine dependent on which government is in office in Kiev and which parliamentary majority the Ukrainian nation has elected.
That is intolerable, and Russia is on the wrong track with such a policy.
We as Europeans, as the European Union, must support the Ukrainian people on the next stages of their journey to independence and firmly established democracy.
Mr Zaleski's report constitutes a large and important contribution to that effort.
I am sure you are right, Mr Caspary, that the debate should be replied to by the appropriate Commissioner, but in practical terms that is not always possible.
I know that Mr Borg is an extremely experienced Commissioner and politician who will no doubt convey your message to the relevant people.
I should point out that the debate on globalisation earlier today was replied to by Mr Barroso, so it is a mix-and-match Commission, but a very competent one.
(PL) Mr President, Ukraine should have priority as regards the European Union's foreign policy within Europe.
This is because of its strategic geopolitical situation.
On one side it is a direct neighbour of the European Union and, on the other, Ukraine could be an important bridge between the EU, Russia and the countries of Central Asia.
With its access to the Black Sea, it could be an important economic partner in that region as well.
I support the recommendations of the rapporteur as regards assistance from Member States to Ukraine in its accession to the WTO.
This will bring a raft of benefits to Ukraine and to the region.
In saying this, however, we should not lose sight of the fact that, for historical reasons, Kiev still has much to do.
The European Union should support the Ukrainian government in rebuilding the country on many levels, not just as regards its economy or industry, but also in social matters.
There should also be considerable flexibility as regards foreign policy, taking into consideration the political complexity in Ukraine.
At this point it is important to consider Russia, whose interests conflict with Community interests in Right-bank Ukraine.
Ukrainian democracy is still very young.
However, the last few years have shown that democratic processes are becoming stabilised.
We cannot at this time forget that, depending on social attitudes, it would be possible for strongly anti-European forces to come to power.
For this reason I would like to add my congratulations to those that have already been expressed in the House, and I am in favour of Mr Zaleski's report.
It is a report in which all these fundamental questions have been addressed, and in which a path has been outlined for the EU to follow in its policy towards Ukraine.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their comments and the interesting debate.
I have taken good note of it and will convey your messages to my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, who is today attending an international commitment that he could not miss.
I am, however, certain that he will give them due consideration.
Allow me to react to some of the points raised in the debate.
While not entering into detail on the different points, I would like to underline that we are in agreement on two most important conclusions.
First, that Ukraine is a key and valuable partner in the European Union's neighbourhood strategy.
We share your key messages concerning the positive economic interdependence, the importance of our energy relations, the field of science, people-to-people relations and the need to deepen and strengthen our economic relations.
On the issue of WTO accession, the Commission is in full agreement that this is a key issue.
However, the Commission and the Member States believe that negotiations on an FTA represent a crucial step which needs to be taken as soon as possible.
As a consequence the finalisation of the WTO Geneva process would be sufficient to allow for the setting in motion of the negotiations for a deep and comprehensive FTA.
We hope that the WTO process can still be finalised by the end of this year or the very beginning of 2008.
We aim to conclude the most ambitious bilateral trade agreement we have ever entered into.
It will also need to address the question of institutional capacities and reform needs, customs, police and the judiciary and the question of corruption in general.
On the issue of scientific exchanges and visas, I would like to point out that these will also be covered by the FTA.
Let me also state that increasing trade flows is not a threat for sustainable development.
On the other hand, it encourages sustainable development through the adoption of EU standards.
On the issue of Ukraine's possible accession to the EU, let me emphasise that neither side is ready for this step.
The new enhanced agreement will bring Ukraine as close as possible to the EU in as many areas as possible while not prejudging any possible future developments in EU-Ukraine relations in accordance with the treaty provisions.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for this good report, which we find to be a balanced report, and we will take due account of its recommendations in our ongoing work with Ukraine.
Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you to all speakers in this important debate on a particularly relevant topic.
The debate is closed;
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) The report that has been discussed rightly sheds light on the fact that Ukraine is a strategically important partner for the European Union, since it may play an important intermediary role in dialogue with Russia and other Central Asian countries.
We are convinced that the strengthening of economic relations through the principles of a free market has inherent advantages for both sides.
This is particularly true in the area of energy policy.
The events of the last few months have shed new light on the fact that the energy sector in Ukraine today is characterised by a lack of transparency.
The confusing relationships allow room for corruption and the exercise of political pressure.
None of this promotes the realisation of market relationships.
They impede Ukraine's endeavours in respect of integration with the Union and thereby endanger the security of European supply.
The European Union and Ukraine must work together precisely for this reason, so that the principles of transparency and competition are realised as cooperation begins to develop in the field of energy.
At the same time, in any case, we must base the relationship on reciprocity.
I feel that it is important to note that the economic cooperation to be developed between the European Union and Ukraine cannot be interpreted without taking into account the ambitions of Russia.
The Ukrainian Government that is taking office may have an important role in ensuring that the principles outlined above are realised not only in connection with dialogue with the Union but also in the whole region.
in writing. - Following the 2004 enlargement and the accession of countries with common external borders with Ukraine, it is clear that Ukraine has become a neighbour of strategic importance to the EU as a whole, as well as a determinant actor in the region.
Since 2004, the EU has been the most important trade partner of Ukraine, and the eastern expansion of the Union's borders has definitively opened up new opportunities for trade, industrial cooperation and economic growth in the region.
In this respect, it is of the utmost importance for the Union to actively support the WTO accession of Ukraine, following which it will be possible to establish a genuine EU-Ukraine free trade area within a sound and transparent institutional framework.
Generally speaking, it is indeed in the interests of the Union to foster a good commercial, economic and social performance in Ukraine in order to secure trade relations and political stability in the region.
We therefore support the call for a coordinated global response to the political, economic and social challenges in Eastern Central Europe.
More specifically, we ought to set up consistent approaches, together with Ukraine, on important issues, such as the reliability of energy supply, nuclear safety, agricultural matters and environmental sustainable standards.
Recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (debate)
The next item is the report by Iles Braghetto, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean - C6-0110/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, and to the Committee on Fisheries for this report, which raises the issue of the recovery plan for bluefin tuna.
The Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna is a key stock for the Community.
As confirmed by scientific advice, this bluefin tuna stock is now at high risk of collapse.
All the states involved in this fishery have agreed to the need for urgent measures to ensure the sustainability of the bluefin tuna stock and of the fishery.
I am convinced that the recovery plan adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas in 2006 represents a realistic chance for the gradual recovery of bluefin tuna if it is fully respected.
Therefore, decisive and effective action is immediately necessary at Community level.
The speed of the implementation of the ICCAT recovery plan is an absolute must, both for conservation reasons and to safeguard the common fisheries policy's credibility and the credibility of the EU fishermen themselves.
The objective is to have the proposal agreed at the November Council.
During discussions held in the context of the Council preparations, many changes were introduced to the original proposal, some of which go in the direction of your suggested amendments.
I am sure that we are in agreement on the objectives of urgently taking measures to eliminate overfishing and to ensure strict compliance with ICCAT measures, in order to bring the bluefin tuna stock to sustainable levels.
This will, at the same time, improve the profitability of the fishing industry in the long term.
Apart from the benefits to industry, there is also an international political commitment that we are obliged to fulfil.
Turning now to the report, I appreciate and share the Fisheries Committee's view that the Community needs to address the excess fishing effort of its fleet.
The Commission also considers that the annual fishing plan is an effective instrument to avoid overfishing because of the overcapacity of the Community fleet.
In this context, the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 7 and 8 concerning the establishment of annual fishing plans to ensure a balance between the fishing effort of the Community fleet and the quotas.
A relevant provision on this issue has been introduced in the Presidency compromise.
In addition, the Commission asks the Member States concerned to include in their operational plans a reduction of their fishing capacity, either temporary cessation or scrapping, to ensure that their quotas for 2008 and the following years are fully respected.
I recognise that we are asking the industry to make considerable sacrifices, but these are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fisheries, fleets and coastal communities concerned.
The choice is between short-term sacrifice and the collapse of the stock.
Moreover, I totally agree with you that, in order to alleviate the socio-economic impact that will be caused by the reduction in fishing activity, it is necessary to ensure financial compensation for the industry.
A provision on the related financing measure in line with Amendment 5 has also been introduced in the Presidency compromise.
I am aware that there are other concerns.
I share many of those concerns and know that they too will need to be addressed.
With respect to Amendment 3, let me state first of all that I am well aware that the number of cages for tuna fattening has increased greatly since 1990 and that their capacity exceeds the total sum of the TAC available.
ICCAT has now adopted a strict regulation in order to ensure the sustainable development of farming activities for bluefin tuna.
The next step will be to regulate the number of farms.
The Commission fully supports the adoption of the recommendation made by the ICCAT Working Group on Capacity in July 2007.
This recommendation proposes the implementation of a freeze on boat fishing capacity and farming capacity for bluefin tuna.
We need to wait for the final results of the ICCAT discussion being held in Antalya this week.
That is the reason why the Commission cannot accept, at this stage, the amendment concerning the limitation of farming capacity.
On the derogations relating to fishing areas and minimum size, I would like to remind you of the context within which such derogations were accepted by ICCAT.
All contracting parties have agreed these derogations as part of the package on the recovery plan.
These derogations were granted for artisanal fleets and for some seasonal fleets because their impact on catches is insignificant.
In addition, these derogations include a series of strict conditions, such as a limited number of vessels, limited catches and designated ports.
Having said that, the recovery plan may be revised in 2008 on the basis of new scientific advice or weaknesses detected in its implementation.
At this stage, the Community has a responsibility to ensure that the recovery plan is incorporated in Community legislation to ensure its full implementation.
In this context, I cannot accept Parliament's amendments on the deletion of the derogations, that is Amendments 4 and 6, or Amendments 12 and 13 on the renaming of the plan, the modification of the EC quotas and the introduction of a new payback system.
These amendments are not in line with the recovery plan adopted by ICCAT and the ICCAT rules on payback.
Similarly, I cannot accept Amendment 10 regarding traps, since the proposal does not include measures to address this issue.
For the first time, the recovery plan regulates trap activity and this will, in future, enable an evaluation of the impact of this fishing activity on the stock.
Regarding Amendments 9 and 11 relating to the harmonisation of sanctions and the possible closure of a national fishery of a Member State where it fails to respect its reporting requirements, let me say that, whereas we fully understand and share the spirit behind this proposal, we cannot accept the amendment in this context, as the proposal does not include measures that address the issue.
The issue is one of general policy and the Commission will examine it in the forthcoming 2008 reform of the control framework of the common fisheries policy.
We consider that documentation and transmission of information to the Commission at set times is a crucial element for the success of the bluefin tuna recovery plan, and it is also a prerequisite if we are to monitor the uptake of the EU quota in real time.
The Commission has therefore opened infringement procedures against all seven Member States which take part in the bluefin tuna fishery for shortcomings in data transmission.
In conclusion, let me state that we are deeply concerned about the overshoot of the quota by some Member States, which undermines the credibility of the Community at international level and jeopardises the success of the bluefin tuna recovery plan.
At the meeting of the Compliance Committee, which took place in Antalya on 8 and 9 November, the contracting parties - notably the United States and Canada - criticised the lack of compliance with ICCAT rules.
As expected, the European Community was severely criticised for overshooting the TAC in 2007.
At the same time, the contracting parties acknowledged the difficulties for the European Community fleet in adapting to the reality of the recovery plan, which entered into force in 2007, and welcomed the European Community proposal on a specific payback regime.
The Compliance Committee has adopted a specific recommendation concerning a payback system for the overshoot of the EC quota in 2007, which comes to 4 440 tonnes, based on an EC proposal.
In accordance with this recommendation, the overharvesting of the European Community's quota in 2007 will result in a yearly deduction of 1 480 tonnes from its annual quota for the period 2009-2011.
In addition, the Compliance Committee agreed that the figure for the European Community was provisional and may be subject to review and eventual adjustment as a result of ongoing investigations.
This recommendation will be adopted by ICCAT during its plenary session on 18 November.
Nevertheless, we have to reassure the ICCAT parties that the European Community will do its utmost to ensure that quotas allocated to the vessels of our Member States are scrupulously monitored by those Member States and by the European Commission, in order to ensure respect for the quota set for 2008 and the forthcoming years.
Following the adoption of this regulation, the Commission is resolved to work closely with the Member States to ensure and closely monitor the full implementation of the bluefin tuna recovery plan.
The Community Fisheries Control Agency will also play an active role.
The agency has started the preparatory work for the coordination of control and inspection activities by Member States, with a view to having everything in place for the 2008 bluefin tuna season.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Commission's recovery plan for bluefin tuna, set in motion by ICCAT, is to respond to scientists' concerns regarding the critical condition of the stock brought about by overfishing.
The plan has been criticised in a variety of ways, illustrating the fact that scientific experts and fishermen hold differing views regarding the need for stocks to be protected.
It does, however, offer an appropriate response to those needs that have been highlighted, providing, as it does, for a steady reduction in the catch quota of up to 20% between 2006 and 2010, an increase in minimum size to 30 kg, the limitation of fishing periods and the stepping up of control measures to combat illegal fishing.
In detail, some elements of the plan were strengthened during the Committee's work, with proposals to:
make provision and ask for fisheries plans to be submitted by Member States under the fisheries agreements, even in the case of fish stocks which are in good biological shape, since one of the main problems is a fleet capacity which exceeds the quotas available;
establish a balance in each Member State between its quotas and the capacity of its fattening farms;
remove the derogations relating to fishing areas and minimum sizes: these conflict with the views held by all scientific experts and with the opinion of the majority of the Member States.
Moreover, these derogations are not justified from the biological point of view, since the Mediterranean and the Atlantic are populated by a single stock, and are severely distorting competition, leading to more intensive fishing in the areas concerned, including by vessels which do not traditionally operate there, and reducing the effectiveness of checks;
urge Member States to respect their requirements to report data and information to the Commission, closing national fisheries if no catch data are provided by Member States;
draw up a plan to reactivate traps in the Atlantic and to recover traps which are no longer active in the Mediterranean in order to preserve a sustainable and highly selective method of catching tuna;
make provision for financial compensation from the European Fisheries Fund to be paid to fishermen during the closed season in order to safeguard and protect the socio-economic balance of fishery enterprises and fishermen;
harmonise penalties in order to prevent discrepancies in the way in which the Member States implement this regulation.
Lastly, the infringement procedures opened in recent months against some Member States for their failure to respect the 2007 catch quotas are undoubtedly called for and necessary, but the short period for the entry into force of the current provisions during this year should also be borne in mind.
Bearing in mind also that stock management is particularly complex, especially in areas in which there is strong competition with other non-EU fleets, in particular in the Mediterranean, there is a need for improved respect of the principle of reciprocity to ensure that the aims set out by ICCAT are fairly pursued.
Those measures will be effective only if their principles and their provisions are applied by both the Member States and non-EU countries.
In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to offer my particular thanks to all those colleagues who have taken part in this work.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, although I share the view that this recovery plan is not as ambitious as it should be, the truth is that it is the result of a hard-won compromise at the ICCAT and I believe that by approving it we are taking a huge step forward and for the first time sending a very clear message to the persons responsible for the over-fishing of this species.
In any event, as far as the European Union is concerned, the serious status of the bluefin tuna is down to certain Member States which have allowed and even encouraged excessive growth of their Mediterranean fleets and by the Commission which, while fully aware of that abuse and the continuous under-reporting of catches, has not lifted a finger to remedy the situation until now.
This failure to take responsibility is what has led to the closure of the fishery to all Member States because of the scandalous news in August that two countries had fished the European Union's entire quota.
On that ground I believe it is important for the plenary sitting to endorse Mr Braghetto's report, which includes my amendment, so that henceforth the Member States will be required to submit a fisheries plan in advance stating, first, the maximum number of vessels and secondly, that the country's fishing effort is in line with its quota.
The Commission has indicated that it is in favour of incorporating the fisheries plan and we hope that the Council will also lend it its support.
I regret, nonetheless, that the report has not made provision for any exceptions for fleets which have since time immemorial fished the Atlantic taking a negligible amount of the Community quota with much more selective gear.
The people involved in these traditional fisheries are therefore forced to pay for the sins of unrestricted avarice on the part of the purse-seine fleets of the two Member States I referred to above even though they have had no part in it.
This is an injustice which I also hope this Parliament and the Council will rectify.
Finally, all that remains for me to do is to ask and urge the Commission to take all the measures necessary so that when distributing the Community quota for next year due compensation is made to the Member States which have been forced to stop fishing because the quotas to which they were entitled have been used up by others and that the appropriate tonnage is withdrawn from the quotas of those responsible so that it can serve as genuine and effective recompense.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I take a very positive view of the Commission proposal to transpose the recovery plan for bluefin tuna agreed at ICCAT into the legal order and I agree with the Commissioner that the measures it contains, if applied correctly, will allow a gradual recovery of stocks both in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
The plan - and this is a very important factor for me - has taken into account the specific features of traditional fisheries by extending to them terms and conditions which will prevent their activity from being penalised, while at the same time striving to combine conservation of the resource with socio-economic aspects.
On that matter I would like to inform the Commissioner that from the outset my country sought a degree of flexibility over the minimum size to be applied to the traditional fleet and for that reason asked for a given percentage allocated to the traditional fleet to be included in the under-30kg quota of that fleet.
The Commission listened to that request, understood that small traditional fishermen could not be made to pay for a situation brought about by large industrial fleets, and agreed to include that measure, although it reduced it to 2% in the plan.
However, Commissioner, the place in which it incorporated it, namely point 6 of Annex I, raises doubts as to the geographical scope of application.
Restricting the measure to Atlantic fisheries would mean quite simply ordering the disappearance of the traditional Mediterranean fleet, a fleet which does not even have the capacity to travel to the Atlantic fishing grounds.
At issue here is an historic fleet which has been operating for centuries without causing problems to the stock; any decline is down to excess capacity in the purse seine fleet of the Mediterranean.
Commissioner, the measure should apply to the fleets of all countries which are involved in the fisheries, not only those which have Atlantic fleets.
Algeria, Tunisia or Turkey also have the right to use some of their quota to protect their traditional fleets against competition from industrial fleets and I do not believe that this exception, minimal as you know it to be, will do anything at all to reduce the effectiveness of the recovery plan.
That is why I am asking the Commission to take account of the doubts raised by the inclusion of the measure under point 6 of Annex I and why I am asking the Commission representatives to make every possible effort during the ICCAT meeting currently under way to clarify that that 2% of catches may be made by traditional fleets both in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean.
As regards the report we are debating today, I would like to inform the rapporteur that my Group is again opposing the removal of exceptions both to the minimum size and to off-limits areas, exceptions which, as the Commissioner has said, were agreed at ICCAT.
For the same reason we oppose, and will oppose tomorrow in the vote, the new amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, on his excellent work in the Committee on Fisheries, making it possible for to us to table a balanced text for tomorrow's vote, which, based to some extent on previous experience, amends the regulation on bluefin tuna recovery in a way which undoubtedly improves it.
The removal of the derogations to the fixed quotas for tuna catches, some of which had originally been maintained, and for catches in the Eastern Atlantic and in the Adriatic, is in my view one of the major successes of this parliamentary procedure.
Those derogations were not adequately justified from the biological point of view, since the Mediterranean and the Atlantic are populated by a single tuna stock, and they could even severely distort competition since they could lead to more intensive fishing in those areas not subject to restrictions.
Checks would also be more difficult and would undoubtedly be less effective.
I agree with the rapporteur that financial compensation needs to be paid to fishermen during the closed season and I also welcome the proposed plan to reactivate traps.
Illegal fishing, considered to be one of the major scourges undermining the protection of bluefin tuna stocks, also needs to be vigorously combated.
Although the proposal for a regulation tackles the problem of checks more incisively than in the past, ongoing discrepancies in the way in which the various Member States apply the legislative provisions should, in my view, be ironed out.
In my view, improved cooperation between states is needed to harmonise national legislation on implementing measures and that is the direction that my amendment takes.
In my view, a further problem also needs to be resolved: managing bluefin tuna stocks in the Mediterranean requires a global strategy agreed with the other non-ICCAT countries which fish in the Mediterranean.
I am thinking, for instance, of the Japanese fleet, as otherwise the goals pursued by the regulation will come to naught.
I therefore hope, by way of conclusion, that the vote will endorse the text agreed by the Committee on Fisheries.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I too would like to begin by acknowledging the work done by our colleague Mr Braghetto in this report.
However, as I mentioned at the time during the Fisheries Committee discussions, on the basis of the reports being drawn up by a large number of scientists, environmental organisations and even some areas of the sector, I believe the title of the report should be changed.
Instead of referring to a supposed regulation of the recovery plan for bluefin tuna, we should call it the non-recovery plan or, better still, the plan for the annihilation of tuna.
Let's be clear about this: when the misnamed recovery plan was adopted at ICCAT a year ago in Dubrovnik the Scientific Committee warned even at that stage, and I quote, 'Generally speaking the preliminary results indicate that it is unlikely that the measures adopted, although a step in the right direction, will fully achieve the objective of the plan'.
It added, 'If implemented perfectly and if future recruitment is approximately at the level of the 1990s and is not affected by the recent level in the reproductive biomass, there is a 50% probability of recovery in 2023 under the current regulations'.
In other words, in the event either of less than perfect implementation or of recruitment which falls below recent levels in line with the reduction in the reproductive biomass, or both, the objectives of the recovery plan will be difficult to achieve.
I reiterate that the basis for my speech is scientific reports.
As if that were not enough, the plan, which has already been implemented provisionally in 2007, has gone so badly in practice that the European Union has exceeded its quota by 26%, which, in an unprecedented move, has forced legal proceedings to be taken against all the countries which failed to comply with the rules, especially France and Italy.
I am of course concerned to know how another country, Spain, was able to export almost 9 000 tonnes of tuna in 2006 when it only declared having captured 4 700 tonnes, as organisations such as Greenpeace or Adena have noted.
Finally, it would also be interesting to hear what measures the Commission and governments intend to take to control and even reduce the size of the fishing fleet, given that it would be difficult, to say the least, to believe it possible to reduce catches when our vessels are increasing in number and quality, vessels which in the majority of cases are living off European subsidies.
Perhaps the ICCAT meeting being held at the moment in Antalya, Turkey, which my colleagues Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Aubert and Michael Earle are attending, will be able to provide us with some answers.
To my mind, however, the immediate conclusion is both simple and alarming: all the indications are that the situation with regard to the stock is very much worse than the most optimistic forecasts.
Some even say that we have already gone past the point of no return.
In other words, given the circumstances, I find it difficult to believe that the current plan should be called a recovery plan rather than something else.
Mr President, can I, first of all, also add my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report.
To achieve recovery in any recovery plan is always difficult.
This is no different from many of the others establishing a multiannual recovery plan, but this time it is for bluefin tuna.
I, like everyone else, sincerely hope that the programme will be successful.
I have only had one experience and that was with the cod recovery plan in the Irish Sea.
During those years the fishermen in that area did not receive any compensation for not being allowed to fish during that period.
I believe two wrongs never make a right: if you have conservation then I believe you must also be prepared to pay compensation - I do not believe there is any alternative.
It is fine to ask for sacrifice but sacrifice also comes at a price.
I recognise that this report is extremely sensitive for fishermen who come from the Mediterranean and those who fish in the Atlantic.
So, from an economic and social perspective, it is going to be extremely difficult for them.
In such circumstances, this will also be a very painful regulation for the fishermen on the ground in this region.
However, the preservation and the protection of species of bluefin tuna are paramount.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I also want to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, on the excellent work he has presented, and I would like to begin by saying that the most striking example of the inability of the current common fisheries policy to ensure the sustainability of this activity is the situation we are now facing with bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean in particular.
This was recently recognised in a very interesting study commissioned by the Directorate-General for Fisheries, which Mr Borg took the trouble to make public, a gesture I would like to thank him for now.
The fact is that the tough measures we are now seeing in this area, with the total closure of fisheries before the end of the year, an attempt to decommission a substantial part of the fleet and the prospect of a total paralysis of activity, even if it perhaps does not achieve its objectives, are a direct consequence of a view of the common fisheries policy in which management decisions are dissociated from their application and control, and in which the fishing communities and authorities' responsibilities have been eroded by an exclusive European competence that has nevertheless not been exercised by the party that advocated it.
Environmentally sustainable but economically less profitable traditional pole-and-line fishing gear had to compete with modern technologies and extremely sophisticated resources that were incomparably more profitable in the short run but environmentally unsustainable, and some discriminatory measures against the latter type of vessel are finally only emerging now.
I would like to endorse and stress my total support for what my colleague Mrs MiguÃ©lez said here, to the effect that it is essential to favour traditional fishing methods.
The imminent threat of the commercial extinction of bluefin tuna fishing should make us all reflect on what needs to be done urgently in connection with the common fisheries policy as a whole.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with most of Mr Braghetto's positions on restoring tuna stocks.
I think we all want seas with satisfactory fish stocks.
However, let me express two concerns.
Firstly, there are plans to establish a system whereby fishing boats would submit a detailed tuna fishing plan, to ensure greater control.
I believe the situation created by this fishing plan would be feasible only for large tuna-fishing vessels that exclusively catch tuna, not for small craft intended for tuna and other fish.
We all want to control tuna fishing but do not wish to exclude nations with small craft.
Besides, there is a strong fishing tradition here.
Secondly, I refer to Amendment 3, which links the capacity of the fattening units to the national quota.
The breeding of red tuna in the EU is carried out in countries other than those with large quotas.
My country, for example, is not one of the favoured countries in terms of quotas.
On the other hand, we have comparative advantages in terms of tuna breeding.
Why should we reduce the capacity of our units to the level of our quota?
To conclude, let me now mention the unacceptable fact that tuna fishing was prohibited in September, because two EU countries were catching quantities that should have sufficed for all Member States together.
These countries must be subject to the appropriate sanctions.
On the other hand, the countries deprived of their fishing rights this year should be the first, next year, to receive the percentage they were deprived of.
Meanwhile, we should find ways of checking fish catches promptly.
(FR) Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, for the excellent job he has done.
As the ICCAT negotiations are still ongoing, we do not yet know what fate has in store for our fishermen next year.
What we do know is that something very serious happened this summer and that we shall have to undertake a thorough review of the arrangements for monitoring catches.
The Commission, I am glad to say, has that task in hand, although I fear that some of the measures proposed last month for eliminating illegal fishing will not go down too well with the Council.
I hope that, whatever happens, the Community Fisheries Control Agency will succeed in introducing proper coordination of European efforts to carry out the necessary checks, because the national monitoring systems are not working.
It is all very well for our Spanish, Portuguese and Greek friends to sound off about the behaviour of the French and Italian fleets and the failure of monitoring in those two countries.
Everyone knows the true picture!
We are all aware that every country has concealed the illegal activities of its own fishing fleet for too long.
That is why - like it or not - we need tougher control at European level, and that is why I am convinced we need a European coastguard.
We also need to discuss sanctions for this overfishing.
It is very likely that ICCAT will decide to penalise the Community, and then we in turn would have to penalise those Member States that are at fault.
The French Government has made loud noises about refusing to compromise and has warned that heads could roll.
Personally I hope these sanctions - which would not have been necessary if the monitoring systems had been effective - will be tough but fair and balanced.
I also hope that those engaged in traditional tuna fishing - which has less impact on stocks - will not be punished for the faults of others.
Lastly, since the experts have clearly established that European fleet capacities have been disproportionate to the bluefin tuna stocks, I want to take this opportunity of asking the Commissioner what resources are to be allocated to retraining those fishermen who will have to go out of business.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Members of Parliament for the interesting points they have made.
What has emerged from this debate is recognition of the fact that we share a common objective, which is that of effectively addressing the precarious situation of bluefin tuna.
The best way of addressing the poor stock status is to implement the ICCAT recovery plan.
I thus thank Parliament for its proposal regarding national fishing plans, which is an effective tool for addressing compliance on overcapacity.
On the issue of derogations, the Commission cannot modify the contents of the plan adopted by ICCAT.
All the contracting parties have agreed to those derogations.
Let me remind you that the derogations were granted for artisanal fleets and for some seasonal fleets because their impact on catches is insignificant.
Furthermore, those derogations include a series of strict conditions, such as a limited number of vessels, limited catches and designated ports.
Having said that, the recovery plan may be revised in 2010 on the basis of new scientific advice or weaknesses detected in its implementation.
As regards the point made by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, who wanted a further extension to the two specific instances in the Atlantic and in the Adriatic, these are specific, small and inconsequential cases.
To extend them to cover other areas necessitates a change to the ICCAT recovery plan agreement.
That certainly cannot take place this year.
We do not want to reopen the ICCAT plan.
A revision is scheduled for 2008 but, given the criticism of the two derogations, I believe it will be extremely difficult to extend them even further.
Overcapacity will be addressed through the national plans to be submitted by the Member States, which will have to balance capacity with catch.
In addition, in our discussions in the Council, we have managed to introduce enhanced control measures to allow for better compliance.
Furthermore, in 2008 we will be concentrating our efforts on the reinforcement of controls in general.
We are also insisting that, under the European Fisheries Fund, funds are committed for the decommissioning of vessels in those Member States where there is overcapacity, in particular with regard to bluefin tuna fisheries.
On the question of ensuring that other fishing vessels comply with ICCAT regulations, which is to say fishing vessels belonging to third countries, the ICCAT provisions apply to all ICCAT partners, and we expect all of them to adhere to the terms and conditions of the bluefin tuna recovery plan.
If they do not, we will take this up with them within ICCAT and bilaterally.
If they refuse to honour their commitments, then we will consider other measures that can be taken.
Regarding the question of overfishing by two countries, I have already said that we support the national fishing plans, and this features in the Presidency compromise, which I hope will be endorsed by all Member States at the November Council.
The amounts overfished have to be repaid, and this was agreed to in Antalya.
The result will be a yearly deduction of 1 480 tonnes for the period 2009-2011.
Compensation with regard to states underfishing will take place with effect from 2008.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Thursday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) The Braghetto report contains much for us to think about as regards the implementation of the bluefin tuna recovery plan.
That plan imposes major restrictions on fishing, in view of the need to protect stocks of an endangered species.
There is nevertheless a risk that the initiative will not be effective if the European Union fails to adopt measures to counteract its socio-economic impact.
All credit is due to the report for highlighting this gap and proposing appropriate instruments for effective implementation of the recommendations from the Commission and ICCAT.
As regards socio-economic aspects, tuna fishing is a traditional activity and is the sole source of income for thousands of families: if it were to be shut down completely, fishermen would have to receive financial compensation from the EFF.
Member States must also apply penalties for illegal fishing, which is the real cause of stock impoverishment.
There is little point in clobbering honest fishermen if there are no instruments to stop predators at sea.
Lastly, reciprocity must be demanded from non-EU countries: there is no point in sacrificing our fishermen to protect the species if the other countries, and I am thinking here of Libya and Turkey, as well as China and Japan, do not apply equally severe restrictions in their seas.
While they would have a competitive edge over European fishermen, the problem of tuna impoverishment would not be resolved.
Quarterly statistics on Community job vacancies (debate)
The next item is the report by Alexandru Athanasiu, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on quarterly statistics on Community job vacancies - C6-0090/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the objective of this regulation is to establish a legal framework for the collection of quarterly statistics on job vacancies.
Quarterly data on job vacancies, broken down by economic activity, are needed by the Commission and by the European Central Bank for economic and monetary policies.
They allow monitoring of short-term trends in the labour market and help to assess the business cycle.
Owing to its importance, this statistic was included in the set of principal European economic indicators defined in the 2002 communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Eurozone statistics.
Quarterly data on job vacancies is the only one of those indicators for which a legal basis has not yet been developed.
The proposed legal act will provide for a mechanism to guarantee a harmonised set of timely job vacancy data across all Member States.
I understand that there was a discussion on several issues addressed by the legal act proposed by the Commission, and some changes were introduced.
The amendments proposed in the Parliament report include the changes introduced by the Council, and the text proposed to you today for adoption reflects the compromise achieved between the three institutions involved - the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
There is also agreement across the three institutions that the legislation should come into force as soon as possible.
This opens the way for adoption of the regulation at first reading.
I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Athanasiu, for his good cooperation and his understanding on this matter.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues, who entrusted me with this report, and the shadow rapporteur for their respective contributions.
Obviously, in the society we live in, data collection has become an essential tool of analysis.
Data about job vacancies are used not only to gauge the health of the economy but also to determine and shape certain policies.
Nowadays, statistics about job vacancies have a direct impact on financial markets.
Ratings agencies await these figures and use them to inform the advice that they give.
Statistics, Mr President, are, if I may say so, a demanding subject.
It is worth quoting G.O. Ashley's famous comment: 'Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has a private jargon, deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from non-practitioners.'
In working together on this text in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, my colleagues and I sought to highlight three aspects.
Firstly, there is the political aspect of the regulation: reasserting once again, even in the context of a statistical tool like this, the concept of free movement for European citizens and unconditional, unlimited and unhindered access to employment.
Then there is the social aspect: making it easier for all the people of Europe to find suitable employment and to access information about job vacancies throughout the European Union.
Lastly - and we have the Commission and the Council to thank here - there is the technical aspect of data quality.
We are talking about a system that has harmonised procedures and has effectively updated arrangements for statistical information gathering, in other words an improved approach to obtaining precise data.
As you know, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we previously had no more than a gentleman's agreement - that is to say a voluntary basis for statistical information gathering.
Accurate analysis depends, however, on the collection of these data being compulsory and consistent.
That is why a regulation is a better legal basis than a directive because the provisions of a regulation, unlike those of a directive, are identical throughout the Union: the Member States have no power to apply them incompletely or selectively and no choice as to the methods of pursuing the stipulated aims.
One of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy is to bring more people onto the labour market, and at the same time more jobs need to be created, hence the need for the best possible system of information on labour supply and demand.
Quality of information can be the key to success, and we all know today that information is power.
That applies in economics as elsewhere, and that is why it was deemed necessary to develop and publish a structural indicator for job vacancies, capable of measuring just how narrow the job market is and where the skills shortages lie.
The Commission and the European Central Bank also need quarterly data on job vacancies in order to monitor fluctuation in the number of vacancies in particular sectors of the economy.
Job vacancy figures are part of a series of major European economic indicators and they are needed for evaluation of prevailing conditions on the EU labour market and within the euro area under the EMU Action Plan.
Mr President, I will conclude by quoting AbbÃ© Pierre, who said that many politicians are familiar with poverty only through statistics, and no one has yet shed tears over statistics.
We ought to need no convincing of the necessity for a technically more effective mechanism for gathering all the statistics that are required.
As politicians we can do our job by making it easier for people to find suitable employment.
These statistics will enable us to facilitate their efforts.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Athanasiu, whom I have had the opportunity to meet several times over the last few months, and who is now presenting the results of what I consider to be a fine job.
I have monitored the content of the report under discussion today and negotiations with the Commission and with the Council since June this year, and on behalf of the PPE-DE I can now safely say that a high-quality and very sound compromise text has been reached.
Should Parliament adopt the amendments to the Commission proposal in this plenary session, as I hope it will, we know that the Council has already said that it will also adopt the same amended proposal for a regulation.
I believe this report will turn out to be a useful tool for identifying EU sectors and regions where workers are needed, and therefore for promoting solvency and better management of training.
I would also like to draw attention to what I believe is an important aspect: the content of this report does not represent a greater bureaucratic burden or more inconsequential legislation, since in its current version it avoids the duplication of initiatives and the inclusion of tools already in place.
Meanwhile, the report also represents a good compromise between the need to provide information for statistical purposes and the need to ensure that enterprises, mainly small and medium-sized ones, are not overburdened with unnecessary bureaucratic procedures.
I therefore believe that all the conditions have been met for it to be adopted now at first reading, and that is the decision I recommend to this House.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, having all of four minutes tonight, which is 400 % more than I normally have to play with, I have to avoid becoming too talkative.
So I will get on with it.
Despite the exceptionally technical nature of this proposed regulation, its value to Europe and the Member States should not be underestimated.
The relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda for more and better jobs in 2005 gives rise to the need for accurate, timely and comparable statistics on job vacancies in Europe, by region and by economic activity.
It is crucial if we are to plan for the needs of the labour market and the needs of those entering the labour market.
I welcome the fact that, in this instance, we are negotiating a regulation rather than a directive, as this ensures speedier implementation once it is approved.
And, of course, it is directly and equally applicable to all Member States and there is therefore no likelihood of different definitions or interpretations arising from one Member State to the next.
There is no need, for instance, to transpose it into national law, thus avoiding the delays that this can entail.
This is an excellent example of how the EU can add value to the work of Member States that could not possibly be achieved by them working on their own or even together.
Nevertheless, it has taken two years for this piece of legislation to reach this stage and I hope therefore that an agreement can be finalised with the Council and that it will be approved at this first-reading stage.
I know that in Ireland we do not produce job vacancy data, but work by the Central Statistics Office is under way.
The CSO is highly regarded and it is hoped that, within a year or so, Ireland will be able to participate fully in the system.
I welcome too the proposal to include personal services, farm vacancies etc., employers with fewer than 10 employees, and the nature of the employment contract.
I think this is particularly important in view of the growing concern about the casualisation of employment and the fears in some quarters arising from the move towards flexicurity.
I do hope that an agreement can be reached and that we can get on with the job of establishing common statistics right across the European Union.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work on this proposal for a regulation on the collection of quarterly statistics on Community job vacancies.
First of all, let me say that high quality, up-to-date and relevant statistics underpin good policy decisions.
This is particularly true at EU level, where we are dealing with 27 different countries all trying in this particular context to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
Indeed, any help or assistance that can be given to Member States to achieve these objectives - that is to create more and better jobs - in my opinion will be well worth the effort.
I fully support the idea that, while the information required can be compiled by the Member States themselves under this regulation in order to ensure comparability of data, we still need the Commission to coordinate the harmonisation of the statistical information.
And I am satisfied in this context that we do need a regulation - rather than a directive - but that the regulation proposed is the minimum required to achieve the desired objectives and does not go beyond that.
I suppose in this context I do not really need to go beyond that except to say that I am particularly pleased to see that we are asking Member States to transmit information on personal care services, residential activities and social work activities without accommodation.
This information is hugely important because of the growing number of carers in the EU.
The ageing of our population is a major demographic challenge and caring is an essential element of dealing with that challenge.
Those of us who are lucky enough to live long enough will be more likely to need care of some sort and this is definitely a growing market for job opportunities within the EU.
While most caring work is unpaid and indeed much will remain so, the opportunities for employment in this area will increase.
Therefore we need reliable, good quality statistics in order to prepare ourselves to meet the caring aspect of the demographic challenge.
To conclude, as I said earlier, in the overall or global context: high quality, relevant, timely, comparable and coherent information is an extremely valuable tool in good policy formation, provided of course that we as politicians use the information that is provided to us.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, implementation of the Lisbon Agenda as regards the increase in the number of high-quality jobs requires certain tools.
One of these is provided by quarterly statistics on job vacancies in the Community.
Eurostat has to have a legal basis for collecting data on job vacancies.
An unwritten agreement is not enough and does not guarantee comparability and completeness of data.
Now for some specifics.
The first amendment means, in practice, an increase in the bureaucratic burden placed on small businesses, but there is an ever-increasing percentage of employees in just such businesses and therefore information about the situation in these businesses is increasingly useful.
I support the second amendment, which includes social partners in the implementation of the regulation.
Amendment 3 tidies up the method for submitting data even when they are provided voluntarily, which makes it vital.
I also support Amendment 17, which guarantees publication of the data, thus creating the possibility of using them to come to practical conclusions.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to add my voice to those who wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his report.
Like him, I also support the opinion that the compilation of good quality and comparable job vacancy statistics is a European priority.
I am equally certain that collecting this statistical data under the auspices of a gentlemen's agreement alone is insufficient, and that it is necessary to adopt a legal act at European level to guarantee the production of harmonised and high-quality statistics across the Member States.
Only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level.
I did advocate the same point of view recently, when expressing my opinion on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work.
I was also very pleased by the results of the trialogue between the rapporteur, the Commission and the presidency.
The ensuing compromise proposals significantly enhanced the quality of the document.
Just like the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups, I, too, was happy to add my signature on behalf of the GUE/NGL.
Among these compromise proposals I would like to highlight in particular the significant contribution of the proposal to include in the statistics data concerning units with fewer than 10 employees, the proposal to distinguish between vacancies for fixed-term and permanent posts, and the proposal to ensure that as many European citizens as possible have access to the data.
Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the definition of the quality assessment criteria because only relevant, exact, updated and comprehensible job vacancy data can help to fight unemployment in the Community.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, information on changes in job vacancies to identify labour shortages sounds fine.
But surely not just to compile statistics?
It must be to enable employers to fill vacancies and for workers to find jobs, both as quickly as possible, hence quarterly.
Currently, national statistics are compiled by Member States themselves and the Commission seems to favour making use of that to set up a common framework under a single European Union regulation, option C. So the EC craze to harmonise converts a simple system into a bureaucratic and time-consuming one.
The real purpose is centralised control.
Will we soon see a requirement for employers and jobseekers to consult an EU bureau?
Down the road, does it lead to job direction?
It certainly leads to a planned European economy, spelling the end of the dream of an increasingly prosperous Europe of full employment and bustling innovation.
In a globalised marketplace, the only way to stay competitive is to stay loose, ready to fill the gap, ready to exploit an opening, ready for anything.
Columns of stats on reams of paper or locked on a hard drive do not do that - it is the man or women on the ground suddenly finding the chance and striking quick, before the other fellow.
If he wants second place, get employers to browse the stats.
While they are doing that, streetwise operators elsewhere are jumping in first thing and cornering the market.
Worse, Amendment No 8 - if adopted - allows the collating agency to reject as inappropriate national figures and substitute figures of their own.
Thus they can create a false image to suit the EC centralised controllers, misleading the people.
So much for informing the citizen!
Finally, Amendment No 3 encourages the exclusion of agriculture, fishing and forestry from these considerations.
Now, why should that be?
I do not know much about forestry, but the UK figures for farming and fishing are horrendous.
Since 1973, when we joined under the CAP, more British farmers have left the land and more have committed suicide than in any other comparable period in our history.
Our fishing fleets, down to about a quarter of 1973 size, are testimony to the devastation caused by the rotten CFP.
No wonder some people want to keep these figures out of pan-EU stats; no need to alarm the citizens is there?
(PL) Mr President, every attempt to streamline the EU is worthy of respect, especially when it concerns the issue of employment.
Employment is, I believe, the most crucial link in the social and economic transformation of an integrated Europe.
The rapporteur has found a climate of anticipation accompanying this legislative initiative and has imbued his report with a highly accessible and truly interesting format.
The Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council replaces existing practices, based on a gentlemen's agreement, for the collection of data on job vacancies with a decision to establish a legal framework for this activity.
This provides the opportunity to improve the next section of the process of information integration, which, by the way, forms part of the basic European economic indicators.
With this there arose the need for a legal basis that would help in the creation of the necessary methodological pillars for summarising the growing collections of data.
This regulation also promises to create another type of benefit.
It enables higher standards to be achieved in the quality and comparability of statistics.
It will also make it easier to develop effective employment policies based on reliable data, at both national and international level.
At the same time it will become possible to monitor the implementation of such policies in individual countries.
The governments of the so-called new EU countries have pointed out that, thanks to quarterly statistics, they will have at their disposal a common system of indicators which is essential for monitoring the employment market.
They have also noted, with some relief, that the introduction of this regulation will not mean that any additional finances are needed for quarterly data collection.
In the justification for its standpoint as regards this proposal, the Polish Government pointed out that the unification of data at European level, together with monitoring of its quality, should lead to increased knowledge concerning the changing levels of demand for specific qualifications and to more effective monitoring of the situation in the Polish labour market.
It will also make it easier for more accurate employment and pay forecasts to be made.
Comparability of data at European level will make it possible to evaluate the extent of mismatches in national labour markets against the background of the remaining EU countries.
It also has specific practical outcomes as regards the correlation of employment policy with supply and for planning the direction of vocational training for future employees.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to express my support for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on quarterly statistics on Community job vacancies.
There can be no disagreement over how important it is for these data to be collected systematically and uniformly while fulfilling set standards in all Member States.
The value of information collected in this way is undeniable in terms of assessing the situation in the labour market in the European Union, as well as for the functioning of the European Central Bank.
The present situation, where these data are collected on the basis of an unwritten agreement, clearly shows that this method is ineffective and has to be changed.
Only with the approval of this regulation, which establishes the same rules for the preparation of high-quality statistics throughout the Community, will it be possible to have an accurate insight into, as well as an analysis of, the factors that combine to create the overall situation and conditions in the labour market.
This regulation does not just oblige Member States to create statistics in accordance with well-defined norms but also helps them in this task, by supplying ready-made tools for this purpose.
The unification of this research at European level will help to extend our knowledge of fluctuations in demand for specific jobs in national markets and will enable more accurate employment and pay forecasts to be made.
For these reasons it is vital for a legal document to come into force that, in a clear and transparent manner, will define all the rules regarding the collection of data about job vacancies across the entire Community.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Thursday.
Cross-border collective copyright management (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the follow-up of the EP resolution on cross-border collective copyright management (LÃ©vai report, by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0381/2007).
author. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 March 2007, in plenary session, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Commission's Recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services.
In that resolution, Parliament invited the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 Recommendation applied exclusively to online sales of music recordings, and to present as soon as possible - after consulting closely with interested parties - a proposal for a flexible framework directive to be adopted by Parliament and the Council in codecision, with a view to regulating the collective management of copyright and related rights as regards cross-border online music services, while taking account of the specificity of the digital era and safeguarding European cultural diversity.
Parliament also stressed that the proposed directive should not in any way undermine the competitiveness of creative businesses, the effectiveness of the services provided by collective rights managers (CRMs) or the competitiveness of user businesses - in particular small right-holders and users - and that it should, on the other hand, guarantee right-holders a high degree of protection and equal treatment; ensure that the relevant legal provisions had a real, significant and adequate impact; emphasise the use of alternative dispute resolution; provide for democratic, transparent and accountable governance in CRMs; promote creativity and cultural diversity; allow only fair and controlled competition without territorial restrictions, but with the necessary and suitable qualitative criteria; take into account the interests of users and of the market; satisfy the future needs of an online market; and foster the development of legitimate online music services.
Today the European Parliament is asking the Commission what steps it has taken towards meeting the expectations enshrined in that resolution.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the interest expressed in the cross-border management of music rights and the 2005 recommendation on online music.
The Commission's 2005 online music recommendation aims to allow the music market in Europe to develop in the digital environment.
It aims to create a framework in which the best new online licensing model will emerge by agreement between the market players.
This should allow authors, composers and music publishers to get a fair share of the distribution of their online works.
The recommendation does not prescribe a particular EU licensing model, and leaves implementation of its principles to the market.
Exactly two years after adoption of the recommendation, the Commission is assessing the development of online licensing practices in the music sector in Europe.
Stakeholders were invited to comment on emerging online licensing trends by 1 July 2007.
The Commission received 88 replies from interested parties, such as collecting societies, authors, creators and music users in Member States.
The process of reviewing the submissions is still ongoing.
Only after a thorough examination will the Commission assess further policy steps regarding the online operations of collecting societies.
The submissions analysed so far show that most stakeholders do not see the need for a framework directive, and prefer market-based solutions to regulatory intervention.
On the question of whether the 2005 recommendation is limited to online sales of some recordings, the Commission would like to point out that the principles on transparency and governance set out in the recommendation should not be limited to online music sales and should apply to all the activities of collecting societies.
To conclude, while the online market for music is still in flux, legislating in favour of a particular licensing model would appear premature.
The Commission will monitor developments and report back to Parliament and the Council as foreseen in the recommendation.
