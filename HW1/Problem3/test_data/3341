We say âyesâ to strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including raising the profile of security policy.
We say âyesâ to more competition and to greater transparency in EU legislation.
We also say âyesâ to a calm debate as part of the constitutional process, as the Prime Minister no doubt has in mind for his countryâs Presidency.
As he can see, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament have great confidence in the success of the Finnish Presidency.
All of this is taking place against the background of the Prime Ministerâs recent statements in the Finnish Parliament, however.
He said there that the Union no longer shares a common core, and that instead coalitions are formed depending on the individual case.
The common European interest is taking second place to intergovernmental cooperation on a case-by-case basis.
We should like him to do something for the common European interest, for the European core, and thus also to set an example for the subsequent German Presidency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have won the FIFA World Cup, but in political terms, too, the European Union is on the attack once more, it is achieving joint success, and it has increased its common objectives once again.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to be a strong captain of his Council team and to increase teamwork with his fellow players â cooperation with Parliament, for example, was one of the reasons for the success of the Austrian Presidency.
I would ask him to continue this course of strengthening cooperation and involving Members.
Cooperation with Parliament is not the same as cooperation with national parliaments We are here to be the Councilâs partners and co-legislators â not to monitor it.
We are on a par with the Council; it is the Council, rather than the national parliaments, that is our opposite number.
Secondly, on the subject of transparency, I would ask the President-in-Office to ensure that this catchword becomes legislative reality, as transparency is a precondition for putting an end to the double game involving domestic and European policy.
I ask that he ensure that all citizens of the Member States learn of the transparency of the Councilâs role as legislator; and that he advertise transparency and give EuroNews a slot in the schedules of all public broadcasters.
Thirdly, on the subject of enlargement, the only way of inspiring confidence is through observance of the rules and consistency in our negotiations.
If the Ankara Protocol is not implemented, the accession negotiations with Turkey must be discontinued.
I recommend the President-in-Office to follow the example of the enlargement of the euro area, and that of the discussions on enlargement of the last six months.
For this reason, I would also ask the President of the Commission to clarify his comment on the preconditions for enlargement, which may be technically correct but, politically, has caused confusion.
When we say that Nice is not enough, we must make it clear that, before we embark on the next major enlargement â namely the accession of Croatia â we need a new constitutional treaty.
Finally, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that results are achieved with regard to the Services Directive, the Working Time Directive and the Television without Frontiers Directive, and also regarding cross-border payments.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I will deal with three points from your speech and add a challenge.
Firstly, I would like to welcome the fact that the Finnish Government, on taking over the Presidency, has stood by its word and ratified the Constitution, which has now been supported by the majority of the States and people of Europe.
That is a fact that must be emphasised, because we all agree that it is necessary, not just in order to enlarge, but also in order to function.
Secondly, with regard to the issue of security and the fight against terrorism, I would like to thank you for the support that you and other members of the European Council gave us at the beginning of the process of overcoming violence and achieving peace in my country, Spain.
Thirdly, I would also like to stress that the process of creating a Community immigration policy â and you mentioned the case of the Canary Islands â began in Tampere and we must make a serious effort to speed it up.
Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, last week in Geneva I had the opportunity to meet Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, Minister for External Trade and Development, at the negotiations of the Doha Development Round.
That is a very important challenge and it must be given concrete form during the Finnish Presidency.
I believe that it must be given a prominent place on the agenda, in order to safeguard our future and take on our responsibilities.
Â Â  Mr President, I am reassured by the Prime Ministerâs determination to focus on the Balkans and advance their progress towards the EU.
Prime Minister, I know this is a European not a Finnish project, but you are particularly well placed with your former President, Mr Ahtisaari, involved in the status talks on Kosovo and your former assistant, Olli Rehn, as the Commissioner for Enlargement.
The EU has a heavy responsibility to get the balance right between encouragement, as in the case of visa facilitation which will be debated tonight, and pressure, for example on delivering war crime suspects to The Hague â particularly as regards the challenge in Kosovo.
I am reassured by your energy in that direction.
Secondly, the EU is dysfunctional in the area of justice, home affairs and human rights.
On the one hand, there are the delays and dilution of measures resulting from the national veto.
Almost five years after agreeing on an EU anti-terrorism law, some Member States have still not implemented it.
On the other hand, we talk a lot of rhetoric about human rights, we preach to third countries, but there are credible indications of complicity by many EU countries in illegal rendition and torture.
We do not convict terrorists, but we are at best passive with regard to human rights breaches in the war on terror.
This is a toxic mix and I ask you to look at the contrasts and contradictions in this area.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find your programme clear, practical and credible, which has not been the case with all presidencies.
Some of your priorities strike us as essential, including the issue of Russia and energy.
We have to be clear on the Russia issue.
There is no point in negotiating only with Russia on the issue of energy.
Russia is an extremely important partner that we must bring into international affairs, because that way we can also influence human rights and democracy in that huge country.
A further priority that you put forward, with which we agree, is that of the Europe of results.
This is an area that the President of the Commission has been pushing and that has been fought for, in spite of the difficulties with the Constitution.
The Europe of results is closely associated with growth and employment.
It must be said that the intergovernmental method that has been pursued for the Lisbon Strategy has led to disappointingly mediocre results.
The Commission must be given the responsibilities and the resources that it needs to draw up a roadmap, whereby we can grow and can create more jobs, just as we have done for the internal market and the single currency.
What is currently in place is not working and will be a further disappointment for our citizens.
Lastly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I feel the period of reflection on Europe in 2020 that you have suggested is most welcome.
We have to start today to think about the Europe that we want in the future, and it is in this pragmatic, open and, hopefully, transparent vein that I have faith in this Finnish Presidency.
I hope that at the end of the Presidency I can come here with words of congratulation for you.
Â Â  â I shall not be going on the attack.
I shall leave that to the Portuguese national team tonight, which I hope will beat France.
You said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we are living in a time of challenges, such as globalisation, climate and demographic challenges, and that we must look to the future with courage.
We agree.
The Lisbon Strategy will help us to meet these challenges and to realise the knowledge triangle of which Mr Barroso spoke.
The Lisbon Strategy is the best instrument at our disposal for modernising the European economy, for boosting employment, for creating more jobs and for delivering social cohesion. In other words, more and better Europe.
Finland is a successful example of economic competitiveness based on knowledge and innovation.
It is a shining example of modernisation and progress.
The Finnish Presidency is therefore in an excellent position, and has a major responsibility, to provide impetus to the Lisbon Agenda.
I should like to ask whether the Finnish Presidency is prepared to do this.
My second question concerns the policy on equality between men and women.
Finland has special responsibilities on this issue, too.
What practical measures will Finland propose to the Council to promote equality between men and women at all levels?
Â Â  Mr President, as the European Union's newest members we have learnt a great deal from Finland, and from you personally.
You have had recent experience of the accession process, which is why we are extremely confident that your Presidency will be sensitive to those concerns and problems associated with integration.
In fact, the date of entry two years ago only marks the beginning.
We have to continue to fight for the same treatment, equal rights within the European Union and for the same standards, after all, the great historical undertaking of reunifying Europe and trying to catch up is a long process.
This is clearly highlighted by the debate on the service directive or Lithuania's membership of the euro area, which provides a clear indication of the current uncertainties and, unfortunately, the distrust shown towards new members, as well as the application of double standards.
This is why it is very important that when we are talking about the European Union's further expansion, we must not forget that it is also our job to deal with the impact of the last, and biggest expansion so far, in 2004, as well as to focus on the European Union's capacity.
The European Union's recent expansion, combined with current events, highlight how important it is to strengthen a common Europe's basic democratic values.
In fact, a short time ago, Martin Schulz had some harsh words to say during the campaign against extremism; but not only can we speak out about it, we can do something about it too.
You have among your ranks the Socialist Party that recently won the elections in Slovakia, which has chosen a partner whose main political message amounts to making attacks on minorities, such as Hungarians, Gypsies and gays.
This should sound alarm bells throughout the whole of Europe.
It also draws attention to how poor the European Union is at defending minorities across the whole of Europe.
This is why progress must be made in the planned European Human Rights Agency's activities during the Finnish Presidency.
Finland, which pursues an exemplary minorities policy, must show us the way on this matter.
During the Finnish Presidency, 23rd October marks the 50th anniversary of the revolution, which involved a kindred people, the Hungarians.
Nowadays we often talk about the European Union being in crisis.
Let us help to renew the EU by drawing encouragement and strength from one of the 20th century's most significant struggles for freedom in resolving the problems we face today.
I wish the Presidency every success!
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Vanhanen, MrÂ Barroso, I share the Finnish Presidencyâs view of globalisation as a challenge.
I also think it good that the Presidency has struck a balance between, on the one hand, flexibility and, on the other, social protection or security in the midst of change.
I look forward to a solution being found to the Services Directive during the Finnish Presidency. This will be based on Parliamentâs proposals, which have specifically achieved this balance between, on the one hand, openness and flexibility and, on the other, security in the labour market and protection for public services.
There is an issue that I think the Finnish Presidency should get to grips with.
Parliamentâs proposal and the proposal by the Commission and the Council make no mention of agencies that supply temporary workers.
At the same time, such agencies are growing in importance all around Europe.
There is a proposal from the Commission concerning agencies that supply temporary workers.
We have responded to it, but it has been blocked by the Council.
It is now time for the proposal to be unblocked so that we might obtain an agreement and a framework concerning these agencies.
This is an area in which the Finnish Presidency can act.
I welcome the fact that you are taking the initiative concerning the Working Time Directive.
This is also about achieving a balance between health and safety â no unduly long working hours â and, at the same time, flexibility.
We in Parliament are convinced that, in order to achieve flexibility, no opt-out is needed.
There are other instruments for promoting flexibility.
I look forward to solutions in these areas and also share MrÂ Rasmussenâs view that solutions must be sought in cooperation with both sides of industry.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Vanhanen, ladies and gentlemen, .
We speak Latin in Europe.
As a citizen of Rome and as a citizen of Europe, I am grateful to Finland for having taken the decision to inaugurate this half year's presidency of the Union in Latin, as well.
However, mine is more than just a formal expression of gratitude. The decision has a profound meaning: Roman civilisation, the heir to Greek civilisation, represented Europeâs first, crucial unifying element.
The Latin language, the major infrastructure, the law, the huge internal market and, lastly, the were the foundations into which Christianity, as the true bridge between Western and Eastern Europe, dug its roots.
An important European archaeologist and writer, Valerio Massimo Manfredi, wrote: âRome was above all a great ideal.â
Paraphrasing those words, we could say: âEurope is above all a great ideal.â
We cannot give up on making this great ideal a reality, giving Europe basic legislation that will enable it to provide 450 million citizens with answers to the problems that concern them most: immigration, security, competitiveness with emerging countries, the energy issue, the definition of borders and job creation.
The President will have our support.
Finland has the important task of continuing the work done by Austria and paving the way for the next half year under the German Presidency, which will be key to finally establishing the Constitutional Treaty that Europe needs in order to be closer to its citizens.
In Rome, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties.
Let us see to it that, like those who, in ancient times, took pride and felt secure in the guarantees they obtained from the institutions when becoming Roman citizens, any future European citizen, from whichever part of the world he or she comes, will also feel secure and take pride in living in an area in which human rights, peace, security and freedom are guaranteed and protected.
Only then will we have met our challenge, and will the great ideal have become a reality.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is with great pleasure that I accept the aims that the Finnish Presidency has set itself for the coming six months.
Translating words into action on the matter of the Constitution and further engagement in the matter of EU enlargement are key issues at a time when the EU is in the throes of an identity and leadership crisis.
For that reason it is particularly important to strengthen collaboration on a common Eastern policy and a common energy policy.
The issue of diversifying energy sources and supply lines is extremely important for the security of Europeâs energy supplies.
The European Union must establish a joint and uniform standpoint on the issue of oil and gas supplies.
It should not be assumed that building a single line from a single supplier means real diversification.
Investment in renewable sources of energy and saving energy are necessary, but they will not be sufficient to cover growing demand.
Europe must become politically and financially involved in projects looking for new sources of energy and conduct a joint policy, based on solidarity, towards suppliers.
I also attach a great deal of importance to Finlandâs role in drawing up a common Eastern policy.
Here connections with Russia should be instrumental in finding a golden mean for the EUâs Russia policy.
I also look forward to the improvement and development of cooperation with Ukraine, as political support for Kiev will help to consolidate Ukraineâs pro-European policy.
It will also be important to raise the issue of Belarus at international forums and in discussions with Russia.
Mr President, among many other things Finland is famous for its Finnish sauna.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency will bring us, in the end, the same feeling of freshness and relaxation as one gets after spending an hour or two in a Finnish sauna.
Â Â  Mr President, the Finnish Presidency will not just be a transitional presidency, but a key presidency from the viewpoint of the EUâs most important strategy, the growth and jobs strategy.
This will decide the future of Europe, but you have to start somewhere.
In the revised Lisbon strategy, we decided that we need to start from research, innovation and technological progress.
We will be unable to do this, Prime Minister Vanhanen, without launching the 7th Framework Programme on time.
A common position of the European Council is needed as early as July to allow Parliament to start work on the second reading in September.
I appeal to Prime Minister Vanhanen to ensure that this is done.
There has to be constant collaboration between the Council, the Commission and Parliament if we are to finish the job in November at the latest.
However, what is important as well as the 7th Framework Programme is funding for research and innovation from national budgets.
I wholly support Prime Minister Vanhanenâs statement on this.
Our greatest weakness as Europeans is lack of innovation.
I believe that the European Institute of Technology will be able to help us here.
We already have an excellent European education system, and we do not need to reproduce it.
We have reasonable research, but we lack innovation and the latest technologies which are decisive to growth and employment and which are important for our strategy.
A decision on the EIT is an important task for the Finnish Presidency.
The triangle of knowledge â education, research and innovation â is Finlandâs strongest card.
The decisions on these matters have therefore come at the right time.
We wish Prime Minister Vanhanen success.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am much obliged to MrÂ Vanhanen, who made it clear in his speech that he wishes to win over the public, to further the development of Europe and to move over to specific action.
I congratulate him on this motto â it is a motto for the future, and has my full support.
We want specific projects, and the Services Directive is one such project.
MrÂ Vanhanen has expressed the desire to conclude the Services Directive at second reading in autumn.
I am confident that we can succeed in this, as the decision of the Council of Ministers to incorporate and further develop Parliamentâs fundamental demands provides the basis for doing so.
I am confident that it will prove possible to reach a compromise on the Services Directive under the Finnish Presidency.
I should very much like to see this.
This is an expression of the common will to make a commitment to the community of values for the public.
After all, that is what we want to achieve â and MrÂ Vanhanen expressed this very clearly in his speech: we want to develop the community of values, determine Europeâs future and ensure not only that we have a free internal market, including for services, but also that there is respect for citizensâ rights, labour law, social legislation, consumer protection and patient protection.
That is what we want to achieve, and it is also the way to really ensure that citizens say âyesâ to Europe in future.
That is the best thing we could achieve.
The matter of prime importance is the Constitution for Europe, and that is the best present that MrÂ Vanhanen could give himself on the 100th anniversary of the right to vote in Finland.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Finland is the first Council Presidency since the enlargement of the European Union on 1Â MayÂ 2004 to hail from the shores of the Baltic Sea, which the enlargement by eight countries has of course made a .
The Finnish Presidency is therefore in a position to develop strategic dimensions that are also connected with the Northern Dimension, as there is also a non-Member State bordering on the Baltic Sea, namely Russia.
Finlandâs experience makes it particularly well placed to develop relations in this region that could be extremely constructive, and that also include issues such as security of energy supply.
We are pinning our hopes on Finland in this matter.
My second point is that the Finnish Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission, must make at least the first attempts to achieve a new balance between enlargement and the European Unionâs capacity to cope with this.
We must hold out the prospect of EU membership to many countries, but this cannot always mean full membership.
We must find other ways â and, in the Barroso paper, both the European Council and the Commission declared their intention to take essential initiatives in this matter.
We shall wait until December and see how far we get with this discussion.
My third point is that history has shown that the EU is only strong where we have Community Europe, as only there is it capable of action, and only there does it show continuity.
That is why an enlarged EU renders it particularly necessary to take the approach of a constitutional treaty.
I am obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for committing himself to the ratification of this Constitutional Treaty.
This matches the position of the subsequent German Presidency, which means that there should be constructive cooperation on drawing up the declaration to be made by Germany at the end of its Presidency.
I think I can even say that this should be the position of all the Community institutions, in order to enable the Constitutional Treaty â with regard to which we need to be much more imaginative â to enter into force inÂ 2009.
Cherry-picking will be of no help to us here, as it would destroy the approach we have to take of explaining to the public in persuasive terms why we need a constitutional treaty â which gives it more rights and brings greater transparency.
We need not only a Europe that works, but also a Europe of democracy and transparency.
That is why this Constitutional Treaty is so important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Vanhanen, ladies and gentlemen, you, MrÂ Vanhanen, like the President of the Barroso Commission, often referred in your speech to the need to give a boost to the Europe of results in order to regain the citizens' trust, naturally without pitting this Europe against the Europe of values and of the Constitution.
When it comes to dividing up the work that exists in this Parliament, I, as rapporteur for REACH, belong to the category of sherpas, of those who work to deliver results, like my colleague, MrsÂ Gebhardt.
For this reason, I very much welcomed the fact that you have included among the priorities of your Presidency the conclusion of the legislative process on REACH and that you have done so by including it in the âcompetitivenessâ chapter.
The main purpose of REACH is, of course, to protect human health and the environment, but it is also a powerful incentive for innovation.
From this perspective, both the Council and Parliament have done an excellent job over the years of work that we have behind us, because they have reconciled their positions to a great extent and have made this instrument much more usable, and have done so, too, in an effort to boost innovation.
I am sure that, under your Presidency, an agreement at second reading will be possible.
Both legislators will nevertheless have to make progress. A small amount of progress, since there has already been a great deal of convergence, but progress will still always have to be made.
I am saying this to you because there will be those who advise you to stand firm and make no concessions.
I, on the other hand, am willing to make progress and I am sure that you will be too.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Vanhanen, MrÂ Barroso, as a representative of Sweden, which is not only a neighbouring country but also a sister country, I should like to say that the prospect of the Finnish Presidency fills me with pride and high hopes.
We have, to the very highest degree, not only an overlapping history and geography but also a shared experience of the present.
We became members of the European Union at the same time and are still counted as being among the new Member States, with all the freshness of approach that that can bring with it.
We have seen how enlargement of the European Union in recent years has totally changed our world thanks to European cooperation, in the context of which the Baltic Sea is now eminently a sea that links countries together.
We have an internationalised economy, which is manifestly a precondition for prosperity and employment rather than a threat to our prosperity.
We have an economy whose individual strands are becoming ever more closely interwoven.
We are also cooperating on establishing a common battle group, which is the only thing that unites small countries.
Finland is also an example for those of us who expect a lot from your Presidency.
I am thinking of Finnish energy policy, in which you can combine increased competitiveness and reduced dependency on surrounding countries with greater attention to the environment and to the Kyoto objectives.
I am thinking of Finlandâs unique ability to handle relations with Russia, giving this Presidency an opportunity to lay the basis for a sound policy on Russia for the whole of the European Union.
I am thinking of our experiences of enlargement, which oblige Finland resolutely and single-mindedly to take the issue of continued enlargement forward, with not only clear demands being made but also a clear objective pursued, partly with a view to its being possible for Turkey to become a member of the EU.
With characteristic openness and single-mindedness, Finland should also, of course, ensure that it turns the European Union into a form of cooperation that is open, transparent and easily accessible to its citizens.
I wish you good luck.
High demands are being made because a clear example has been set.
Â Â  Mr President, many in this House are of the opinion that the Unionâs credibility in the eyes of the people needs improving.
For that reason, Finland, during its Presidency, wants to see confidence-inspiring action which has importance for peopleâs everyday lives.
The people have a right to expect cross-border cooperation to be implemented in all aspects of life, including, for example, the fight against crime, and not just the internal market.
Criminals move freely from one country to another and network across national borders.
On the other hand, the police authorities in the Member States fail to maintain contact with each other and lack mutual trust.
The criminals have too much of a head start.
That is why Finland needs the support of the other Member States and this Parliament for its work when the decision-making process in justice and home affairs is being improved.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree, Prime Minister, with the Europe of results. For many people war was a very long time ago and they take peace for granted.
The European Union must therefore win the citizensâ confidence by achieving tangible results with regard to todayâs problems.
I would therefore like your Presidency to achieve greater successes, better results.
The European Union must serve to tackle trans-national threats, such as terrorism and organised crime, and to calm the citizens' fears about globalisation.
It must also help to properly manage migratory flows, including effectively fighting illegal immigration.
This is a dramatic and topical issue in my country â you have mentioned the case of the Canary Islands â and in other countries of Southern Europe.
It leads to great suffering and the loss of human lives.
I therefore hope that during this six-month period this problem will be treated as a priority, and not just Russia and energy.
It seems to me very appropriate that Finland should now be taking over the Presidency and that it should make progress on a European immigration policy.
The Tampere European Council represented an historic milestone in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice.
Mr President, the conclusions of the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils stated that the issue of migratory flows should start to occupy a prominent place in the European Unionâs relations with third countries.
This seems to me to be a fundamental element in the approach we should take.
The Union must demand that countries of origin and transit cooperate closely in the fight against the drama of illegal immigration and in the ordered management of these flows.
It must ask them for â and help them to achieve - better border controls, more effective combating of mafias and readmission agreements.
There are things to do in our countries as well, including putting an end to unilateral legalisation measures and improving the material and human resources at our external borders.
Funds are also needed and I regret that of every one hundred euros budgeted for in the financial perspective just fifty cents are allocated to immigration issues.
Finally, I shall briefly mention another of your Presidencyâs priorities: enlargement.
This six-month period will be the final stage in Romania and Bulgaria's efforts to join the Union on 1 January 2007.
This is the common objective that we all share and I trust that the report that the Commission will present at the beginning of the autumn will confirm that date.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr President of the Commission, I wish to make three points.
Firstly, I will speak about the Presidency.
The Presidency needs three things to succeed.
First it must be well prepared.
The Finns have once again prepared themselves admirably.
Secondly, it must be objective.
The Finnish Presidency will once again be an excellent, objective one.
We also need a little luck with the agenda and I think we have some.
The other point relates to transparency.
I would like to make a concrete proposal for the Lahti Summit.
I suggest that the first three speeches, yours and those of the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament, are shown on camera to us all openly.
I will make the third and final point in English in order to get it across: it has to do with competitiveness and football.
There is an interesting correlation.
In the World Cup the more competitive you are in football, perhaps you are slightly less competitive in the economy; the more competitive you are in the economy, the less competitive you are in football.
My proposal to Prime Minister Vanhanen for Euro 2008 is: please keep the Finnish economy competitive and push our team through to Euro 2008 as well.
Those two things can go hand in hand.
Good luck to the Presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, I kept diplomatically quiet on the subject of football.
Our task, however, that of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, is to ensure that the worldâs four â or preferably 25 â best are European: that is our common responsibility.
I tend to agree with many of your assessments and opinions regarding my speech and my style of presentation.
I am perhaps slightly civil servant-like and it may well be that I tend to make lists, but I do not intend to change my style.
I know that I will not get away with rhetoric with hardly any of you and I am not even going to try.
Nevertheless, this debate has showed that there are such passionate views on many of these European issues that perhaps it is going to take a cool head to reconcile them all.
This might be a better solution than strident rhetoric.
In this I have received very much good advice and guidance.
I cannot now comment on all your speeches.
I would like to start, however, with MrÂ Titleyâs speech, as he is a sort of godfather to us.
Some time ago, he drafted a report on the Finnish Presidency and was the first Member of the European Parliament whose acquaintance I briefly made when we were on the same committee jointly set up by the Finnish and the European Parliament.
He gave me some good advice: action, action, and action.
That will also hopefully describe the Finnish Presidency.
MrÂ Poettering made the apt comment that the presidencies form a six-month chain.
It is therefore also natural that the same issues that you have heard many times will appear on the Finnish Presidencyâs agenda.
If I remember, one of you grumbled about this.
This chain is necessary.
You sit in the European Parliament for five years.
The Commission sits for five years.
There is a natural long-term aspect to all this among you.
For the Council, the long-term aspect has to be established through mutual cooperation between the presidencies, because we need continuity.
We have to devote our energies to that.
We need the involvement of everyone in next springâs 50-year anniversary festivities and declaration, and I have welcomed those ideas that have been put forward here in this part-session.
I agree with MrÂ Schulzâs powerfully expressed view that the Union needs those tools which we can use to respond to all the challenges that are important to us.
To his comments on the need for enlargement and a new treaty I reply that there is not the slightest conflict of opinion between Commission President Barroso and myself.
As it is, we have the mechanisms for enlargement, but everyone knows that common sense says that we also need a new treaty, at least in the longer term.
Thank you to MrÂ Schulz and MrÂ Watson for your support and for the firm but healthy pressure you exerted in order that we should achieve progress in decision-making under the third pillar.
MrÂ Cohn-Bendit made the criticism that I did not raise the issue of legal immigration.
It occupies a position of importance in our programme and I mentioned it.
I mentioned it in connection with factors relating to Europeâs success.
We also need legal immigration for Europe to succeed.
It is one path towards European success in global competition in the future.
MrÂ SeppÃ€nen criticised Finlandâs aim to ratify the Constitution, saying that we do not respect the results of the French and Dutch referendums.
We certainly do, but we also respect Finlandâs right to adopt a position itself on the negotiated Treaty, that broad-based compromise which was at one time reached.
We also have the right to express our views on it and we do so with reference to our own constitution and the consideration of matters and ratification procedures which it establishes.
MrÂ Crowley made special mention of new sources of energy, and I fully agree with what he said in his speech.
MrÂ Farage said that a common asylum policy in Europe is laughable.
It is not.
On the contrary, we need a common asylum policy.
That is exactly what Europe needs, as with a lot of other things which are vitally necessary in internal and legal affairs.
It is with regard to these very issues that we need an area of freedom and justice.
We need common standards and common regulations, and we need common action very much along the same lines.
We need both cooperation between our countries and a clear mandate for the European Union.
MrÂ Paasilinna raised the sensitive question as to whether energy policy is for some in the world a weapon.
That question is raised very frequently.
Our reply is that energy policy should not be used as a weapon in global policy.
On the contrary, the EU line should be that energy policy is a normal part of business.
It must be business-based, and should clearly work both ways and give the same rights to all concerned parties.
It must be based on long-term, reliable agreements and market prices.
This way, when we act we can benefit from one another.
The energy policy between the EU and Russia in particular is part of a strategic partnership.
Russia needs European technology and the money that we spend as well, and we need Russian energy.
This partnership can serve to improve both the EUâs and Russiaâs success globally.
MrsÂ JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki made special mention of transparency and I fully agree with what she said when she remarked that what was most important was public access to documents.
We are expecting the Commission to produce a document to debate on the review of a Community Regulation on transparency, and, during our Presidency, we will submit it as a topic of discussion in the Council.
Furthermore, everything that was said on the issue of climate change in the debate, including what MrsÂ Hassi said, will be taken into consideration.
MrÂ Kirkhope stressed the importance of assessing the effects of legislation.
This is also a fundamental part of this policy of better regulation.
This will be the responsibility of the Commission, the Council and Parliament: all those involved in legislative work.
We must consider our legislative work a basis for impact assessments.
As I said in my speech, they relate to both the effects on our competitiveness and the environment and the effects on social welfare.
This needs to be part of the normal legislative process.
MrÂ Swobodaâs speech on the issue of Turkey was a wise one.
I fully support what Commission President Barroso drew attention to regarding Turkish negotiations in his speech.
MrÂ PflÃŒger described Finland as neutral.
I must correct him on that: Finland is a member of the EU.
We were at one time a politically neutral country, during the time of the Iron Curtain.
Now we are a member of the Union, part of this community of values, which has a common policy and, moreover, a common foreign policy.
He criticised the fact that we are leading the Union into military ventures and mentioned, by way of example, the operation we have begun in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
That is all about ensuring that there are democratic elections.
That is just the sort of task that the Union should be engaged in.
It gives firm support to those basic values which our existence relies on.
MrÂ Rasmussen mentioned the extraordinary social summit which we are holding and the fact that in choosing between flexibility and security the people need to feel that they have security.
This will be an exacting task when we are introducing reforms.
In responding to the challenge of globalisation we need to be able to make reforms in such a way that we also lead the world in terms of the economy and employment, but that has to happen in such a way that the people too can have confidence in it.
In this respect, the social partners have an especially important role to play.
At that summit we mean to speak a little about the model of consensus which Finland, for its own part, has used with some success to achieve certain kinds of results.
Finally in this regard, I will address MrsÂ Estrelaâs question on equality.
The introduction of a regulation on the founding of a Gender Equality Institute is now being considered.
Hopefully we will achieve a result there.
Similarly, during our Presidency we will focus attention on such issues as the trafficking of, and violence against, women.
MrÂ Buzek mentioned what in fact is the most important of the Finnish Presidencyâs priorities: innovation policy.
The Seventh Framework Programme is an important component of that.
The EIT is an important initiative and a suitable structure needs to be found for it.
In general, however, during this six-month term you will be hearing the phrase innovation policy over and over again.
That is the message we want to drum home in the Union.
Moreover, if there is something I hope the Finnish Presidency will be remembered for, it will be that we never stopped talking about innovation policy and how important it is.
In fact, MrÂ Buzek gave a very graphic description of the sort of elements innovation policy should embrace.
Then, regarding MrÂ Brokâs speech on the importance of the Baltic region, I have to remind you that it is now a common sea.
I was happy to note what you had to say, and we intend to keep the issue of the Baltic a current one.
The progress we are making on the Northern Dimension is enough to provide us with the tools we need to improve the situation regarding the Baltic too.
To MrÂ HÃ¶kmark of Sweden I can only say that for 700 years we were the same country as Sweden, and in a few yearsâ time we will be celebrating the fact that we went our separate ways.
Now for the last 11 years, on the other hand, we have been part of the same community within the framework of the Union and we enjoy a very close partnership.
I would like to end with a comment on MrÂ MillÃ¡n Monâs speeches on the situation in the Canary Islands.
Hopefully there is something symbolic about the fact that Finland, the northernmost country in the Union, has wanted even to send a border patrol and a surveillance aircraft to the Canary islands to help and demonstrate solidarity, and show that the problems that we have in different parts of Europe, even with regard to illegal immigration, are shared by all of us.
We need to show solidarity within the Union.
These are issues which we all have in common.
I would also like the Finnish Presidency to act in such a spirit in the Union over the next six months.
Thank you, MrÂ President, for the opportunity to speak here in Parliament, and I hope that we will enjoy the most fruitful cooperation with Parliament, its committees and its political groups over the next six months.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that all the important points have already been made, but I hope that you will just allow me to stress one or two points, returning in particular to questions that were raised during the debate.
First of all, we are very much in favour of the approach referred to as the 'Europe of results', but let me make it clear that the Europe of results is not an alternative to the Europe of values, but, on the contrary, the means of strengthening adhesion to those values.
It is a question of taking two paths at the same time, each of which can strengthen the other.
Our vision of a Europe supporting real projects is very much built on the idea that we need to strengthen the conditions needed to create a Europe with a dimension of social cohesion and justice, a Europe with a political vision, a Europe that is willing to use its weight, to exert its influence and to promote its values throughout the world.
That is why we think it is important to follow these two paths at the same time.
To respond to the question I was asked regarding the link between enlargement and constitutional reform, I have said many times that Nice is not enough.
In an enlarged Europe â and we are already an enlarged Europe â we need to reform the institutions to make them more effective and more democratic, and to improve the coherency of Europe's actions in the world.
In addition, the Constitutional Treaty negotiated between the Member States was already designed for the Europe of 25, which gives added strength to the idea that a Europe of 27 or more Member States will need institutional reform.
That, indeed, is the Commission's position.
With regard to the specific priorities of this Presidency, I would like to stress something that emerged very clearly from the debate: the importance attached to innovation.
We think that the Lahti Summit could be a great moment for Europe if the Heads of State or Government can actually now agree to produce concrete results as part of the innovation agenda.
As several of you emphasised here today, Europe has many excellent universities and research institutions, but it lacks the capacity to translate all this activity into more concrete results for the economy and for the competitiveness of our continent.
We therefore need to improve the connection between knowledge, science and research, on the one hand, and concrete results, on the other, and innovation is the key to that.
Finland can use its considerable experience and its specific authority to help us to produce concrete results.
Another field in which our actions are going to be judged over the next six months is that of freedom, security and justice.
This debate has made it clear that there is broad support for the idea that we must do more at Community level, too.
There is, of course, an intergovernmental dimension â we could do more in terms of cooperation between the governments â but we also need a Community dimension in certain domains, such as the management of both legal and illegal immigration.
The problems currently being experienced by some of our Member States, such as Spain, are not just their problem, but are shared by the whole of Europe.
It is clear, in these circumstances, that we cannot separate legal and illegal immigration, and that we need a European approach in this area.
I think that, on this matter, all of us â the Finnish Presidency, the Member States and us â are going to be judged at the end of these six months on our willingness to produce, on the basis of the existing treaties, better results in terms of security and justice, including, of course, when it comes to immigration.
Another issue that Parliament regards as extremely important, and that is also a priority for the Finnish Presidency, is energy, and, in this field, we must make ourselves quite clear, particularly with regard to relations with Russia.
First of all, we are in favour of a constructive partnership with Russia with regard to energy, but, as was clear from the strategic paper prepared by the Commission, we do not simply propose to develop good relations with Russia, but also to diversify.
The solution to Europe's energy problems is diversification: diversification of the country of origin, the country of supply and the country of transit, and also diversification of our sources of energy, in particular by increasing investment in renewable energy.
So, the solution for energy is to diversify, and not to lock ourselves into a relationship with a single partner, however important that partner may be.
Secondly, and still with regard to relations with Russia, let us be quite clear: in the negotiation mandate that we presented to the Council regarding our relations with that country, the first point on the list is not energy, or even trade â no, the first point relates to human rights, respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law.
That is the precondition for developing a special partnership with a country with which we do, of course, want to build a relationship, a country that also wants to build a relationship with us.
If I may, I would like to make one final point regarding the continuity on which MrÂ Vanhanen spoke so eloquently.
It is true that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, have a five-year mandate, and that the various Presidencies each have a specific purpose, but there is sometimes a problem of continuity over time, as was also identified during the negotiations regarding the constitutional treaty.
On this point, I think we are starting to make progress, as the Austrian Presidency showed.
The Presidencies are all connected, and it is a very positive sign that the constitutional issue of the granting of a mandate has been clearly raised.
On this subject, I support the pragmatic approach determined by results, and also the constructive approach chosen by the Finnish Presidency.
Ladies and gentlemen, when we were talking about a Europe of results, we did not know that the football was so soon going to show Europe's ability to be the best in terms of results.
Some of you gave in to the temptation to use the football World Cup to show that we can, in this field too, be proud of our results, but I think, as you have stressed, that, when it comes to the economy, competitiveness, our competition-based model and our values, we can and must produce more results.
I am sure that we will be able to do so during the Finnish Presidency.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â Despite a slight Nordic twist here and there, the focus of the Finnish Presidency emphasises the old, recurring themes of the EU, with the accent placed on completing the internal market, liberalising the market for services, competition, the well-trodden path of the Bolkestein Directive; in other words, the priorities of the employersâ organisations, with UNICE at the helm.
The social aspects that will be adversely affected by the liberalisation policies, and by the deepening of the internal market for services, continue to be treated as though of secondary importance.
Furthermore, apart from that sprinkling of Nordic flavour and its relations with Russia, its close neighbour, the emphasis has been placed on militarisation and on taking the option of intervention in crisis situations, rather than a policy of autonomy on US foreign policy.
Indeed, the Presidency has promised to place the accent on intervention in justice and internal affairs, which, in view of the Commissionâs agenda, underlines our concerns as regards the development of a 'Fortress Europe' immigration policy.
We expect very little from this Presidency and are not prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt, as we are opposed to most of its policies.
Â Â  During its period the Austrian Presidency has faced some real challenges, now Helsinki has to face some of these aspects too.
One which is deservedly prominent among them is the future of the Constitutional Treaty, which requires more consultation and a higher profile.
I would like to welcome the initiative from Finland, which envisages better legislation, in addition to compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.
We should make new decisions, as well as update the old ones, taking into consideration economic, environmental, but mainly social aspects.
I agree with President Barroso when he says that the sense of balance the Finns have can bring some harmony to the EU's stormy political climate by guaranteeing an opportunity to promote the innovative policies of the European Union.
Increasing researcher and student mobility, along with consolidating European know-how are basic elements in making this progress.
It is already extremely important for Europe's citizens to be familiar with the EU's institutional system, how it operates, and with the decisions that have an impact on their lives.
Therefore, I greatly applaud the Finnish Presidency's ambition to bring about an EU which supports cooperation within its institutions and communicates more effectively with its citizens.
I also agree with regulating national veto rights in order to make implementation more effective.
I support Helsinki's policy on human rights, which highlights the need to adopt a united approach to defending human and basic civil liberties.
I feel it is important to adopt a common approach to preventing illegal immigration, especially the trafficking in human beings and worker exploitation.
The European Union can only successfully respond to the growing challenges of globalisation by consolidating Europe's democracies and producing a well-structured social policy.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Palestine.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all very well know, there have been very dramatic developments in the situation in the Palestinian territories in the last week.
The capture of an Israeli soldier and the ensuing Israeli operation has been followed keenly by us all.
We have also been concerned about the continuing firing of Kassam rockets at Israel from Gaza.
As the situation in the region is still very serious, I would like, in this first speech of mine in the European Parliament, to focus on expressing the views of the European Union on the prevailing crisis.
Right at the start I want to say that yesterday in Helsinki the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister, Erkki Tuomioja, discussed the situation in the region with Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Livni.
MrÂ Tuomioja was also in telephone contact with Palestinian President Abbas and the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister Aboul Gheit.
The EU Special Representative, Marc Otte, has also been in the region this week and he has been in contact with various parties.
It is important that the Palestinians release the captured Israeli soldier immediately.
The Palestinian administration must also bring to an end the continued onslaught of Kassam rockets on Israel from Gaza.
Israel, for its part, must cease its military operation.
The Unionâs firm line on this is that any action that goes against international law must be stopped.
We should also point out that we cannot accept disproportionate action or action that punishes the entire population.
We in the Union are especially concerned about the suffering of civilians.
It is important to say that it is the duty of both parties to protect civilians.
We also know that the humanitarian situation in the region was already problematic earlier on, and that will suffer even more now with the destruction of the infrastructure, such as the power station in Gaza.
This did not just result in problems of the supply of electric power but also water supply and sewerage.
Hospitals, too, for example, are suffering the consequences of the bombing of the power station.
We also condemn Israelâs attacks on the Palestinian administrationâs infrastructure.
In this connection it has to be made clear that the European Union will not automatically act as paymaster when the reconstruction starts.
Neither can we accept that Israel has detained numerous Palestinian ministers and members of parliament.
They must be released, or at least guaranteed a fair trial.
What the Quartet formerly set out as its demands with regard to the Hamas-led Palestinian Government still holds good.
The Palestinian Government must recognise the following principles: non-violence, the recognition of Israelâs right to exist, and compliance with existing agreements and obligations.
In this connection I would like to refer to the understanding reached between Hamas and Fatah based on the âPrisonersâ Documentâ.
In a situation in which bad relations between Fatah and Hamas seemed to be reaching an acute stage, one that threatened peace, reaching an understanding in this way was a step in the right direction, although it does not as yet mean that the EUâs conditions and those of the Quartet are adequately met.
How are we to come through the present crisis?
The European Union emphasises that the crisis can only be resolved through discussions.
Regarding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, it was a promising move that Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas met about two weeks ago. It was also promising that they decided to meet again soon.
A speedy return to this path of maintaining contact and negotiations is very important.
It is only the path of negotiation that can lead to a permanent and lasting peace.
Although the chances of initiating a peace process once again seem very slight in the prevailing circumstances, the idea of a two-state model must be kept alive.
Weapons and unilateral action will not bring peace.
The European Union and Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, are committed to helping both sides to reach a peace settlement.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are all extremely concerned by the events unfolding in the Palestinian territories.
These are very disturbing times: the insecurity, the inter-factional violence, the Qassam rockets, the shellings.
The attack by militant Palestinian factions in Karem Shalom and the abduction of the Israeli soldier, followed by the Israeli military incursion into Gaza, signal a very worrying escalation.
In its statement last week, the European Union strongly condemned these acts, and we have just heard what the President-in-Office of the Council has said.
Last week I called on both sides to take a step back, to exercise restraint.
I now repeat that call.
All sides need to consider their responsibility extremely carefully.
All parties must abstain from any actions that are in violation of international law and we must insist that the Palestinian leadership do all in its power to end violence and terrorist activities.
The European Union has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Corporal Gilad Shalit.
This kind of act can only make things worse for the Palestinian people, as we are seeing.
But we must also look to the Israelis to act with prudence.
We understand their outrage, but diplomacy offers the best chance to address the immediate priority, not the destruction of essential infrastructure, the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council or the shelling of the Prime Ministerâs office.
Recent events have considerably worsened the situation of the Palestinian population, and that is, I must say, a source of both sorrow and deep frustration for us.
The damage to Gazaâs only power station has deprived hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of electricity and could have serious humanitarian consequences.
Everything must be done to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating further.
Israel has to understand its responsibilities for the well-being of the Palestinian population and an immediate step has to be the restoration of electricity to the Palestinian territories.
Both sides need to step back from the brink before this becomes a crisis that neither can control.
We must do all we can to avoid an unacceptable economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories.
Even before the latest events, we were looking at a 30% fall in income, unemployment at 40% and poverty levels of 67%.
But responsible politicians cannot give in to frustration.
I visited Israel and the Palestinian territories only two weeks ago.
The principal aim of my visit then was to bring Israel and President Abbas up to speed with the European Council and the Quartet decisions on a temporary international mechanism.
The mechanism is designed to provide immediate relief to the Palestinian people and to ensure that basic services are provided.
Discussions were positive, but there is no doubt that events in Gaza and the West Bank have greatly complicated this effort.
Now, more than ever, there is a need to press ahead with the mechanism to help meet at least the basic needs of ordinary Palestinians.
A number of donors have indicated their willingness to make funds available through the mechanism. But the needs will be great and funds are limited.
The Commission has therefore sought the budgetary authorityâs approval to transfer funds from the emergency reserve.
I am very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this difficult endeavour and I am especially grateful for the many very valuable exchanges of views I was able to have with the committee chairmen and leaders in my discussions with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the forefront in setting up this mechanism.
It is our collective responsibility as Europeans to help the Palestinians and to give peace a chance.
I look forward to your continued support on that.
Let us be clear.
The mechanism cannot be a panacea for all the difficulties faced in the Palestinian territories.
Donors cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of the Palestinian Government, which must take real steps to comply with the Quartetâs principles and end the violence that threatens the lives of Israelis and Palestinians alike.
Nor can donors be a substitute for the responsibilities of Israel under international law, for freeing up movement and access, for releasing Palestinian customs and tax revenues, or for the recent damage caused to key civil infrastructure.
The events of recent days have undermined a fragile process that has just begun with the meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert in Amman.
As my colleague has said, these events come at a time when progress was being made on a national consensus agreement between Hamas and Fatah, based on the prisonersâ initiative.
It remains to be seen whether this tentative agreement for a government of national unity will produce a leadership better able to meet its responsibilities.
I have commended President Abbas for taking this initiative, but at the same time I have been clear that it is not an end in itself, but only the start of a process.
The Palestinian Government must ultimately commit itself to renouncing violence, to recognising Israel and to respecting previous agreements as set out by the Quartet.
We are faced with a very grave crisis situation in the Middle East.
We have to work together to de-escalate the tension and to give diplomacy a chance. Because in all the chaos and confusion of the current situation, one thing is clear: a negotiated two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the security that ordinary people â Israelis and Palestinians as well as others â desire.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MadamÂ President-in-Office of the Council, this is one of the debates that leaves one increasingly dumbstruck.
We have had to seek new ways.
The Commission is producing a wealth of ideas as to how to help the Palestinian people despite the fact that the new Palestinian Government fails to recognise Israelâs right to exist and has not renounced violence â in this the Commission has our full support.
However, the other party must also make a move.
It goes without saying that there are things, such as the Kassam rockets, that are unacceptable to Israel, but the question is whether it really had to react like that at a time when President Abbas had been on the way to making some progress with Hamas.
This would at least have been worth putting to the credibility test.
On the other hand, however, there have been occurrences that further detract from the credibility of President Abbas, and so it is increasingly difficult for us to find points of contact.
This whole situation is a vicious circle.
It is hard to say who was originally right or wrong, because the circle keeps turning.
We must make the position of the EU and of the Quartet crystal clear.
Our conditions must be Israelâs right to exist as a state, and a viable Palestinian state.
Both parties in the region must be aware that they are pursuing a policy that is not only causing their peoples serious harm, but increasingly also causing problems for the whole international community and endangering peace in general â as this is not just a localised conflict.
Decisions are urgently needed in this matter.
I should like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and explains the dangers, rather than its members travelling there separately and thus achieving nothing.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a real humanitarian disaster has been taking place in Gaza over the last few hours, involving more than one million civilians.
UN, UNICEF and WFP reports talk of a desperate situation.
Gaza has become a prison in which an entire population is being collectively punished.
The international community had finally come to an agreement to ensure that the Palestinians received the aid they needed to survive via the European Union, but all of that is now pointless since Gaza is practically isolated and nothing is getting through to an exhausted and humiliated population.
The Palestinian issue cannot, however, become a humanitarian issue, because it remains a major political issue.
The indiscriminate decapitation of Hamas was, for its part, an act of madness, firstly because the members of parliament and the ministers now legitimately represent the majority of the Palestinian population, but mainly because PrimeÂ Minister Haniyeh had given the go-ahead to the so-called âprisonersâ documentâ and had actually dissociated himself from the most intransigent of the positions adopted by the Hamas representatives in Syria, avoiding the referendum and paving the way for a coalition government in Palestine.
With these actions, the Israeli authorities are in real danger of once again encouraging the most extreme and violent fringes of Palestinian society.
Corporal Gilad Shalit must be released, just as an entire population must be released from the grip of an army that is infringing every aspect of the law.
In the past, the European Parliament has pressed for aid to be allowed to get through to the Palestinian population; today, the same Parliament is calling on the European governments and the Presidency to demand respect for fundamental human rights, so that people can resume their lives in Gaza and so that political prospects can be re-established in place of violence and abuses of power.
Â Â  . Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I do actually share Mr Brokâs sense of despair.
Observing the way things have developed in recent weeks is enough to make us, too, become despondent.
Indeed, if we compare the current situation with the way things were, say, in January of this year, they have only taken a turn for the worse.
The arms truce, which Hamas observed, has come to an end; the number of prisoners on both sides is on the up; violence perpetrated against citizens has increased; Gaza has become a prison for its residents and the humanitarian situation is tragic.
Nevertheless, now is not the time to let our hands hang low.
That is why I should like to start, on behalf of my group, by pledging our full support, both to the Finnish Presidency, you, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, your Prime Minister, your Minister for Foreign Affairs â whilst also congratulating you on the efforts that have already been made â and also to you, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
If I can venture drawing the political lesson from your words, what strikes me as paramount from what you have said â and you seem to be in agreement â is that negotiations and diplomacy are the only way-out.
That appears to me as a clear message in the direction of those who at the moment say that they refuse all contact with the other party.
We support you in this, and needless to say, we remain faithful to the principles of the Quartet, the recognition of Israelâs right of existence, the renunciation of violence by Hamas, as well as respect for previous treaties.
We also support your call for taking a step back and for restraint.
You have our full support in this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this overdue debate today because, frankly, the declaration of the Presidency issued two days ago falls far short of the response that we should expect of the European Union and risks undermining the EUâs credibility in the region.
Clearly that declaration is not balanced: it gives great emphasis to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier, which it condemns, but spends far fewer words on the completely disproportionate response of the Israeli authorities, which it only âregretsâ.
I am sorry that the representative of the Council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning.
It is not only that, contrary to both international law and humanitarian principle, the Israeli Government has destroyed electricity plants and water distribution networks: it has kidnapped and arrested 64 elected representatives.
That follows the terrible massacre on the beach in Gaza.
If that had happened anywhere else in the world we could have expected immediate condemnation by the international community.
It is quite extraordinary that the Council has only finally spoken out now, and spoken in such muted terms.
I believe it vital that we, the European Parliament, speak out and that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the arrest of democratically elected Palestinian representatives.
At the same time we condemn the kidnapping of the captured Israeli soldier and we call for his swift and safe release.
But let us not forget, either, the 9Â 600 Palestinian political prisoners, over half of whom are being detained without trial, nearly 400 of whom are under the age of 18.
Let us have some consistency.
Secondly, politics is about responding to changing events, and there has been a historic event in recent days that has been tragically overshadowed by the events in Gaza.
That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so-called prisonersâ document.
In recent weeks the international community has called upon Hamas to change and now, as it gradually begins to do so, we should recognise that fact, give credit for that fact and alter our own political response accordingly.
In agreeing that national conciliation document, Hamas has demonstrated that it supports the formation of a government of national coalition, that it supports an independent Palestinian state, within the 1967 borders, and that it is taking the first steps towards recognising Israel.
We should be clear that the EU must immediately reopen dialogue with the legitimately and democratically elected representatives.
The Council must reaffirm its conviction, as it has done, that the negotiated two-state solution is the only one that will bring peace and security, but that means that the EU itself must live up to its responsibilities.
Together with the Quartet it must put forward concrete proposals about what it plans to do to help bring about that settled and peaceful resolution.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we are calling for the release of Corporal GiladÂ Shalit and we are calling for the release of 9Â 000 Palestinian prisonersÂ âÂ of whom 128 are women, 300 are adolescents and 900 are being detained without trial.
The Israeli armyâs offensive on Gaza and the unprecedented seizure of a third of the Palestinian Ministers, of the President of Parliament and of many Hamas Members of Parliament, have nothing really to do with the desire to free that soldier.
These plans had been in place well before his capture.
The Olmert Government took this opportunity to try to take a decisive step towards a well-established and now well-known strategy.
Firstly, the idea is to depose the Palestinian Government, even if it means all that remains of the Palestinian Authority of President Abbas being destroyed in the process.
Then, as always, they will say that there is no Palestinian interlocutor to negotiate with.
The way will then be open for Israel to impose its borders unilaterally.
The regrouping of the settlements into three great blocs, which are easier to defend, the dividing up of the Palestinian territories and the annexation of almost half of the West Bank, of the Jordan Valley and of East Jerusalem and the continued construction of the wall: in short, a destroying any hope of a Palestinian State deserving of the term.
Finally, the chaos thereby generated within Palestinian society will make it possible to justify continuing use of force, in the name of the essential need for security.
This strategy is not just monstrous for the Palestinian people.
It may well mean that the Israelis themselves have a nightmarish future in store.
How can they expect docile Palestinian leaders and a consenting population to emerge, as if by a miracle, from such a collapse?
He who sows despair, reaps violence.
Palestinian society is in danger of concluding that playing the game of democracy has brought them nothing but more misfortune.
Faced with such a challenge, is the European Union going to let the Palestinian institutions that it has spent 12 years helping to create be destroyed?
Is it going to abandon the Palestinian President in the middle of this turmoil, when, together with the head of the government, he has just achieved something that nobody dared hope for, that is the conclusion of an agreement recognising Israel and opening up the way to a government of national unity?
Or is it going to have the will and the courage, which I have not noticed on the part of the Council â something I regret â to make its mark by demanding the release of the Hamas leaders, by re-establishing appropriate aid and active cooperation with the Palestinian authority and government, and stating clearly the obligations of all States without exception according to international law and the Geneva Conventions.
I believe that it is in this area, and from this moment on, that Europe is going to be staking much of the credibility of the Euro-Mediterranean project and its credibility as a global player in general.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are following the situation in the Holy Land with anxiety and anguish.
It is a situation that is becoming more serious by the day and one that is in danger of turning into an international crisis and, even before that, into a humanitarian crisis.
I think that it is only right to begin with the words of the Pope, who has launched an appeal for the release of all of the kidnap victims and for negotiations to be held between Israelis and Palestinians, with the decisive contribution of the international community, and especially of Europe, in favour of a restoration of peace.
At this tragic time, in fact, only dialogue and a cessation of the hostilities by both parties can stop the unacceptable escalation of violence.
We welcomed the agreement between Fatah and Hamas on the prisonersâ document, which implicitly acknowledges Israelâs existence, but much more progress needs to be made, starting with the release of the Israeli soldier.
Europe has done well to launch an immediate appeal, with one voice, for moderation and peace, but more courage and more determination are required.
The international community must genuinely take the lead and assume full responsibility for becoming the guarantor of peace in the Middle East, by putting a stop to the violence and bringing Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.
To conclude, I should like once again to cite the Pope, who has reaffirmed Israel's legitimate right to exist, in peace, but who has subsequently appealed for the international community to genuinely support the people of Palestine so that they can overcome the precarious conditions in which they are living and can build a future for themselves, with the ultimate aim of building an actual State.
We are sure that, if these words could be heard, it would be possible at last to re-embark on the road to dialogue and peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, yesterday, Israeliâs Defence Minister, Amir Peretz, held the Syrian President, Bashir al-Assad, responsible for the welfare of the captured Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit.
In doing so, he backed up his argument by reference to the terrorist command of Hamas, which operates under the of Khaled Meshal in Damascus.
Do the Council and Commission share this view and if so, how do they think this may impact on European relations with Syria?
A second question to the Council and Commission concerns the functioning of European monitoring on the border between Egypt and Gaza at Rafah.
A prominent Israeli analyst has described this EU mission as a complete failure.
Before Europeâs and Egyptâs very eyes â probably literally in the case of the Egyptians â weapons and terrorists are entering the Gaza strip.
I would ask the Council and Commission what their reaction to this is.
Given yesterdayâs Palestinian rocket attack in the centre of the Israeli city of Ashkelon, this is an urgent matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, the present situation in Israel poses a genuine threat of war.
It is the gravest situation in the region since 2000, or even since 1967.
Without wishing to go into a detailed analysis of the most recent events, and without wishing to play the role of a judge passing sentence or of a jury deciding who is at fault, I need to say that the lack of stability in this region is a real threat to peace and order throughout the world, and therefore international intervention is required.
We cannot sit idly by and watch.
If the escalation of violence continues, the spiral of conflict will intensify and lead to events whose repercussions will be felt not just by the inhabitants of Israel and Palestine.
There are extremists on both sides.
We must do everything to give a chance to the forces of moderation in both countries, to those who choose the difficult path of dialogue, rather than those who choose the easy path of violence.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner very rightly mentioned the agreement between President Abbas and the Hamas government on the basis of the proposal by the prisoners, which has been overshadowed by recent developments.
Each time there is a positive development towards peace, some extremist elements make sure they undermine it by an action such as the ambush in which two soldiers died and one was abducted.
We condemn any terrorist acts and we demand the release of the Israeli soldier.
However, it must also be said that the Israeli side always falls into this trap.
With their excessive and disproportionate use of force they are destroying all the positive developments toward the peace that they themselves are seeking.
They say that their aim is to spare innocent civilians. However, by destroying power stations and preventing normal irrigation â thereby leaving several million people without electricity and water â they are punishing not only innocent civilians but also the European taxpayer whose money has contributed to the building of the infrastructure and who, most probably and quite rightly, will be asked to repair it again.
Therefore, our call is for both sides to respect the political, democratic process and to abandon violence as a means of imposing their political objectives on each other.
The fight against terror should not be an excuse for Israel to overturn a democratic political decision taken by the Palestinian people.
Â Â  A dark cloud is hanging over the operation under way in Gaza.
The further that operation progresses, the darker that cloud becomes!
The summer rains that are flooding Gaza are not just pointless. They are above all entirely illegitimate.
It is not legitimate to deprive 750 000 people of electricity, it is not legitimate to call upon 20Â 000 people to leave their homes in order to turn their town into a ghost town.
It is not legitimate to penetrate Syrian airspace.
It is not legitimate to kidnap a quarter of a government and a quarter of a parliament.
A State acting in that way is no better than a terrorist organisation.
These are not my words, they are those of a Jewish man, Mr Levy, this week on Haaretz.com.
If the voices of reason are speaking out in Israel to condemn these crimes, why is the Council struck down dumb?
Its communiquÃ© of 3 July does not go as far as that of Switzerland or Turkey!
The European Union, which spent EURÂ 3Â 000Â 000 on observing the Palestinian elections, has been slow in reacting to the kidnapping of 64 members of the government and of the democratically-elected legislative Council, and is not calling for their immediate release.
The shelling of Gaza, the destruction of an electrical power station, the cutting off of water, are not causing any outcry.
Despite the increasing numbers of deaths and the cycle of violence that is re-emerging, we are not hearing anybody say: enough, enough, enough!
Stop this carnage, you have gone mad!
Yes, I condemn the firing of Kassam rockets, yes, I want to see the release of the soldier Gilad, but I also want to see the release of the 339 Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons.
If a soldierâs life is sacred, then so are the lives of children.
Above all, however, I am amazed that the European Union has not yet welcomed â though I would thank the Commissioner for doing so today â the historic step of the agreement on the document of the prisoners.
Six months after the elections, Hamas and Islamic Jihad committed themselves implicitly to recognising Israel and to stopping the violence outside the territories.
Not a word was said here though, just a deafening silence!
Our humanitarian aid â and I support the Commissioner â is just about going to keep Palestine going.
Yet is it still our ambition to help the Palestinian State to build its democracy?
I put that question to the Council.
Stop this scandal and ensure that international law is adhered to!
Â Â  Mr President, we have heard about Corporal Shalit and those responsible should release the poor kid now. We have heard a lot less about Maria Aman.
She will never again use her arms or legs; she is just three years old and her spinal cord was destroyed by Israeli shrapnel.
That is what you get when you drop shells on a busy street in Gaza.
The Israeli army killed more than 12 Palestinian children last month, but what do they care?
The Israeli Prime Minister says that the lives of Israelis are more important than those of Palestinians.
Israel is diverting attention from the agreement between Fatah and Hamas that recognises the 1967 borders.
What more does Israel want?
It will use any pretext to avoid going back to the roadmap.
It has no intention of negotiating a two-state solution.
But where is the challenge from Europe?
There is none; our double standards are just rank.
We ignore Israeli racism and stand by with scarcely a word of protest as Israel imposes collective punishment on the people of Gaza.
Our words about justice are never matched by our deeds.
Europe has an opportunity here to move the agenda forward by telling the world that we embrace the prisonersâ document and that we will deal with the Palestinian Government.
But all the evidence is that the Council and the Commission will not have the courage to do that.
We make the Palestinians jump through hoops, but we let the Israelis get away with bloody murder.
Â Â  Mr President, last week the whole Parliament was treated to a very grand press release from Mr Adamos Adamou, MEP.
Apparently the whole world should know that he, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, âcalls upon the international community to provide protection for civilian lives in Gazaâ.
Well how, precisely?
What is he going to do â stand in the middle of the street with a tin hat on his head?
Fortunately, a Google news search shows that there has been no response to the suggestion at all.
All I can suggest now â and there have been some very strong speeches made here â is that we take a check on reality.
The tragic truth is this: if Hamas continues to bomb, to kill, to maim and now to kidnap, then Israel will respond.
Those who are burying their heads in the sand had better recognise that, or more tragedy will ensue.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must not copy the Italian Governmentâs dubious policy of treating Israel and Palestine equally: the Gaza Strip has become an institutionalised launch pad for terrorist attacks.
Hamas militia have abandoned the institutional option and have turned the situation back into one of full-scale terrorism.
This is the main point.
We cannot compare terrorism with Israelâs military decisions, or with the human rights violations that we do nonetheless condemn, but if Hamas' decision-making powers are in the hands of the media-dependent butchers from Syria and Iran, what can the MEPsâ feeble requests to the Hamas government accomplish?
Our inspectors have failed to prevent the shameful trafficking of millions of dollars, money that was packed into Hamas suitcases and definitely not intended to meet the needs of the Palestinian population.
However, it is the European taxpayer that must attend to this problem.
Â Â  Mr President, the escalation of tension in the Palestinian territory was provoked by the Hamas-led kidnapping of Corporal Shalit with unrealistic demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Coming on the back of the cold-blooded murder of a civilian settler and the continuing firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza on to Israeli civilian areas, Prime Minister Olmert had no choice but to launch the limited surgical intervention by the IDF.
I too now call for Corporal Shalitâs immediate release.
Personally, I oppose any funding of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority Government unless it renounces violence, disarms and recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist.
Regrettably, the joint Hamas declaration with Fatah of 27 June, allegedly implicitly recognising Israel, reportedly remains an ambiguous document and Hamas does not clearly renounce violence.
In the past, millions of euros of our taxpayersâ money have been donated in aid to the Palestinian Authority with little to show for it in terms of securing a lasting peace as envisaged in Oslo in 1993.
Instead, there has been widespread corruption.
I personally, although accepting the democratic victory of Hamas â after all, Hitler was also elected democratically â continue to regard it as a banned terrorist organisation, as does the European Union and the USA, and therefore would never countenance supporting any funds for it until it convincingly changes its charter and terrorist ideology.
The recent Passover suicide bombing in Tel Aviv was publicly supported by the Hamas PA Government, which is an outrage.
Nevertheless, the European Union, through the Quartet, must remain committed to lasting peace in the Middle East with a two-state solution whereby a viable, democratic Palestinian State can live in peace and security side by side with Israel within internationally recognised borders.
I join all parties in this House in urging that Israel â the IDF in particular â Hamas and all the people involved in these ghastly events respect international law and avoid further bloodshed.
Â Â  Mr President, no conflict has ever been resolved with raised voices.
In what way does the present picture of terror and violence differ from the others?
The fact that the violence and crimes of the abductors and murderers of an Israeli lad, and the many victims of the attacks have not been condemned by the democratically elected Palestinian Authority.
In fact, Hamas took the side of those who spread violence and terror.
It happened just after the new Israeli Government was sworn in, and to each action there is a reaction.
The Israeli authorities responded to this criminal act by military action.
Todayâs scenarios have not been scripted by the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority, who have attempted to keep the dialogue open, but by the Iranian President and Hamas extremists brought in from Damascus and terrorists of all shapes and sizes.
I appeal to the Council and Commission to bring greater pressure to bear on both sides in this conflict, but particularly on the Palestinian Authority.
It must be remembered that to renew the peace process, that government appointed by Hamas must recognise the state of Israel, renounce violence and abide by all agreements signed so far, which it has not yet done.
Â Â  Mr President, the situation is serious, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said. Yes, the Israeli army is back in Gaza, yes, the Palestinians are in a dramatic humanitarian situation, the victims of the murderous deadlock into which they have been led by Hamas.
We certainly support the emergency aid announced by the Commissioner.
Yes, the Israeli reaction which has deprived half of the inhabitants of Gaza of water and electricity is disproportionate.
Nevertheless, Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza.
This great crisis could end tomorrow if the terrorist movements were to release the young soldier captured and stop firing rockets into Israeli territory, like the one last night on a school in Sderot.
One constant concern is the possibility of the conflict in the region undergoing a sort of âiraqisationâ: kidnappings and executions of hostages, such as that of 18-year-old EliahouÂ Asheri, which hardly anybody has mentioned, who was shot in the head because he was hitch-hiking in Jerusalem.
Only a return to diplomacy will control this radicalisation and extremism, this policy of making things worse in order to achieve oneâs ends.
France and Egypt are currently in the best position to find a solution which I hope will be imminent for Gilad Shalit and for the Palestinian people.
I would like to reassure Mr Davies by stressing here that, for each of us in this House, a Palestinian life is worth as much as an Israeli life.
I believe that it is extremely unfair and inappropriate to put words into our mouths like that.
Our dearest wish â which is unfortunately little more than a dream â is to see Europe work together on this issue in order to achieve a return to the negotiation table.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that everything has already been said about the conflict and its origins.
I believe that the situation is much worse today than a year ago, because we no longer know whom to help and how.
On the one hand we have a physical barrier, and then we have an armed barrier (soldiers, passport control), which led to the destruction of a power station and bridges.
Another new political barrier has also appeared, in the form of the elected Hamas government, and all that it entails in political terms.
Then there are also the people, the ordinary citizens, whom we do not know how to help.
It is a fairly simple rule that hunger and frustration lead to aggression, and aggression is the food on which terrorism, and possibly even a potential war, thrives.
We should ask ourselves whether, if the two peoples cannot coexist in one country, there is only one viable solution: the creation of two states.
I have a question to the Commissioner and the members of the Commission and the Council: is the European Union doing enough, are we being sufficiently vigorous and effective as mediators, as helpers and as diplomats?
Does the Commissioner have any ideas on this particular situation?
Â Â  Mr President, I am amazed by what I have just heard, and I regret that some people here still confuse Jews with Israelis.
We would not be facing such a huge humanitarian crisis if we had not started by stopping our aid to the Palestinian people.
The Council of Ministersâ decision to cut aid and to endanger the Palestinian people was a serious mistake.
There were other ways to apply pressure.
Since the suspension of that aid, has the Hamas Government made the slightest progress in terms of recognising the State of Israel?
Has it finally decided to condemn the attacks?
Not only has this policy of using the humanitarian crisis for the purposes of blackmail had no positive effect whatsoever, but it has actually led to suffering.
We are once again in a cycle of violence in which wrong is clearly being done by both sides; rockets fired into Israel, disproportionate reprisals by the Israeli army, the seizing of the soldier Shalit, who of course must be released, as everybody here has said.
Many players have continued to cooperate with Palestine. I am thinking in particular of the many European local groups who met in Brussels last week.
Furthermore, as President Brok said, the Quartet must allow intervention on the ground.
Finally, allow me to express my great regret at the fact that the European Parliament's resolution voted on last month made no reference to the statement of the Palestinian prisoners, because I believe that that text is the most encouraging sign for the Palestinian authority led by Mahmoud Abbas, which we must support.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only share the profound concern which Members of Parliament have expressed on the worsening crisis in the Middle East.
Moreover, as the Minister responsible for development cooperation, I think that the deteriorating humanitarian situation is especially serious, as I said in my opening speech, considering that the situation was not very good even before this latest phase of the crisis.
This conflict is a huge challenge for the European Union, and the Council is firmly committed to supporting every means to find a solution to it.
At the same time we have to bear in mind that the parties involved hold the keys to solving the crisis.
We can and we must work to find a solution as best we can, but it is crucially important that the parties involved have sufficient will and the desire to do so too.
The Council issued its latest statement on 30 June: it did not waste any time.
As I see it, the position taken is a very balanced one, unlike what has been suggested in some of the speeches here.
The Council wishes to stress that, to ease the crisis, both sides must take the necessary adequate action.
We regard it as vital that the captured Israeli soldier is released, but also just as vital that Israel puts an end to this military operation and that both sides act in compliance with international law.
It is crucial that the parties involved can return to the negotiating table and thereby find a solution to the crisis.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I said at the beginning, I really sense and share your deep concern at the escalation of these events in the Gaza Strip.
It is a vicious circle.
I also understand the reactions in Israel to the kidnapping of Corporal Shalit.
He must be released unharmed.
It is true that the Syrian part of Hamas has a great responsibility here.
The Qassam rocket attacks from northern Gaza into Israel must stop.
However, the Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip and the destruction of the civilian infrastructure there punishes Palestinians collectively and puts civilian lives at risk.
That raises questions about respect for international law.
Is it really in Israelâs long-term interest?
Does it not threaten to reinforce this vicious circle of poverty and extremism?
Electricity and water supplies must now be restored quickly and with Israeli assistance.
The arrest of elected law-makers threatens the institutions of the Palestinian Authority that are needed for the creation of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State.
The European Union has expressed particular concerns about the detention of these elected members of the Palestinian Government and legislature and those detained must be accorded full legal rights.
All sides must exercise restraint.
Last year I spoke of the need to hope for prospects in the peace process in the wake of Israelâs disengagement from Gaza and the G8 plan to revive the Palestinian economy.
How different the situation looks today.
Yet, I think it is possible to step back.
Therefore we will remain committed to a negotiated two-state solution and we will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed by both sides.
We welcome President Abbasâs efforts to create the widest possible Palestinian consensus in support of the objectives of the roadmap and we want to have continued support.
We are ready to work with any Palestinian government that renounces violence, recognises Israel and respects previous agreements as set out by the Quartet.
We have to consider Mr Brokâs suggestion of going there as a Quartet and seeing what we can do.
We have reiterated our commitment to a negotiated, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in the Middle East.
The common goal of the G8 remains the creation of a viable, democratic and sovereign Israel and Palestine living in peace and security.
We want to achieve that and therefore we want to continue our efforts, even at the most difficult times.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  â How much more must the Palestinian people suffer, how many more children must be killed before the international community finally wakes up and demands that Israel stop the abominable crimes which it is committing every day?
The cause of the tragedy is the Israeli occupation.
We must not let the truth be distorted by putting responsibility for the unacceptable developments on the imprisonment of one Israeli soldier.
This would be the equivalent of our accepting the occupation and the logic of mass punishment and the declaration that the life of Israelis is more important than the life of Palestinians.
We condemn the arrest of ministers of the legal and democratically elected Palestinian Government and our fellow parliamentarians.
We demand their immediate and unconditional release.
Israel must stop the undeclared war and the blocking of humanitarian aid and must restore the infrastructure it has destroyed.
We are also calling for the release of the solider, which will remove any pretext for continuing attacks.
The Quartet must immediately apply the temporary aid mechanism to the Palestinians.
The international community, the ÎU and the Quartet must insist on returning to the negotiating table and must demand respect for the roadmap by the Israeli Government and respect for all the agreements signed on the promotion and safeguarding of peace by both sides.
Â Â  â Faced with the upsurge of Israelâs criminal onslaught against the Palestinian people and its institutions, the EU has once again held Israel and the Palestinians jointly responsible for the situation in a statement by the Council Presidency.
This completely overlooks the brutal policy of Israelâs aggression and occupation of Palestine, where Israel systematically violates international law and the Palestinian peopleâs inalienable right to their own independent state.
The EU has not issued a single word in condemnation of the current Israeli military aggression, which judging by its extent appears to have been a long time in the pipeline, with Israel simply waiting for an excuse.
This criminal military action forms part of a long-planned Israeli strategy to destroy the Palestinian Authority, its institutions and its structures, including those that meet the peopleâs most basic needs.
Israelâs strategy is to annexe occupied territories â as evidenced by the building of the wall â and to undermine the conditions required for building a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state.
This is why solidarity is needed towards the PLO and the Palestinian people.
Â Â  The situation in Palestine is critical.
All humane individuals want to see the Israeli soldier who has been taken hostage released safe and well.
However, his abduction should not be used by Israel as an excuse for extreme action in Gaza and the West Bank.
I urge Israel to keep all its actions in line with international law.
The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories must be addressed urgently.
Electricity should immediately be restored to all homes, medical supplies provided and food shortages addressed.
Both parties should be encouraged to take measures to build mutual confidence and reduce tension.
A clear statement from both sides that a negotiated two-state solution is the only viable future for the region would go a long way to improving the present situation.
Â Â  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
Are we all ready to vote?
More or lessÂ âŠ
We should also thank Germany for being a great host and providing a great team.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order under Rules 149 to 164, I rise to ask why it is Parliament cannot be organised, via the Presidency or its administration, to have votes at the proper time, on time, when required.
Votes should take precedence over everything else and should be at a fixed time, so that inconvenience is not caused to everyone by having votes at ridiculous times such as this.
Â Â  Thank you, Sir Robert.
I did check.
This morningâs debate was slightly prolonged because of the Finnish Prime Ministerâs speech, which lasted 45 minutes.
You will recall that Finnish has too many vowels for any serious language. That is what prolonged it.
I should like to announce to colleagues that Terry Wynn will be retiring from the European Parliament this week.
I am sure that we would all like to thank him for his distinguished work, especially as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
Â Â  Mr President, for me as a newcomer from one of the new Member States, it was feasible to jump into the chair of the Committee on Budgets because I had an eminent predecessor.
Chairing the Committee after MrÂ Wynn is like flying on autopilot.
For me he is, and will remain, a great master of European finance.
All the best to you, Terry.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, inaccuracies in the German translation of our compromise proposal on cabin crew have caused confusion among some of my fellow Members.
These inaccuracies are found in AmendmentsÂ 20, 22 and 24(1).
The authoritative version is the English âwhere relevantâ, which translates into German as â and not , which would be âif relevantâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I would confirm that linguistic difficulty.
I would also like to say that 37 of us tabled Amendments 17 and 18 in plenary.
Last night at the end of the debate an agreement was reached in relation to these amendments.
I can tell the Members involved with these amendments that the Council and the Commission have agreed to include cabin crew in the air safety rules, as those Members wished.
I can therefore say to the Members who have tabled these amendments together with me that, provided that the compromise amendments are adopted, our amendments will no longer be relevant and we will therefore be able to vote against.
I believe that this has been a fine collective success.
I hope that my fellow Members have understood what I wanted to say.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I should like to request a roll-call vote on this one.
Â Â  Mr President, unless I am mistaken, according to Rule 153(3) of our Rules of Procedure, the share of the vote just now should have led to rejection.
That is how it appears to me, though I could be wrong.
Â Â  We are applying Rule 153(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which reads: âIn the event of a tied vote on the agenda as a whole (Rule 132) or the Minutes as a whole (Rule 172), or on a text put to a split vote under Rule 157, the text shall be deemed adoptedâ.
Thank you for your remarks.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I regret that the Commission did not take the floor.
The decision we have just taken on nuclear exports is relevant to the forthcoming G8 Summit.
Based on this morningâs debate, I expect the Commission to raise the issues of human rights and the environmental situation in the Urals in relation to the Mayak and Chelyabinsk reprocessing plants with President Putin on site.
Â Â  The rapporteur could have indicated that he wanted the Commission to reply, but that was not the case.
Therefore that was in order.
Â Â  It gives me great pleasure to welcome Emma Bonino, the Italian Minister for European Policies and International Trade, to the House today.
Â Â  . The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the effectiveness of contacts between law-enforcement authorities and to maintain law and order in the different Member States in order to improve the planning of cross-border policing during certain international events.
The report proposes that, in the last quarter of the year, the Council Presidency draw up a list of the international events planned for the following year, along with the assistance that will be required.
The report also proposes that the Presidency produce a review of the assistance provided during the previous year, containing a list of the problems and difficulties experienced by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties can be resolved.
I therefore support the Boepels report and the amendments that she has tabled.
This is a justified, welcome report.
The necessary measures must be taken to ensure that security and law and order are maintained during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, and that illegal acts may be prevented and combated.
Â Â  We are issuing our opinion today on a proposal for a decision on strengthening cross-border police cooperation with regard to meetings attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, including large international sporting events (the football World Cup, the Olympics, cycling tours etc.), but also religious events, State visits or international political meetings or summits.
Experience has clearly shown that cooperation, confidence, proper communication between the police forces involved, the availability of reliable information and good preparation are essential factors in the success of such events, particularly from the point of view of prevention.
The text takes account of each of these elements and specifically lays down the following stages.
Before events: annual planning of expected needs.
During events: cross-border cooperation and assistance amongst national police forces.
Finally, after events: an evaluation and, if necessary, proposals for adapting the European legislation (particularly the Schengen Agreement).
At the moment of the second semi-final of the World Cup, which has so far taken place without any major incident, we must support this text in the hope that that remains the case as often as possible.
Â Â  . The proposal to draw up a list of international events taking place in the EU, attended by citizens from various Member States, requiring high levels of cooperation between the security services of the different Member States raises major concerns as to the real objective of this initiative and the use of this mechanism.
The recent attempts to prevent people from taking part in international events and demonstrations taking place for example alongside European summits, in protest at neoliberal and militarist policies or expressing solidarity with people fighting against imperialism, are very fresh in the mind.
This ultimately demonstrates the potential meaning of the âprovision of cross-border assistanceâ between security services for âmaintaining law and orderâ and âcombating criminal offencesâ.
This initiative forms part of the securitarianism that the EU is drifting towards, and follows the adoption of other measures which, on the pretext of the so-called âfight against terrorismâ, undermine the citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees.
Our parliamentary group therefore voted against.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Brepoels on her timely report on the initiative by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on strengthening cross-border police cooperation with regard to meetings attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, at which policing is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences, which has my full backing.
I especially welcome the idea of adding an unanticipated event attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State to the list submitted to the Council Presidency during the previous year.
A consequence of the free movement of persons is that the EU must think about judicial cooperation in criminal matters, so that an area of freedom, security and justice can be created.
Â Â  . Good preparation is of vital importance in preventing or containing disasters.
It is for that reason that I support the report aimed at making cross-border assistance as effective as possible.
Combating crime and protecting law and order falls essentially within the competence of the Member States.
This proposal is solely aimed at improving cooperation between the different Member States in this area by establishing a uniform, transparent and effective framework for the exchange of information.
It is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State.
Every year, before 31 January, the Council is to produce a review of international assistance provided during the previous calendar year.
The review will comprise an overview of the international events that have taken place, an overview of the assistance provided and received and an overview of the main difficulties observed by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties could be resolved.
This will ensure that national police forces work in the most effective way possible.
Â Â  There can be no doubt that the only effective way of combating organised crime and crime tourism is by strengthening cross-border police cooperation.
In this connection, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, in particular, seems to have proved itself in everyday policing.
Indeed, owing to its speed, many alerts are now being sent only via the SIS and no longer via Interpol.
On the other hand, we now have a juxtaposition of multiple forms of police cooperation: Schengen, Europol, Eurodac, CIS, many forms of bilateral cooperation and now the PrÃŒm Convention, too.
This gives rise to the question as to whether we may now be seeing some unnecessary overlaps here, and also whether we may be starting to lose sight of the overall picture.
In any case, we must also ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the protection of personal data.
Â Â  â New measures to strike at the grassroots struggle at national and European level are proposed in the report on the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation at international EU events.
It insultingly provides for a 'calendar of international events' to be held every year in order to programme and organise cooperation between the repressive mechanisms of the ÎU used to combat grassroots movements.
Thus preventive repression is being promoted within the framework of the more general imperialist doctrine of preventive war at home and abroad, in the objective of 'protecting' summits and all kinds of international meetings of imperialist organisations from the enemy the people.
The people of Europe have first-hand knowledge of the murderous action of the EU's repressive mechanisms in Gothenburg, in Genoa and in other countries.
Every day they have to deal with restrictions on their most fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Greek Communist Party voted against the report.
It will help to develop a movement of resistance from the working-class and grassroots movement at national and European level to defend grassroots freedoms.
Defiance, disobedience and the abolition in practice of the decisions of the ÎU and governments abolishing vested democratic rights are the right and obligation of the peoples.
Â Â  . I will be voting for this report, but the whole fate of inland waterway vessels in the UK is currently under threat.
The UK has a derogation from the Energy Products Directive which allows the country's recreational boat owners to fill up their vessels with red diesel, taxed at 6.44 pence per litre.
This derogation is due to expire on 31 December 2006, and in a Communication from the Commission to the Council on 30 June 2006, the Commission indicated it did not believe an extension to this derogation to be justified.
The benefits of ending this derogation are unclear.
As leisure boaters' red diesel usage makes up less than 0.05% of the country's diesel consumption, the environmental benefits are essentially negligible.
There is no evidence to suggest that the UK derogation affects or skews the internal European market.
Loss of the derogation will put a hobby and an industry at great risk.
A survey by the Royal Yachting Association reveals that 54% of boaters 'would or may' be forced to give up boating due to the sudden price rise.
The knock-on effects could seriously damage the 30 000 people employed in the boat industry, the 70 000 people whose jobs are supported by marine tourism and the GBP 700 million spent by boaters every year.
The UK requires a final five-year extension to address these issues.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation.
This regulation provides for a range of technical provisions that will have a far-reaching impact on safety, which in general terms is to be welcomed.
Some regulations on emissions, flight time limitations and administration are inadequate, however, and should be viewed in the broader context.
Any moves towards further taxation on fuel or services would limit free competition among new airlines and airports.
It should be remembered that in addition to improving safety and the quality of services, we must also ensure that entrepreneurship is facilitated, that bureaucracy is stripped away and that the cost of air transport is cut.
Mobility is one of the prerequisites of economic growth and the rising cost of air transport would put us at a competitive disadvantage in the global market.
Â Â  . The majority in Parliament has rejected the amendments that we tabled, which were aimed at protecting workersâ rights and guaranteeing passenger safety.
These amendments were as follows:
- No provision in the present regulation can be used or invoked, within the framework of relations between the Member States, to undermine the rights, and the salaries, working conditions, qualifications and training of the various strata of civil aviation personnel;
- a reduction in the flight duty period â a maximum of 160 hours in a period of 28 consecutive days, distributed as evenly as possible throughout this period and a maximum of 40 hours in a seven-day period, with two rest days â so that the flight and cabin crew are able to guarantee safety.
- certification of qualified cabin crew, with an appropriate, valid licence that is accepted by the relevant authority, which certifies that the person concerned has the appropriate qualifications and skills to carry out the duties allocated to them.
We deeply regret this.
Â Â  . I vote in favour of compromise Amendment 1.
As Mr Stockmann has done such a splendid job as rapporteur, I shall be voting in favour of compromise Amendment 1.
I take this amendment to be, among other things, an indication of the very particular need on the part of all parties for safety in the air.
The new rules on flying times and rest periods is a milestone in terms of air safety and guarantees a marked enhancement of the safety not only of passengers but also of the crew.
It is not only the passengers, but also the whole crew, who stand to benefit from the establishment of uniform standards in all European countries, which will make it possible, even though the number of people who travel by air is constantly increasing, for the same safety standards to apply wherever they do so.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, which has been on the table for six years.
One of the main points to be considered is to ensure that pilot fatigue does not endanger flight safety.
Given the increased frequency of flights and the huge number of passengers flying nowadays, harmonisation of safety standards at the highest, scientifically supported safety level is imperative, in order to create a level playing field within the enlarged EU.
When dealing with this type of legislation, we have to be mindful of its impact upon pilot fatigue.
On that basis, I support a medical and scientific evaluation of the impact of such a law two years after this legislation comes into force.
I believe that this report clearly stipulates that this regulation can in no way constitute a legal basis to watering down existing safety protection in Member States.
It is important, in view of safety, that the Commission carries out an assessment of the impact of the regulation on rosters and operating models and, in the event that they are adversely affected, the Commission should carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations.
Â Â  Even though the nuclear industry has spent five decades looking for solutions to radioactive waste, we are, in this respect, still at square one.
Nuclear waste is transported the length and breadth of Europe in convoys that cost the taxpayer millions, entail a high risk of accidents, and are an ideal target for terrorist attacks.
Risk-free storage over a period of millennia is an impossibility and the idea of it takes the argument about clean and cheap electricity from nuclear power to absurd lengths.
All we would be doing would be to burden future generations with the potential dangers from these ticking time-bombs.
Our scientists have not, as yet, even succeeded in agreeing among themselves as to what geological conditions are best suited to disposal, and so, for example, we see the desperate attempts at preventing radionuclides from escaping from the former Asse II salt mine in Germany, which are costing over EURÂ 120 million.
Over the coming years, the taxpayer will be required to invest some EURÂ 500 billion in the decommissioning of currently operational reactors in Europe; even if the atomic energy industry were to be obliged to bear the costs of storage itself instead of being able to shuffle them off onto the public purse, electricity generated by nuclear power would still be at least 20% more expensive and hence unprofitable.
It really is high time that the billions in subsidy that keep this nuclear extravaganza afloat were cut off.
Â Â  . Firstly, I wish to express my support for the efforts of the Community to strengthen the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste within the EU.
Without a doubt, should it be our priority to ensure that our people are protected against the dangerous affects of nuclear waste.
However, I decided to abstain from the vote because the proposed Council directive does not take into account the dangerous effects of shipments and reprocessing of radioactive waste on nuclear-free Member States like Ireland.
The proposed directive focuses only on Member States who are active participants in the production of nuclear energy.
The interests of passive bystanders like Ireland, a country which chose to remain nuclear-free and is not a transit state, are not covered by the proposal.
As a nuclear-free country, Ireland is affected by the waste coming from continental Europe to be reprocessed at Britainâs Sellafield plant.
The waste is shipped through the Irish Sea, thus making it the most radioactive body of water in the world.
Irelandâs unique position is not included in the proposal for a directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste.
Â Â  . I welcome the fact that Parliament has voted to adopt two proposals in the report, the first aimed at promoting a socially inclusive, knowledge-based society by supporting free, open-source software, and the second highlighting the fact that improved research and innovation policies must contribute to new employment opportunities through sustainable development.
I wish to point out that these were proposals that were put forward by our group and to which we put our name during the debate in the relevant committee.
We also welcome the focus on lifelong learning and the role of universities in creating and disseminating knowledge, and the attention paid to SMEs.
There are some less welcome points, however, such as intellectual property issues, the report's promotion of entrepreneurship from the early stages of education and the fact that the whole position is broadly based on competitiveness.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  . The March 2000 Lisbon European Council set the objective of the EU becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010.
In 2006, it is a long way from achieving this objective.
I agree with the rapporteurâs proposal for Europe to enhance its performance via the creation, sharing and financing of knowledge.
I should like to highlight the current lack of investment in R[amp]D, the lack of promotion of entrepreneurship with the emphasis on innovation and the lack of political and financial support for lifelong learning and ICT training.
Secondly, Europe is not sharing its knowledge.
Major obstacles continue to prevent agents in the sector from working together both within and outside national borders.
Lastly, Europe is not financing knowledge.
In this context, Community policy should strengthen programmes such as the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Programme) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro- to Medium-sized Enterprises) financial instruments.
Â Â  . The Lisbon Agenda 2000 resolved to make Europe the worldâs most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy within ten years.
However, the EU still continues to lag behind the US and Japan.
I welcome this report, which attempts to improve the EUâs performance in three main areas.
Firstly, through financing and encouraging the creation of new knowledge: this will be facilitated through promoting the spirit of entrepreneurship, providing lifelong learning and ICT training and improving the image of scientific research as a rewarding career path.
Secondly, Europe is failing to share its knowledge.
Human resources must be used in an efficient way and improving partnerships must remain at the forefront of European R[amp]D policy-making. Resources must now be focused upon ensuring that the brightest minds are provided with adequate cross-border capital and human resources.
Furthermore, organisations who continue to treat women as inferior workers should be named and shamed.
Thirdly, Europe is failing to finance knowledge.
It is essential that a large proportion of EU budget resources for financial instruments are aimed at enhancing SME finance and tackling market failures.
Europe must now recognise its faults so that it can fulfil the aims of the Lisbon Agenda.
Â Â  . Although this is an own-initiative report without legislative impact, the points and concerns that it raises are worthy of my support.
The idea that research and innovation should play a central role in the new economic model currently lacking in Europe strikes me as crucial.
One must admit, however, that there is a huge gap between the Lisbon goals and reality.
Europe has failed to respond adequately to the evidence that technology and investment in material and human resources in the area of research and innovation are vital components in development and growth, particularly given the current state of affairs in the world economy.
This point, which is expressed in the resolution before us, along with a number of other proposals â for example on redefining research and innovation strategies â justifies my vote in favour.
Words must now be transformed into action.
There will not be a Europe of results without a Europe of investment.
Â Â  . I voted in favour because I feel that the innovation and research sectors are vital components in creating more and better jobs in the EU.
The SMEs play a key role in this context in that they act as a conduit between the universities and the business sector.
The main factors standing in the way of meeting the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy are well known: poor performance by the Member States, fragmentation of the labour markets, inefficient, inadequate use of human resources and reduced mobility of Europeâs workforce.
Accordingly, I regret the fact that the Member States are not lending the necessary political and financial support to the creation of a flexible workforce capable of adapting to the new realities of the labour markets, and that they do not accord their researchers the prestige they deserve.
I am therefore in favour of putting an end to administrative and legal barriers in the way of greater mobility for researchers, and of creating better working conditions, that is to say, an attractive, prestigious âsingle marketâ for researchers in order to stem the European brain drain.
I am also in favour of promoting entrepreneurship from the early stages of education, strengthening lifelong learning and actively encouraging the training of workers and the unemployed in new technologies.
Â Â  . This report contains a number of contradictions.
On the one hand, it gives prominence to negative aspects, including the emphasis on issues of competitiveness and competition, and on measures aimed at industrial restructuring and modernisation, in the face of âfierce international competitionâ, the impact of which we know is terrible.
It also, on the other hand, contains proposals that we tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, including the proposal to call on the Commission to refuse Community aid to companies which, after receiving such support in a Member State, transfer their manufacturing operations to another country without completely fulfilling the agreements entered into with the Member State concerned.
I should also like to highlight the inclusion of the proposal to accord the same weight to the working environment and the health and safety of workers as to ensuring the creation of more and better jobs, and the call for the rights of workers to be protected when manufacturing companies are restructured and hence for the availability of information to be fully guaranteed, for workersâ representative bodies.
Hence our decision to abstain.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because I agree that a dynamic and highly competitive industrial sector is a vital prerequisite to improving social standards.
The Commissionâs communication gives a detailed overview of the 27 manufacturing sectors and, with sensitivity, combines a range of sectoral actions with cross-sectoral policy initiatives.
Like the rapporteur, I am in favour of developing a coherent, European-level industrial policy that will enable us to meet the challenges of globalisation head on.
Although the EU is an economy essentially based on the services sector, it remains an industrial power on the world stage.
It therefore makes perfect sense to develop European-level industrial competitiveness strategies, and to promote European entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility.
I am convinced that the future of European manufacturing lies in increasing the added value and the quality of products, and in a qualified, flexible workforce.
I also welcome this report as it highlights the importance of increasing the regional concentration of manufacturing.
I support close collaboration between regional and national authorities and the economic and social players to draw up local strategy plans targeted at making the best possible use of the primary wealth producing sector and any comparative benefits offered by each region.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not a point of order, I just wanted to thank our colleagues who signed Written Declaration No 21.
My thanks also go to my colleague Mr Braghetto for his solidarity.
We tabled the declaration together.
The European Parliament has today once again proved its sensitivity to cultural matters, because the cultural and religious heritage of Cyprus is not strictly speaking a Cypriot matter â it is a European matter.
The European Union embraces all the cultures of all the Member States of the Union.
Â Â  The next item is the interim report (A6-0213/2006) by Mr Fava, on behalf of the Temporary Committee, on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners [2006/2027(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament constantly has to tackle a high-minded and difficult task: making its personal contribution to combating terror.
As you know, on Saturday, alongside our British friends, we will be commemorating the fifty people who died in last yearâs bomb attacks in London.
We have another equally difficult task: investigating the truth, including the truth about the abuses committed over the past few years in the name of the fight against terrorism.
This is the raison dâÃªtre of our committee: the truth about the rights denied those accused of being our enemies, but who, as human beings who stand accused, are entitled to representation by a lawyer, to a trial, a judge and dignified and humane treatment.
Mr President, where there are no rights there are no laws â merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts.
When we talk of extraordinary rendition, which is the theme on which our committee has focused, we are talking about an arbitrary act that certain countries want and others accept in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Extraordinary rendition refers to the extraordinary transport of terrorist suspects captured by the CIA and sent to complaisant countries that are willing to interrogate them using any methods at their disposal and to hold them without trial.
In recent years, Mr President, rendition has been a fact and not an opinion or a conjecture.
It is a fact that has even been admitted by the US State Department, a practice that has been used and abused, even to the detriment of European citizens.
We are reserving the work conclusions reached in the past few months, and those that we hope to reach over the next few months, for the concluding report; but it is now our duty to inform you of a vast and general range of offences, involving various European countries and different levels of responsibility: some have been complicit, some have covered up the illegal operations and some have simply looked the other way.
A few hours ago, news arrived from Italy that the Milan investigating judge has signed a protective custody warrant against the deputy director of the Sismi, the Italian military security service, for acting as an accomplice in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Milan imam who was kidnapped, in whose case another twenty-two preventative custody warrants have been issued against CIA agents.
And here I must impress upon you the seriousness of the fact that the director of the Sismi, General Pollari, appeared before our committee to assert that his agency had never received any information regarding this abduction.
Let us note the fact that the deputy director was arrested because he was considered to be responsible for this abduction.
Mr President, we are not a court of justice; because of this event, however, we have an additional responsibility at the political and institutional levels, as do governments and Member States, to which we appeal because the burden of proof â precisely because we are not a court of justice â is a burden that must be shared with the governments, whose full collaboration and commitment to absolute truth we will need in the months to come.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to make every effort to discover the plain truth on the facts and responsibilities, to ensure above all that these events and abuses are never repeated on European territory or to the detriment of European citizens, and I believe that this is the ultimate aim of our committee.
Thanks to the work of our assistants â the committee staff, whom I would like to thank â we have reconstructed in detail a complex system of aircraft and fictitious companies used by the CIA for its assignments in recent years; we have minutely reconstructed the routes of over one thousand flights, which we have made available to our fellow Members of Parliament.
We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or officials, but not all of them were: Abu Omar, Maher Arar, Khaled el-Masri, Mohamed Algiza and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prisons.
These flights have landed in our airports, used our skies and taken advantage of our silence with impunity and in only one case out of 1Â 084 flights has a police officer claimed to be able to identify crews and passengers.
Mr President, we have provided the victims of scandalous errors of justice with a voice and the right to speak, as we have those who have enabled this committee to do its work.
We now have a difficult task before us, for which we ask Parliament to authorise us to continue our work until the end of our mandate, in the knowledge that the truth that we will have obtained and consolidated by the end of it will constitute a body of work to be placed at the disposal of all European countries and, of course, of this Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Council has been asked for an opinion on this matter, I am happy to take part in this debate on its behalf.
Right at the start, I would like to say that the subject of this interim report is an extremely important one, and I consider that the initiative taken regarding this issue by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and its Parliamentary Assembly is very important and significant.
The issue is the implementation of fundamental rights in Europe and action against terrorism.
These must not be allowed to come into conflict with one another.
All action taken against terrorism must be in compliance with obligations under international law, and no compromises on these, where it concerns human rights, refugee or humanitarian issues, can be accepted in the name of action against terrorism.
With reference to the interim report under discussion, I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the Treaties do not bestow competence on the European Union in such matters as these, and national intelligence is not within the scope of application of the Treaty, because the Member States have unanimously decided to reserve the task of monitoring the work of national intelligence services for themselves.
This obviously does not mean that the Council has adopted a passive stance regarding the matters raised in the report.
Since last November it has been suspected publicly that the US Central Intelligence Agency was using flights to transport prisoners and illegal detention facilities in Europe.
On 21Â November the European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed this information at a session of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council.
As a result of this discussion, on 29Â November 2005, the Foreign Affairs Minister for the country to hold the Presidency at the time, Jack Straw, wrote to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the European Unionâs behalf, trying to discover the US Governmentâs views regarding these allegations.
On 5Â December the US Secretary of State made a detailed statement on the matter, prior to her European visit, according to which the United States considered that international agreements were binding on its own actions and that the United States respected other countriesâ sovereignty and that it did not transport detained persons to countries where they would be tortured, under interrogation or otherwise.
The European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers and Secretary of State Rice discussed the matter again later on during the latterâs visit to Brussels.
Since early this year there has been intensive dialogue with the United States at various levels and in different assemblies regarding these matters.
Human rights have been discussed on many an occasion with the United States.
There have also been discussions on the need for compliance with international law in the fight against terrorism.
This was most recently on the agenda at the US-EU Summit in Vienna on 21Â June.
The European Union has repeatedly asked the US Government to allow United Nations human rights reporters full access to Guantanamo Bay.
EU Foreign Affairs Ministers have stated that the European Union is still seriously concerned about Guantanamo Bay, and the topic has been discussed with the United States on more than one occasion.
It is the opinion of the EU that the US Government should take steps to close Guantanamo down as soon as possible.
Accordingly, the Union welcomed the remark made by President Bush at the Vienna Summit that he was willing to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.
As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland will naturally continue to keep alive the debate on human rights in dialogue with the United States.
That will be very important during our Presidency.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in London, the fight against terror must certainly remain the main objective of European security strategy and this is a good opportunity to remember it, together with the declaration, which should be loud and clear, that respect for the fundamental human rights of every human being is the other factor that should be included in European security strategy.
It is obvious that, when we erode guarantees of freedom and peopleâs fundamental rights, we involuntarily risk providing a propaganda target for the very terrorists that we are combating.
The search for truth is therefore necessary, and, I have to say, it involves a historical truth, a legal truth and a search for liability, and naturally the Commission has made and will continue to make a heartfelt contribution to it.
From the very beginning, the European Commission has made its contribution with conviction, a fact that I believe the committee chairman, MrÂ Coelho, can corroborate.
It assisted and vigorously supported the request from the temporary committee to obtain the Eurocontrol data, which, as emerges from the report, have provided some of the most important evidence for identifying certain facts.
I also strongly supported requests from the temporary Parliamentary committee for access to European Agency satellite photos.
Together with colleagues from the Council, we worked to ensure that the request was dealt with rapidly and I think that this was a useful contribution to the first phase of the temporary committeeâs work.
Furthermore, I have tried three times to impress on the Ministers of Home Affairs in the Member States the importance of collaborating with the European Parliament temporary committee and with the Council of Europe, in other words of ensuring that enquiries and national checks make progress in countries where this has not yet happened.
I can tell you in advance that at the next Council of Ministers on 24Â July, the first to be held under the Finnish Presidency, I will repeat my invitation to the Ministers of Home Affairs in the 25 Member States to continue to collaborate with the temporary Parliamentary committee.
I acknowledge and agree that the European Parliament temporary committee does not claim to be a sort of âEuropean super-courtâ and this is a very important factor in identifying institutional responsibilities.
However, I maintain that the items indicated in the report are useful tools that must be assessed in detail.
Some elements have already been assessed because they were already available to the many national judicial authorities involved in enquiries, some of them highly detailed, that started a long time ago.
I think that now, in the light of the data contained in this report, national authorities can and must proceed to such checks with greater conviction, including in cases in which they have not yet been carried out; that they must do so with full guarantees of due process, which are in fact the guarantees of the rule of law, full rights for victims, to whom you too have listened to some extent, and for those accused, and to provide proof of the events, until a judgment determines when and if there is liability for specific events.
This is the result that, I am sure, we all hope for: to find out at last the full and satisfactory truth on these charges.
I think that it is important that we await the decisions to be taken by judges in the Member States with confidence.
I would like to express a final thought on future prospects, which seem to me to be just as interesting.
I want to reflect on the reform of the so-called secret services, a reform that comes under national competences, but which I think could benefit from broader debate.
We could, for example, reflect on whether the rules of transparency, in terms of relations with Parliamentâs bodies, can be improved at national level; whether the coordination of the activity of the services in each Member State should, as I believe it should, provide for more direct responsibility on the part of the heads of government of the respective countries; whether there should be some sort of national parliamentary control over the financial resources of the secret services â since everyone knows that where there is control of financial resources, one can have a significant effect on operating activity.
Finally I quote the reference in the report to the need to define new rules on non-commercial aviation, including by civil aircraft, with a definition of âState aircraftâ or âused for State businessâ.
I can tell you now that, in this respect, the Commission is ready to discuss this with the temporary committee in the next work period, since finding a European definition, for example for âState aircraftâ, could be a step forward in this area, which, as you know, is currently insufficiently covered by national legislation.
I therefore confirm my commitment to collaborating with the chairman and the members of the temporary committee.
Thank you.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had hoped that MrÂ Fava would not mention todayâs news from Italy, but, seeing that he has, in my capacity as an Italian Member of this Parliament, and not as the coordinator of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that today Osama Bin Laden must be laughing his head off because, in my country, instead of arresting terrorists, they concentrate on arresting their captors.
As regards the report, I believe, Mr President, that it is not sufficient for the rapporteur to say that he can accept some of our amendments.
It is a highly tendentious report, which takes into consideration only those points of view critical of the United States.
Two examples: until now they have refused to insert two statements by MrÂ Solana and MrÂ deÂ Vries because they both said things that were not to the liking of the committee and that were not satisfactory to the Left; they declared that they had no knowledge of any breach of the law by European Member States in their cooperation with the CIA.
Now, as a great concession, it appears that they are ready to accept it.
However, they refuse to accept another statement because it goes against the so-called truth that the committee is trying to impose on us; that is the statement made by an expert from Human Rights Watch which as we know, is definitely not an organisation that is in favour of the Bush Administration to our committee: âwe have our suspicions, but no proof.â
We all know that the Americans have made mistakes, for which they must be criticised or even condemned, but they have made mistakes because they are doing something.
I would have been pleased to see in this report recognition of the fact that, if today we are meeting to discuss the CIA problem, it is thanks to the US press, the US Congress and the US people and not thanks to the report writers.
There is no trace of this in the report.
For all these reasons, we remain extremely critical, not to mention disappointed, in this report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with the warmest congratulations to our rapporteur MrÂ Fava on his excellent interim report, and the reason why I call it that is that we are less than halfway through our work.
Let me emphasise and clarify at this point that nobody in our group is against the idea that we should join together in fighting international terrorism.
Quite the contrary: but we do take the view that we can no longer do this using the same weapons as the terrorists, but only by lawful means and in accordance with the ethical and moral principles on which our community of values, the European Union, is founded, on which we insist wherever we go in the world and in which we can also take pride.
It is surely not acceptable that people should be abducted from EU territory or from states that are desirous of joining our Community, flown halfway round the globe and tortured in prisons in such places as Kabul, which has been shown to be what happened to Khaled El-Masri, himself a German citizen.
The fact is that this is where the end does not justify the means, and that is what must come between us and the approach adopted by the Bush administration and the CIA.
When we express criticism of such goings-on, that has nothing â nothing whatever â to do with anti-Americanism; on the contrary, it is our duty to do so.
We also find ourselves facing the question that the governments in the EU must answer, namely that as to precisely what a secret service â which is what the CIA is, albeit one from a friendly state â is permitted to do on our soil, and in what manner it may act.
After all, this is not something to which the country of origin principle can apply.
The Member States of the EU, and also the countries that seek to become such must also make it clear that action may be taken against a person suspected of terrorism only by way of proceedings in accordance with the rule of law.
How else, then, do the EU Member States think they can cooperate with such institutions as the European Parliament and the Council of Europe?
This is a question that the government of FYROM in Skopje has to face up to as well, for we really do not take kindly to being lied to.
