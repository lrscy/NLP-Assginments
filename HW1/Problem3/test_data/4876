Compared with those predicted for the Member States' public budgets, this rate of increase is lower than the average.
I want above all to emphasise that the preliminary draft Budget is, with EUR 4.7 billion, below the amount that the Agenda 2000 financial perspective fixed as a maximum.
I also see it as good news that a preliminary draft Budget, despite the many new demands that are made on it, can be set out in such a way that there remains a large margin for unforeseen eventualities, and that this can also be captured within the financial perspective.
The Budget amounts to 1.03% as a proportion of gross domestic income, which means that the share of European GDP attributable to public expenditure for next year is 1.03%.
That is very small - less, indeed, than in previous years.
The reason I lay such emphasis on this is that it demonstrates that Budget discipline is taken very seriously even at European level.
I also emphasise it because it is often said in public discussions that, okay, there will be these developments and those developments, and they will exceed what is budgeted for.
On the contrary, that is not the case; rather, we again have a preliminary draft Budget below what was laid down as an upper limit in the financial perspective.
Above all, we should also make clear what will be financed within the European Budget with this share of GDP attributable to public expenditure that amounts to just over one per cent of the EU's economic performance, and which policy areas will benefit from this money from the taxpayer.
Let us take agriculture first, which continues to be the most significant area.
If we add all the agricultural policy outgoings together, they amount to a total of EUR 48.7 billion allocated to this area.
This figure includes, for example, aid for the candidate countries, that is, for the farmers in the candidate countries, and also the staff in the Directorate-General which has responsibility for this area.
To put it another way, if we express it as a percentage of the EU's gross national income, just about 0.5% of the EU's gross national income is to be spent on agriculture via the European Budget.
The illustration I have just given with reference to agriculture corresponds to the new approach to breaking down the Budget by policy areas.
In the past it was very often the case that the public had difficulty reading the Budget - if they had any access to it at all - because it listed only the Budget lines, but not the legal bases, which one might term the policy content, what was to be achieved with the money.
With the new Budget breakdown, that has now been done, and it is clear at a glance how much is to be used and for which policy areas.
To quote a few more figures before I move on to something else, EUR 21.8 billion have been allocated to regional policy, EUR 940 million to fisheries policy, EUR 3.2 billion for external relations, EUR 1.1 billion to development policy, EUR 9.8 billion for employment and social affairs, and EUR 1 billion solely for promoting the information society.
Such a breakdown is in fact capable of expressing much more than would be possible through a breakdown of figures only by reference to categories in the financial perspective.
All the same, I propose now to enlarge on these categories.
I have already referred to agriculture, in which area there is, according to the Commission proposal, a margin of EUR 2.3 billion, meaning that the Commission's preliminary draft remains EUR 2.3 billion under the maximum set for agriculture in the financial perspective.
This positive outcome results from a combination of several factors: firstly the prognosis of relatively favourable market developments in agriculture, then a situation in which stocks are relatively low, and an underlying euro/dollar exchange rate of EUR 1 to USD 0.88.
At this point, I must observe that this is not the Commission's prediction for the future development of the euro/dollar exchange rate, but regulations state that, when drawing up the preliminary draft Budget, we have to base our calculations on the average over the preceding months.
However, I will point out that, in the event of the euro/dollar exchange rate changing, or, to put it another way, the euro rising, expenditure in the agricultural sector will also rise.
That does not, though, represent a risk to the Budget, as the large margin will remain and will be able to take it up.
In June, the Commission will be presenting its so-called mid-term-Review of agriculture.
My fellow-Commissioner Fischler will then present an overview estimating how agricultural expenditure will develop in the future, and proposals for reforms.
These will not, however, have any direct effect on the 2003 Budget year.
I would like to observe that our agricultural policy will have different rates of increase.
Firstly, that used for rural development is, as in previous years, and in accordance with the Commission proposal, to be the whole amount provided for in the financial perspective; this instrument will play a very major role in the future and it is certain to receive special attention in the mid-term review of agricultural reform, as incentives need to be used to promote alternative economic opportunities in rural areas.
Above all, this category includes environmental measures of relevance to agricultural policy and this makes it highly significant in terms of sustainable agricultural development.
Still on market measures and direct aids for agricultural policy, I would like to point out that 2003 will be the first year in which the new organisation of the agricultural markets in goats and sheep will apply.
This gives us a slight increase in this area, because, according to the resolutions adopted so far, for example, a premium of EUR 21 per head per annum is paid for sheep.
This is an increase over the previous year.
I now turn to structural policy, where the commitment appropriations for structural measures are in line with the current financial perspective, although here the Budget ceiling is exceeded to a negligible degree, as the Commission, adhering to the resolutions passed by Parliament and the Council, is looking to present the second tranche, of EUR 27 million, for the special measures to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal.
The Commission proposes that this should be funded out of the flexibility reserve, and I believe this is in accord with the arrangement reached as part of last year's resolutions.
Over the past two years, estimating the payment appropriations required for the structural policy as a whole was made very difficult by the programmes' start-up phase, so that there was under-utilisation in these areas in 2000 and 2001.
Some of the resources were able to be transferred to other programmes.
It is due to this delay in implementation that we now have, of course, a sharp increase in the payment appropriations we must reckon with, and the Commission's preliminary draft Budget envisages a 4.4% increase in the structural policy's payment appropriations.
It is to be noted that a major part of this is intended to pay the balance for the old programmes carried out by the Member States between 1994 and 1999.
Delays occurred in all the Member States, with consequent delays to the final payments, but we hope that all of these can be dealt with in 2003.
I would now like to turn to category 3, the internal policy measures, which are indeed wide-ranging.
It is proposed that funds amounting to EUR 6.7 billion be allocated, leaving a reserve of EUR 81 million, which is sure to be called on in the course of the discussions on the Budget.
Let me also point out that a very large number of new measures have been adopted.
Your House has just had a debate on the new Sixth Framework Programme; I am glad that a decision can now be taken on it and that, as I have just heard, the Framework Programme can be voted on tomorrow.
It is endowed with an overall EUR 17.5 billion up to 2006.
That this is a very large amount of money should be reiterated, as the accusation is frequently levelled that the European Budget, with its particular focus on agricultural policy, would never promote new developments.
I believe that the Framework Programme demonstrates that the opposite is the case, in that a truly massive amount is being invested in joint promotion of research, and preparations for the programme's implementation can be set in train as soon as the decision is taken.
The preliminary draft of the Budget already allocates over EUR 4 billion to this research programme for next year.
I would like to quote, as another example of new measures, the transport sector, in which it is envisaged that EUR 53 million will be spent on maintaining safety measures, so that 2003 will be marked by the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Agency for Safe Seas.
This is something else that the public can expect of the European Union - action being taken to prevent accidents of the sort we have experienced in the past, and to ensure, moreover, that the steps that are taken are effective without delay.
That will be another of the tasks for the Agency for Safe Seas.
Resources for the new so-called Marco Polo programme have also to be incorporated.
These are Community financial aid to improve the impact on the environment of freight transport networks.
As one final example of category 3, I will point out that measures for a rational energy policy, in the form of the promotion of innovative sources of energy, show, with almost 50%, the greatest increase.
I believe this is another example of how the priority given to the promotion of sustainable development results in corresponding approaches to funding.
I would now like to discuss the area of external policy, that is, category 4, where commitment appropriations totalling EUR 4.9 billion are envisaged, representing an increase of 2.3% over the current Budget year.
In its draft, the Commission is standing by its priorities and the foreign policy commitments we have made.
Let me mention the Balkans, to which, for next year, we are allocating EUR 685 million.
Aid for Afghanistan is also in accordance with commitments which the Commission made on behalf of the European Union in December 2001 in Tokyo.
Funds for this have also been budgeted for, although it will of course be necessary to exert proper financial control on all these resources.
I would like, furthermore, to emphasise that an increase of 4.2% is planned in the financing of the Mediterranean programme, which includes pre-accession aid for Turkey, Malta and Cyprus, but also new resources for the commitment made as part of the Barcelona process to make available additional resources from the European Investment Bank, constituting the provision of a special facility.
The Commission proposes to set aside EUR 25 million for this purpose, for example, to give financial support to a risk capital programme.
One external affairs policy focus for the Commission is the combating of serious infectious diseases in many parts of the world.
In consequence, the appropriations for health measures in 2003, have, on the Commission's proposal, had around EUR 55 million added to them, EUR 35 million of which is an additional contribution to the Global Health Fund.
Still in the external policy field, I would like above all to mention that the Commission proposes to allocate EUR 40 million to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, EUR 20 million of which would be set aside for the joint European peace mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
This makes it clear that this new type of activity under the Common Foreign and Security Policy is funded out of the operational part of the Community Budget.
Let me, in conclusion, turn to the administrative costs, where the appropriations come up against something of a peculiar situation.
On the one hand, there is here a very large increase in pensions payments, but, on the other, we made no provision in the financial perspective for the European Community institutions - both Parliament and the Commission, the European Court of Justice and the Council - to have to take preparatory steps in the run-up to enlargement.
It is for this reason that the Commission's preliminary draft Budget exceeds the upper limit only in respect of these preparatory measures.
The Commission proposes that the resources needed for this should be made available from the flexibility instrument.
For myself, I am sure that this will be one of the main points to be covered in discussion, including with the Council, which has held out the prospect of an increase of 11% for its staff appropriations.
That is not the increase for which the Commission is planning, but I do believe that it is this very area that we have to debate together, in very definite terms, how to go about the preparatory measures that are necessary if enlargement is to be a success for the institutions as well.
I take it as read that this will be a keynote in the debates, as much of course as the issue of how to fund any new requirements in the area of foreign policy, such as - and I will give just two examples - Palestine and Cyprus.
I hope that the conciliation meeting in July will enable us to find a common outlook.
The Commission was unanimous in deciding on the preliminary draft Budget after a very matter-of-fact discussion, and the unanimity was due, among other things, to the preliminary draft Budget again being so well prepared by the Directorate-General and above all by its Director-General, Mr Mingasson.
As it is, so to speak, the last draft prepared by him in his capacity as Director-General of the Budget Directorate-General, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him warmly for the work he has done.
I am delighted by this burst of applause for Mr Mingasson.
Thank you very much!
Our discussion of the priorities has shown that Parliament's and the Commission's are very largely the same after all, something that is also shown in the preliminary draft Budget.
I believe it to be a successful draft that looks to fund new requirements and is, at the same time, guided by budgetary discipline.
I look forward, of course, to the debates, and am highly optimistic that we will be able to achieve a good outcome this year as well.
(Applause)
.
(SV) Mr President, allow me to begin by submitting apologies from the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, who was prevented from being here. He has asked me to speak on his behalf too.
We both wish to express our thanks to Commissioner Schreyer and Director-General Gazon for their excellent cooperation.
I believe that we shall benefit greatly from the spirit of cooperation we have enjoyed during the year, for there are a number of problems which need to be solved.
That is only an initial discussion of the preliminary draft budget.
We shall be returning to the subject more than once, for example during the July part-session and on a number of occasions this autumn.
It is nonetheless important to make some introductory observations.
First of all, there are a number of positive features I think there is good reason for looking at.
The first, concerning the draft budget for the year, is the improvement of the process itself.
We are now finally on the way towards a system of activity-based budgeting and thus also towards a more lucid and transparent system that will make it easier to present the EU budget to people in Europe, something which I think is incredibly important if people are to have confidence in the European Union.
We are now taking the first step by using the old technique and the new ADB technique in parallel, something which constitutes major progress.
The second positive feature is that we have succeeded in achieving a better political dialogue.
Through the Commission's annual political strategy and through the fact that the Council and Parliament decide upon the political guidelines for next year's budget at approximately the same time, we have brought about a political exchange, or dialogue, at an earlier stage.
That is, in fact, progress.
Certainly, there was a great deal of criticism in Parliament of the lack of factual content in the Commission's annual political strategy, but I nonetheless believe that the method as such constitutes clear progress.
I also hope that we shall be able to renew Parliament's own budget debate by holding a wider debate in July in which we do not only focus upon next year's budget but also upon the implementation of the current year's budget, as well as linking the processes together, which is something I believe is very important for the future.
I also want us to be able to have a proper and exciting budget debate this autumn, hopefully during the September part-session, in which we can also make a better link between the budget and the political initiatives in terms of legislation.
So much for the procedure itself, which represents a positive development.
Another positive aspect is the fact that there is broad agreement as to the basic political priorities.
If the Commission's basic priorities are compared with the guidelines adopted by Parliament, it can be seen that we are agreed on a range of points.
We are agreed that we must now put enlargement first.
Enlargement, which is the most extensive we have ever undertaken, will most probably involve ten countries at the beginning of 2004.
That is our most important task, and we must begin preparing for it as early as in the 2003 Budget.
We are also agreed that we must tackle the issues of security and safety in the broad senses of those words, partly by having a full discussion of how we are to manage security in Europe following the terrorist attacks of last September and partly through adopting a broader perspective on the safety issues - such as food safety and transport safety - on which a range of initiatives need to be taken no later than in next year's budget.
We are also agreed upon a third area, namely the need for increased focus on sustainable development in economic, social and environmental terms, which is something that will require a range of initiatives on the part of the EU.
We have been relatively ineffectual in this area so far, especially when it comes to implementing Parliament's initiatives on the issues of small companies, e-learning and a range of other areas within which I believe we must really step up the pace.
Bearing in mind all those who believe that the EU budget is forever growing out of all proportion, it may also be noted, especially for educational purposes, that we now have a budget whose share of the Member States' economies is decreasing.
Even though a number of basically positive signs can therefore be seen, a number of points should be noted that cause us to feel a certain anxiety.
The first of these, and the one that overshadows everything else, involves the implementation of the budget.
We have a backlog of payments and other backlogs - what are termed reste Ã  liquider or total outstanding commitments - which only increase.
As a reminder, I might mention the debate in the last part-session on supplementary budget number two for 2002 and the fact that the Member States are demanding EUR 10 billion back on the grounds that the EU has not been able to complete its tasks.
In this connection, the Commission proposes a greater increase in payments than in new commitments, something which is naturally a step in the right direction.
We are nonetheless afraid that this measure is quite inadequate for getting to grips with the existing backlogs.
Especially on the issue of the structural funds, from which we have to pay the money sooner or later, we are in danger of accumulating a mountain of unpaid budget items which will create major problems in the years to come, especially if these payments have to be made at the same time as we have major costs in connection with enlargement.
The problem is of crucial importance and it needs to be discussed.
The other problem, which is also worrying and needs to be discussed, is the way in which enlargement is to be dealt with.
Of most concern are the efforts which need to be made within the European institutions in order to prepare for enlargement itself.
The costs of enlargement as such will not of course place a burden upon the 2003 Budget, but we must prepare ourselves right now, especially if ten new countries are to join as early as the beginning of 2004.
In this connection, the Commission proposes that we use the flexibility instrument to defray the increased administrative expenses.
It is possible that we shall be forced to do this, but I believe we must increase the pressure on the Secretary-Generals to produce new, radical proposals, for example concerning increased cooperation between the institutions so as to reduce the costs and thus avoid having recourse to the flexibility instrument.
I believe that there are many new avenues open when it comes, for example, to the language regulations and the recruitment of new staff to the EU.
We should seriously increase the pressure before we decide to use the flexibility instrument.
With regard to the security and safety issues - I earlier mentioned food and transport safety - we are also concerned about the incredible variety of new authorities or 'bodies'.
We have Eurojust, Europol and authorities for food, rail and air safety and so on.
These bodies do not in themselves present any problems, but they create problems in terms of budgeting and the ability to obtain an overview of the EU's costs.
They constitute a risk of our doubling our costs due to work's being carried out in both the Commission and new authorities.
They give rise to problems concerning methods of requiring accountability and maintaining scrutiny.
We must review these aspects in depth before we continue to extend the variety of new authorities, even though the tasks as such are certainly of exceptional importance.
A further point we need to discuss, and which the Commissioner too mentioned, is, naturally, foreign policy, for which the Commission proposes a budget margin of EUR 60 million.
It may sound a lot, but it is actually insufficient.
We are faced with major situations of uncertainty, for example the continued development in the Middle East.
We do not know what demands will be made upon the EU in terms of efforts in Palestine.
We do not know in detail or with any certainty what demands will be made when it comes to Afghanistan or overall efforts at tackling poverty-related illnesses and so on. Nor do we know whether it will be acceptable to reduce our contributions within the CARDS programme in the Balkans at as fast a rate as the Commission is now proposing.
In this area too, I believe we need a more extensive discussion and evaluation of the EU's contributions before we take any decisions.
To all these uncertain factors, we can add the fisheries agreements within category 4 which, for a further year, will constitute an issue that we need to discuss.
In conclusion, I want to say something about the longer term future.
Two of the absolutely most important budget problems we need to discuss certainly do not concern the 2003 Budget, but must nonetheless be addressed.
These are the reform of agricultural and fisheries policy, on the one hand, and the real costs of enlargement, on the other.
We shall later be receiving a special report on the subject from the Committee on Budgets.
Let us begin this discussion in time.
Let us also try to retain the extraordinarily interesting cooperation and the common approach we have in relation to the exciting developments towards enlargement.
I believe there would then in actual fact be high hopes of being able to find common solutions.
The presentation of the preliminary draft budget for the financial year 2003 is closed.
The next item is the report (A5-0117/2002) by Mr Stenmarck, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2003.
. (SV) Mr President, when, some months ago, we set the guidelines for the 2003 Budget, there was a great deal of agreement in Parliament concerning three priorities for category 5.
The first of these concerned preparations for the forthcoming enlargement, the second concerned necessary institutional reforms and the third concerned the need to deal with everything within the framework of the budget.
These are priorities which, for Parliament, must now be translated into figures and calculations in euros and cents.
If, at its summit in Copenhagen in December, the European Council decides in favour of a 'big bang' whereby ten new countries will become members in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004, this will present extraordinarily large demands.
There is no greater challenge for the European Parliament than precisely this.
If such an enlargement is to be possible, it will have to be possible for up to 147 observers to be in place from the beginning of 2003.
With this in view, it is now proposed that EUR 6 million be placed in a reserve.
It is estimated that the enlargement-related costs for 2003 will amount to just over EUR 32 million in total.
By means of a far-sighted policy, Parliament has for a long time been working single-mindedly to make the forthcoming enlargement possible.
It is a task which is now continuing into the 2003 Budget.
There is also a readiness in this Budget to bring certain costs for 2004 forward into the 2003 Budget.
This sum amounts to EUR 51 million.
In total, this means, in other words, a financial investment of EUR 89 million in the course of just a single budget year.
If it is to be possible to cope with all this, enlargement must be given top priority by the European Parliament, and that must also have a visible effect on the budget work.
Parliament's own reform process is of the utmost significance and is priority number two.
I believe that, in common with myself, a good many MEPs have heard remarks over the years along the lines that this is not a proper parliament.
In many ways, that may once have been an accurate observation in the sense that the European Parliament did not have any real legislative power.
Today, Parliament has power of co-decision in ever increasing areas.
It is probably not difficult to predict that there will be a further increase in the use of this power.
If that is to be possible, Parliament must be strengthened in its key functions.
We are talking here, then, about MEPs' ability to exercise the power due to every Parliament in every democracy and relating to the budget, legislation and oversight.
Unless we continue to invest seriously in these functions, there will, in the future too, be many people who maintain that we are not a proper parliament.
For precisely that reason, we must strengthen these areas, develop better follow-up of the budget and increase support for MEPs in the legislative work.
If room for everything - the costs of enlargement and Parliament's necessary reforms - is to be found within the framework of the third priority - that is to say, with ever greater expenses being dealt with within the established budget framework - a strict budget process is required.
In spite of all the commitments entailed in the biggest enlargement in the EU's history, the 2003 Budget will be managed within the 20% framework that has for a long time been Parliament's portion of the common budget.
For next year, we are looking to a 1.6% increase, which has to be compared with an intended increase of, on average, 3.5% for all the EU institutions.
When, a few months ago, we began work on the 2003 Budget, there was a large estimated deficit in category 5.
A few months later, the majority of institutions responded positively to the challenges from Parliament and the Council to focus on the key activities and so reduce its estimates.
When we now look at the Budget figures from other institutions, it appears in actual fact fully possible for us to be able successfully to manage our commitments within applicable frameworks without using any flexibility instrument.
Allow me finally to make a short technical correction.
Paragraph 22 of the resolution quotes a sum of EUR 15.5 million for the buildings reserve.
If it is accurately to reflect today's decision, the amount should be adjusted somewhat so that Parliament remains under the ceiling of EUR 1 051 million.
Mr President, I am pleased to be the first to congratulate our rapporteur on putting together a package for the budget for 2003 for our Parliament.
Many of the items included in his report are ones which we, as a group, can fully support. In particular the provisions concerning enlargement, especially the inclusion of observers and other provisions.
There are, however, three points that still remain of concern to us.
The first relates to an early-retirement scheme, which we would like to see applied in this institution as it is applied in others.
We would like the Council to come forward with the right kind of conclusions so it can be included in the 2003 procedure.
This, along with other reforms, will help to prepare our institution for enlargement.
There are two other items of greater concern which relate to the way in which the administration responds to the demands and consultation of parliamentarians.
The first refers to the Interinstitutional Recruitment Office which we as a Parliament, and indeed as a Committee on Budgets, have been calling for for many months.
We now find ourselves faced with a text but without the means either to amend or discuss it.
We understand that Mr Gargani, as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has sent a letter this morning to the President stating that committee has concerns about legal administrative questions.
My group also shares those concerns and therefore we support what Mr Stenmarck has put in his report, namely that we would like the relevant committee to have a report on this proposed recruitment office before a final decision is taken.
In addition, we understand the Council wishes to amend this document and, therefore, we do not see why we, as parliamentarians, should not also have that right.
Lastly, buildings: my group has discussed the needs of enlargement so far as offices and so on are concerned, and we have put in a request.
No decision has yet been taken in my group as to what buildings we need.
Yet we understand that negotiations are in full swing for the construction of new buildings in Brussels, for which authorisation has been given neither politically nor in relation to the Committee on Budgets, since we have no documents available to us.
This is why I have tabled an amendment, on behalf of my group, which calls for this question to be clarified.
The PodestÃ  report concerns translation and interpretation and there should be a report on buildings to indicate what commitments are needed, unlike in the past when Parliament has been faced with a fait accompli, and then had to sign up for the bill.
In conclusion, on these two items, we would like to see greater sensitivity on the part of the administration and the Bureau towards parliamentarians, because ultimately it is the Assembly that is sovereign.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Stenmarck for his report.
I agree with him that the estimates in front of us are critical in that they deal with Parliament's preparations for enlargement.
We all know that this is the greatest enlargement the EU has faced, so it is critical that we get the preparations right in time for 2004.
This is especially so in the current climate in which the EU seems to be needlessly coming under attack from all sides.
Our credibility more than ever depends on getting this right.
In this context the need for improved provision for information is imperative and I therefore support the 15% increase outlined in this report for this area.
Bringing the work of the European Parliament closer to the people must be one of our top priorities.
It is increasingly evident that all the work we have been doing on information provision has not quite caught the imagination of the European public.
I heard recently some evidence from the Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty which shows that citizens who went to Parliament or Commission information offices for literature were not sufficiently convinced or motivated to go out and vote.
If this is indeed the case, we need a fundamental review of what we are publishing and how we are communicating with the people.
So what did encourage people to go out and vote?
The source of information that encouraged people to go out and vote "yes" most effectively was conversations with friends and family.
The clear message for us is that producing mountains of glossy brochures is not getting the message across.
I, for one, am continually meeting people who are completely confused about the roles of the different institutions.
We need, therefore, to recognise that we must have interinstitutional cooperation on information policy, and such cooperation has been quite slow to develop.
I know that some of these issues may be dealt with by the convention and I know the Council is talking about opening up its decision-making process to permit greater transparency.
However, we need to be more focused and targeted in our approach and I am not entirely convinced that the proposal in this report to broadcast Parliament's plenary part-sessions on the Internet, will really solve the problem.
How many people will be inclined to sit at their computer and watch such broadcasts?
Before we go down this particular road we should undertake a pilot study and look at the cost-value ratio of this measure.
I am also extremely concerned about how the institutions are going to deal with proposals for funding the administrative costs.
Commissioner Schreyer has informed us today that in the proposed PDB for 2003 on administrative expenditure there will be a negative margin of EUR 66 million.
It is proposed to finalise this through the flexibility instrument.
I have enormous reservations about this, because my understanding of the flexibility instrument is that it is meant to be there for unforeseen events.
How can we justify using this to the taxpayer for the administrative purposes which are known and have been foreseen for quite a long time?
What happens if there is another crisis in the coming year?
How will we fund measures to tackle it?
Commissioner Schreyer also made a reference to pensions.
I recognise that this is an area in which there has been a dramatic increase in terms of the provisions we need, given the demographic profile of staff in the institutions.
Surely we need proposals for the long term which look at how we can provide for the pensions by setting up a fund or alternative means,.
The issue of budgetary rigour is referred to time and time again.
We want greater budgetary rigour, but there are two major issues that the Council needs to address if we are to achieve this, and it is a pity it is not here to listen to this: the first one is the issue of the language regime.
The area most affected by enlargement within the institution will be staff and the building costs related to languages.
Whilst I support the right of all MEPs to speak their own language, we must recognise that we need to rationalise this and we need to recognise the danger of a loss of dynamism in our meetings.
The Council therefore needs to look at the Treaty provisions to see how we can rationalise this area.
Secondly, the issue of the seat of the European Parliament requires urgent attention.
This fact alone has a major impact on costs.
Surely it is time that Parliament has one seat.
Mr President, Mr Stenmarck has drawn up a very rational and balanced estimate of Parliament's estimated revenue and expenditure for the next financial year and my sincerest thanks go to him for that.
The report also serves as a good basis for later discussion of the budget in the autumn.
The 2003 budget is likely to be the last before EU enlargement.
For that reason the rapporteur has set aside considerable sums of money for the new Member State's admission to the EU.
The rapporteur is proposing that EUR 32 million is needed for enlargement immediately and a further EUR 51 million for a special reserve.
When we also take into consideration the 6 million euros reserved for observers and the extension of property reserve of 15 million euros it is my group's opinion that sufficient funds have indeed been set aside for preparations for enlargement.
The language issue is one of the hardest matters to deal with.
Nearly every new Member State will also bring its own language to the European Union.
For democracy to function properly it is vital that every EU citizen can stand as a candidate for election to the European Parliament without being required to be fluent in a foreign language.
This places special demands on the European Parliament with regard to interpreting.
All of us must be able to take part in the debate in our own mother tongue.
On the other hand, it is virtually impossible to arrange for the smaller languages to be interpreted just through one interpreter.
For example, Finnish is interpreted first into English, say, and only then into Greek.
In my opinion, we should establish the practice of interpreting as many languages as possible, including the smaller ones, into the most important languages, that is to say, English, French and German.
In this way Members could listen to the original speech in these languages as interpreted by just the one interpreter.
Another crucial problem is the support of Parliament's core activities.
It is incomprehensible that the committees should be short of staff to carry out preparatory work at the same time as legislation work has increased.
It is important to give more support to this basic work.
Parliament must be capable of high standards in its treatment of matters, as, otherwise, the Commission and the Council will become too overbearing and above all because the quality of legislation will otherwise suffer.
Mr President, according to its preliminary draft budget, the Commission wants 500 temporary posts to serve the needs of EU enlargement, which would be financed by means of a flexible mechanism.
This is the wrong way to provide finance.
There is no question here of unforeseen expenditure.
Parliament also wishes to prepare for enlargement by employing additional staff.
To cover the cost of this the desire has been expressed to resort to the so-called negative priorities, in other words seeking to trim and wind down current activities.
Savings would then apply most drastically to activities that maintain Parliament's pluralistic and diverse nature, and that is why this is the wrong way to provide finance.
It is reasonable for both the Commission and Parliament to place on view the administrative expenditure due to enlargement under Section V of the budget.
It is reasonable to exceed the upper limit for administrative expenditure recorded in the Interinstitutional Agreement partly because when the agreement was being made there was no provision for the inclusion of ten new Member States and nine new languages.
The costs of enlargement must be paid for and they must be shown transparently in the budget.
Mr President, it is clear that the costs of enlargement are at the present moment difficult to estimate, but it must also be clear to us that they must not, in future, be allowed to exceed their limits.
The economic data for our EU as regards employment and economic growth are not particularly good, and, in addition, the fiscal burden in Europe, which is to be borne by the citizen, has reached an all-time high of 46%.
Put in clear terms, this means that the Member States will have to manage without tax revenues from 2003 until 2008, as prevailing tax rates are too high and must be reduced absolutely.
That is also what we in this House have committed ourselves to.
At the same time, the Member States' budgets will not be able to cope with any additional burdens, the payment of higher contributions being one example.
The EU's citizens will not accept higher tax burdens.
If we decide on them all the same, the political landscape of the EU is likely to change in the future and probably not to Europe's advantage.
It is highly likely that, at the next elections, the voters will tell us what they think about it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's estimates for 2003 should be viewed as a success, thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck, who has focused on a series of fundamental issues on which it is good for Parliament to give its opinion.
One of these is enlargement and the other, assistance to Members.
It is clear that in the enlargement process we will have to seek a balance between the political timetable and efficiency, without which there will be a surge in administrative costs and expenditure on buildings, an issue of great interest to Members and Parliament as a whole, because the public image of this Parliament very often suffers if too much money is spent on buildings.
This is the essence of the amendment tabled by our group: to seek improved information on the part of the services corresponding to this Parliament to discover the true need for these buildings.
On the other hand, assistance to Members also requires a balance between professional requirements and the immediacy of Members activities, which are very specific and which require punctual and immediate assistance.
Parliament now has more political responsibilities, new competencies and a whole set of technical requirements that need to be fulfilled, yet there have been no improvements to the administrative element of our assistance.
For this reason we need to follow the recommendations of the ROME-PE study.
We believe that the rapporteur has covered this very well in his report, and for this reason, apart from further negotiations with the Bureau, the rapporteur's opinion should prevail in this report.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work.
I would then like to stress the importance of item 20, which calls for the broadcasting on the Internet of audiovisual recordings of Parliament's plenary sittings and for the creation of archives.
Unlike Mr Gill, I believe that the principle of publicising our work is very important.
There will be meetings which will have a large audience and meetings which attract less attention, but I still feel that the Internet represents a very inexpensive opportunity to retrieve the fundamental democratic principle of publicising meetings, which, as we know, are only public in theory, on paper.
Indeed, we know that European citizens cannot attend these events: irrespective of whether they interest thousands or dozens of people, the fact is that the public cannot have access to them without an invitation.
The costs might be much less than those currently sustained for the various publicity materials or for reported information; this would be live information, not reported information, which would bring the European Parliament's activities back into line with the principle of publicising our work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report (A5-0161/2002) by Mr Trentin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission recommendation for the 2002 Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community (COM(2002) 191 - C5-0191/2002 - 2002/2075(COS))
report (A5-0145/2002) by Mr Marinos, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes (Article 99(4) EC) (2002/2016(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with an economic situation which is still very uncertain, and the European institutions need to do more than just wait for American recovery and its impact on the European Union economies.
Moreover, as in Europe, recovery in the United States still appears to be slow and to differ according to sector, and it is accompanied by restructuring processes which are having considerable repercussions on employment and require substantial capital investments.
It is no coincidence that the United States Government has adopted a highly interventionist policy, and it should make the European institutions pause for thought for they still have to counteract ongoing stagnation in the investment sector, at least if they want to avoid the gap in competitiveness between Europe and the United States widening further.
This being the case, the need to respect the constraints of the Stability Pact, particularly in terms of national budget deficits and the debt reduction mechanism, cannot, as some would advocate, take the place of stronger coordination of economic and social policies and a policy mix which will impact on the economic policies of the countries of the Union, particularly the Eurogroup.
The constraint of the 3% threshold for national budget deficits must be respected.
However, we have to understand, at this point, that the scarcity of resources available for each State to develop an economic and social environment policy which is capable of giving fresh stimulus to employment and the economy makes it essential that we create fresh synergies through stronger coordination of economic, social and environmental policies, particularly in the eurozone; moreover, this coordination should also be evident at the level of the policy for supplies of oil raw materials, in order to reduce price fluctuations and counteract the threats from inflation.
That is why our report calls upon the Commission to propose to the Council and certain groups of States open coordination experiments precisely in the investment sectors in which the Lisbon European Council recorded the greatest delays in the European Union in the development by 2010 of a knowledge-based economy and society moving towards full employment and social cohesion. I refer, in particular, to investment in research and development, to investment - which has to be substantial if it is to have any effect - in lifelong learning; a policy which is inseparable from the promotion of job flexibility.
I refer, once again, to investments which could encourage, which could facilitate a policy of active ageing based on the voluntary choice of employees and on the retraining of older workers so as to ensure the endurance of a collective pensions system. I refer, lastly, to investments in integrated infrastructures of networks and services which can lead, with the commitment of the States, with the commitment of private individuals and with the support of the European Investment Bank, to the immediate recovery of employment.
I also feel it is important and urgent that consideration be given to the recommendations of the Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, in cases of mergers and restructuring, so as to use benchmarking and other procedures to encourage the practice of informing and consulting workers and in order to find solutions based on employability and continuous education as alternatives to structural unemployment.
Mr President, this is the path proposed by Jacques Delors yesterday and again today in the interview published in Le Monde this morning.
With this path, the economy and the markets will benefit from a considerable announcement effect which will encourage economic recovery in the countries which are currently just marking time too.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' call to the Commission and the Council for Parliament not just to be consulted but to be more involved in establishing the broad economic policy guidelines and promoting greater cooperation between the European institutions to be taken up, so that this process too is carried out with full transparency and with the informed participation of the Members of Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, my report on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes, which was approved unanimously by the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, concludes - in brief - that the annual stability and convergence programmes submitted by the governments of the Member States and their application in 2001 were, for the most part, in keeping with the requirements of the stability and growth pact, despite the recession caused by the decline in growth rates, what were luckily temporary setbacks in the American economy and one-off incidents such as the terrorist attacks on 11 September.
This generally positive state of affairs, a number of very serious exceptions in the case of Germany and Portugal notwithstanding, proves that having a stability pact and applying it as strictly as possible - and the policy of the European Central Bank has helped here - are vital to monetary stability.
That was why we were able to introduce the euro successfully and the prevailing opinion is that it is a prerequisite to healthy and sound economic growth in the European Union, something we have yet to achieve.
Unfortunately, apart from a few exceptions, rates of growth are still low, high unemployment persists, causing serious problems among the poorer classes and the young in particular, and we live with the threat of inflationary pressures.
The European Commission and ECOFIN believe that recovery is on the way and will start to bite during the last quarter of this year.
The new stability programmes for the next three years paint a similar picture.
We shall just have to wait and see if they prove to be right.
Unfortunately, despite the upward trend in the American economy and recent improvements on the stock exchanges, uncertainty persists and huge swathes of the population are taking to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction, occasionally in extreme terms, especially at the last elections.
Obviously, simple management by the intergovernmental conference is not enough.
We need more effective economic policies which strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy, promote convergence, encourage productive investment, especially high-tech investment, and create jobs, if we are to allay fears caused by what is, unfortunately, an uncontrollable influx of immigrants, the criminality ascribed to them and persistent high unemployment, especially among the young.
Despite the fact that a revised stability pact - or more lenient application of it - are being mooted in certain quarters, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers it is vital that it be adhered to rigidly and is therefore highly critical of the cowardly manner in which deviations in Germany and Portugal were dealt with.
Unfortunately, despite the Commission's recommendation that an early warning be sent to these countries, as happened with Ireland in the past, ECOFIN did not do so, clearly for political reasons.
That was a bad move and could undermine confidence in the need for the pact and the Commission's authority.
And it has turned out to be an extremely bad move because, after the elections in Portugal, for example, the new Portuguese Government revealed that public finances were in a far worse state than the previous government had let on, with the budget deficit exceeding the gross domestic product by far more than the 3% limit.
Figures were also covered up in Germany, on unemployment at least, while the deficit in both France and Greece appears to be much higher than suggested by the figures released.
All this creative accounting must stop; the Commission is already pressing for greater transparency and honesty in figures released by governments and stressing the urgent need to speed up the structural reforms needed, especially in pensions, the liberalisation of markets, especially the job and energy markets, and education standards, if the Lisbon targets are to be met.
The European Union needs to be bolder, to learn from the successes of the American model - which announced a worrying 80% increase in farming subsidies yesterday - and to allow the creative forces of private initiative free - but not of course unaccountable - rein, without abandoning the social market economy, so as to escape the current climate of uncertainty which is a breeding ground for many a threat.
And it has to do so against a backdrop of destabilising terrorist activities and in the face of the sort of revival of far-right and far-left movements, with all the suffering that presages, the like of which has not been seen since between the First and Second World Wars.
. (SV) Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Trentin for the very good job he has done under extremely difficult circumstances.
The latest version of the report arrived this morning, and it has not been easy for any of us on the committees to cooperate under these conditions.
We are nonetheless agreed on many issues, and Mr Trentin has done very well in accepting a number of the viewpoints produced by our committee.
I agree with him that the starting point must be the fact that the European economies are in the doldrums right now and need to be strengthened and that investments need to be made in what is necessary and in what there is substantial political agreement about.
Both Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos have talked about education.
I would especially emphasise basic education and basic professional training.
It is also important to invest money in improving the ecological infrastructures, which are beneficial for the future, as well as to invest money in education, which has a large effect upon employment.
It is important not only to do those things that are required immediately but also those that are required in the long term and that will have beneficial social consequences.
It is therefore crucial to give particular attention, and more than has been given so far, to the importance of strengthening those local labour markets that are less vulnerable to economic trends.
We shall have the opportunity to return to this subject in Parliament a little later when we debate a report from the Commission about developing local employment strategies.
I wish finally to say that, unfortunately, we have not had the opportunity to take sufficient account of the East European countries and their economies, something which it would be desirable to do as part of this process.
Certainly, there are other measures which need to be prioritised in the short term, but as soon as we have a somewhat longer-term perspective it will be necessary to discuss the economics in a pan-European perspective.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please let me make three introductory comments.
The first is that I am very happy that we are dealing with the Trentin and Marinos reports in a joint debate, because that again gives clear expression to the fact that there is not only no contradiction between the stability and convergence programme and the Guidelines of the Economic Policies, but also that they even complement each other.
The second is that anyone comparing the Lisbon objectives with reality will be aware how much there is still to be done, and will see that there have been substantial delays in their being put into practice.
The Lisbon objectives, which are to make the EU into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area, facilitating sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater cohesion, represent the goal to which all of us - Parliament, Council and Commission - give the highest priority and to which we have committed ourselves.
Thirdly, Commissioner, and speaking on behalf of my group, I fully support, as regards their content, the guidelines you have put forward and believe that their main features, despite a number of amendments we have also agreed to, are right and merit our entire support.
Our objective is best, and most safely, reached by way of the model of the environmentally responsible market economy.
I have to reiterate that, because the environmentally-responsible market economy incorporates on the one hand functioning free and liberalised markets and, on the other, sees responsibility towards enterprises, employees and consumers, along with sustainability, as part of its responsibility towards future generations.
I would like to appeal right now to an element among the speakers on the Left. Let us at last stop playing social policy off against economic policy, and employment policy against price stability.
Growth and employment presuppose price stability, and social cohesion in our society presupposes growth and employment.
Those who jeopardise the Stability and Growth Pact are mortgaging the future and acting irresponsibly.
Those who abide by it have enough room for their political initiatives and investments to manoeuvre.
I call for greater consistency in implementing what we have agreed to and adhering to it.
The implementation of Lisbon, of the convergence criteria, of the Stability and Growth Pact, of the Action Plan for Financial Services, of the plans for liberalisation, offers enough opportunities for coordination.
Coordination at the expense of participation is something we will never agree to, but we will support coordination for the purpose of implementing our common objectives.
The internal market enhances competitiveness in Europe and in the world, but it does not ban competition within Europe.
We need competition in products and competition in systems!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialists say yes to the Stability and Growth Pact, which is something that we need.
Stability cannot be an end in itself, it must serve growth.
Europe needs a more innovative policy for growth.
To achieve this, we must invest more in European infrastructures.
The collective profitability of infrastructures is always much higher than their direct financial profitability.
How many regions of Europe have experienced greater development due to a network of high speed trains, due to a new motorway, a more modern port or an airport?
The communication networks and energy transmission networks are also a factor in development and growth.
Ten years after the launch of the trans-European networks (TEN), we must point out that few projects launched back then have been completed.
What is worse, the increase in mobility has resulted in all the existing infrastructural networks being saturated.
Those who advocate the liberalisation of the energy markets do not seem to be aware of the obvious lack of existing inter-connections for energy transmission.
Similarly, those who desire a liberalisation of rail transport do not seem to be aware that the existing capacities on the rail networks are already saturated.
This is true of passenger transport and freight transport.
We clearly need to extend trans-European networks in all areas.
This is a typical Community policy since the trans-European networks, the name says it all, Mr President, do not stop at national borders but serve the entire European economy.
The Commission would therefore be well advised to make improvements to trans-European networks and to extend all these networks.
Trans-European networks must receive European financing.
The Union's budget and the European Investment Bank must be used.
Public and private finance is necessary.
The European infrastructural policy serves growth, serves immediate employment but above all it serves growth and therefore employment, in the medium and long term.
I would like to finish, Mr President, by thanking the two rapporteurs, and especially my colleague Mr Bruno Trentin, for the 2002 report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express the support of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for the two reports by Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos, which deal with two key issues within the excessively complicated EU economic and monetary policy mechanism, of which the stability pacts and the broad economic policy guidelines are key components.
I would like to highlight the following points: firstly, that we fully support the policy of budgetary rigour and the fulfilment of commitments established in the stability pacts.
Therefore, we regret very much that the Member States, in the Ecofin Council in February, if my memory serves me correctly, did not support the Commission proposal with regard to the concern for the development of the Portuguese and German economies and the administration of their respective budgets.
I would also add our concern at the French Government's recent announcement.
Therefore, I support the policy of budgetary rigour that will hopefully give confidence and strength to the European economy and its single currency, the euro.
Lastly, I would like to point out that with regard to the broad economic policy guidelines, we agree with the Trentin report's proposals, particularly where they aim to implement the Lisbon commitments after revision in the Barcelona Council.
We particularly agree with the difficult compromise between achieving greater competitiveness whilst not abandoning the policy of economic and social cohesion.
Clearly, this can only be achieved by putting an emphasis - as the Trentin report does, and as proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - on the information society and the expansion of technological research and development activities.
This will clearly give rise to the information- and knowledge-based society that will allow us to improve quality and be more competitive, which we hope for at the end of this decade.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I would also like to thank our esteemed fellow Member, Mr Bruno Trentin, and to congratulate him not only on his personal qualities, but also because I believe that the report adopted last night by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contains a strong political message.
The message is that, if Parliament adopts this report, it will be rejecting the 'wait-and-see' strategy favoured by the Member States' governments and is calling for a stronger qualitative growth.
This message is conveyed by highlighting the fact that, in the triangle that economists know well, in other words that formed by the volume of public debt, the volume of public revenue and the volume of public expenditure - whether this is current expenditure or, more importantly, investment expenditure referred to in this report - we must also take into account the level of public expenditure needed to achieve the objectives defined at Lisbon and also at Gothenburg.
And one does not need to be a genius to realise that this message runs counter to widely held views.
To be convinced of this, one merely has to watch the election broadcasts by the main political parties, which all place the emphasis on reducing public revenue and fail to specify which areas of public spending should therefore be decreased accordingly.
Bearing in mind, therefore, the increasing tax competition between the Member States, I think that Amendment No 7 is an absolutely crucial amendment, because it warns against the pressure that public expenditure is under.
Besides the tax aspects which we do not think are covered sufficiently in the report, this is another reason why we feel that Amendment No 8 is an absolute minimum in terms of corporate income tax and the implementation of the conclusions of the Primarolo report.
But we must also - the Commissioner is well aware of this - move forward with environmental taxation and taxation on revenue arising from capital, which are all areas where the debate is stalling.
Lastly, Commissioner, as far as the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, my group will not vote in favour of the Marinos report, because I think that there is a contradiction, contrary to what other speakers have said, between the Trentin report and the Marinos report.
The Marinos report calls for the strict observance of the stability programmes.
I personally believe that, in the interest of citizens, it is unwise to refuse to launch a debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is unwise to seek to accomplish, at any cost and within strict timetables, budgetary balances: the level of public debt of the Member States is more important than simply complying strictly with budgetary balances.
I think that there is a connection to be made between the rise of extreme right groups in Europe and the fact that the States no longer know how to respond to the basic needs of their citizens, or in any case these needs are not being properly satisfied.
We need public funding that is sufficient to meet these needs.
Mr President, we have, in the European Union, an internal market, and a unitary currency in twelve of its Member States, but we do not have a communitarised European economic and fiscal policy and nor do we have a policy on employment.
This is our fundamental dilemma.
Opinions will differ to a marked degree as regards the Guidelines.
If we make growth our priority, we can discuss whether or not it presupposes a high rate of employment, which makes for greater purchasing power and hence strengthens domestic demand.
We can discuss whether to roll back supply-side economic policies a bit in favour of those that are demand-driven, but we will not solve the problem if we do not sort out communitarised policies.
The Member States are jostling for position among themselves, which means that a common framework needs to be laid down, at any rate to provide guidelines for economic policy.
How much can or should be budgeted for expenditure on investments?
Is it really necessary - as is stated in the text - to prioritise the reduction of outgoings, or can we not change the revenue side by means of tax justice?
Why does tax law not treat partnerships and corporate enterprises equally?
Why is it that not every business or private individual pays tax on the profits it or they make?
It is frameworks such as these that we can lay down and thereby enable there to be a level playing field in every country.
The question we have to ask ourselves - which I think Mr Karas framed in an improper way - is not to do with the Left wanting to engage in social policy as against economic policy or to oppose employment with stability.
Good employment policy and low unemployment are merely the precondition for growth actually being achieved.
We get growth only if the products that are manufactured are capable of being sold.
That means that the two are linked together.
That is why we have to give some thought to how to fit economic and social policies together much better, rather than setting them up in opposition to each other.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Trentin for his excellent report and for his work, which quite clearly reveals the slowdown in the progress of our Community's economic policy: a fact that has become extremely clear, as has - and I am taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioners in the Chamber - the issue of poor cooperation in economic matters between the European Union and the European Parliament.
This is not, then, just a question of hoping that, in the future, the cooperative effort between Parliament and the Union will become reality.
This is a real necessity if we still believe in the prevalence of politics over a certain type of economy, characterised by lobbying, which has certainly not yielded the desired result thus far, as is shown by the figures on the economic slowdown.
What, then, can we hope for in such a situation?
I feel that, faced with the current momentous problems of our world - which have been mentioned, touched on today - we need to start to reason, to attempt to apply our great Europe's entrepreneurial capacity to the problems of social cohesion which were evident in Mr Marino's report too.
We need to be able to define the new relationship between the new economy and the Welfare State in terms of the modern context, the Welfare State needs to be redefined for the modern age.
We are attempting to do so in Italy and we are succeeding, but only by means of a great struggle to remodernise the relationship between capital and the world of work and achieve a great synthesis of the two, with a view, not least - and this is my invitation to Mr Trentin and the other Members of my committee - to what is going to happen in a few years' time with enlargement, which is now almost upon us.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired by Mrs Randzio-Plath, recently visited Bulgaria, where we were able to take a look at the budget of the applicant States, with some practical concern for what the implications will be for our economy.
We must therefore act as if enlargement were on our doorstep and congratulate ourselves on our endeavours.
In my opinion, Mr Trentin was right to refer in his recommendation to the age-old, noble values of which the Europeans are traditionally the champions; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore made good progress along this road, which is the road to the practical creation of an essentially inclusive European State with a sound economy.
You can speak your mind, but you also have to back up your words by action.
And this is what is sometimes lacking when it comes to implementing agreements concluded in the socio-economic field.
Since the Stockholm Summit, integration of social and employment policy and environmental policy into economic policy has been an objective in order to achieve sustainable development.
The Barcelona Summit two months ago prompted the inclusion in Mr Trentin's preparatory report, by amendment, of a whole host of social and employment objectives.
Although I can trace the social and employment objectives in Mr Trentin's report, I believe that there is insufficient consideration for environmental aspects.
It appears that integrating economic and social policy is more a matter of course than integrating environmental policy into economic policy.
Might the reason lie in the fact that environmental policy costs money and yields economic results that are not immediately measurable?
I would therefore call for clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the guidelines for economic policy, in addition to references to the importance of the environment.
Objectives relating to energy consumption and the reduction in CO2-emissions spring to mind.
Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with the responsible use of our natural resources.
Finally, I understand that the method of open coordination does not function entirely satisfactorily.
In practice, it transpires that the use of this method is often too unregulated and the method itself is not clearly defined.
As a result, cooperation by means of the method of open coordination is not sufficiently binding for the Member States.
It is therefore desirable that it is made clear how cooperation between the Member States is taking place in the field of employment and social policy, taking into account the responsibilities of the Member States.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work.
Two - almost magic - formulae, typical of a certain type of Europeanism are constantly being proposed in this Chamber: the European social model and the social market economy.
The underlying implication - which is, in reality, often expressed - is that this is where the distinction between the European model and the US model lies, the former being an altruistic, inclusive model and the latter being an egotistical and cynical model.
I feel we would do well to ask ourselves whether these labels actually correspond to the facts in reality, whether the European social model genuinely does protect the weaker sections of society and the marginalised.
Does our economic policy really produce better results than that of the US?
The Council texts before us today are pervaded by the optimistic, consoling mantra of the Lisbon goal: making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world in ten years.
This is, of course, an excellent proposal, but we are overlooking the fact that two years have passed already and that the European economy is still at the starting post, that the necessary reforms are being postponed or diluted from summit to summit and that the hopes of Europe's unemployed of economic growth bringing them work are still linked to the resumption of growth in the US economy, which is the motor for growth.
It is a constant factor: we set grandiose, ambitious goals and then, when we fail to achieve them because it has become unrealistic to pursue them, we have to just resign ourselves!
The reforms need to be speeded up.
The demands made upon Italy in this year's broad economic policy guidelines are the same as those which have been made throughout the past five years, but nothing effective is being done to meet the requirements relating to the labour market, pensions, the liberal professions and the liberalisation of the markets.
I will end, Mr President, with a warning: only ten years ago, Japan was still seen as an invincible economy with a social model offering a remarkable level of protection.
Now, a long recession coupled with the country's inability to effect liberal reforms in its economy appear to be inflicting torture on Japan which is as long-drawn-out as it was unexpected.
These are, of course, different situations which cannot be compared, but the fate of Japan is a warning which we in Europe would do well to heed.
We have therefore come to an end of the list of Members who spoke on behalf of their group.
As a voting session is soon due to begin, I shall suspend the joint debate on these two reports.
The debate will resume this evening at 9 p.m.
(The sitting was adjourned at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
Mr President, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34.
It can also accept, in principle, Amendments Nos 8, 14, 15 and 18, after they have been reworded. It rejects the other amendments.
Mr President, I recommend the adoption of the common position without amendment.
In discussion yesterday in Parliament, questions were raised as to whether there was full harmonisation or not.
I want to make a statement to the House that there is full harmonisation in respect of information to consumers prior to the conclusion of the contract on, for instance, the supplier, financial services, the distance contract and the redress mechanism.
Particular concern was expressed in relation to Article 3(4) on the information on contractual obligations to be communicated to the consumer during the pre-contractual phase.
In particular, concern was expressed as to whether this was in conformity with the e-commerce Directive, and I want to give an assurance that, in my opinion, it is.
I refer the House, in particular, to recital 56 of the e-commerce Directive.
I assure the House that, for instance, web sites will still be subject to the country of origin principle.
As for Article 42, I would say that this is necessary, having regard to the fact that further harmonisation legislation is still pending and the article is therefore necessary.
I urge the House to reject Amendment No 49, as the wording of the article is correct, as it says that 'the laws shall be approximated'.
This is the normal wording to be found in a directive, and the other form of wording you would find in a regulation.
Finally, Amendment No 50 should also be rejected, as it requires the inclusion of a specific date of 2003, which is inappropriate.
The appropriate approach is to stipulate, as is normal, two years after adoption.
In the circumstances, the Commission recommends the adoption of this without amendment.
Mr President, I would like to respond to the Commissioner's position by saying, in my capacity as rapporteur, that it corresponds completely with my recommendation to this House.
Let me say, for the information of Members of this House, that, at any rate in the German version produced by our interpreters, whenever the Commissioner spoke of amendments, the word was rendered as 'articles'.
The numbers that the Commissioner has cited refer, however, to the amendments rather than to the articles of the original text.
My group asked for these to be voted on separately, but I can withdraw this request.
A mistake has been made.
This means that Amendments Nos 13 to 23, which were to be voted on separately, can now be voted on en bloc.
Mr President, should you not be asking us to vote for the text?
You are changing the vote around and reversing it.
A "yes" vote should be for keeping the text and a "no" vote should be against the text surely?
The last time you did this it was rather confusing.
The intention is to modify the common text and that requires a qualified majority.
You are voting for or against deletion because the common text is already before us.
I am putting it politically and procedurally the correct way.
(The President declared the common position approved, as amended)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0143/2002) by Theodorus J.J. Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (14854/1/2001 - C5-0070/2002 - 2001/0006(COD))
Before the vote:
I can tell you that the Commission is willing to accept all the amendments to the common position of 18 February 2002, since we believe that the amendments tabled do not only improve on the common position, but in many places they help to clarify it.
Mr President, in paragraph 7, we should delete the words "Advisory Committee on Tourism", so the paragraph reads: ..."calls for the Forum to meet in public".
This is the only solution that is correct.
I ask colleagues to approve it.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Producing homogenised statistics for the whole of the Union could prove to be a useful exercise, and that is why we voted in favour of the report.
It is common knowledge, however, that governments distort and manipulate statistics in all sorts of ways, even those in an area as straightforward as unemployment.
The fundamental disparity between employees' salaries and those of their employers is all the more reason for us to obtain reliable statistics on income.
Employers know, to the nearest penny, how much their workers earn, but do the latter have any idea as to their employers' income?
The total amount of capital income and, more generally speaking, information on how capital income works, are kept under wraps by virtue of the infamous 'trade secrets act', which exists to hide all instances of waste, speculation and corruption.
Because of a lack of transparency, European Union statistics on the income of the rich will always be unreliable, whether they are homogenised or not.
We are, of course, in favour of scientific and technical cooperation between Europe and India and exchange visits by scientists within the framework of the parallel programmes.
For this reason, we did not vote against the report, but at the same time we refuse to endorse it.
This is because, behind the faÃ§ade of 'cooperation', there is a reality, and primarily that which has surfaced out of a distrust for those who are being exploited and is revealed by the very examples cited by the rapporteur.
The rapporteur states that poor countries must do without the energy sources that rich countries use because they are too expensive for them.
The report makes no mention whatsoever of the causes of this poverty: centuries of colonial exploitation, followed by imperial exploitation by India.
The report makes no mention either of those who have benefited from high energy prices, such as European companies which include global oil, gas and electricity giants.
The rapporteur depicts as helpful the fact that the European Union is installing, in rural areas of India, alternative energy technologies, the patents of which usually belong to the above-mentioned energy giants.
The report recommends that the European Union provide farmers with technologies to process their agricultural produce, so that they can?
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The British Conservatives voted against this report due to growing concerns about the effects and implementation of such agreements.
Firstly, we are unconvinced by the benefits of agreements which are of huge cost to the European taxpayer and yet seem to supply limited benefits to EU fishermen as a whole.
Secondly, we remain sceptical over the financial proberty of such schemes, and how such proceeds are spent.
The effect on local indigenous fishermen continues to be highlighted, and yet the attitude that the EU can simply come in and take the livelihoods of such subsistence fishermen is worrying.
But finally we have seen the damage the CFP has done to the fishing stocks around our own coastlines.
The CFP has been an unmitigated environmental disaster.
We believe that it is simply wrong to suggest that the only answer to such a dire situation in our fish stocks is simply to up anchor and go and repeat the exercise in someone else's waters.
Mr President, Mrs Maij-Weggen's report refers to the list of documents to be made accessible to the public.
Tell me, Mr President, which European Parliament document is most faithful and closest to reality out of all the documents issued by Parliament that we have to include in the register?
You do not reply but I am sure you have guessed: the most faithful European Parliament document can only be a video recording of the plenary sittings.
Do you realise, Mr President, how faithful the recording would be, showing the moment when Mr Fatuzzo delivers his explanation of vote and all the other Members gaily chat amongst themselves, with my blessing, of course?
Indeed, Mr President, I would rather you did not call them to order!
Mr Fatuzzo, please let me point out to you that any explanations of vote that you give should actually have something to do with the way you voted.
The European Parliament has just adopted what appears to be a highly commendable report on the list of its documents that are directly accessible to the public.
But although transparency appears to be respected, there is creeping censorship at various stages of parliamentary work.
For example, written explanations of vote must, in theory, be no more than 200 words, as stated in the Rules of Procedure, but this word limit has not always been strictly enforced in order to allow Members to express their opinions fully and clearly.
This tolerant attitude seems to be frowned upon in some quarters: despite the fact that the European institutions often spend money as if there is no tomorrow, Parliament has recently decided to save money on paper and ink by cutting 100 words here, 50 words there of Members' explanations of vote.
In the Minutes of the sitting of 25 April 2002, I drew attention to instances where my explanations of vote had been shortened.
We must simply bear in mind that the Union spends a considerable amount subsidising associations which merely serve to spread propaganda pure and simple.
It obviously prefers to listen infinitely to servile associations, rather than find out the opinions of the representatives elected by the people.
We are seeing a whole programme of 'new governance' taking shape before our very eyes.
. (NL) Once upon a time, the government used to be the private property of king and nobility, all decisions were secret and people did not all enjoy the same civil rights.
We have come a long way since then.
Practically nobody would like to return to those days, but the last vestiges have still not been fully stamped out.
It is very convenient for leaders and large businesses if citizens cannot access information, if they cannot access it in time or if they are unable to respond in time to measures which privileged groups find important.
There is even fear for the consequences of democracy and openness which may conflict with traditional opinions on stability and state security held by leading groupings.
Within the EU, the extent of public access differs greatly between northern and southern Member States, and between large ones and small ones.
This allows for a great deal of secrecy to continue to exist at EU level, such as the Councils of Ministers, which meet behind closed doors and which have assumed the role of senate off their own bat.
The proposal to declare all EP documents, such as attendance lists, written questions, Minutes, voting results and the lists of staff, public from now on is right and proper, but this does not constitute a step forward.
I assumed that these documents had always been in the public domain, but obviously I have nothing against stressing this point.
The fight goes on.
The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced the concept of openness and transparency into the Treaties, in such a way as to give any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, a right of access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
For that reason, Parliament provided in its Rules of Procedure that 'Categories of documents which are directly accessible (and unabridged) shall be set out in a list adopted by Parliament and annexed to these Rules'.
It is precisely this procedure and this list that the Maij-Weggen report deals with.
This report warrants our full support, because it makes another positive contribution at European level to formalising the principle of transparency and of public access to documents, here in the specific framework of our Parliament.
.
(DE) I wish to emphasise at the outset that I am unreservedly in favour of Parliament working in a transparent manner and also of all its documentation being made accessible to the public.
I nonetheless voted against Mrs Maij-Weggen's report.
Parliament has a political task, and, in the conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament deals with political questions - sometimes sensitive ones - and the work of the delegations can even touch on live political issues.
I consider it irresponsible for us to make 'working documents' accessible to the public.
Official documents and working documents are quite different things.
The conciliation procedure in particular deals with the political implementation of different positions taken by the two institutions, Parliament and the Council.
If all the thinking set down in the working documents is made public at the outset, then we can give up politics.
The Council will be delighted to know in advance what Parliament has in mind.
There is always a connection between my explanations of vote and the reason for my vote for or against a motion, Mr President, although you need to listen very carefully to understand it.
With regard to the Foster report, for example, which deals with aviation security, the fact that, as I was flying to Strasbourg, Mr President, I was thinking precisely about aviation security and about this report through which Mrs Foster rightly calls for the implementation of specific measures to ensure that flights are secure, would appear, at first glance, to have no bearing on the matter.
I was reflecting that the security envisaged for us by Mrs Foster is so very secure that I hope aircraft do not lose that swaying, rocking motion which enables us to sleep even when we are up among the clouds.
Mr President, I voted for the report not least because, as an airman, I am in favour of improving security.
Moreover, on the subject of security, I am quite concerned by the fact that, for reasons of foreign policy, we are forced, or rather we have been persuaded, to welcome 13 dangerous Palestinians to our country who have been released from the Church of the Nativity, which they had taken over by force.
Indeed, it would not make sense for this European schizophrenia to improve security in one area while, at the same time, exposing us to considerable risks - a fact of which I am certain - for I am sure that the fact that these 13 Palestinians were not released means that they are not honest and are, in any case, a danger and a hazard for our citizens.
We voted in favour of all the amendments which seek to strengthen safety both for the staff of airlines, airports and companies based in airports, and for air passengers.
However, we rejected the amendments which, on the pretext of maintaining balanced competition, bow to pressure from the lobbies - primarily the airline lobbies - and will do nothing more than delay the implementation of essential measures or will ensure that the measures taken will not meet the legitimate expectations of the public and the staff concerned.
In recommending that the authorities finance these measures, the rapporteur is acknowledging the fact that the market, the laws of competition and profit, in other words, the capitalist functioning of the economy extolled by the European institutions, are incompatible with passenger and worker safety.
And unfortunately, air transport is by no means an exception in this area.
. (NL) Unlike trains or buses, aircraft are completely dependent on the uninterrupted operation of their engines for their safety.
If these engines fail as a result of technical problems or deliberate sabotage, then the aircraft will crash.
In such cases, not only the passengers will be the victims, but also those on the ground where pieces of the wreckage land.
We have witnessed this, inter alia, in the deliberate crash in Lockerbie in Scotland and in the air disaster above the Amsterdam district of Bijlermeer that was caused by carelessness and secrecy.
Safety is subordinated to the way in which civil aviation is currently being organised.
It is based on competition between private companies that wish to acquire the largest possible share of the passenger market at the lowest possible cost and rates.
Thanks to the absence of tax on kerosene, they already have the edge on transport on the ground.
They prefer to pass on safety costs to the government instead of factoring them into the price of air tickets.
Mrs Foster usually acts as the voice of airline companies in this House and wishes, above all, for the aviation market to grow unhindered.
I have great difficulty with the continuous series of proposals that are based on the survival of an organisational model that will ultimately lead to uncontrollable accidents.
It is time that the EU acts in European airlines' interests since they are one of the most severely affected industries of the events of 11 September.
I fully support this report, therefore, which aims to lift the financial burden for paying for increased security that airports and airlines currently face.
If Europe's airlines are to stay competitive with their American counterparts, they cannot afford to shoulder the additional burden that 11 September has thrown at them.
Indeed, in the present climate where American airlines enjoy massive financial handouts, tax breaks and state aid, it is grossly unfair to expect Europe's airlines to survive, let alone compete, when they are currently compelled to pay for new increased security measures.
I also welcome the move to delay the entry into force of this legislation until 31 December 2003: airlines need time to carry out the necessary retraining and to purchase additional equipment.
Mr President, I vote for this report on financial services, both on my own behalf and as representative of the Pensioners' Party.
Why is that?
Well then, Mr President, when I went to catch my flight at Milan Malpensa airport, instead of the group of pensioners who usually come to see me off, I found the notary, Mr Barbati, who is my own notary. 'What are you doing here, notary?'
I asked him. 'You can hardly be described as a pensioner!'
'I know, Mr Fatuzzo,' he replied, 'but Amendment No 21 in Article 6(3)(b)(i) on page 16/22 of the document places a question mark over the use of a notary when contracts are signed which fall within the scope of the directive.'
For this reason, since the amendment was adopted, I voted for the motion, not least in order to safeguard the jobs of notaries.
.
(DE) The Council's new Article 3(4) is a very remarkable cuckoo in the nest, and a very dangerous one too.
In practice, this article means that, even at a stage when no contract has been entered into - when, for example, information, advertising, offers etc are posted on a web site - it is not sufficient for the service provider to adhere to the laws of the Member State in which he is based; he also has to be familiar with those of the other fourteen, with all their idiosyncrasies.
Furthermore, a service provider would have to set up not just one web site, but fifteen, each tailored to the legislative quirks of the various Member States.
Obstacles of that sort make it scarcely possible to speak in terms of a common internal market!
This article also puts the consumer at a disadvantage, as the legal uncertainty that results from this is more likely to deter businesses from offering their services via the Internet, which, as a medium, is convenient for the consumer.
Like Article 3 (4), Article 16 of the common position envisages an exception - admittedly one with a time limit - to the country-of-origin principle and to the e-commerce directive, in that it permits the Member States to impose national rules on a service provider based in a Member State if the service provider's Member State has not yet transposed the directive.
This totally absurd way of going about things could become a dangerous precedent and should therefore be removed from the text.
(Explanations of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, I voted for the measure tabled by the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Bouwman, who is rightly concerned to protect employees in the event that their employer becomes insolvent. How could I do otherwise?
When are we going to concern ourselves, then, Mr President, with the bad debt of States as regards pensions?
There are many citizens who receive their pensions late: that is bad debt on the part of States.
There are many citizens who, after working for a great many years, receive tiny pensions which amount to starvation rations: that is bad debt on the part of States.
There are many widows who receive less than half the pension their deceased husband received: is this not just as serious employer bad debt, which I hope Mr Bouwman will proceed to settle in some fashion one day.
The only reason why we voted in favour of these amendments is because the obligation to 'set up an institution which guarantees that the workers concerned are paid outstanding claims' is supposed to ensure, throughout the European Union, that workers who have lost their jobs as a result of their employer going bankrupt will receive at least partial legal compensation payments.
This protection is, however, scandalously limited.
The texts of the European institutions themselves stipulate that certain categories are excluded from this protection such as home-helpers and fishermen who are paid from shared proceeds.
Additionally, however, there is an amendment which states that 'Member States may set limitations to the responsibility of the guarantee institutions'.
In other words, if a general obligation is defined, the States can do what they want, and essentially place a ceiling on compensation payments paid to workers.
As regards the financing of these guarantee funds, Amendment No 6 hypocritically states that 'the employers shall contribute to the financing, unless it is fully covered by the public authorities'.
Although it is, without doubt, better, in terms of the protection of workers, for the public authorities to pay compensation in the event of bankruptcy of the employer, in any?
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) At first reading, the Council regrettably chose not to accept some of the proposals that we had tabled and that Parliament had adopted which sought to achieve better protection for employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, amending the 1980 directive to enable it to cope with the frequent cases of insolvency in the European Union.
Although the Council position already represents an improvement on the previous situation, it was necessary to insist on the amendments designed to include, in the scope of the directive, new forms of work and new labour relations and the directive's extension to cover severance pay, as laid down in ILO Convention No 173(6).
The Council position remained set on cases provided for in national legislation.
Although we voted for the amendments tabled in the report, we are bound to regret the fact that it did not go further, and specifically that it opted for reaching a compromise solution with the Commission, which will carry out an in-depth study and hold a joint public hearing with Parliament as early as this year on the situation of workers in light of new forms of labour relations.
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Pack's report on the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.
Ah yes, I dreamed about Mrs Pack, Mr President.
Strangely, however, in the dream, Mrs Pack was married to three Members of the European Parliament who are sporting champions: Mr Mennea, Mr Messner and Mr Vatanen.
In the dream, however, Mr President, Mrs Pack picked up a club and set about beating me, she beat me, reproaching me: 'What are you going to say tomorrow at the European Parliament when you explain why you voted for the motion?'
It is strange, Mr President, but, when I woke up this morning, all my bones were aching.
Even though the beating happened in the dream, I am still aching.
This is an excellent initiative and I fully endorse the goal of highlighting the educational value of sport.
Much can be gained from establishing partnerships between sporting organisations and educational establishments.
As a Member from Ireland, I am particularly pleased that this proposal is to dedicate 2004 to Education through Sport.
This will coincide with the Irish Presidency of the Union in the first half of 2004 and I can assure colleagues that Ireland will play a most prominent role in many of the actions envisaged.
Ireland has a long sporting tradition, and in particular an amateur and voluntary tradition.
We are all aware that a number of important sporting events will take place in 2004.
The European Football Championships will be held as well as the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.
The proposal envisages 2003 as a preparatory year, with some activities beginning to coincide with the academic year 2003-2004.
Ireland will play host to the Special Olympics in 2003, and the contribution of the EU to the organisation of this event is also worthy of praise.
This will be a unique sporting and cultural experience for the athletes taking part, from 160 international delegations all over the world.
It is crucial that we continue to use all possible means to ensure that we make better use of sporting values to improve educational programmes, specifically of what is known as 'parallel education' and to consolidate and expand, in this framework, a close partnership between educational and sporting organisations, thereby giving full expression to educational values and to the enormous educational potential of sport.
We therefore support the initiative of organising a European Year of Education through Sport in 2004 - a year in which the European football championships will take place and in which the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Athens.
This is another reason why we voted for the courageous report by Mrs Pack.
The aims of the European Year, amongst which we would highlight making education and sports organisations aware of the need for cooperation, highlighting the importance of voluntary activity and providing incentives for including sporting activities in school curricula - and also the financial means to be provided - a financial package of EUR 11.5 million - clearly show the importance of this new line of awareness-raising action.
We want to attach the greatest priority, however, to greater efficiency in this field and this is why we support the amendments in favour of substantially increasing the financing of local, national and transnational actions and of the initiatives of European organisations working in the educational and sports sectors.
It must be stated, however, that many of the aims pursued with the European Year would not ultimately be achieved if we saw that a significant part of those resources were being spent on more 'surveys and studies'.
I fully support this report which recognises the diverse advantages that sport has to offer, from improving social skills and integration to working with and including voluntary organisations.
Here in the EU, we constantly reiterate the need to promote integration: sport is the ideal way to achieve this.
For too long sporting activities have come second to so-called formal education.
To relegate sporting activities is to deny the host of benefits that sport brings; it is something at which all people can succeed, regardless of class and race.
So, the promotion of sport also bolsters and enhances other Community projects, ranging from the fight against racism and social exclusion, to the inclusion of disabled people.
Since so many of the EU's goals can be partially realised by promoting sports, the EU must promote sport as a functional as well as recreational activity.
Lastly, once Member States begin to co-operate more in this domain and demonstrate how they have mainstreamed sport into their education systems, we will finally come to realise the full potential that sport has to offer.
Mr President, I voted for this report, which refers to the extension of the Tempus III programme.
The words 'Tempus fugit' have come to mind.
What has 'Tempus fugit' got to do with anything?
It is written on many clocks.
I am sorry, Mr President, but I reflected that, with the passing of time, young people and workers become pensioners if they are lucky.
Therefore, the invitation I extend - to myself and also to Mr Ojeda Sanz and to his Tempus III programme - is to bear in mind that we need to think harder, work harder, do more and make greater efforts to ensure that young people - who will, if they are lucky, become pensioners one day in the future - are also able to live comfortably during this period of their lives.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report, and did so because I believe that tourism's future lies in the development of sustainable tourism which takes account of ecological considerations and promotes them.
In Austria, which is a tourist destination, the principle of sustainable development is of primary importance to the tourist sector.
Protection and maintenance of the countryside and of sensitive regions have demonstrated their potential for the future and are characteristic of our country's practice of what is termed 'soft tourism'.
I therefore expressly welcome the Commission's initiative to develop and implement an Agenda 21 to promote sustainable development of tourism in Europe.
The proposal that has now been put forward for TEMPUS III, to incorporate the aim of 'promoting understanding between and rapprochement of cultures and developing free and flourishing civil societies', exactly along the lines laid down in the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, which established the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, is of great importance.
It is also of specific importance that this should be done at a time when it is intended to extend the Tempus III programme from next year to encompass countries and territories also covered by the MEDA regulation (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon) and no longer apply only to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - currently covered by the Cards and Tacis programmes.
Indications from the experience of the Tempus I and II programmes for trans-European cooperation in university studies have been largely positive, which is why we are confident about the innovations now being proposed for Tempus III, although with the reservation that a thorough and objective assessment must be carried out.
We have confidence in the various evaluations of the Tempus programme, which show that this is a valid instrument for fostering mutual understanding, and we consider that it is precisely in this spirit that all its programming of activities should be undertaken.
One of the good things in this life is that Dante's is not the only comedy; Parliament puts one on from time to time.
The report and the motion for a resolution on a European strategy for tourism, an industry which is hugely important to the economy of and employment in the European Union and which is widely neglected, contains a number of excellent points, which is why I shall vote in favour of it.
However, I should like to add the following:
First: the European Union should revert to the idea of a special programme on tourism, such as the PHILOXENIA proposal which came up against opposition from a number of Member States.
Secondly: one specific aspect of Community policy should be support for small and medium-sized enterprises in tourist areas which risk being bled to death by the major tour operators in the European Union.
Thirdly: we need a broader-based policy to reconcile tourist developments with the history, landscape and specific traditions of individual tourist areas, many of which have already been disfigured by impersonal, industrial tourist developments.
The MPF (Mouvement pour la France) Members voted against the Torres Marques report, which calls for a European tourism policy.
We believe that this area is the responsibility of the national, even regional or local, authorities, and that cooperation should not be forced.
Yet the Commission and the European Parliament have been working relentlessly for years, firstly with a 'communication', then a 'White Paper', at an 'informal meeting', then an 'own-initiative report', to take over this responsibility.
The Commission has set up its own internal 'Tourism Unit' and Parliament has allocated responsibility for tourism to one of its parliamentary committees.
They succeeded in slipping the words 'tourism for all' into the conclusions of the recent Council meeting in Bruges.
The Spanish Presidency has just produced a 'working document' on the subject, which even mentions the 'ethical dimension' of tourism.
They all want European competences, European funding and European staff for tourism.
The Torres Marques report that we examined today concludes by calling on the Convention considering the future of the Union to propose that the tourist sector has 'a solid legal basis enabling it to give force to Community measures'.
Is this not an admission that everything that has been done so far in this area has no legal basis?
I welcome the Commission's initiative in proposing ways to boost our tourist industry, which is an industry able to make a major contribution to local, regional and national economies.
I am fortunate to live in one of the most beautiful places in the Union, namely West Cork in Ireland.
I mention this simply to indicate that I am fully aware of the benefits that carefully-developed tourism can bring to a region.
We must get the balance right: protect the natural beauty, heritage and environment that give an area its attraction, while at the same time make the most of natural assets to improve the local economy.
I note that the Spanish Presidency took the initiative to organise a special Informal Council of Tourism Ministers.
I welcome in particular the decision hold a seminar on the fringes involving the tourism stakeholders.
The tourism industry in Europe was extremely hard hit in the past year following 11 September.
Some Member States, including Ireland, were additionally afflicted by the foot and mouth crisis.
Any assistance that Europe can offer to kick-start the industry is very positive.
I await the bringing forward of specific programmes and measures in which stakeholders in the tourist industry can participate.
. (SV) Tourism is an important engine for the development of economic activity in many parts of Europe.
Naturally, we support the promotion of cooperation within the tourist sector so that this can be developed both economically and socially throughout Europe.
Subsidiarity is nonetheless something we safeguard and, for that reason, we are abstaining from voting on this report.
The introduction of a legal basis and a common framework for tourism would encroach too far upon the subsidiarity principle.
. (NL) There is no common public opinion in Europe.
Some issues are considered extremely important in one EU Member State, while they leave the inhabitants of another Member State completely cold.
If there are opinions on certain topics, they will be completely contradictory or they will be the same right across the groups.
Important examples of this are tobacco growing, the role of the regional funds, the funding of the common agricultural policy, the choice between Brussels and Strasbourg as the EP's meeting place, tax facilities for remote islands, ocean fishing and tourism.
When the topic of tourism is raised in the EP, this invariably revolves around the issue of transferring the income from the people living in northern Member States to the Mediterranean beaches.
Far less attention is paid to the effects on the environment, traffic, safety and consumer protection, although there are many difficulties in those areas specifically.
These problems in particular are only considered to be the responsibility of the local and regional governments, while the 'tourist as a milch cow' is seen as something that falls within the EU's remit.
In practice, we always adopt documents that underline the economic importance of areas that rely heavily on tourism for their revenues.
In many cases, these areas want even more tourists, preferably spread equally across the four seasons.
It is only out of solidarity with the inhabitants of economically weak regions that I am not voting against these proposals, but I am of the view that we do not solve anything by adopting such paper proposals.
.
(DE) Tourism's future lies in the development of sustainable tourism which takes account of ecological considerations and promotes them.
In Austria, which is a tourist destination, the principle of sustainable development is of primary importance to the tourist sector.
Protection and maintenance of the countryside and of sensitive regions have demonstrated their potential for the future and are characteristic of our country's practice of what is termed 'soft tourism'.
I therefore expressly welcome the Commission's initiative to develop and implement an Agenda 21 to promote sustainable development of tourism in Europe.
It is to be hoped that this package of measures will mark a further step towards realising a European form of tourism that respects the environment and conserves resources.
Tourism is now already an important economic sector in Europe and also has very high potential for development over the next few years.
The Commission's statement contains quite a few sound proposals as to how employment and the dynamism of the sector can be promoted further.
An open coordination method and a strengthened role for the advisory tourist committee would be important factors in this connection.
We also welcome the fact that tourism is to be made sustainable in the long term through a European Agenda 21 for tourism.
We believe, however, that the current report does not accord sufficient respect to the subsidiarity principle.
Setting up a European framework programme for tourism would place a further burden on the EU budget, which is already overstretched.
Nor is it possible to give tourism policy it own legal basis in the Treaties.
Even if there is a need for coordination, tourism can be dealt with at national and regional levels, for example when it comes to marketing.
The report also appears to lack confidence in the sector's own capacity for development.
The tourism industry is important for the future of all EU Member States' economies and it is vital that the EU focuses its attention on tourism's future.
Indeed, over the next ten years, employment in this industry is set to increase by a massive 15%.
The tourism industry has benefited from the single currency and its continued growth is directly linked to the fact that EU citizens now possess more disposable income.
However, we must not rest on our laurels but ensure that tourism remains dynamic and that this growth does not stagnate.
This is why I fully endorse this report.
Tourism should become treaty based, not so that operators incur excessive regulation - indeed, the growth of the industry depends upon its ability to innovate independently - but so that it is seen as a serious European issue.
This would also establish some kind of long-term and binding EU tourism strategy.
This will guarantee that European tourism stays on target and caters for the future needs of Europe's holiday-makers.
. (FR) I voted for Mrs Torres Marques' report and I congratulate her on her excellent work as rapporteur.
The tourist sector is of vital importance to the European Union, which is the world's most important tourist destination.
Tourism contributes to our economy and societies in many ways: creating employment, boosting European territorial development, and promoting cultural exchange between European citizens.
In proposing a planning framework and practical measures to promote tourism, the Commission is recognising its importance and tackling a number of problems facing the European tourist sector, caused, in particular by increased international competition.
I believe there is only one way to combat this competition: quality.
I am convinced that the Commission must be guided by this imperative need for quality in the field of tourism.
That is why, for example, I drafted proposals in favour of vocational training in the tourist industry, in order to develop skills in this important employment sector.
I am sorry, however, that the Commission proposal is not more ambitious. I would like to see a commitment to reducing the VAT rate for services in the restaurant sector and possibly other tourist sectors ...
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I think Dante will turn over in his grave at hearing himself compared to Mr Fatuzzo, but thank you in any case, Mr President.
I have to say that I voted for the GrÃ¶ner report on a new impetus for European youth, page 8 of which tells us that Mr GrÃ¶ner is of the opinion that political parties should do their bit to involve young people too, in particular encouraging them to stand for political appointments at local, national and European level.
I agree with this, Mr President, but there is one problem: how am I going to get young people to stand for the Pensioners' Party?
That is the first question which springs to mind.
The answer, Mr President, is that the Pensioners' Party has a section called 'Young people for pensioners', and it has a great many young members on its books and in the assemblies where it has been elected.
Thank you for allowing me to make this point, which I could not omit to do on this occasion.
The motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport contains a number of fine proposals.
However, whether or not it will have any degree of success in transforming the bleak future facing young people throughout Europe, as expressed either in their indifference towards the process of European integration or in the protests staged by its more progressive sections during European Council summits, is debatable.
This sort of transformation cannot be based simply on specific, fragmented measures; it requires a sea change in Community policies: we need to ditch budgetary prudence in favour of employment, we need to ditch privatisation and support state education, we need to ditch the policy of persecution and introduce a support framework for young people in a spiral of drug and alcohol dependency and we need to ditch the idea of fortress Europe and start integrating immigrants' children.
. (PT) The rapporteur's analysis of the White Paper is to be welcomed, although it makes some controversial and unnecessary proposals.
Nevertheless, the report highlights various important aspects of the process, specifically where it states that the White Paper does not meet the expectations created by the consultations that were held in terms of either quality or quantity since, despite the organisations participating in the consultation process complaining about the proposals that were not included and even those that were considered and which can be found in Annex 1, these were not included in the White Paper. Examples of these are issues relating to education and employment.
Furthermore, the White Paper twists the opinions of young people to say the opposite of what was meant.
An example of this is the use of the expression 'the capacity for adaptation' of young people to a complex
. (PT) Our view of the White Paper presented by the European Commission on 'a new impetus for European Youth' is that we largely agree with the criticism of our colleagues in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport who condemned the Commission for having initiated the consultation process with pre-established ideas and for conducting the process in a way designed to guarantee that these ideas were accepted.
Furthermore, we also consider it crucial to ensure that, in future, greater attention is paid to the needs and interests of young people across the board in the various policies of the Union.
Lastly, we also regret the absence in the appropriate chapter of the White Paper of an explicit reference to the numerous Community programmes - from the Structural Funds to programmes such as Urban, Equal or even Meda - which have for a long time been pivotal instruments of Community policies and in which we must increasingly promote a sufficient number of projects that will benefit young people.
We are therefore very happy to support the report by Mrs GrÃ¶ner.
. I fully endorse this report, which calls for a revitalisation of European youth policy.
Whilst young people have not been entirely marginalised in the project of European integration, there has not been enough sustained emphasis on their importance for the future of Europe.
Indeed, the future of European integration depends upon the interest and support of the next generation, and since war is not at the forefront of young people's minds - and will no longer act as a catalyst for integration - it is vital that we include them now.
A stronger European youth policy can help to bolster and reinforce measures taken at national level to deal with universal problems such as drugs and alcohol.
Finally, since all Member States face the lamentable situation of increasing voter apathy - particularly amongst the young - the call for more young political engagement is most welcome.
It is more useful to look for a pan-EU solution to this problem than for Member States to seek a solution individually.
Mr President, I do not think there is any harm in making people smile while explaining the reasons for one's vote.
I voted for the report which proposes to appoint Mr Lucas Papademos Vice-President of the European Central Bank.
Why did I vote for the report, Mr President?
Well, I had another dream last night.
I dreamt that I was invited to lunch at Lucas Papademos' house - in Athens, of course - and that he let me take a bathe with him in his swimming pool, but the pool contained euro coins, not water.
Like Uncle Scrooge, he was swimming in euro coins, and he said to me: 'My dream is that all the candidate countries will adopt the euro immediately: indeed, the whole world should adopt the euro.'
So, Mr President, what better candidate could there be than Lucas Papademos?
Moreover, when I woke up, I found that my pockets were full of euros because I had gone swimming with all my clothes on, being too embarrassed to take my clothes off among the euro coins.
Mr Fatuzzo, last night I, too, had a dream.
I dreamt that Parliament eventually got to decide on a change to its Rules of Procedure.
. (FR) I abstained from voting on the appointment of Mr Papademos as Vice-President of the European Central Bank, both out of a desire not to be directly involved in the implementation of the euro, but also because of certain statements made by the candidate during his hearing.
Several times, he evoked the principle of accountability to which the ECB is supposed to adhere, as if it were a given fact.
I would like to emphasise that this principle does not exist, as accountability normally goes hand in hand with penalties.
In fact, the ECB is bound merely by the obligation to report to the European Parliament.
What is more, these reports are not even transparent, as we do not know how the Governors voted in the ECB Governing Council.
Secondly, Mr Papademos confirmed that the ECB was considering modifying voting modalities in the Governing Council, which could have been anticipated from the draft Treaty of Nice.
In particular, we appear to be moving towards abandoning equality in governors' votes, a rule which was made much of originally but which, in practice, has had many negative repercussions on decisions, particularly with regard to interest rates.
Another Maastricht illusion bites the dust!
Mr President, as you see, people are starting to copy Mr Fatuzzo's explanations of vote. I am pleased that they are following my example because they are calling for the European Parliament to have a single seat: not a seat in Brussels, one in Strasbourg and one in Luxembourg but a single seat.
I support that demand, Mr President, and I put this question to you: what costs more, the few minutes Mr Fatuzzo spends delivering explanations of vote or having three seats for the European Parliament
with three buildings, and three offices for each Member and each employee.
If we succeed in having a single seat for the European Parliament, I would be willing to stop delivering explanations of vote in celebration of the major saving made.
That is where the saving needs to be made, not on Mr Fatuzzo's minute-long speeches.
Mr President, I believe we are here to discuss serious matters, not to make jokes.
We have voted for the Parliamentary budget estimate at a time when Parliament has also asked to know the cost of the three seats, in a report which we adopted last month and sent to the European Convention on the Future of Europe.
We feel that this vote is important and that, by voting for the Stenmarck report, we are highlighting what President Chirac would call the preposterous situation of our working methods: three seats and a tremendous waste of public money.
That is why a group of MEPs now want to mark this vote by delivering explanations of vote, in the hope that their message will reach the Convention, whose eminent representatives are indeed sitting right here in this venue.
The message is this: give us one workplace, a single seat in Brussels.
Mr President, I too have voted in favour of the Stenmarck report, despite the fact that next year, a large proportion of the costs will once again be spent on buildings in Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg.
If the awful developments in the Netherlands over the past few weeks have taught us anything, it is that there is an enormous chasm between the citizens and their elected representatives.
This does not only apply to the Netherlands, but also to France, for example.
The European Parliament's travelling circus is one of the symbols of waste and power politics to which citizens are opposed.
Let us indeed persuade the Convention to call for an end to this mad situation.
The European Parliament can organise its work more cheaply and more effectively by meeting in one place.
This would send a strong message to the European citizens that we are taking their concerns seriously.
This building could become a European university.
I suggest we call it the Fatuzzo University.
Mr President, you mentioned a change to the Rules of Procedure in your response to Mr Fatuzzo.
I would remind you that the role of court jester is an essential one!
The parliamentary jester probably plays the same role, and perhaps we would be better off listening to him entertaining us rather than obsessing over matters of seats, which fuels populism more than you think.
Mr President, I too have voted in favour of the Stenmarck report. This report makes it abundantly clear that more than one third of our budget disappears into the ridiculous travelling circus between the three chairs of the European Parliament.
The costs, however, are not only financial.
Needless to say, it is a total nightmare from an organisational point of view too.
The French Government has decided that Air France should not operate any direct flights between Amsterdam and Strasbourg, so to get here is a disaster on its own.
It is apparently possible to build a TGV to Disneyland but not to Strasbourg.
The biggest problem with the travelling circus, however, is political.
As Parliament, we must monitor the Commission and the Council, but they are based in Brussels.
This simply undermines our political credibility, and we must settle this matter as an absolute priority.
Needless to say, we should try to do this before the enlargement, for then we will still be able to give the French something else by way of compensation.
I am prepared to strike a good deal on this. The Convention should now make this a priority, so that this ridiculous travelling circus is done away with.
Mr President, I too voted in favour of Mr Stenmarck's report, which is very sound and makes clear the costs of all this taking to the road.
We must highlight this issue and discuss it in the Convention and in this House.
I visit schools every week and, every time without exception, I am asked the question: why do you persist in moving between Brussels and Strasbourg?
They know nothing about the EU, they perhaps do not know who President Prodi is, but they know that we move between Brussels and Strasbourg, and they think that that is insane.
So do I.
We make ourselves a laughing-stock. We are like a travelling theatre company.
Because we operate in different places, the Council and others can say that, yes, it is a travelling Parliament and does not have very much influence.
The cost is enormous. The waste of resources for ourselves as MEPs is also considerable, and there are always problems in getting here, what with cancelled and delayed planes etc.
We need to make this beautiful building into something permanent.
A Fatuzzo institute is a really excellent idea.
It must have a significantly more important function than at present, however, so that, in the future, we can put our energies into the important political issues and not into travelling between Parliament's two cities.
Mr President, I believe that, as my fellow Members, Mrs van der Laan and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, have quite rightly said, this matter is, of course, eminently political.
I have been an advocate of Strasbourg for many years, along with my radical colleagues, but I feel that the deterioration in transport links and a number of services now makes it impossible to support Strasbourg.
It is a question of political dignity.
Obviously, changes need to be made.
The plenary Chamber in Brussels, which certainly looks more like a Supreme Soviet than a Parliament, will have to be taken down.
We will also, however, have to take action with regard to the Parliamentary calendar for the coming year.
The Brussels part-sessions must be given real dignity.
We must ensure that they are of the same standard as our part-sessions here in Strasbourg.
We must therefore at least double the length of the part-sessions, and we shall make every endeavour to ensure that that happens during the next session.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, irrespective of the vote we have each cast regarding this report, I feel that clarification is necessary, for there are very many - maybe not all but certainly very many - Members who are burdened by this fact of having three seats and particularly by the way our work is carried out alternately in Brussels and Strasbourg.
There are problems of huge administrative costs, there are staffing costs which must not be underestimated, the level of organisation has fallen, which means disorganisation, and procedures are lengthy to administer; then there is concern, the result, in some cases, of anger and disappointment, on the part of the citizens when they are informed of this situation.
These, therefore, are the reasons for our - differing but united - votes on the issue.
Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Stenmark report and would like to add that we all know that the costs of enlargement cannot at present be estimated, but that we have to take care that they do not exceed their limits, as the European public will take an unsympathetic view.
That means that we must make savings.
We often, and passionately, discuss the costs of translation, which are high and likely to rise in future.
We should instead be working towards being able to reduce the costs of a seat for Parliament.
The public does not understand how we can presume to say that we can solve Europe's problems when we are unable to agree on a location.
Mr President, before the Members of the European Parliament and the citizens who, in order to be able to work properly and express their opinions, are raising an issue concerning the European Parliament and the fact that a third of the budget is being used to maintain a circus which is of no use to anyone, this is being held up as an example of populism.
It is precisely those people who do not want to respond to this criticism and who do not want to see the taxes paid during the years of Realpolitik called into question, who have pulled the wool over the eyes of their own countries and unwittingly promoted the cause of those who have constantly upheld these causes even though they have been met with silence every time; we, however, feel that this can be, that it is a practical political initiative which is in the interests of all the citizens.
Mr President, I too voted for the Stenmarck report, which - as a number of other Members have already pointed out - reveals the costs of an absurd situation.
I feel that it is impossible to explain to any European citizen now - not 20 or 40 or 50 years ago - why we still have two seats.
This is an irrational, idiotic situation, not just from the financial point of view but also in terms of the practical organisation of Parliament's work.
I believe that Parliament must issue a clear signal, and one way to do this, as Mr Dupuis pointed out, is by starting to increase the size of the Brussels part-sessions, calling for a situation that no longer has any sense to be eliminated and for the European Parliament to make sense outside this House too, in other words to be a Parliament with a single seat.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's seat and meeting place on historic ground here in Strasbourg is certainly significant.
I do think, though, that this historical significance, by reason of which this long fought-over plot was sought out in the first place, gives us another task for the future: to enable Europe's citizens to continue to understand what Europe is all about.
Today, the man in the street asks us on various occasions why we cannot agree on a place to meet; this argument from history might well have been justified in the past, but cannot, I believe, have any validity in the future.
I believe it will be far more meaningful to make clear to people our desires for the future and the decisions we take about it here.
It surely cannot be that we are, at one and the same time, deciding on packages of austerity measures while spending a third of this House's costs on travel.
Mr President, I am afraid that Mr Duhamel cannot tell the difference between what is populist and what is popular.
If only the European citizens could be familiar with the issue and decide on this problem impacting on the European Parliament's budget, I feel that not even in France would there be even a tiny minority in favour of continuing with similar expenditure and the consequences - which have already been mentioned - for Parliament's work.
It is not just a question of money: the dignity of Parliament, of its work, of its organisation and of its individual Members depends on it too.
I therefore thank the Members who have been willing to stay behind a little longer to talk about this matter.
In actual fact, I believe that Parliament must shoulder the responsibility for making these decisions, maybe even initiating an open debate with the Council, and that it must be prepared to take the matter to the Court of Justice as a practical display of its unwillingness to continue to travel between three different seats.
I find the budget laid aside for the nonsensical tracking backwards and forwards from Brussels to Strasbourg almost impossible to support.
There is no reason for such absurd peregrinations on political or economic, organisational or geographical grounds.
It leads to inefficiency and waste.
Unfortunately too many of the public believe this nonsense is a decision of Parliament and are not aware it is the product of the unholy deal done for the worst of all reasons at Edinburgh in 1992 under the presidency of John Major.
Britain got a declaration on subsidiarity, an opt-out on the social chapter, thankfully overturned by the Labour victory in 1997.
Germany got the recognition of Croatia and former Yugoslavia and, in consequence, a series of interlocking civil wars the results of which colour European history still today, and hence the perpetuation of an absurdity in Strasbourg we all hoped would finally end.
We are now left stranded in Strasbourg until Parliament finds the political will to exert its own best interests and remove itself to Brussels with the odd symbolic sojourn in Strasbourg for formal occasions.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on progress and perspectives in immigration and asylum policy.
I am pleased to welcome Mr Rajoy Brey to introduce the debate on behalf of the Council.
I am pleased he has taken the time to be here today for this delicate and sensitive question.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the European Parliament for giving me this opportunity to appear here to give my assessment of the progress we have made during the four and a half months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in what I believe to be one of the key areas of the European Union's Justice and Home Affairs policy; immigration and asylum.
The progressive development of a common immigration and asylum policy is an essential part of the area of freedom, security and justice we Europeans have proposed creating in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This immigration and asylum policy must be based on a balanced and global approach.
This global framework, in accordance with the Conclusions of the Tampere European Council, must be founded on four fundamental premises: the adequate management of migratory flows, the quest for fair treatment of third-country nationals, cooperation with countries of origin and the establishment of a European asylum system.
Making progress on these four guidelines was the inspiration behind the Spanish programme of objectives and priorities for the Presidency of the Council of the Union.
All of this taking good account of the renewed impetus provided by the Laeken European Council of 14 and 16 December 2001, which put the emphasis on the necessary balance between the protection of refugees in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1951, the legitimate aspiration for a better life and the Union and its Member States' capacity for receiving refugees.
Furthermore, we have tried to prioritise those instruments which the Laeken Conclusions considered most urgent to adopt, such as the Global Action plan to combat illegal immigration.
In accordance with these ideas, I am going to try to organise my comments on the progress over these months in the field of asylum and immigration by dealing with what I believe must be the two main sources of inspiration for this policy: progress towards a European asylum system and the appropriate regulation of migratory flows, in accordance with the following premises: respect for legality, the fair treatment of third-country nationals, cooperation with States of origin and the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking.
On the establishment of a common European asylum system, we have taken very important steps at these last two formal Councils of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.
I would like to highlight the directive establishing the minimum rules for the acceptance of asylum seekers in the Member States.
This proposal intends to guarantee that asylum seekers arriving in our States enjoy a minimum level of rights essential to a dignified life, including housing, free movement, family regrouping, schooling and education for children, access to employment and professional training.
The Council, following its meeting of 25 April, has achieved a general political orientation on the text of the directive and now we must study the proposals contained in Parliament's opinion and establish the position of the fifteen States with regard to the contents of the opinion.
In this same field of asylum, I would like to concentrate on another legislative instrument, which we approved on 28 February and which seems to me to be extremely important: the Council Regulation establishing certain rules for the implementation of Regulation No 2725/2000 on the creation of the "Eurodac" system.
Having created the Eurodac system in December 2000, implementation rules became necessary to establish the procedures for identifying asylum seekers by means of an electronic comparison of their fingerprints.
This will facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention which, as you well know, determines the Member State responsible for the examination of asylum applications.
In the second section of my speech on the progress made so far during the six months of our Presidency, I am going to focus on the key elements of our immigration policy, which is governed by the central idea of the appropriate management of migratory flows, which includes both the idea of legally regulating those flows in accordance with the fair treatment of third-country nationals, and combating clandestine immigration, in particular human trafficking, governed by the idea of cooperation with countries of origin.
In this respect, we have tried to make progress with the gradual unification of our visa systems.
To this end, at the General Affairs Council on 18 February, both regulations were approved, establishing a uniform model for visas and a uniform model for the form for issuing a visa granted by Member States to holders of a travel document not recognised by the Member State issuing that form.
At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council of 24 April, we supplemented these rules with the Council Decision approving a uniform model for visa applications.
Together with this unification, we have also achieved a general approach for the Regulation establishing a uniform model residence permit for third-country nationals.
Amongst other advantages, this regulation will help in the recognition of documents by police border control authorities, which will benefit their holders and will help with better detection of false documents.
Secondly, in order to financially support certain actions proposed by the Member States aimed at promoting cooperation and coordination between national administrations and the transparent application of Community legislation, in the fields of immigration, asylum and borders, at the last Council in April all the Member States reached a general agreement for the approval of the ARGO Programme, which will be in force for five years and will receive EUR 25 million.
Thirdly, there is no doubt that the appropriate management of flows requires the adoption of effective measures to combat clandestine immigration, in particular human trafficking.
In this respect, the Conclusions of the Laeken European Council urged the approval of a Global Plan, which we were able to discuss at the informal meeting of Ministers in Santiago de Compostela and which we formally adopted at our meeting of Ministers on 28 February.
Very much inspired by the Commission Communication of November 2001, the Plan is designed to be a programming guide, which will help with the planning of actions which we can start to implement in order to effectively combat the phenomenon of illegal immigration.
Allow me to briefly explain the main actions and measures included in this Plan.
Firstly, visa policy; secondly, the promotion of the exchange and analysis of information relating to the problem of illegal immigration; thirdly, the plan deals with a series of measures prior to the crossing of borders; fourthly, the plan focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of border controls; fifthly, another aspect dealt with by the plan are the policies of readmission and repatriation; sixthly, the operative role of Europol in the fight against human trafficking will be increased; and finally the Plan includes many repressive measures to combat these crimes.
It is now a question of making progress with the necessary protection and assistance for victims, the fight against illegal contracting by employers, the confiscation of the proceeds from this trafficking and of the means of transport used, and to make it obligatory for transporters to meet the costs of the repatriation of foreigners who do not meet the requirements for legal entry.
This plan has borne fruit, ladies and gentlemen.
Thus, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council following its approval, we adopted certain measures in compliance with it.
Likewise, the Council Conclusions on illegal immigration and human trafficking by sea. These Conclusions seek an integral response by the European Union to the massive arrival of immigrants by sea, on the basis of the notion that migratory issues must have a prominent place in the EU's external relations.
In my opinion, this is a fundamental issue which we must be very conscious of and, above all, we must act accordingly and as quickly as possible.
I repeat, migratory issues must have a prominent place in the EU's external relations.
Turning more directly to Justice and Home Affairs issues, we are going to prioritise measures such as the carrying out of a study to improve the control of sea borders, prevention, and the adoption of operative measures, in particular the exchange of information, which is already yielding very good results, and we are going to strongly urge States of origin and transit States to combat human trafficking and readmit illegal immigrants who leave their territory, amongst other things.
Secondly, as our Heads of State and Government requested in Laeken, we have gone ahead with the determination of a list of third countries with which we must negotiate new readmission agreements, setting the general criteria for that determination.
During April we have also carried out a risk assessment operation in the main airports of the European Union, known as the RÃO operation, whose results, which I presented during the Council held on 25 April, will allow us to improve the cooperation between the border control authorities of the Member States and Europol, and also to ascertain the methods, routes and other procedures employed for the clandestine introduction of immigrants into European Union territory.
Also with a view to this type of cooperation, during this six-month period, the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Borders and Asylum has met for the first time, with the participation of the Heads of the External Border Control Services.
This meeting, which is to take place periodically every six months, has established a strategy for improving the operative cooperation of Member States in relation to the control of external borders, in aspects such as risk assessment systems, the situation of our sea borders, and specific training for our agents running border controls.
Furthermore, we have improved the mechanisms to resolve the situation of foreigners who do not fulfil, or who have ceased to fulfil, the conditions for entry or residence, by means of Conclusions on the obtaining of travel documents for the implementation of repatriations.
From another point of view, and as I suggested at the beginning of this speech, in order to manage migratory flows properly, it is essential to promote cooperation between the countries of origin, transit and destination.
In recent months, we have intensified the Union's external relations in this area.
I would very briefly like to mention the contacts we have held.
As a follow-up to the meeting of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 28 February, we held a meeting with the candidate countries during which we dealt, amongst other things, with the control of external borders.
At this meeting, we communicated a catalogue of recommendations and best practices in relation to the control of external borders and admission and expulsion procedures within the Schengen area, which we had approved that same day.
Similarly, and for the first time within the Union, the fifteen Member States held a meeting with the Russian Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, during which we dealt, amongst other things, with the issue of migration, the management of borders and the readmission policy, and we also communicated to the Russian representatives the catalogue of recommendations I mentioned earlier.
Thirdly, at the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Valencia of 22 and 23 April, we dealt with cooperation in the field of the social integration of immigrants, migration and the movement of people, and to this end we approved a regional programme within the Valencia Action Plan.
Furthermore, this Plan indicates the will of the parties to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference focussing on the issue of migration and the social integration of immigrants during the second half of 2003.
Finally, I would like to mention in particular the Conference on Migration, held within the framework of the ASEM process, in Lanzarote, on 4 and 5 April.
This initiative, which stemmed from the Summit of ASEM Heads of State in Peking in October 2000, has served to lay the foundations for dialogue and cooperation between both parts of the world on the general situation of immigration, the management of migratory flows and the fight against illegal immigration.
As a result of this meeting, a Declaration was approved which stresses the need for cooperation between Europe and Asia in order to organise migratory flows in an integrated fashion and which specifies, amongst other aspects, the establishment of a network of national points of contact for continuing the dialogue and developing future actions.
So far my speech has focussed on the concrete results achieved over recent months.
I would also like to stress the significant impetus which has been given by the various working groups to the different legislative instruments, in the field of both asylum and of immigration.
I can confirm that there has been considerable progress on the work on the proposed Council Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for an asylum application, known as Dublin II, or the directive establishing minimum rules on the status of the refugee.
In the same way and in accordance with the modified proposals on the minimum rules for the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status and on family regrouping, which the Commission presented on 30 April, we will promote the continuation of the work to move these issues forward.
As you will be aware, the Commission has recently presented the Green Paper on a Community policy of returning illegal residents and the communication on "Guidelines for the integrated management of external borders", and we will try to ensure that it is studied by the competent bodies of the Council.
Turning to the field of legal immigration, significant progress has been made on the discussion of a proposed directive regulating the status of non-EU long-term residents and the directive relating to the conditions for entry and residence for the purposes of employed and self-employed work.
Under our Presidency a study has begun of a proposed directive on the issuing of short-term residency permits to victims of human trafficking who cooperate with the competent authorities.
Finally, within this section on progress made, I would like to refer to the promotion of European Union action plans with third countries.
In particular, in relation to the dialogue with Morocco, there has been progress in the work of the 'Social Affairs and migrations' group, which held its second meeting on 12 March of this year in Rabat.
I would also like to stress that the High-Level Group on Immigration and Asylum has agreed to send a mission of experts to Morocco to assess a border control programme.
I would like to end my speech by very briefly explaining our work perspectives until 30 June 2002.
At the last sitting of the Council of Ministers on 13 and 14 June, the Spanish Presidency will deal with the issue of creating a Visa Database, with regard to which we have consulted the guidelines of the common system for the exchange of visa information.
In June we intend to present for your approval draft Council Conclusions which will indicate to the Commission which aspects must be considered and examined in the viability study.
This system will represent a further step in the implementation of the Global Plan against illegal immigration and human trafficking and will prevent the issuing of a visa by a consulate of one country of the Union when it has already been refused by another consulate of another Member State.
At the end of this month we expect the results to be presented of a viability study on European border policy which, under the auspices of Italy, is being developed by a working group which also includes representatives from Germany, Belgium, France and Spain.
We also intend to submit a proposal for a decision to the Council on the signing of the readmission agreement negotiated with Hong Kong and the draft negotiation mandate for the Commission in relation to an agreement of this type with the Ukraine.
Furthermore, if during these months sufficient progress is made on the proposed Regulation known as Dublin II, we will submit it for discussion at the final Council of our Presidency.
I would like to end by once again thanking the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino for the fundamental role they have played in these efforts, which would not have been possible without their help.
I would also like to thank Parliament for its dedication and cooperation, which have given great impetus to the European Union's policy on immigration and asylum during the almost five months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the Union.
I believe that the assessment of results and perspectives is positive and I can confirm that we are fulfilling many of those objectives which were contained in our working programme and which I was able to present to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 4 February.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and, in particular, thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President, there are all too many things I have to apologise for, and one of them is that I am not Commissioner Vitorino.
I am standing in for him this afternoon - insofar as that is possible - because he is attending an important meeting in Canada.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate, firstly because we know, as politicians, how important and sensitive all these issues are and how they require honest, transparent and constructive debate and discussion. Secondly, because there is a close connection, as the Vice-President has just made clear, between external relations policy and immigration - both legal immigration and illegal trafficking in human beings - and related issues.
Those were issues that we managed with strong leadership from the Spanish presidency to discuss at the recent meeting of the Mediterranean partners in Valencia, and I shall come back to them later.
I was able to discuss these issues as well myself on a recent visit to the People's Republic of China.
The Commission very much welcomed the conclusions adopted at the Laeken European Council and especially the confirmation of its commitment to the policy guidelines and objectives defined in 1999 in the second semester at Tampere.
The Commission supports the new impetus to reduce the backlog in the fields of immigration and asylum legislation defined in the scoreboard which was established to review progress on the creation of an area of "freedom, security and justice".
We are delighted that the Spanish presidency has given a new dynamism to this process.
It is worthwhile recalling that the main proposals necessary for the implementation of Article 63 of the Treaty and the Tampere conclusions are already on the table.
Therefore it is mainly up to the Council to speed up its work.
The political agreement at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council on the proposal on laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States signified the start of much-needed movement in this direction.
The Commission is once again grateful for the efforts of the Spanish presidency.
Negotiations are under way regarding two other legislative proposals on asylum, namely a Council Regulation on criteria and a mechanism for establishing responsibility for examining asylum applications to replace the Dublin Convention, as well as a Council directive on the qualification and status of persons as refugees or as beneficiaries of subsidiary protection.
The Commission will also pursue the implementation of the Eurodac system as quickly as possible in the hope that Member States will soon make the necessary provisions to take part.
As for the other subjects under discussion, the Commission will continue to contribute to the follow-up and the outcome of all these debates.
In that sense, we warmly welcomed the rapid adoption of the Action Plan on the fight against illegal migration and human trafficking, which was based on our communication.
As promised, the Commission will swiftly take the necessary steps to ensure its implementation.
The first initiatives have already been taken, as the Commission has adopted the Green Paper on a Community return policy on illegal residents.
In view of the highly complex nature and sheer scale of this phenomenon, the primary aim of the Green Paper is to launch a debate and to sound out all the interested parties.
The Commission has also recently launched a communication on the integrated management of the European Union's external borders.
This issue will be considered on a Community-wide basis rather than as a set of national systems and will, I very much hope, map out the route to the longer-term objective of setting up a European corps of border guards or police.
Furthermore, following the Laeken invitation, the Commission tabled a new amended proposal on family reunification on 2 May in order to make it easier to find a consensus on this extremely sensitive issue.
As also requested by the Laeken Summit, the Commission will also shortly bring forward an amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
Furthermore, the Commission supported the willingness expressed in Laeken to better integrate migration policy with the external policy of the Union.
It would therefore welcome any initiative aimed at giving a new perspective to the High Level Working group on Asylum and Immigration that was created by the Council in 1999.
Its mandate merits an update so that it is brought into line with the current situation.
The Commission intends to present a proposal of programme cooperation with third countries before the end of the year.
It will be based on the experience gleaned from the implementation of the new budgetary instrument created by the European Parliament.
I just want to say how much importance both AntÃ³nio Vitorino and I attach to this particular issue: the relationship between the subjects we are debating this afternoon and external policy.
There is plainly an intimate connection between our success, for example, in promoting sustainable development and demographic pressures.
There is clearly an important role for us to play in helping other countries to deal with illegal trafficking in human beings, which is just as much a threat and, in some cases, a greater threat to them than it is to those richer countries which are the targets for those who traffic in human beings.
Over Easter I was in China and was able to take further the discussions that we had begun, thanks to the initiative taken by Zhu Rongji on how we can assist to develop programmes in China, which will make it less likely that people will put themselves into the hands of those who seek to move other human beings around the world, sometimes with fatal consequences, as we saw at Dover a couple of years ago.
We have been very impressed by the positive way in which the Chinese authorities, led, I repeat by Mr Zhu Rongji, have responded to our own ideas, and I hope that we will have in place shortly some viable programmes in areas such as information and training, which will help to deal with a very serious problem for China and for us as well.
This is, of course, a model for what we want to do in other places.
In the field of re-admission, the Commission is about to finalise an agreement with Sri Lanka.
This is the second agreement at Community level of this kind, the first one, I am delighted to say, having being concluded with Hong Kong.
The Commission will continue its efforts to achieve the other agreements for which it has the mandate to negotiate and will table the necessary proposals to extend this approach in as coherent a manner as possible.
Finally, in line with its communications concerning the introduction of open methods of coordination both for immigration and asylum, the Commission will shortly propose the implementation of a European system of information exchange on migration, asylum and countries of origin, as called for by the European Council.
The new action plan on statistics requested by the Council in May of last year, the development of the activities of a virtual European Observatory on migration and the take-over of the Council committee on exchange of information activities by the Commission will all be developed.
With regard to the extremely important question of the integration of migrants, the Commission wants to complement the instruments which have been developed in the fight against discrimination and racism with some new specific initiatives in this field.
This is an exceptionally important area for us and we should not have needed recent electoral manifestations in order to convince us of the importance of this subject.
Once again, I want to thank Parliament for allowing me to fill in for my colleague.
I say, as a fellow Commissioner, that all of us in the Commission are very well aware of the enormous importance of this subject politically, and I am certainly aware of its enormous importance in the discharge of my principal responsibilities in the area of external relations.
Mr President, there is no question that the most developed countries have an inescapable obligation to show solidarity in relation to immigration.
It is also an essential instrument in combating poverty and the social imbalances in the world and, furthermore - and this must be stated clearly - it is necessary to the maintenance of growth and prosperity in our countries.
However, it is the case that migratory flows towards the European Union have increased dramatically in recent times and our capacity for reception is not unlimited.
So much so that it is no exaggeration to say, as the Council has pointed out, that proper management of immigration is Europe's greatest challenge today.
We must ensure that the immigrants we can receive are protected by and subject to the law, that they assume the rights and obligations that implies and that they fully integrate into the society receiving them and share the values on which that society is based with the other citizens.
It is proven that illegality leads to marginalisation.
We must therefore prioritise the fight against the illegal trafficking in human beings, that is, against organised crime and mafias, in close cooperation with the third countries of origin and transit, and we must demand greater commitments from some of them.
I would ask the Commission to produce and present a report to this House on this issue, because the desire to reach readmission agreements is essential in this field.
I agree with Commissioner Vitorino that there is a link between foreign policy and immigration policy.
Both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission are promoting greater cooperation in police and diplomatic areas, including, of course, the visa policy, which I believe - and Commissioner Patten will surely agree with me - can perfectly well fall within the framework of the work to create a common European diplomatic corps.
We must also consider economic aid for specific cases such as the Canary Islands, for example, where there is a shortage of reception centres to deal properly with the flood of refugees and immigrants who find themselves in an illegal situation.
Finally, Mr President, I believe it is time to leave behind demagoguery and irresponsible statements.
My group believes - and I propose - that the time has come for a great European pact on immigration which excludes this issue from party political confrontation.
Mr President, in relation to the words of Mr Galeote, I would like to say that this morning I ate my breakfast with certain comments by the President of the European Council, in which he says that the European Socialists are guilty of promoting, through their policies, the emergence in Europe of extremist and radical movements and that, in contrast, the President of the Spanish Government and the Council expresses his desire to toughen the immigration policy.
For a moment I thought this morning that Mr Rajoy would come here to communicate the good news of a new immigration policy which - according to Mr Aznar - was going to counterbalance these errors of European Socialism which have led to the emergence of the extreme right.
I am delighted to see that this is not the case, that you have settled for an explanation of the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, the main approach of the European Council's proposals over recent months.
I am delighted about this and I am therefore only going to speak about this field.
I believe that we also have differing points of view on this, Minister.
As Mr Patten has said, we have on the table a legislative working programme - but not only that - presented by the Commission following the Tampere conclusions.
Two and a half years after that Council there has been little progress.
You have mentioned some progress and I will return to that.
This has an impact on both the content and on interinstitutional relations.
I am referring to cooperation with Parliament.
I must say, Minister, that we are perplexed by situations such as the one created by the approval in the Council of the proposal on admission conditions for asylum seekers.
We are perplexed because you tell us that you are going to look at what Parliament's proposals are.
I must tell you that they are proposals on a first draft which bears no relation to the one adopted and it will be difficult for us to go on working like this.
We have the same problem with the common rules on entry for residence, the body of rights for third-country citizens.
For us, all of this takes the form of concrete proposed directives the results of which we have not seen during these years following Tampere.
You tell me that there have been results.
I would like to ask you what they are.
The fight against illegal immigration is a part of this immigration policy which is yet to become a common European policy, but I believe that it would be much more effective if it were part of a genuine common structure of immigration policies.
I am in favour of it, but I am also in favour of an immigration policy which is better suited to the needs of the labour market, because otherwise, Minister, this lack of suitability will lead to irregular contracts, or rather a lack of contracts, and I believe that this is the worst of the 'lamada' effects.
Finally, and in line with the working plan proposed by the Commission and which the Council should adopt, I would like to ask the following four questions: What does the Council think of Mr Prodi's proposal with regard to border police?
What does the Council think about the Green Paper on repatriation?
Can you give us a timetable for the implementation of the Tampere proposals?
What does the Council think of their content given the way they have been presented by the Commission?
Mr President, the timeliness of this debate is beyond dispute.
The recent rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in France and the Netherlands shows what happens when governments fail to respond to the challenge of immigration.
We know that, quite apart from the valuable contribution which immigrants bring to our societies in terms of increased cultural diversity, there are sound economic reasons for a policy of managed immigration, such as meeting labour shortages and funding our creaking pension systems.
Indeed, our prosperity will depend on immigration.
The question therefore is: what policy should we adopt to make immigration politically acceptable?
What we must not do, as too many socialist governments have done, is to bury our heads in the sand and refuse to address the challenge.
It is in large part the failure of EU governments to police our borders, to tackle discrimination and xenophobia, and to integrate immigrants harmoniously into our societies that has led to this impasse.
No wonder public concern continues to grow.
The Liberal Democrat approach would be to open the front door a little, by providing legal avenues for immigration, in order better to close the back door to illegal immigration.
