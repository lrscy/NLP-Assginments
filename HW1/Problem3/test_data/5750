Human rights organisations must be able to do their work without hindrance, and their activities will continue to be supported by the Commission in future.
Thank you.
Mr President, Commissioner, once again the European Parliament is being called on to address what is, without doubt, the most problematic of all the countries associated with the European Union under some sort of special relationship which, in the case of Turkey, goes as far as qualifying as a candidate country.
This time it is about what is, even by Turkish standards, an unprecedented case of unhesitating disregard for the basic tenets of the rule of law and democratic intergovernmentalism and, what is worse, under the supervision of a high-ranking judicial officer who ostentatiously confirmed a prevalent Turkish practice and state of affairs, within the framework of which Turkey systematically and blatantly infringes even the most fundamental obligations which it is supposed to have undertaken in order to justify and support its application to join the European Union.
The raid by an anti-terrorist squad on the Human Rights Association of Turkey in Ankara adds yet another black mark to the long, sad list of Turkish repression of political, religious and minority human rights and freedoms in Turkey and belies, without any excuse whatsoever, the extravagant promises and assurances given by each Turkish Government in succession that they are allegedly taking and applying the institutional and other measures needed in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria.
Many hastened to extol these proclamations with superfluous optimism and now obviously realise with equal disappointment that, in treating the Turkish system with understanding and tolerance, they have achieved precisely the opposite effect and have basically encouraged and supported everyone in Turkey who opposes moves to bring the country into line with the recognised moral values of internal legal order and international conduct.
That is why the European Union and, more particularly, the European Parliament, as the elected representative body of its people, must severely and unreservedly condemn this new intolerable incident and the more general standard Turkish stance in the field of human rights and international law and make it perfectly clear to the Turkish Government that any thought of accepting Turkey into the bosom of the European family is out of the question under these circumstances, as the exceptional report by Mr Oostlander quite rightly emphasises.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by making it abundantly clear, on behalf of my group, that we find this raid unacceptable, and we are of course protesting against the fact that police officers and a public prosecutor from the State Security Court in Ankara have been able to take such action in the first place.
We take it for granted that the Turkish Government, in a case such as this, will act in an exemplary way and sort the matter out.
It is quite proper that we should be discussing this here this evening, but I think we should avoid making the mistake of playing the game the way the hawks in Turkey expect us to.
What is actually going on in Turkey at the moment is that the opponents of the EU within the state apparatus, who continue, regrettably, to wield a great deal of power, are full of fear of Turkey ever joining the European Union, when they will no longer be allowed to do those things that have been permitted to them until now.
It is these forces within the apparatus of the Turkish state who have a natural interest in exploiting every opportunity and engage in provocative behaviour as often as possible.
On the day in question, 6 May, a meeting had actually been planned between non-governmental organisations, the Turkish foreign minister, and the minister responsible for human rights issues.
It was on the afternoon of that day that the raid was carried out.
This shows that those forces that actually want to use all available means to create a different mood in Turkey, had deliberately chosen this day to mount an operation that we would regard as unacceptable, with the resultant situation inducing us to hold this evening's debate, in which Turkey would yet again be the subject of much adverse comment, and we would end up doing a favour for those who do not want to see European democracy in Turkey.
The one fact of which we have to take note is that Turkey at present has a government that wants to carry out necessary reforms, and is making the effort to do so; it responded to this raid by saying that everything possible would be done to resolve this case.
For this reason, I would like to ask my fellow Members of this House to help and support those in Turkey who are really campaigning for democracy and human rights, and, when faced with provocations such as this, to be very careful in what they do and not allow themselves to be provoked and misused by the wrong side.
Mr President, I too should like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to express our great disappointment at the search made of the human rights office and take strong exception to this event.
I agree, however, with Mr Ceyhun that we must be cautious in our interpretation of it.
As the Commissioner mentioned, we are in fact seeing an express desire for reform in Turkey and a desire to comply with the political criteria, as required if the country is to embark upon negotiations concerning EU membership.
We saw this with the amendments to the constitution last August, when the death penalty was abolished in peace-time and a series of other freedoms was established. Further reforms are on the way, moreover.
I myself took part in the Turkish National Assembly's symposium at the end of April when it was discussed what changes there needed to be to the Turkish legal system if it were to comply with the political criteria.
What I witnessed was an objective and open debate, in which, for example, legal experts and representatives of the judiciary provided clear and incisive descriptions of the reforms that would guarantee the independence of the courts and the observance of fundamental human rights.
If the National Assembly follows the good advice and adopts reforms that guarantee the independence of a legal system that is also in accordance with human rights, Turkey will be another step on the way towards negotiating for accession to the EU, and - just as importantly - the Turkish population will be guaranteed the fundamental and democratic rights I believe they really desire.
The fact of the matter is, of course, that it is not enough to amend legislation if changes do not also take place in practice. We should then be back to square one, as the Commissioner emphasised, and I think it important that we emphasise this.
It is therefore very sad that we continue to receive reports of torture in Turkish prisons and of other infringements of human rights, including violations of freedom of expression.
The events of 6 May unfortunately show that there are still forces in Turkish society that either do not understand the need for changes or do not approve of them and who act on that basis.
This is unacceptable.
Turkey is a very complex country with many different cultures.
It is also a very dynamic country with major resources and a lot of talent, and continued cooperation between the EU and Turkey is in the interests of both Turkey and the EU.
Membership of the EU requires, however, that specific principles be observed.
We often hear Turkish politicians say that tougher demands are being made upon Turkey than upon other countries where accession to the EU is concerned. This is not the case.
The ten countries that are to accede in May 2004 have had to implement difficult reforms for which there was often little grass-roots support and which were also opposed internally.
For all countries, democracy is a process, and we need to be on our guard against human rights violations and any imbalance between institutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, human rights have yet again been trampled on in Turkey.
With a representative of the Turkish Public Prosecutor's office present, the offices of the IHD in Ankara were searched by the authorities and everything in them seized.
Yet again it was the largest human rights organisation in Turkey that was on the receiving end of this treatment, and, yet again, it was terrorism that served as the pretext for it.
What I ask you is this: how much longer are things to go on like this?
Is this what Turkey's reform process adds up to?
Can it still seriously be believed that it matters to Turkey whether or not it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria?
The Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left protests emphatically against the Turkish authorities' actions.
The latest raid on the IHD is but the last in a series of hostile acts against this human rights organisation.
Let us remind ourselves that, since 1991, over ten members of the IHD have been murdered, and that, in May 1998, the organisation's chairman, Akin Birdal, was gunned down in his office.
In the last parliamentary elections, neither he nor other representatives of HADEP were allowed to stand as candidates.
According to Amnesty International, in the last couple of years alone, over four hundred separate court actions have been commenced against the IHD, to which must be added the innumerable cases brought against individual members.
Mrs Eren Keskin, a lawyer and deputy chairman of the IHD, has just been barred from practising law for a year.
Over and over again, the charge is 'separatist propaganda'.
Is this Turkey's new way of handling human rights?
It was with a great deal of sympathy that we all watched as the reform process in Turkey was inaugurated.
Both in the European Union and among the Turkish people, there were high hopes for a new policy on the part of the Turkish Government, but these hopes have so far been in vain.
Turkey must make changes to critical aspects of its policies, not merely to forms of words, but also in practice.
Only then will it have a realistic prospect of acceding to the EU.
Recent months have shown that there is no shortage of problem areas.
Let us mention first the banning of HADEP, yet another ban imposed on a party that champions in particular the concerns of minorities in Turkey.
Turkey still relies on the banning of political parties as a means of silencing the voices of those who take a critical view of the government's policies.
In the meantime, the DEHAP - the alliance of parties as part of which HADEP contested the latest parliamentary elections - is also threatened with a ban.
Is that, I ask you, democracy? Is that freedom of opinion?
Then there is the legal action against Mrs Leyla Zana, a former member of the Turkish parliament, whose party, the DEP, was also proscribed.
While we must welcome the fact that there is at last a retrial, what does it amount to?
So far, it appears to be a repeat of the proceedings in 1994, which the European Court of Human Rights categorised as unfair.
The judges are, admittedly, no longer military men, but there is a massive military presence in the courtroom.
Even after two days of proceedings, there is no prospect of Mrs Zana being released.
Let us remind ourselves that her offence, for which she was sentenced to fifteen years in jail, was a sentence spoken in the Turkish parliament - in Kurdish, her mother tongue.
Then there is the authorities' continuing arbitrary treatment of the Kurds, who, even after formal changes to the law, are far from being treated as having equal rights.
Harassment and sweeping accusations of separatism continue to be the order of the day.
The use of the Kurdish language, too, is still subject to considerable restrictions.
There continues to be no evidence that Turkey is making any effort to set in motion a real process of democratisation, or to involve all elements in Turkish society in seeking solutions to its manifold problems.
Then there are the conditions in police stations and prisons. Anyone who is put into custody in Turkey can reckon, with a high degree of probability, on being mistreated, especially if he or she is a member of a minority group.
Elementary rights, such as the right to have contact with family members and legal counsel, are often granted only on a restricted basis or disregarded altogether.
The most prominent example of this is Abdullah Ãcalan, who has for months had virtually no contact with the outside world.
The list could go on and on.
This is where we might bear Cyprus in mind.
It has to be said, for all these reasons, that the road Turkey must travel before it joins Europe is still, alas, a long one.
The assumption that Turkey can hope for accession negotiations with the EU without fundamental changes to its policies is an illusion.
Turkey will have a prospect of accession only if it proves that it takes the Copenhagen criteria seriously.
It is up to Turkey to show by its policies what value it really places upon accession to the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the raid on the human rights association IHD itself I can be brief.
One reason why my group also condemns it in the strongest possible terms is that it is totally inconsistent with the reforms that are designed to bring Turkey closer to the EU.
But what I find more interesting is the background against which this raid took place.
Mr Ceyhun has already spoken about it and I endorse what he had to say.
I am convinced that there is a struggle going on not only in public, but also - and in particular - behind the scenes at the moment, between on the one hand the reformers, the new government, the new Parliament, many human rights organisations and other reformers and on the other the conservatives, who are still very strongly represented, in the army, in the bureaucracy, and also in the judiciary.
Fellow Members, it is no coincidence that on the very day that this human rights association was invited to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for discussions on Turkey's new strategy with a view to accession, the conservatives respond by breaking into the association's offices.
Nor is it any coincidence that this happens by way of the state security courts - a bastion of conservatism in the Turkish legal system.
That is, as far as I am concerned, also a reason to call on the Turkish Government again to press ahead with the abolition of these state security courts - which has already been announced - because they are once again the source of much misery.
If there is a struggle between the conservatives on the one hand and the reformers on the other, then I am convinced that it is the task of Parliament to support the reformers.
I therefore contest the analysis of Turkish affairs that is heard in this House from some of our Members, that is that it never was anything, it is nothing and it never will be anything.
That is not the situation.
Look for example at the reactions of Mr GÃŒl, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr Cicek, the Minister of Justice.
They are ashamed of what happened in this raid and new measures have again been announced to make this impossible in the future.
It is the role of our Parliament to be critical if things go wrong in Turkey, that is what we are doing this evening, that is what we shall be doing in the Oostlander report, but it is also the task of the Parliament to support reformers and reforms so that raids of this kind become a thing of the past.
Mr President, first I should like to thank my colleague Mr Oostlander for letting me move up the speakers' list so that I can go back to my visitors' group.
This debate, on which there is a great degree of consensus, is not about whether Turkey joins the EU, but about what sort of country Turkey is.
In the raid that was authorised by the state security corps, in the words of the Human Rights Association, and I quote, 'all of our private notebooks, all notes, all of our computers, our files and all our reports were taken, all faxes and e-mails sent to the offices were read and some were taken away'.
Not only is this not good for Turkey, it is also highly destabilising that an agent of the state, namely the state security corps, is acting so clearly against the interests of Turkey.
The message it is sending outside is that it is trying to subvert the very democracy that the Turkish Government is trying to build.
Is it not ironic that immediately after the raid the officials go to meet the foreign minister and the minister for human rights?
It is our job as a Parliament to place ourselves firmly behind those people in Turkey who are promoting democracy, to make it quite clear that we support those agents of the state who are saying that this is not the way to run it and that we support people like Abdullah Gul, who clearly was deeply upset by this activity.
The fact of the matter is that in a modern democratic state, the state security corps and the military have to be subordinate to the civilian power - that is the definition of a modern democratic state.
There are many people in Turkey working towards those aims and I believe that this Parliament, in passing this resolution, can give support to those people.
We are not saying yes or no to Turkey in the EU; we are saying we want to back the people of Turkey in making their country a decent, good sort of place that they will all be proud to live in.
Mr President, Leila Zana, winner of the Sakharov prize, at a time when her case is being reviewed due to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, has just called on the European Union to encourage reform by instigating accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.
She claimed that this would speed up the democratisation process in Turkey.
Indeed, when will the Turkish powers finally embark on that path instead of continuing to harass democratic militants, as was still the case with the arbitrary requisitioning of the premises of the Turkish Human Rights Association, an association which already suffers frequent threats and intimidation?
The recent ban last March of the ADEP party is also unacceptable, given that this party clearly rejects any link with armed combat.
The Constitutional Court of Ankara is thus adding to the very long list of penalties imposed on those who fight for the recognition of the Kurdish people's rights.
The Turkish powers are keeping rigidly to a way of thinking which not only harms the direct victims of oppression but also Turkish society as a whole and the image of the country abroad.
Almost exactly a year ago, on 10 May 2002, the ad hoc delegation from Parliament considered that the ban on the ADEP would constitute a substantial step backwards for Turkish democracy.
Sadly, that is now the case.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
We must avoid falling into the trap of the conservatives and other extremists here in Europe, who automatically exclude the Turkish people from the Christian club that the European Union would be.
It would be criminal to stigmatise and isolate this nation by closing the doors to the Union in its face.
That is why I would like to reiterate here my full support for the activities of those in Turkey who are demonstrating in favour of human rights, sometimes risking their lives.
The democratic forces need to know that we are by their side to ensure that the day when it is possible to live and speak freely in Turkey comes as soon as possible.
The Council and the Commission therefore need to make a greater effort to ensure that the Turkish Government observes the Copenhagen criteria, in other words, that it promotes human rights and the rule of law.
This commitment should be shown by commensurate financial support for the activities of associations working for democracy.
Lastly, following the reopening of the Leila Zana case and those of three of her colleagues a few days ago, I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament will be able to present Mrs Zana with her prize here in this hemicycle as soon as possible.
Mr President, it is not the first time that this Parliament has discussed issues concerning the violation of human rights by the Turkish Government.
Unless we are seen to defend the charters and treaties which we have designed ourselves, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and legislation on human rights, then we run the risk of becoming a laughing stock within the international community.
I personally have had occasion in the past to condemn the Turkish Government for the imprisonment without trial of many among the Kurdish community, as I have also condemned the 14-year imprisonment sentence imposed on Leyla Zana and three of her colleagues.
They all campaigned for the rights of the Kurds and in 1995 Leyla Zana won our own European Parliament Sakharov Prize.
A retrial of Leyla Zana was ordered following a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg, a court the international community established itself, because the original trial of Leyla Zana and her colleagues was deemed not to be equitable.
Once again we have to raise in this Parliament a further breach of human rights standards in the wake of a search of the Ankara headquarters of the Human Rights Association of Turkey.
The Human Rights Association performs internationally recognised work in the realm of human rights in Turkey and provides Members of this Parliament with invaluable data on human rights atrocities.
Therefore we regard it as a violation of the defence of human rights when the promotion of these standards is thus impeded.
Is it any wonder that some of us once more ask whether Turkey's request for membership of the European Union should be supported?
For the record, the Human Rights Association has found that 183 people were subjected to torture, ill-treatment and detention in Turkey in the first quarter of this year alone.
A Union presidency that prides itself on defending the human rights of minorities and the oppressed everywhere cannot stand by and allow such violations to continue.
Mr President, the Turkish legal system is based on the idea that collective order and security very definitely take precedence over individual human rights.
I am very well aware of the views of the Ankara public prosecutor.
I have heard terms of this kind from his own lips; no wonder, then, that in such a system a raid on the human rights bureau in Ankara should be seen by the perpetrators as normal.
That is how life is lived there.
The Minister for Justice has expressed regret for the raid, and that is, of course, all very fine and good, but the problem is whether he actually has the power over the public prosecutor to prevent the latter simply carrying on without further ado.
Is this not once again the so-called deep state, with its generals and pashas, that rumbles through everything, as it did with the attempts of Prime Minister Erdogan to find a solution to the Cyprus problem, the restoration of the ban on HADEP and the continuing detention of Mrs Zana who, as a Sakharov prizewinner, has very special symbolic value for us?
Such behaviour amounts to downright defiance of the norms and values of the European Union.
The views of the deep state on good administration differ markedly from those in the European Union.
Successive examples of this can be found in every embassy of Member States.
Mr Ceyhun points out that it is the opponents of the European Union in Turkey who are in favour of such damaging acts.
I do not believe that there are people in Turkey, and certainly not amongst the pashas and the generals, who do not want to join the European Union.
This is because there is status and all kinds of other benefits attached to it.
They do want to join, but they want Turkey to join the European Union on their terms.
This we must prevent at all costs and make clear to the citizens and to every person of goodwill in Turkey that we do not want that.
I think that it must also be made clear to the Turkish public where we stand, that there are conditions attached to accession and that whenever there is a violation it will be said over and over again that we do not accept that, so that the deep state knows that in the European Union there is no future for its way of thinking and acting.
I hope that Commissioner Verheugen can make this visible in Turkey too, possibly through measures relating to the support for human rights organisations in that country.
Mr President, the raid on the offices of the Human Rights Association of Turkey is not the first attack on this organisation, which has played and is playing a leading part in the fight against the repression of the people of Turkey, Turks, Kurds and national minorities.
There have been repeated, even more savage raids in the past.
I need only remind you of the armed raid on the previous president of the Association, Akin Birdal, who was repeatedly fired on.
That attack too was condemned by the then Minister for Justice, and yet the victim was ultimately locked up in gaol for several years.
Just so that we understand what condemnations by serving ministers mean!
So this raid is particularly significant, because it was carried out at a time when the new government of Turkey is trying to stop the democratic mask which Mr Erdogan and his cohorts were wearing before and after the elections from slipping.
As far as we are concerned, there can be no doubt that the government of Islamists, by reason of its very ideological base, was and is not in a position to lead Turkey towards democracy.
It had to be elected, taking account of the thirsting and the fight of the Turkish people, but under no circumstances has it changed its ideological political orientation.
Without doubt, the basic reason for this raid is the intrepid, heroic fight of the Human Rights Association in Turkey and the rights of the Kurdish people.
Neither the military establishment that always directs political life in Turkey nor the Islamic party entertain any sympathy for this sort of impropriety.
The raid was carried out on the basis of Articles 169 and 312 of the Criminal Code and the anti-terrorism law respectively, which criminalise any support for the hunger strike of political prisoners and their fight against the white cells as an act of terrorism.
The ban on the Turkish communist party and the HADEP party was decided in the same spirit.
We express our brotherly solidarity with the people of Turkey and stand by their side in their fight for democracy and peace, as recently expressed during the attack on Iraq.
Thank you very much, Mr Korakas.
I wish to inform you that I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0146/2003, by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society (9923/2002 - C5-0485/2002 - 1991/0388(COD));
A5-0127/2003, by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Draft Council directive on supplementing the Statute for a European Cooperative Society with regard to the involvement of employees (renewed consultation) (9924/2002 - C5-0494/2002 - 1991/0389(CNS).
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by extending the Commission's thanks to the rapporteurs of both the leading Committees for the outstanding work they have done, both on the regulation on European Cooperative Societies and on the related directive on the involvement of employees.
There are, in the European Union, at least 130 000 cooperative societies, which have 2.3 million employees and well in excess of 80 million members.
The regulations will put in the hands of these cooperative societies an instrument for cross-border transactions right across the internal market similar to that already enacted for public limited companies in the form of the Statute for a European Limited Company.
Associations of cooperative societies in Europe have been demanding this sort of statute for some years now, and the text of the regulation now before you has met with their approval.
The Statute will also make it possible to form cross-border syndicates on the basis of cooperative society structures, enabling enterprises of this type to build up joint activities, become more competitive, and enter more diverse markets.
Parliament expressed its approval for the Statute for a European Cooperative Society at first reading, which was on 20 January 1993.
This initial position taken by Parliament resulted in numerous improvements to the text of the Commission proposal as later amended, which Parliament approved on 2 December 1993, reconfirming that approval on 27 October 1999.
Although the regulation is not perfect, it reflects a broad consensus on what rules should apply to this new form of cooperative enterprise.
At Council level, it met with the Member States' unanimous approval, something that constitutes considerable progress in view of the individual Member States' divergent regulations on cooperative societies.
From the outset, the Commission has had the objective of creating an instrument that would be, on the one hand, flexible and modern, whilst, on the other, taking into account the particular characteristics of cooperative societies and the principles underlying them.
We are glad that this balance is maintained in the Regulation in its present form.
Article 79 offers the possibility of removing any inadequacies brought to light by the experience of the first five years of implementation, and so the Commission will monitor the application of the Statute with a view to the possible revision of the Regulation.
The Members of this Parliament regard as extremely dubious the Council's unilateral and unanimous decision to change the legal basis in such a way as to deprive Parliament of its right of codecision, and it is understandable that they should do so.
The Commission took Article 95 as the legal basis for its proposal on the grounds that this article has the completion of the internal market as its objective.
We continue to believe that Article 95 provides the right legal basis.
With almost no exceptions, the amendments proposed for a second time have to do with the protection of the employees' interests.
The Commission takes the view that the directive must fully protect their rights, and that it must be complied with when a European Cooperative Society is set up.
The directive is the right place for this rule, and so we cannot support the proposed amendments.
Let me now turn to the directive on the involvement of employees, which complements the Regulation and represents a very comprehensive piece of legislation intended to guarantee in an appropriate way employees' rights to information, consultation and co-determination.
In its essentials, the text is based on the corresponding directive on the European Limited Company, adopted one and a half years ago, and the Commission believes that it merits your support.
Parliament now wishes to make a number of amendments to it, many of which are undoubted improvements.
Having examined in detail all the amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission is prepared to agree, either fully or in part, to half of them and to support these in the Council.
Amendments Nos 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 and 22 can be accepted as they stand.
The Commission is also in agreement with a number of other amendments, which, however, still require certain minor changes of formulation in order to take into account the concerns of certain Member States.
The amendments in question are Nos 4, 14, 17, 20 and 21.
Leaving to one side the debate on the legal basis, we believe that the Council, too, is open to most of these amendments.
We hope that this means that both the Regulation and the directive can be adopted by the Council in June, so that there will be a legal framework conducive to those European Cooperative Societies that want to extend their activities across frontiers, with, at the same time, their employees being guaranteed appropriate protection of their interests.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
We do indeed have before us a very important report, a very important piece of legislation for the very large number of people in the European Union who have joined together in common enterprises in order to pool their strengths and bring those strengths to market more effectively.
In a European Union in which more and more work is done across borders, this sort of collaborative effort across borders is quite clearly very much needed and very deserving of support.
It was as long ago as 13 April 1983 that Parliament first adopted a resolution on European Cooperative Societies, which fact shows what great importance Parliament has always attached to legislation in this area.
The Commission also took on board our concerns, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, we did indeed, after some time, have the beginnings of legislation.
I find it very regrettable that the Council - after Parliament, in 1993, had given its position, and a very good position at that - took all of eleven years to adopt a resolution on the subject, and had ulterior motives, some of them quite unrelated to the matter in hand, for not taking action in this area.
The fact is that we find that unacceptable, and so, above all, do the people that this is all about.
I also have to say in relation to this that I cannot commend the Council for the way in which it simply changed the legal basis, and, when forwarding the new text to Parliament, did not even think it necessary to explain why this change had been made and on what arguments it was actually founded.
At any rate, there is nothing on the subject in the official documents we have been given.
I do not think this is any way for Parliament and the Council to work together.
The fact is that, naturally enough, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market gave particular attention to the legal basis, for what is at stake here is a weighty matter, namely the rights of Parliament, and it would be a strange parliament that simply said 'yes' and agreed to waive its right of codecision on the grounds that a unanimous Council resolution had to be respected.
No parliament - not even this one - can afford to do such a thing, and so the Committee reaffirmed, and by a clear and unambiguous majority, that Article 95 was the right legal basis.
There are eminently clear arguments in favour of that, as Commissioner Schreyer has just again confirmed, and they cannot simply be swept aside.
The proposed Regulation creates an independent structure under Community law in parallel to national forms of association.
Article 8 makes it clear that the regulation does not govern the structure by itself, but does so in conjunction with the statutes of the cooperative society in question and the company law of the Member State in which that cooperative society has its registered office.
This is not, then, about superimposing a European model on the fifteen national company models, but about harmonisation, that is to say, the approximation of laws, thereby reducing the legal obstacles to the operation of the internal market.
That is what it should be, and as such it should be adhered to!
While I am still on this subject, please permit me to add a personal note, for, as rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I now of course have to recommend that, tomorrow, this House should vote against all the amendments with the exception of the first, as these are all resubmitted amendments that were rejected by the Committee.
That is how it is, and a rapporteur's duty is of course to reflect the views of his or her committee.
What I say, though, on my own behalf is that I trust you will not mind if I vote, with my group, in favour of these amendments, on the grounds that they reinforce workers' rights.
The fact is that, as a Social Democrat, I regard the reinforcement of such rights as an obligation without the possibility of any exceptions, and so I will self-evidently vote in favour of it, even if, when we vote tomorrow, it will be said that I recommend that you do the opposite.
Mr President, I would also ask to be allowed to repeat that before the vote tomorrow.
- Mr President, Members will be aware that the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as indeed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, was dominated by the concerns we had about the legal basis which was used, which only provides for consultation with Parliament.
Like everybody else in this Parliament I share those concerns.
But I also believe that we have a responsibility to seek to improve the draft directive presented to us, a view shared unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
What we have here is a proposal from the Council and Commission concerning workers and representatives on the boards of a European Cooperative Society, and this is a welcome development.
The cooperative sector has been waiting 30 years for this legislation, because of the extremely diverse nature of this sector.
Obviously it has been difficult to achieve a common position.
Even so, 30 years is far too long for the estimated eight million people employed in the social economy across the Member States.
I know that many of them are keen that we complete our business here tomorrow and enable the Council to arrive at an early decision.
The social economy is an important sector in terms of employment in the Union and in terms of gross domestic product.
Cooperatives are an important part of that social economy.
It is estimated that cooperatives in the consumer and production areas alone have over 78 million members in the Union.
By facilitating at long last the formation of European cooperatives and guaranteeing the involvement of workers at board level in such new enterprises we will be sending a positive message to the cooperative movement.
This, I hope, will have a particular impact on emerging cooperatives in the accession countries and serve also to strengthen the European social model throughout the enlarged Union.
Important amendments relating to gender equality in the selection of workers' representatives, trade union rights and corporate social responsibility have been adopted in committee and I am pleased to hear that there are indications that both the Commission and the Council are favourably disposed towards many of them.
We regret that the Commission is unable to recommend the amendments to the regulation which my group are putting forward.
But with regard to the level of agreement that we have achieved in relation to the directive, I want to thank the Council and the Commission, the staff of the Employment Committee and the staff of my own group for their assistance.
Without the cooperation of all the members of the Employment Committee, we could not have arrived at the unanimous decision that underpinned the amendments that are going forward to the Council.
We can look forward to working closely with those involved in the social economy sector across the Union and to further developing the social economy.
Other pieces of legislation are required to complete the coverage needed in this area and I would urge the Commission and the Council not to delay further in agreeing what is necessary.
Could I also suggest that they might consider using the Treaty of Nice provision which allows for decisions of this nature to be taken by QMV rather than unanimity.
This would provide for codecision with this Parliament in any further legislation they bring forward in this area.
Mr President, my wife and I have had the privilege of having our three children in a parents' cooperative in my home town in Dalarna.
A parents' child care cooperative is not perhaps a model for a European Cooperative Society, but we have very good experience of cooperative work.
The regulation on a Statute for a European Cooperative Society and the Directive on the involvement of employees are inseparable.
The Statute concerns how the mechanisms that are to guarantee employees' right of codecision in European Cooperative Societies are to operate in practice.
In the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have chosen to adopt three political priorities.
Firstly, the European Parliament must demand a legal base guaranteeing Parliament the right of codecision.
Secondly, current provisions concerning the right to information and consultation must be fully respected during the procedure before a European Cooperative Society is registered or restructured.
Thirdly, the rights that employees enjoyed before the European Cooperative Society was created must be guaranteed.
Parliament has warned the Council that it would not tolerate a repeat of the Council's position on the European Company Statute. The Council has ignored that warning in this case.
In order to defend Parliament's role in the legislative process, and with reference to Parliament's legal service, those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have highlighted Article 95 of the Treaty as the correct legal base.
It is a question of bringing about an approximation between the Member States' legislation, not of transferring the right of decision from national legislation to the EU.
- (DE) Mr President, as I have only two minutes, please allow me to combine what I have to say about the Regulation and the directive, as I have essentially the same things to say about each of them.
What happened with the European Limited Company has happened in exactly the same way with the European Cooperative Society; the Council of Ministers has, quite out of hand, robbed us of our power of codecision.
This is something that we must not tolerate.
There is little doubt that the majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market takes the view that, this time, we should appeal to the Court of Justice against the choice of the legal basis.
My original agreement with Mrs Gebhardt was that the Committee on Legal Affairs would restrict itself to amendments on the legal basis.
We now have an array of amendments to vote on, both to the Regulation and to the directive.
I gather that the Commission intends to support the amendments to the directive, whilst rejecting those to the Regulation.
I take the same view.
The legal issue is, however, a topic of great importance in terms of the future, for one cannot exclude the possibility of the Council of Ministers doing the same thing in other areas of company law - the other types of company are waiting to be dealt with.
As far as the Regulation is concerned, we share the view expressed by the Commission, that Article 95 is the proper legal basis.
We have already heard that a number of times, but, with reference to the directive on the involvement of employees, I would like to go into further detail.
Article 137 (1) (e) is the rule on jurisdiction for informing and consulting employees and provides for no exception to the co-determination procedure in Article 251.
Article 137 (1) (f), however, is the rule on jurisdiction for employee participation; it requires a unanimous vote in the Council, with Parliament merely being required to be consulted.
In this instance, however, the Council can decide by unanimous vote to apply the codecision procedure.
This directive treats both objectives - co-determination and consultation - equally.
It is my contention that, in a situation like this, where there are two equivalent legal bases alongside each other, option is downgraded to obligation and the Council's discretion is correspondingly limited.
If this were not so, the requirement for unanimity in the Council as regards the one legal basis would nullify the codecision procedure in its equivalent counterpart.
Such a curtailment of the European Parliament's rights as a legislature enjoying democratic legitimacy is unacceptable.
An appeal will not put the European Cooperative Society at risk.
Firstly, the validity of the Cooperative Society Regulation is coupled to the expiry of the time limit for the transposition of the directive.
This period should in fact allow sufficient leeway for the ECJ to hand down a clarificatory ruling.
Secondly, the ECJ can be asked to rule that the Regulation and the directive continue to have legal effect.
Quite deliberately, then, it is the choice of legal basis that is being contested, not the subject-matter of either the Regulation or the directive.
Mr President, I want to make a point of thanking Mrs Gebhardt and Mr De Rossa for their efforts in relation to these two reports and for the painstaking work they have put into them.
Here in plenary, those of us in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled a number of amendments on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society.
We believe that, as far as possible, the procedure for developing a European Cooperative Society must be characterised by scrutiny and transparency. Current provisions concerning employees' right to information and consultation must be fully complied with.
A number of amendments involve guarantees that, right from the start, an express account should be given of the expected consequences for employment of establishing a European Cooperative Society.
Employees' representatives must be given time to submit an opinion before decisions are taken.
Because the proposal for a regulation concerns the various stages in the life cycle of a European Cooperative Society, such as its establishment, the transfer of headquarters and liquidation, a number of different amendments are required if it is to be possible to apply these principles to the different situations described in the proposal for a regulation.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of whose opinion I had the privilege of being the draftsman, also believes that the establishment of a European Cooperative Society must not lead to employees' losing rights they enjoyed before its establishment.
Allow me also to say very specifically, regarding Mr De Rossa's report, how important it is to emphasise that, in connection with establishing a European Cooperative Society and in cases of extensive structural changes, there should be the right to engage in negotiations concerning employee involvement.
All contributions must constitute an ongoing process.
Our report also calls for the removal of the general clause according to which the Member States may be exempted from the provisions concerning employee involvement when a European Cooperative Society is established as a result of a merger between two cooperatives.
I also wish to emphasise that the employee representatives on the management and supervisory bodies should be chosen or designated in accordance with national legislation.
Mr President, we are going to have to wait and see what the Council makes of the points we are raising tonight in relation to the legal basis.
I hope the Commission will think again about the acceptability of Amendments Nos 14, 15, 17 and 19 on the statute, concerning the inclusion of the consideration of employment effects in the case of a merger, transfer or conversion involving an ECS, because I think they are entirely justifiable.
In the meantime I would like to take the opportunity to look beyond the institutional and legal basis arguments and look at the implications these proposals might have for the development of the social economy in a European Union which is trying to deal with a range of profound changes.
The globalisation of markets and the decreased competitiveness of traditional sectors call for the diversification of economic activities and an exploration of new means of creating job opportunities.
Technological progress calls for a highly-qualified, flexible workforce, which in turn expects a more participative working situation.
Increased female participation rates and an ageing population with longer life expectancy increase the demand for household and caring services.
These increasing and more diversified social needs, compounded by budgetary restrictions, have led public authorities to decentralise the provision of services or to reduce the range or level of services they are providing.
The social economy can play a part in meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities arising from these and other processes of change, and in a way can help shape a new model of society and an economy based on solidarity, inclusion and participation on the one hand, and innovation and knowledge on the other.
I can say these things with certainty because I have been looking back at the evaluation of the third-sector initiative which ran from 1997 to 1998, thanks to a budgetary initiative by Mrs Ghilardotti, who is here tonight.
That evaluation underlined the fact that the development of the social economy to satisfy unmet needs could create as many as 120 000 jobs in the United Kingdom, 380 000 in Germany and 100 000 in France.
But perhaps one statistic from the evaluation best illustrates the potential scale of future job creation relating to communal services: the gap between employment rates in the USA and the EU is largest in communal services, which include social services, recreation, education, health and social care.
Equalising the rates would be equivalent to up to 7 million jobs.
The promotion of the third system could contribute to an increased demand for and supply of these services and one, moreover, which could help close the employment gap most among the very social groups where it is greatest.
We have a very well-established cooperative sector in my own region of England.
It has interests in retail, manufacturing, services, farming, housing, banking and a wide range of other areas.
The sector in my own region provides 13 000 jobs in the north-east of England.
I know that many there will welcome these new instruments as opening the way for a fresh boost to the social economy and employment through transnational developments.
That would be particularly useful in the context of enlargement.
I also think that the Commission really ought to look back at the evaluation of that third-sector initiative.
It supported us at the time and there was much talk of mainstreaming the results into the ESF, ERDF and relevant programmes.
Yet just four and a half years later I was deeply disappointed to see that the modest reference to the social economy under the enterprise pillar of the old employment guidelines had completely disappeared under the heading 'fostering enterprise and promoting job creation' in the new, streamlined employment guidelines.
In this case, new and streamlined does not mean better, and that needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, it is twelve years since the Commission tabled this proposal concerning the Statute for a European Cooperative Society, and, exactly as Mr De Rossa said, this discussion has in actual fact gone on for more than thirty years.
The European Parliament addressed the issue at a first reading in 1993.
I was not then a Member of the European Parliament but was an adviser working with small companies and cooperative societies.
My then colleagues and I could not have dreamed that it would have taken such a long time to get to the point where the Statute for a European Cooperative Society was concerned.
This delay has in actual fact put a damper on a very great many proposals and ideas for cooperation when it comes to the European social economy.
Cooperatives are a form of company that should be given every support, especially in political quarters, because they represent participatory democracy in action.
We cannot now wait any longer for this Statute.
On behalf of my group, I wish therefore to appeal to the European Parliament and to my fellow MEPs to avoid further delays and not to take issue with the Council concerning the legal base and our right of codecision, even though I in principle agree with the reasons presented concerning the legal base.
That is because I am afraid that a legal dispute would not benefit the cooperative companies and the social economy.
Because there are so many tasks for the social economy in the new Europe, we need this Statute.
Do not let it get marooned in principles and disputes concerning the legal base.
Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their work on what is a very difficult issue.
It is a testament to their abilities and initiatives that there was such overwhelming support for the positions that they took.
However, like Mrs SchÃ¶rling, I would hope that we do not get into a fight which would further delay us on the question of the legal basis.
As Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out, 30 years is far too long for any legislative proposal to be waiting to be brought about.
Whilst we have to pick our fights or arguments with the other institutions, we also have to keep an eye on the bigger picture of ensuring that we can put in place legislation that facilitates and allows for the fostering of new opportunities within the social economy.
That is why I want to give as much support as possible to the rapporteurs and the reports that they have brought forward, and indeed to some of the amendments that have been tabled and which I, like Mrs Gebhardt, believe will improve the text and not detract from it.
I also hope that the Commission will understand from this debate tonight that we are not willing, as a Parliament, to lie down and be walked over by anyone.
We have in our midst enough innovation, ingenuity and compromise to bring forward positive, new initiatives to ensure that all the peoples within Europe can benefit from what we are trying to create here today.
My last point is that our legal services have drafted an opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with regard to the ability of using Article 95.
However, that opinion is not as cast-iron or as tight as we would like to think it is.
Indeed, if we use the analogy of what happened with the European Company Statute, the legal basis is different despite the fact that there are similarities between the two proposals put forward.
It is vitally important that we support Mr De Rossa's opinion with regard to greater employee participation and consultation in the areas of mergers and developments.
Mr President, I am very glad to be here this evening.
I was a Member of this Parliament in 1993.
I must say that we had the impression then that this would take some time.
In those days proposals did not make such rapid progress as they do now.
Perhaps we did not imagine that it would take as long as is now the case, but it has taken a long time.
Really this should be a reason for great joy.
Everyone has said how important the cooperatives in the different European countries are and it is also very good of course that we can bring about a European Statute for them.
This we have always supported.
I should also like to warmly thank the two rapporteurs for their efforts.
The whole thing is, of course, not entirely problem-free.
That cannot be denied.
Because of the difficulties with the European Company we are still confronted by some old frustrations and these frustrations will have to be cleared up at some point.
The problem is that the Council never learns.
If the Council were to learn, this would of course be an easy debate.
We gave it the benefit of the doubt with the European Company and what does the Council do the next time?
At the first opportunity it abuses its position again!
Mr President, there are of course very many people who are then glad to give way, who say that it is an important matter.
I agree with that, but I nonetheless think that we must not allow ourselves to be led astray by the Old Testament story of Jacob who sells his birthright for a plate of lentils.
I agree with Mr Mayer who says that we must keep it reasonably tight here.
I am also totally astonished that the Greens are now suddenly calling on us not to remain true to our principles.
I reproach the Greens for actually being too principled, but I am glad that this time we in the PPE-DE Group are more principled than the Greens.
I think that it is possible and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have done everything to avoid making this just a debate on a matter of principle.
The possibility exists that it will be fought out on principle, but the amendments submitted by us mean that this may not be necessary.
The Council can simply adopt our amendments.
I regret that the Commission has actually rejected all the amendments to the Regulation, and do not think they have been sensible in doing so.
I think that they will have to come back to this at some future time, but the opportunity now is with the Council.
This I find quite proper.
Let him who sets calamity in motion do the clearing-up afterwards.
That is what we are letting them do, Mr President.
I think that it could ultimately come to a solution if the Council is sensible, but I personally always refuse to go along with those who keep on wanting to give way.
The next time we will have to fight the same fight again because, unfortunately, the Council never learns.
The Commission learns with difficulty. The Council never learns.
This Parliament learns, but not always.
Mr President, more than 10 years after the Commission's attempt to create a suitable legislative framework to regulate the matter of the statute for a European Cooperative Society, the Council is today showing the political will to progress with and close the matter.
Even if this time, however, it appears to have interpreted the relevant proposal for a regulation from the Commission correctly, the legal basis it has chosen is creating tremendous problems.
In essence, as other honourable Members have said, it is undermining the role of the European Parliament by selecting Article 308, the simple consultation procedure. Keeping to the same tactic used during the adoption of the relevant regulation and directive on the European society.
The arguments expounded by the Committee on Legal Affairs in favour of Article 95 are right, but it is also right to look at how relations between the European Parliament and the Council are going to shape up in the future.
This tactic of discordance of opinions cannot go on and the question is, why is the Council afraid of the European Parliament?
However, it is not right for the debate at this stage to be delayed or for the creation of the cooperative society to be put off.
We therefore have to use every possible means to foster approval both of the regulation and of the directive on the statute of the European Cooperative Society, taking account of the fact that the European Cooperative Society will constitute the necessary complement to the European company.
In adopting them, we shall help to develop cross-border cooperative activities in the social work sector which, according to the more general strategy on employment in Europe, will constitute an important source of employment.
Cooperative organisations will acquire a strong legal tool which will facilitate the foundation and operation of cooperative societies at cross-border level.
As with the European company, here too, if we are to be consistent, the corresponding term for the workers must be safeguarded, their rights must be safeguarded and the building of the European social standard must be promoted, in this instance even more so, I think, than with the European company.
In this light, I should like to congratulate the two Socialist Group rapporteurs who agreed to proceed jointly and adopt a joint strategy.
To be precise, the directive needs to take account of the three points that Mr De Rossa raises in his report.
First, the right to negotiations on worker participation cannot be limited to the period in which an SCE is being created.
This right must be safeguarded during other crucial stages in the operation of the company, such as mergers, transfers etc. For the same reason, the terms of the worker participation procedure must not be a one-off right; it must be redefined if there are substantial structural changes in the European Cooperative Society with fresh negotiations.
It is also rightly proposed that, when electing workers' representatives to supervisory or administrative organs, national law should take priority, as in the case of the European company.
To conclude: it is not enough for us to refer each time to our faith in the European social model.
We have to sit examinations every day and prove that we believe in it.
Mr President, I too welcome the movement at long last on these dossiers and the work of the rapporteurs involved, and of those who have worked hard to put forward their opinions.
Like others I regret the legal base chosen.
The arguments are totally unconvincing, in so far as we have actually heard any.
One of the few things we can say about what we have got in front of us is that we have at long last got some sort of parity here with the company statute.
That parity of status in a modern economy is extremely important at a time when many people are looking for added value.
I do not see that we should actually be advocating or allowing an advantage to one particular form of company organisation while, as it were, putting barriers in the way of a different form of organisation.
It is important that we safeguard cooperatives and their parity of status, particularly at a time of increased competition and threats of globalisation, when there is a considerable threat of undermining the cooperative ethos and its way of operating.
We have heard that this is an important sector, not least in terms of the employment opportunities outlined so ably by Mr Hughes.
It is also a question about democracy and participation and the feeling of being in control of either your workplace or indeed the company with which you are dealing.
Cooperatives are particularly important when we are talking so much - or indeed today so little - about corporate social responsibility, when we are looking at companies which have a great deal to teach, at major corporations that already operate across borders, in terms of their responsibility towards staff.
I welcome many of the amendments put forward in terms of employee involvement and greater safeguards there, responsibility towards customers, wider society and indeed, for many of them as well, the investment they make in ethical finance, which again has a lot to teach major corporations.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, Mr De Rossa, today, this debate on a European Cooperative Society is focusing somewhat on the legal base chosen to reintroduce this report. This legal base has been challenged in all the work of the Parliamentary committees as it arises essentially from Amendment No 1, which was specifically proposed for the text of the regulation.
This situation means that, once again, the Members are facing an impossible choice: whether to recognise the rights of this House in terms of codecision or to adopt a Statute which has been awaited for 30 years by the social economy sector.
By refusing the European Parliament codecision in this area, the unfortunate precedent of the limited company is perpetuated and this situation could be repeated when we address the statute for friendly societies or European associations.
Is the Council going to continue to ignore Parliament's position?
As regards the first point, my fellow Members have amply elaborated on the grounds for challenging the legal base and they have put forward strong arguments.
At the same time, however, and despite everything, it is just as important that we achieve a text on the Statute for a Cooperative Society at last.
Although the draft that has been submitted to us represents a backwards step in some respects in relation to the 1993 text, and even though there has been no real debate on the content, I am not sure we need to take the risk of delaying the implementation of a draft which has known many ups and downs.
There are many arguments in favour of adopting this text without a delay.
I shall cite just a few.
The draft has the agreement of representatives of the cooperative sector as a whole, as we have heard.
The number of cooperatives concerned in Europe is anything but negligible.
Out of 200 000 companies - Commissioner, my figures are slightly higher than yours - in this European cooperative sector representing over 3 million jobs, between 10 and 12% operate outside the local area and their activities concern every sector of economic life.
These cooperatives must be able to extend their activities to European level and to be able to do so within a certain legal framework, which safeguards their specific nature, both in terms of the primacy of the individual and the objects of the undertaking on capital, and in terms of participation in the general interest and social cohesion.
Lastly - and I feel this is an important point - we should allow an economic sector built on the original legal base, which has proven itself in terms of local development, to be able to develop, in particular in countries currently experiencing a sometimes painful economic transition towards the market economy.
This is the case of the future Members of our Union.
Recognition of the diverse forms of company and the social economy constitutes one response to the liberal globalisation that is being challenged today and is an ingredient of the European social model that we wish to defend.
I believe, Commissioner, that we share this concern.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs for this report.
Without getting into the issue of the legal basis, I would also like to thank them for their desire to resolve the problems despite the legal digressions and naturally we expect the same good will from the Council.
It is the case that the European Parliament has dealt with the issue we are discussing today, the Cooperative Society, in various resolutions.
Some of these resolutions are very significant. For example, in 1987, the contribution of cooperatives to regional development; in 1989, the role of women in cooperatives and local job-creating initiatives; or in 1994, the role of cooperatives in the growth of women's employment.
If we compare these resolutions with the commitment made at the Lisbon Summit in 2000, and ratified in Barcelona in 2002, we will see that the content coincides to a great extent, equality policies, job creation, etc. In fact, apart from meeting the needs on a strictly local level for clearly local undertakings, all types of company can organise and carry out their activities at Community level.
The European phenomenon, with its dimension represented by enlargement, determines and defines new territorial rules, in deed or in law, which require a uniform applicable legal framework; and a lack of this uniformity may hinder both the grouping imposed by competitiveness and the operational and subsistence requirements.
Within this framework, we must not forget that cooperatives are groups of people or legal entities in which people, the personal dimension, are paramount, and must always be - and in fact are - very present.
Let us remember - and this has been stressed here - that, by means of cooperative formulae, jobs have been preserved, with the participation of workers, who have played a very important role, and in this regard I would firstly like to stress the right and the opportunity for workers' representatives to participate both at the time the European Cooperative Society is established and throughout its existence, and in particular at key moments, such as at the time of mergers or restructuring.
Secondly, we must stress the need for the maintenance of the concept and the practice of the participation of workers' representatives, with the special characteristics represented by the existence and co-existence of the competent body of the Cooperative Society and the workers' representative body.
I also believe it is necessary to insist that it is necessary and appropriate for horizontal policies, to which Parliament is particularly committed - gender equality, health at work, non-discrimination etc. to be vigorously promoted by means of the Cooperative Society.
And finally we must bear in mind that in order to carry out its task, which carries with it rights as well as obligations and an exclusively public content, function or service, the representatives of the workers must enjoy the same protections as the representatives of workers at national level.
Mr President, many Members have already spoken about the Council's failure to take the opportunity to observe and recognise the European Parliament's prerogatives laid down by the Treaty and to propose a legal base providing for Parliamentary codecision in respect of the regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society.
It is important to remember that, as early as 1991, the Council specified this legal basis in respect of the three proposals for regulations it presented at that time, on a European Cooperative Society, a European association and a European mutual society respectively, as well in respect of the original proposal on the European company.
The Council's attitude is even more incomprehensible in the light of its previous actions, and so I hope that it will reconsider its position after the House votes tomorrow.
In this connection - as the rapporteur has already explained - the aim of the proposal for a regulation on the Statute for a Cooperative Society is harmonisation, to approximate Member States' laws, in other words to remove all the barriers hindering the functioning of the internal market.
It does not regulate matters of taxation or competition - although these are important and will have to be addressed in future - or matters of copyright or insolvency, but merely the structure of the societies, referring systematically to the national law of the country in which the cooperative society has its registered office.
That said, we cannot fail to agree that it is important and urgent that we find a solution for the creation of the cooperative society, given that work on this project has been at a standstill for decades and that it was only in December 2000 that the Council finally reached political agreement on the substance, the content of the regulation and the Directive on Worker Involvement , which is linked to the creation of the European Cooperative Society.
Over these years - or decades, rather - the world of cooperatives in Europe has expanded greatly, acquired economic weight and shown that it actually has a key social role to play, particularly in terms of employment.
On a number of occasions during these years, the European Parliament has expressed itself, through various reports, on the importance of the third sector for the economy, on the essential role it plays in preserving society, on its proven ability - borne out by numerous studies - to create jobs, not least high-quality jobs.
Mr Hughes mentioned a successful European Parliament initiative which revealed the zeal and skill shown by the third sector and the cooperative sector in responding to the challenges of employment and social cohesion.
With the proposed amendments, which I hope will be adopted tomorrow and taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament is enhancing the proposal, introducing into the regulation the changes necessary to harmonise the statute and the provisions of the Directive on Worker Involvement.
Information and consultation rights are laid down, to ensure that they are fully respected during the pre-legislative phase and whenever any structural changes or modifications are made.
I will end, Mr President, by congratulating the two rapporteurs for my part too, for they have worked together and developed these two important reports side by side.
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating our colleague Mr De Rossa on his work on this report and welcoming both the directive and the parallel statute for cooperatives.
I want to put to one side the debate that we are having on the legal basis and talk about the very important issue of employee participation, which should be to the fore for us in the European Parliament tonight.
I want to support the rapporteur and the amendments which he has brought forward, in particular in relation to cooperatives that are involved in mergers and in relation to gender balance.
Speaking personally, in terms of my work on corporate social responsibility in this Parliament - I am also speaking at the umbrella organisation of cooperatives across Europe at a conference in Paris next Monday - it is certainly true to say that cooperatives are leading the way in terms of socially responsible business practice and deserve the credit for doing so.
This debate is about support for workers who are coming together to own and work together in their enterprise for better ends.
That cooperative principle dates not least from the work of Robert Owen in my own Member State and is something which we celebrate in this debate.
It is also about successful business, which is a core and mainstream part of the economy.
Just one recent report produced by the Work Foundation and by Birkbeck College in the United Kingdom showed graphically how employee involvement actually goes together with business success: the two go hand in hand.
That is true in my own constituency in the east of England, where we are not simply talking about a very significant part of the economy where cooperatives are active, but also about socially useful employment at one and the same time.
For example, there is a leading cooperative that provides care in rural areas in the east of England so that the elderly and disabled are able to get services that otherwise they would be denied and that creates work at the same time.
Another example can be found in Harlow, Essex - in my constituency - where we have five separate credit unions, cooperatives that provide money and loan finance which is otherwise unavailable to people on low incomes and with poor credit records.
They have over 1 000 members in a town of just 76 000 people.
This provides extremely valuable employment indeed.
The principles in supporting this directive are clear.
It is going to give legal certainty and positive status at European level to cooperatives, something for which we have argued for a long time.
It is entirely voluntary, no one is made to sign up to this, no one has a European rule foisted upon them.
It is a definition, which is inevitably a compromise, of what cooperative enterprise is about, to which the cooperative movement itself across Europe has agreed.
Finally, we have had a long saga about the European company statute tonight: we celebrate the movement towards the end of the long saga about cooperatives.
But I say to the Commissioner and to everyone else in this Chamber: let us move next to the statute on associations, so that non-governmental and voluntary organisations can enjoy legal status too.
This entire package has taken far too long.
This is an important step tonight, but we must look forward to the next to be achieved.
The next item is the report (A5-0119/2003) by Mr Callanan, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Directive 94/25/EC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to recreational craft (PE - CONS [3615/2003 - C5-0109/2003 - 2000/0262(COD)].
Mr President, I thank the Commission, all Members, and the industry and user groups who have taken an interest in this subject and who have sent me many contributions about their problems, suggestions as to how they might be resolved and the difficulties with the original proposal.
If the Commission was honest it would agree that the original proposal it presented to this House had many problems, particularly related to the retrospective element of the proposals.
I come from a country where it is generally regarded that retrospective law is bad law, that people should always have the certainty of knowing under what rules and regulations they perform their duties.
To make something retrospective and apply to what has happened in the past is bad.
Thankfully we have managed, between us, to agree to remove virtually all of the retrospective elements from this legislation.
The process of going through it has been helpful to many.
We have improved the comitology proposals, we have improved the proposals relating to craft built for own use.
We have put in proposals from the Verts/ALE Group on biodegradable oils and we have satisfied user groups and the industries by putting forward the 3dB noise allowance.
The outcome from virtually all sides has been satisfactory.
I have received emails in the last few days from the user groups saying that they are relatively satisfied, and also from the industry saying that it is relatively satisfied.
As long as the Commission is relatively satisfied, that really is an incredible outcome.
Within the legislation, the Commission is asked to produce further reports.
I would warn the Commission about the danger of over-regulation in this sector.
The proposals were originally produced to reduce the emissions from recreational craft.
Recreational craft in the European Union account for 0.5% of all emissions.
With this proposal we would see a substantial reduction in that fraction of emissions.
I hope that the Commission will bear in mind that it will come up against the law of diminishing returns if it tries to regulate even further in this sector.
The large amount of cost and inconvenience that would be involved for users to produce even smaller fractional improvements in environmental performance would be very difficult to justify.
In the field of in-use compliance testing, the Commission has also been asked to produce proposals.
Bearing in mind that many Member States - I am thinking particularly of Finland here - have thousands of small boats on very remote and inaccessible lakes, when and if it brings forward proposals for a system of in-use compliance testing, I hope that the Commission will bear in mind the difficulty of implementing them in many Member States.
I hope that it will also bear in mind that the improvements in environmental performance that it wishes to bring about will be very fractional and may not justify the large amounts of cost and inconvenience for all concerned.
After those few, relatively negative comments, let me thank the Commission for its help in producing these proposals.
I thank all those Members - none of whom have turned up - for their contributions.
We have reached a satisfactory outcome for all concerned.
I commend the proposal to the House.
Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Callanan, I would like to start by thanking Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee and you above all, Mr Callanan, for the outstanding work that has speedily produced the compromise text that is before us today.
The Commission proposal to amend the Recreational Craft Directive is intended to take environmental concerns into account in a directive on the internal market, and so it is a good example of the synergies that the achievement of sustainable development requires between environmental and industrial policies.
The compromise reached in the trilogue between representatives of this House and of the Council represents a balance between these two pillars of sustainable development.
The Commission's expectation is that this dossier will be brought to successful completion, by which is meant the adoption of the accompanying text by this House and by the Council.
That is the final procedural step towards the long-awaited Community-wide regulatory system limiting emissions from recreational craft, and I thank this House, and again in particular the rapporteur, for their help in achieving this objective.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his constructive work and, like the rapporteur, regret that we are holding the debate at this hour, but I believe it is our common love of boats, sailing and shipbuilding that brings us here this evening.
There is of course a saying that goes, Navigare necesse est, vivere non est necesse.
Anyway, it is one of the most important things in life we are dealing with here.
At the same time, the issue is also extremely important to, for example, those regions I represent, in which boat building is an important industry.
I have been following the genesis of this directive ever since Germany and Sweden proposed that we should introduce uniform standards.
Today, we can see that the agreement concerning this directive has stopped the European market from fragmenting.
In the same way, I am glad that we have finally agreed between ourselves upon similar standards in connection with lakes and seas.
I believe that the rapporteur has had a very important role to play in this connection.
In the speech he made today, he has also shown that he is familiar with what applies in different parts of Europe.
I am grateful for his having mentioned my own country.
We have arrived at a sensible proposal, and one that is important in terms of the environment.
The directive also entails the introduction of something essential: noise regulations for water scooters.
The new water scooters released onto the market as from 1 January 2005 will have to comply with the directive.
When, before the end of 2006, the Commission goes on to review the directive, it is important for the issue of noise from water scooters to be examined in detail, because water scooters at present constitute the greatest nuisance in terms of noise in many areas of the vulnerable Scandinavian archipelago.
I am also delighted that it has been possible to agree upon a review of the various categories of boat.
You cannot imagine the anxiety that has been felt in Finland concerning what would happen in connection with what are known as the Savolax boats.
There was concern that they might fall foul of the directive, an issue of which the Finnish Commissioner is well aware. This matter too would now appear, however, to have been dealt with.
I hope that a new approach can be adopted when reviewing the directive, for we are concerned here with thoroughly detailed regulation that should perhaps take a different turn in the future.
Finally, I agree with the rapporteur that it is a good solution not to require the Commission to go in for in-use compliance testing.
There are certainly many alternatives, including voluntary systems, for achieving precisely what we are seeking, and at a more reasonable cost.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to recommend that we, by acclamation, approve the report by the conciliation delegation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in Portugal, and more precisely in the Algarve region, which I represent here, recreational craft and jet skis are an undeniable fact of everyday life due to the abundance of bathing resorts and the tourist activities associated with them.
With the aim of updating Directive 94/25/EC (16.06.1994), the European Commission has decided to keep up with technological developments in engines and the most recent environmental protection requirements.
We welcome the European Commission's original initiative of making craft more compatible with environmental laws currently in force, specifically those concerning:
exhaust and particulate emissions that degrade the quality of bathing waters;
and also engine noise, which damages both the environment and the well-being of local populations and holiday-makers.
I therefore have paid particular attention to the work that led to the report now before us.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Callanan on the quality of his report, on which I have already had the opportunity to express my position, at the second reading in the European Parliament in September 2002.
I welcome the final outcome of the conciliation procedure, in which the European Parliament was able to impose its views, for example applying the three-decibel noise emission allowance to all engine types.
Nevertheless, I must add that I support the idea of a system of exemptions for craft designed for competitions and for commercial passenger transport, which are both important aspects in developing tourism, the main activity in my region.
With regard to competitions, I shall simply give the example of the annual staging in the Algarve of one leg of the World Formula 1 championship in MotonaÃºtica, which attracts thousands of tourists from Portugal and from abroad to the region.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, recreational craft can look back on a very important development.
They were originally powered by two-stroke engines that really did pollute the environment and also produced a great deal of noise.
What is noticeable about modern boats is that research and development have already achieved a great deal, and development can go ahead.
I believe that we have found a joint solution here, one that also provides an incentive for the further development of this new technology, and I would like to thank Mr Callanan most warmly for seizing the initiative.
What matters to us at the end of the day is that mobility should be ensured in the future, not only for the purposes of carrying on a business or profession, where it can of course very often be vital, but also in the sphere of sporting activity, where, so I believe, quite a bit has been achieved recently.
What matters at the end of the day is that exhaust gases and noise should be kept to a minimum so that these are appropriate to the surroundings in question.
I therefore believe that we have now found a solution with which we can all be happy.
Let me again express my heartfelt gratitude and my hope that this may bring us an agreed outcome in Parliament too.
Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the oral question (O-0027/2003 - B5-0091/2003) to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on tourism.
Mr President, honourable Members, the travel and tourist industry has been hard hit by the military conflict in Iraq, whilst SARS has also been a cause of new insecurity.
The adverse effects on tourism in general should not, however, be overestimated.
We have every right to hope that tourism will recover at most of the European tourist destinations.
Tourism is one of the European Union's major branches of industry, with a direct contribution to the gross domestic product and to employment amounting to about 5%, and its indirect contribution to some 12%.
In its 13 November 2001 communication entitled 'Working together for the future of European tourism', the Commission proposed an operational framework and measures aimed at invigorating the European tourist industry, an area in which it is backing close collaboration between all participants in the public and private sectors.
The Commission's legislative and work programme for 2003 envisages a new communication on the further transposition of parts of the 2001 communication, with specific reference to the issue of the sustainability of European tourism.
This will be an initiative specifically aimed at coordinating action by all interested parties to revive the European tourist industry.
If the Member States and the tourist industry agree to the Commission initiating further coordinated action to help the European tourist industry recover from markedly adverse circumstances, the Commission would be willing to do so under Community competences defined in the Treaty.
Mention of Community competences leads me to refer to the Convention, which, to a large degree, works with a view to legal continuity.
In the present Treaty on the European Communities, tourism is listed under Article 3 (1) (u).
As regards reference to tourism as a complementary responsibility in the future constitution, we must wait and see what proposals the praesidium will put forward on the subject and how the Convention responds to them.
As far as its legislative programme for 2003 is concerned, the Commission has listed over 40 items of proposed legislation that can be expected to have some effect on tourism, 24 of them to a more or less marked degree.
These include proposals relating to the policy priorities for 2003, as well as other items of proposed legislation that will probably be put forward in 2003.
They cover a multiplicity of policy areas, mainly transport - with 40% of all proposals and half of the most important - followed by taxation issues with 5 proposals.
It is to be hoped that these initiatives by the Commission will receive this House's support.
Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no doubt that, especially recently, tourism in Europe is going through a serious crisis, due in part to the Iraqi crisis.
I think that there should be action to deal with this problem at European level.
We would expect more substantial steps in this direction but, of course, the basic problem is the lack of a legal basis in the Treaty.
And that is what I shall focus on in my intervention.
I know that from time to time the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, also does what he can and what he is allowed to do on the basis of the current legislative framework; however, there are initiatives which affect the tourism sector and do not fit into a single approach and, at the same time, there is the strange phenomenon that, although we have policy for industry, we do not have policy for the most important part of industry or, in all events, a part which is becoming more and more important, which is tourism.
It is also strange, I think, that there are policies on various individual issues, such as fisheries, and rightly so, while the tourism sector, which provides work for a great many workers, the number of which rises year by year, is ignored.
No-one here in this Parliament, Commissioner, is talking about replacing the role of the Member States.
On the contrary.
We are talking about added value at Brussels level.
We are talking about coordinating action, we are talking about imitating what is basically happening in other sectors, as in the example of industry I mentioned to you.
The constitutional Convention is an important opportunity that should not be missed.
Your reply, the reply of the Commission, not you personally, because I know that you are not responsible for the issue, you are merely so kind as to represent the Commission here, does not, I must say, satisfy Parliament.
If you look at the positions taken by Parliament from time to time, your reply is rather neutral.
One expects a stronger commitment on the part of the Commission for the Convention.
There are members of the Convention who are addressing the issue.
Our honourable friend, Mr Lamassoure, has tabled an amendment so that tourism becomes an additional responsibility of the European Union and we are waiting for substantial steps and a strong commitment on this particular issue on the part of the European Commission, because the Convention cannot and must not go unexploited.
This is an opportunity for us to make a fresh start on tourism at European level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, approximately one year ago, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the future of tourism in Europe, for which I was rapporteur, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
This resolution expressly proposed that the tourism sector should have a solid legal base in the future European Constitution in order to allow the Commission to react effectively to the various problems that might arise.
Since this is one of the largest sectors of activity in Europe, which is the top tourist region in the world, and since it is one of the sectors with the brightest future in terms of jobs and wealth creation, it is hard to understand the lack of political recognition and means for intervention provided in the current Treaties.
Since the growing trend in our manufacturing industry is to relocate outside Europe, tourism emerges as a labour-intensive activity involving a multitude of services that cannot be relocated, which Europe has now and on which it can continue to count in future.
Because of its cross-border definition, however, should this activity remain outside the scope of the European institutions?
Can Europe refuse to intervene in a sector that is one of the most promising for its future development?
Can the European Union remain unprepared to confront and respond to the needs of the industries involved in this activity, simply because there is no legal base that would enable it to intervene effectively?
This is the situation we must now address.
In fact, the provisions of the new Constitution presented by the Praesidium do not contain a single reference to tourism.
There is not even a proposal to maintain what has been achieved in the Treaties currently in force.
We in the European Parliament maintain our position of wanting tourism to be referred to expressly as a sector of competences shared between the European Union and the Member States, being referred to specifically in the first part of the Constitution and in the part concerning the policies of the future European Constitution.
Our question is this: what is the Commission doing to achieve this?
I therefore ask the Commission what its proposals are for strengthening the legal base of tourism in the future European Constitution.
Mr President, Commissioner, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism I am glad finally to have an opportunity to speak about tourism.
In my view, there are three specific issues.
The first is the environmental impact.
A very large number of Members of this House come from areas where tourism is important as an economic sector and where tourism has a major impact on people and the environment.
I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it intends to manage this impact of tourism on people and the environment.
Further, what is the Commission doing about the conservation of tourism in the context of Agenda 21?
I also think of the importance of Article 6 of the Treaty, which obliges the Commission to integrate environmental protection in its policy sectors, thus including the tourist sector, with a view to the promotion of sustainable development.
A second aspect is the link with regional policy.
There is certainly a link with regional development and tourism.
But it must not be the case that a region's own trump cards, that is its nature and cultural heritage, are destroyed.
The Structural Funds must be expressed far more clearly in this regard.
The third link is transport policy.
There has of course been enormous growth in passenger traffic.
We see growth not only in air traffic, but also in car traffic.
Here we need a specific approach in my view in favour of environmentally friendly and safe transport.
The current disappearance of the international overnight trains proves that we are falling short in this area.
There is also no European regulation on taking bicycles on the train.
I hope that the Commission is prepared to invest in good practices, networking and knowledge development around the problems of mobility and tourism.
Mr President, Commissioner, what I am going to say is not directed at you personally, but, as you are representing the Commission, I trust that you will relay our discussions to your fellow Commissioner, Mr Liikanen.
The fact is that I found your answer rather soothing.
I believe that, as a result of the war in Iraq and of the outbreak of SARS in Asia, tourism in Europe and tourist travel to Europe have - as we say on the German coast - heavy weather to contend with, as does foreign tourism outside Europe.
Air travel alone has seen passenger numbers decline, with a drop of 10% on flights to the Middle East and as much as 25% and more for flights to Asia.
The airlines and tourism enterprises are doing their best to get the situation under control, but they need support from the Member States and from the EU.
There are, alas, no indications so far as to how the European Union and the Member States propose to develop a joint strategy to alleviate this crisis and bring it to an end.
So my first question to the Commissioner is to ask whether she is willing to appoint, on an ad hoc basis, a high-level working party, which would involve the tourist industry and whose purpose would be to develop a strategy to reduce the tourist industry's costs and to stimulate international tourism?
Secondly, Commissioner, and quite apart from the present crisis, the Commission must, I believe, examine the fundamental aspects underlying tourism and give primary and close attention to the competitive situation in the Member States.
After all, it cannot be right, in a European single market, that the Member States should levy VAT at different rates on similar tourist activities.
That distorts the competition among them.
You will know - and have yourself emphasised the fact - that the tourist industry merits our particular attention precisely because it is in the hands of the same small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs and training opportunities over wide areas of the European Union.
In conclusion, I want to repeat something that has been said by all the previous speakers, which is that support measures for tourism require legal certainty and legal clarity, and, for that reason, tourism must become a task in its own right in the constitution, with clear powers to act laid down for it.
Commissioner, I admit that we too have problems with our representatives in the Convention, but the Commission, too, has two representatives there, and so I ask you whether the Commission's two representatives have made an unambiguous request for tourism to be incorporated into the new constitution as a task involving powers to act.
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
As it seems that Mrs Schreyer wishes to respond, she has the floor.
Mr President, as such specific questions have been put, I would again like to take the opportunity of responding to Mr Dhaene.
I had stated that the Commission would, this year, be issuing a communication on the sustainability of tourism.
In view of the issue in the Convention, I can, at present, tell you only that the Commission does of course want to safeguard the present position, but I can certainly concede that you are right to say that we have two representatives in the Convention as against the sixteen from Parliament.
That being so, I am sure that things can be done there.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.06 p.m.)
Situation in Iraq
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Iraq.
The Council has arrived in Strasbourg and the minister is on his way.
I would suggest to the House that we should in any event commence our debate, reversing the normal pattern by beginning with the Commission statement, if this is acceptable to the Commissioner.
Given the pressure on our agenda it is important that we try to proceed on time.
The minister should be here in a few minutes.
Mr President, I wish to begin by giving an account of my visit to Baghdad a week ago.
I travelled there with the overall objective of signalling our continuing humanitarian support and solidarity with the Iraqi people.
As a reminder, ECHO has since 1992 and before the current conflict allocated EUR 157 million in humanitarian aid, mainly for health and sanitation.
This programme was complementary to the oil-for-food programme and, in fact, made ECHO the largest humanitarian donor in the country.
Following the outbreak of the conflict, EUR 100 million was secured overall for humanitarian needs, of which an amount of EUR 22.5 million has now been committed and is being implemented, mainly for activities concerning health and water.
I wanted to get a first-hand impression of the humanitarian situation in the country through discussions with our partners - the UN, Red Cross and NGOs, the US-led Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Aid (ORHA) - and Member States, and through project visits.
To that effect, I met with ICRC President Kellenberger, Ambassador Ward, who is heading the humanitarian aid pillar of ORHA, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator Mr Lopes da Silva, a large number of NGOs and the Member States present in Baghdad.
I visited the Abu Nawas raw water pumping station and the big Al Yarmouk hospital.
Another objective was to evaluate possibilities for the opening of an ECHO office in Baghdad.
Premises have now been identified and following the administrative procedures the office should open by the end of May.
ECHO staff have been present in Baghdad for some time.
My assessment of the humanitarian situation in Iraq is that it cannot be characterised as a humanitarian catastrophe.
The direct humanitarian impact of the war has fortunately been smaller than was expected by most humanitarian agencies.
No massive population movements have occurred and direct casualties as a result of the conflict have also, fortunately, been far less numerous than some of the initial estimations had predicted.
Nevertheless, there are very real humanitarian needs and the situation remains very fragile, notably in the main urban centres - there are more than two or three cities of importance in this respect - where the problem is still very much the availability of safe water and similar problems.
There could easily be a humanitarian disaster if the occupying powers fail to enforce law and order and institutions are not reactivated and put back in charge.
Safety is still a very real problem for people trying to go to work or return to work in Iraq.
According to the Geneva Conventions, it is the obligation of the occupying powers not only to restore and maintain law and order in all places under their control, but also to ensure that people have full and secure access to vital goods and services, and to make it possible for people to return to their work.
In spite of this, the international community, as such, has a duty to assist the victims of the situation, and the Commission has up to now approved humanitarian aid operations, as I have already mentioned, amounting to EUR 22.5 million.
These include emergency relief, emergency supplies of drugs and medical equipment, water supply and basic, very immediate rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation infrastructures.
ECHO is also supporting OCHA - the UN coordinator - and is making it possible for it to work efficiently.
The remaining EUR 77.5 million of the 100 million secured will be programmed, and decisions made, as further needs are assessed and identified.
The current priorities for ECHO are to support the rapid restoration of social services, especially health care, including the resumption of vaccination campaigns, the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance, mine awareness and de-mining activities.
It also envisages support for the World Food Programme to help cover the gaps in the food distribution programme.
I hope this will be a transitional challenge.
Under the oil-for-food programme the system was well organised: 44 000 local outlets running year-in-year-out provided 60% of the population's food requirements.
This was a huge operation, with the Iraqi authorities themselves responsible for the two southern parts of the country, and the UN for the north.
We must ensure the whole thing works, because leaving it to some miracle of the market economy to solve all this from one week to another is a recipe for turmoil and disaster.
This is quite well understood by all the different players involved in the situation.
However, it is a complicated operation.
Concerning the wider political framework, the discussion at the UN Security Council of a draft UN Security Council resolution constitutes a positive step in bringing the debate over Iraq's future back to the United Nations.
We make a very clear distinction - for many good reasons - between the immediate response to humanitarian needs and the whole discussion concerning reconstruction.
They are very different.
Everything relating to reconstruction brings us immediately into the centre of political discussions about the structure and structuring of power in the new Iraq.
In the case of humanitarian aid, however, the immediate response can and should be handled as a much more focused activity.
This Security Council draft resolution has been tabled, as everybody knows, by the US and the UK to clarify how the occupying powers would like things to be organised.
The Iraqi Assistance Fund is the cornerstone for handling all the decisions and financial management of the country and its resources.
The decisions concerning this Iraqi Assistance Fund and also covering decisions on licensing in the oil industry are to be taken by the occupying powers, and the Iraqi side and the UN are given a consultative role in those decisions on the basis of the draft resolution.
The draft resolution would also provide for immunity for those making these decisions, and the remaining money - the unspent balance from the oil-for-food programme - should also be put into this fund and administered like the rest of it.
It is supposed to run for 12 months, but then to continue unchanged - with all the provisions unchanged - if no new decisions are made to that effect by the Security Council, of which these two main occupying powers are permanent members.
The Commission's involvement in the reconstruction phase will naturally depend on the outcome of these discussions in the Security Council - this is self-evident.
At the informal ministerial meeting in Rhodes, the Council invited the Commission to undertake some concrete steps to start identifying possibilities for EU involvement in the reconstruction in Iraq.
We have therefore increased our working contacts with the relevant international organisations (World Bank, IMF and UN) with a view to taking forward jointly our analysis of the situation in Iraq.
The Commission has developed specific expertise in various aspects of reconstruction and rehabilitation from other crisis situations, such as Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast.
But, in any case, concrete decisions will need to be taken on the basis of an appropriate political framework and a solid needs assessment, and through a participatory process with the international community and the Iraqis themselves.
A final comment on the regional dimension: the Union is very well placed to offer a regional approach to stabilisation, which will be extremely important in the case of Iraq.
Our ties with the region are already very important.
The Barcelona process, the comprehensive dialogue, the human rights and on-going political and cooperation negotiations with Iran, the on-going negotiations for a free trade area with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the ministerial meetings and our very tight political links with Turkey - all these constitute a solid basis on which to build an active and constructive EU policy in the wake of the Iraqi conflict.
We need to continually assess how best to reinforce our political dialogue and role in the region.
In addition to making a statement on Iraq as planned, Minister Yiannitsis will also comment on the terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two days ago there was another terrorist attack in Riad with a significant number of victims, deaths and injuries.
Again a few days ago, a similar terrorist attack in Chechnya gave rise to a significant number of victims.
The presence of violence is strong everywhere.
In my capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union, I should like to roundly condemn these disgusting actions, to express my profound sorrow for the victims and their families, to express the wish for ways to be found to break this tragic form of political intervention and dispense justice and to emphasise the urgent need for us to achieve conditions of stability, security and confidence; for us to impose the policy against blind violence and fanaticism.
Allow me now to move on to the item on the agenda relating to Iraq.
Today, we face a new situation in Iraq.
From a military point of view, the operations have essentially been completed.
From a political point of view, a series of questions is being raised to which I shall refer in a moment.
From a practical point of view, the predominant issues are humanitarian aid and the safeguarding of security, order and the restoration of normalcy in the area.
Although the overall situation appears to be improving, the rate of progress is slow and it is obvious that considerable difficulties and problems need to be resolved.
At the present stage, the allied forces are responsible for consolidating security and providing humanitarian aid with the presence of Member States of the European Union; however, the assistance and support of the international community as a whole are needed for there to be a fast, efficient and operational return to normalcy.
The first priority, of course, is the channelling of humanitarian aid and the full restoration of order and security.
Significant sums have been amassed within the framework of the United Nations - approximately USD 1.7 billion - without, however, there being a clear picture of the record of damage and the reconstruction requirements of the country.
The European Commission and, from what I heard, Commissioner Nielson obviously referred to this, has already earmarked EUR 100 million, part of which has already been channelled to the area and an important contribution is being made at bilateral level by the European countries.
There are plans on the part of the European Union for a grant of EUR 250 million for 2003.
I would point out that, as long as the sanctions regime continues to apply, the United Nations oil for food programme, which was recently extended to 3 June 2003, continues to operate.
I should like to add at this point that, in order to deal with the humanitarian crisis, cooperation between all the agencies involved is particularly important, so as to safeguard access to the country, as is independent and impartial action on all sides.
There is no need for me to stress that, in addition to the provision of humanitarian aid, the need to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq from a repeat of incidents such as those that took place recently is extremely important.
I should like to express my disgust at the looting and destruction of archaeological treasures, museums and monuments and stress that our immediate objective must be to find the priceless exhibits that have disappeared and seize and return them to the country as and when they appear.
We expect the planning and the administrative work of the military forces occupying Iraq to have tangible results in this sector shortly and we also see coordinated action on the part of the international community on this matter as a top priority.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, on the basis of its previous experience with regard to the reconstruction of states and areas - I refer to Kosovo, Afghanistan and East Timor - must and can contribute efficiently to the reconstruction of Iraq.
Its active participation can focus on numerous sectors, not just on the humanitarian aid I referred to, but also on replacing infrastructures, on support and the provision of know-how with the democratisation and restructuring of institutions, so-called institutional building, on cooperation within the framework of international financial organisations in order to find a solution to the question of Iraq's debt and, of course, on the political reconstruction of the country.
It is precisely the joint objective of contributing to the more general reconstruction of the country which is yet another point of convergence and reason for putting the differences which recently split the Member States on the question of Iraq behind us.
At the European summit in Athens on 16 and 17 April, the European Union confirmed its commitment to playing an important role in this direction and asked the High Representative and the Commission to examine this question.
I would point out that this question was also discussed during the course of the informal Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Greece two weeks ago and we are examining how and what we can contribute.
In fact, important questions still remain open, such as, in particular, how oil revenues are to be controlled, what the future of the oil for food programme will be, what will happen to the contracts signed by the previous regime, how the weapons of mass destruction will be located, what will happen when UNMOVIC returns and others.
The basic principles governing our action to manage the situation in Iraq, however, remain unchanged. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, the vital role of the United Nations and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their future.
Equally important, of course, is the establishment of a government which is representative of the entire population and the use of the natural wealth of the country for its own benefit.
We believe that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, with its special institutional and organisational infrastructure and its political experience from similar situations, have a fundamental role.
The appointment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a special representative to Iraq is a positive step in this direction.
A smooth transition to a democratic and stable situation will also contribute towards regional peace and stability.
Within this framework, we have repeatedly pointed out to neighbouring countries the need to demonstrate sangfroid and self-control and to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq and to combating the humanitarian problem, with the objective of stability in the region.
Both Turkey and Iran are taking a positive approach to the overall question.
Similarly today, attention has also been turned to the question of the road map for peace in the Middle East.
It is clear, as has been said many times, that the promotion of the peace process in the Middle East will have highly positive repercussions overall.
The meeting of the Quartet at ministerial level on 21 May is particularly important within this framework, given that the establishment of positive prospects take precedence and we urgently need to restore a climate of trust with the Arab world.
Regional stability and security will also help substantially to combat the problems linked with Iraq, and will also facilitate the reintegration of the country into the international community after 12 years of sanctions and essential isolation.
The issue of disarming the country must be settled definitively in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and must be linked to the adoption at broader regional level of an overall and efficient policy for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often easy to agree on general principles, but it is proving to be particularly difficult to agree on specific solutions and decisions, especially when questions are raised of institutions, of international legitimacy, of arrangements which emerge after a war, of situations which have arisen objectively and need to be dealt with.
This naturally has repercussions both on the extent to which and the method by which questions are dealt with.
From the Presidency's point of view, however, I believe that we can summarise the priorities as follows: first we need to develop a pragmatic, global, cohesive European policy for post-war Iraq, taking account of the long-term aspects of developments in the Middle East as a whole; to clarify how we, the European Union, see the role of the United Nations in post-war Iraq; to help Iraq get over the problems it has been through and to set up conditions of peace, security, acceptance, dignity and prosperity for the Iraqi people; to implement the principles we accepted in our joint decisions at recent Councils; and to promote regional stability and cooperation by supporting the peace process in the Middle East.
These priorities do not mean that we do not face problems and dangers.
I shall refer specifically to just some of these dangers.
One such danger is that discussions on Iraq will turn from being fruitful dialogue on dealing with the central problems affecting the country to secondary conflicts.
A second issue is the difficulty in agreeing on subsequent measures and subsequent decisions by the Security Council.
A third issue relates to developments in trans-Atlantic relations.
Fourthly, the differences between the European states, although I believe that, on the issues of the post-war phase, these phenomena will be far less acute.
Fifthly, the inability to determine the role we wish to play in Iraq and, finally, any obstacles that might lead us into inertia.
I think that we must bear these dangers in mind so that we deal with them efficiently, so that we arrive at an approach and action which will enable us to deal with the Iraqi question and its repercussions.
In the final analysis, it is the stability, security, normalcy and economic development not only of the country but also of the wider area which are put into doubt or which are linked to these developments.
The whole issue is also connected to the credibility of everyone involved in the Iraqi crisis and, consequently, of Europe also.
In closing, however, I should like to confirm that the Council, as I mentioned, is demonstrating a constructive approach to the formulation of joint answers to the issues of Iraq.
There is close contact between all sides without exception, which is helping us, on the one hand, to prevent splits in contacts between the Member States and, on the other hand - and these intentions are indicative - to reach agreements despite any differences, to have open lines, to see as a matter of priority where there are bridges and how we can make use of them.
It is this constructive stance that also appeared in our discussions in Gimnich and which, I believe, can make us more optimistic about the ability of the European Union to finally play a positive and active role at this stage in Iraq.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Tuesday night some 90 people died in a brutal terrorist attack in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.
The victims included both Saudis and Europeans - as far as we know, French, British, German, one Swiss - and Australians.
This shows once again that the challenges posed by terrorism do not just affect the Americans, they affect us all, and the lesson we should learn from this appalling terrorist attack in Riyadh should be that we need to join together to fight terrorism resolutely throughout the world.
The President-in-Office was right to refer to Chechnya.
The European Parliament - well my group at least, but I think this also applies to the other groups - will be considering very carefully what further progress can be made towards a peaceful solution in Chechnya.
Following the Iraq war, we Europeans need to decide what lessons we can learn from experiences which have been painful for Europe as well, and we must make it clear that there is no cause for defeatism.
During this unhappy period of lack of European unity I have often heard it said this makes nonsense of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
No, we must treat this crisis as an opportunity to be seized and make sure that in future we do better than with the Iraq crisis and the Iraq war.
Above all, we need to make sure that before one Member State or a number of Member States adopt a national position and then go public, we should discuss our respective standpoints within the European Union so that we can arrive at a common position.
This demand is also aimed at the two European members of the United Nations Security Council.
The Maastricht Treaty already stipulates that before Member States who are members of the Security Council vote, they should first consult with their partners in the European Union, and that is the lesson we should learn from the past few weeks.
I would also like to add - and this concerns our relations with the United States - that those people who think that a united Europe should be created in opposition to the United States are on shaky ground, because if we build up Europe in opposition to the United States, then at least half, if not more, of all Europeans would turn their back on a united Europe, so there is in fact no alternative to creating a Europe that does not oppose the United States, but is an equal partner of the USA.

Let me add a further point. One voice in America suggested that Europe could be divided into New Europe and Old Europe.
On a recent visit to Warsaw I realised that they are not happy with that suggestion there.
Warsaw - Poland - is part of the Old Europe and shares our roots, and we should not allow anyone to divide Europe into two halves.
No, it is up to us to act in unison.
Now let me turn to Iraq.
We are bound to have a strong interest in civil order being swiftly re-established, and when we are talking about the relationship between the European Union and the Arab Islamic states we often say that there cannot and must not be any clash of civilisation, and the same of course applies to order in Iraq.
Iraq's population includes Shiites, Sunnis and Christians, Arabs and Kurds, and I believe that one area where we really may be able to help - and if we can help, then we should - is to ensure that peace and order prevail in Iraq, and that there is no conflict between the various religious or ethnic groups.
I believe that the European Union has an important role to play here, and on behalf of my group I welcome the fact that you have been to Iraq, Commissioner Nielson.
It is of course very difficult to say at this point here in the European Parliament whether the United Nations is to be given an exclusive role, and what role we as the European Union and others are to play - NATO perhaps, and the United States and the United Kingdom as the two powers that intervened there.
That is hard to say, but what we can say is that we call on everyone involved there - and particularly the Europeans, including our Polish partners and friends - for we Europeans to take whatever action we take in concert, once we have agreed on a common position.
There are enormous humanitarian challenges in Iraq, and I believe that we can make a contribution to security there, to the establishment of a police force, to water supply, to healthcare and to a new political order in general.
In conclusion, let me say this: we do of course have questions for our American friends and partners.
So far, no weapons of mass destruction have been found.
I recommend that the search for them should be continued, as that was the basis for intervention, and its political credibility is dependent on that, which is why we need to take that question very seriously indeed.
(Applause)
What we need to achieve now is a peaceful solution in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, and that was indeed our great hope following the Kuwait crisis in 1991, when I was very much in favour of the liberation of Kuwait and the firm action against Saddam Hussein that it involved.
We must seize this opportunity now.
The credibility of our policy will also depend on our success in achieving a peaceful solution there, and I call on all of us to make a united and decisive contribution as Europeans.
(Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by joining - on behalf of the Socialist Group - in the condemnation of the massive attacks in Saudi Arabia and Chechnya, and Parliament should also send its condolences to the families of all the victims of this war, particularly the civil population, and stress that we profoundly regret the fact that 14 journalists have died during the conflict, two have disappeared and American troops have bombed media organisations such as Al-Jazeera and also the Palestine hotel, which was occupied by journalists.
Having heard Mr Poettering, I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that we regret even more than you that it has not been considered appropriate to produce a resolution, because we could have agreed on many points and because it is important that the European Parliament's voice is heard.
We are giving the impression that we are indifferent to what is happening and we have a shared responsibility with the other institutions of the Union.
Firstly, with regard to the emergency situation, I would like to welcome the efforts the Commission is making - the Commissioner has been in Baghdad.
EUR 100 million is being provided, and I would ask you please to include women in the peace negotiations and in aid, because this is a very important element if peace is to be achieved in Iraq.
Furthermore, I believe we must support the restoration of basic services.
The Commissioner has raised a point which I believe to be important: we must not confuse humanitarian aid with reconstruction and, above all, humanitarian aid must not be a political bargaining chip.
You have the support of the Socialist Group in this regard.
With regard to the reconstruction process and the debate under way in the Security Council, I would like firstly to point out that, according to international law, we are in a de facto situation, in which there is a coalition which is acting as an occupying power in occupied territory.
In accordance with the Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations, the coalition has clear responsibilities and limits to its authority, and this must be incorporated into the current framework, because otherwise everything will depend on the power games in Washington.
I remind you that the first team of American governors in Iraq has already come to an end.
The confusion is increasing all the time and it is therefore important to reaffirm the role of the United Nations Security Council.
We Europeans have responsibilities here.
It is the case that, according to Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Treaty, we are obliged to coordinate our positions.
But it is odd that we are able to coordinate them amongst Europeans and with others, in the Middle East Quartet and even with the Arab League, but the same principle is not applied in the Security Council.
Public opinion cannot understand this and furthermore Europe has serious responsibilities here.
It is therefore very important that the agreement reached in Athens on 16 April is now applied, but within the framework of international law.
Why?
In order to establish a government belonging to the Iraqi people, which respects territorial integrity and also provides the Iraqi people with an opportunity, having finally been liberated from a despotic tyranny.
We are beginning to see the disappearance of political and religious repression and the Iraqi people are being allowed to express themselves.
This is an absolutely essential issue.
The lifting of the embargo - as expressed in several United Nations Resolutions - must be carried out under the authority of those Resolutions.
The inspectors must also return, because paradoxically the only people who have found any traces of weapons of mass destruction have been the teams of Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei rather than the American inspectors, who are acting illegally, and it is therefore also important to intervene in this regard.
I would like to reiterate, on behalf of my group, that Iraqi oil and its exploitation belongs to the Iraqi people.
Oil - as we have seen too often - is a poisoned gift and there must be genuine respect for its use and the right to access to resources for the Iraqi people.
Finally, Mr President, please allow me to refer to the situation in the Middle East.
We cannot say that action had to be taken because 12 years had passed during which the regime of Saddam Hussein had not respected the United Nations resolutions when we have been waiting three decades for Resolution 242 to be complied with.
We must support the roadmap, Mr Sharon cannot cold-shoulder the Union's High Representative for Foreign Policy, Mr Solana, because he has met President Arafat.
We must show goodwill, and above all we must defuse the most dangerous time bomb in the Middle East.
And all this requires that we Europeans re-establish our unity and act together.
Mr President, although many of us opposed the basis for the recent war with Iraq, we can unite in rejoicing at the fall of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein.
The Iraqi people can now rebuild their country as a free democracy, at peace with its neighbours and using its immense natural resources to raise the standard of living.
The question for Europe today is how to unite in rebuilding Iraq so that we can overcome our previous division.
We must project Europe's voice with the unity of a choir singing from the same hymn sheet, rather than the dissonance of an unruly cacophony.
The informal meeting of foreign ministers leaves me cautiously optimistic.
I welcome the proposals from the Commission and the Greek Presidency to guide our action in post-war Iraq.
While we may not yet have the capacity to wage war in defence of our values, we have long experience at winning the peace.
My group favours an active role for Europe in rebuilding Iraq, but for that we need the legitimacy which can come only from another UN resolution.
We were promised a 'vital' role for the UN by President Bush.
Our foreign ministers have demanded a 'central' role for the United Nations.
Yet the draft resolution of the US, the UK and Spain falls far short of either.
You cannot give a vital role to the UN simply by proclaiming it in a recital to a Security Council resolution.
A vital role means that rebuilding Iraq would not be not possible without the UN; it entails not endorsing for a 12-month period the authority of the self-declared occupying powers, with the right to direct the disbursement of funds from Iraqi oil revenues.
A vital role for the UN means its involvement in setting up, as soon as possible, a legitimate and representative government of Iraqis, in lifting sanctions and in providing urgent humanitarian aid.
Why have running water and electricity not yet been restored?
How many must die before we get medical supplies into hospitals and clean up the unexploded ordnance?
Where are the police that the UN could send to help restore law and order?
We need to give the people of Iraq a better life or their hardship will become anger towards the occupying powers.
A vital or central role for the UN also means readmitting Hans Blix and his weapons inspectors to verify what has happened to the weapons of mass destruction which remain unaccounted for.
Their existence and the claim that they could be used within 45 minutes were central to the case for war.
The weapons inspectors have the international legitimacy and credibility to complete the job they were asked to do, in cooperation with American and British forces on the ground.
The tragic events of Monday night in Saudi Arabia remind us of the continuing instability in the region.
That is why my group welcomes the visit of Colin Powell, marking the re-engagement of the United States in the peace process.
For lasting peace in the region and a successful rebuilding of Iraq, we must simultaneously take forward the Quartet's roadmap for peace in Israel and Palestine.
Mr President, the last time we took a stance on Iraq was before the war, when Parliament expressed its full support for the United Nations inspectors.
At that time, we stated that none of the reasons put forward at that time justified a war and that 'any further steps must be taken by the Security Council after a full assessment of the situation'.
Have we nothing to say about the extremely serious events that have taken place since then, which have been in total conflict with this line?
That is what seems to be indicated by the majority decision of this House not to conclude this debate with the adoption of a resolution.
This petty decision would be rather trivial if it did not reflect a much deeper, serious defect of the European Union, namely its inability to define its identity and defend it with vigour.
This failure to take political responsibility has been spectacular since George Bush first implemented his new strategic doctrine.
To those who, like my group, feel that it is essential to react, in particular by looking towards what the New York Times calls 'the other superpower', in other words the general public who are actively opposed to the idea of war, I propose three closely linked priorities.
The first is to refuse to accept a fait accompli in Iraq.
The Iraqi people have been both freed from a dictatorship and plunged into chaos.
Having spoken to long-time opponents of Saddam Hussein, I can tell you that, on 9 April 2003, many hearts and minds experienced a mixture of joy and suffering, relief and humiliation.
As the days passed, exasperation took over as a result of the blood spilt, the extent of the damage, vandalism and looting, the military occupation and the US civil proconsul.
All this, while the supposed motive for the war - the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, of which George Bush, Tony Blair and JosÃ© Maria Aznar all have irrefutable proof, of course - is running out of credibility.
Our second priority must therefore be to make an active commitment to ensuring the effective implementation of the Middle East roadmap.
The Union is co-initiator of this roadmap and therefore cannot rest on its laurels in the fact of the daily attempts by Sharon's Government to destroy this slim chance of peace, in the belief that the current host in the White House will always understand its reasons.
Finally, we must all help to determine where the mad venture of pre-emptive war will lead us if Europe does not manage to muster the political will to do all in its power to nip it in the bud.
The fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is vital.
This dangerous imperial shift, however, is a completely different matter.
I reiterate today, Mr President, for the third time, the request by my group for Parliament's first major, in-depth debate on the new strategic doctrine published by George Bush on 20 September.
This cynical homage to the law of the most powerful seeks solely to debase all of the principles of the United Nations Charter, as demonstrated once again even now by the US draft resolution to the Security Council.
It is time for Europe to raise the alarm and to take up its responsibilities. That is what the majority of our citizens, from Strasbourg to Warsaw, expect of us.
Our own roadmap could consist of seeking to meet this expectation.
In any event, my group is ready.
Mr President, there is nothing more unpleasant for a politician than to be right but not to win the argument.
What is even worse is to be wrong and to see ever more clearly how wrong you were.
Very specifically, we all know that the so-called existence of large quantities of weapons of mass destruction was the main official reason for starting this war.
We all recall the presentations by Tony Blair and Colin Powell in the United Nations, where they produced hard evidence of the existence of these weapons of mass destruction.
Now, after weeks of searching by hundreds of American and British soldiers, it seems this evidence does not exist.
Might this perhaps be the reason why the authorities, for which read the Americans and the British, are refusing to let Hans Blix and his UN inspection team in?
The UN weapons inspectors are the only ones who can demonstrate that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction, but they are also the only ones who will very probably demonstrate that Bush and Blair were wrong when they started this war because there were supposed to be weapons of mass destruction.
This refusal is part of a much broader pattern, one of keeping the United Nations at arm's length. It is not right and nor is it smart.
Let me give two examples of where the role of the United Nations is crucial.
UNEP, the United Nations environmental organisation, has, rightly in my view, pressed for an investigation as soon as possible into the environmental effects, the environmental consequences of the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium for example.
The establishment of a tribunal, sorely needed for processing the criminal past, is only possible with the help of the United Nations.
But let us also be clear: the European Union itself can only function at full power whether we are talking of humanitarian aid or of reconstruction within a framework that has been legitimised by the United Nations and as an equal partner of the US and not as a subcontractor.
My fear is that Europe, without that UN mandate, will nonetheless, half-heartedly and probably even grudgingly, assist with the reconstruction of Iraq.
The EU from a sense of duty, some Member States because they have no wish for a second conflict with the United States and because they want their share.
That is not the Common Foreign Policy that my group has in mind.
The road to a European Union common foreign policy runs via New York, via the United Nations.
Only with a UN mandate will the EU be able to put its - not insignificant - capabilities to use in building up Iraq and returning the government to the Iraqi people.
That is also in the interest of the United States and the United Kingdom.
I should therefore like to call on the British, the Spanish, but also the Polish governments and our colleagues in the government parties in those countries to break with the logic of war according to which the winner takes all.
The winner does not take all; it must not want to, nor must it be able to.
Look at what is happening in Iraq at the moment.
It is a chaos in which one military governor succeeds another because the Americans and the British do not really know exactly what to do.
Iraq has no need of triumphalist victors who do not know what to do.
The war has been won by the few, but the peace can only be won by the many.
Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency and Commissioner Nielson for the very fine statements that they made here this morning, and to my Parliamentary colleagues for the very enlightening statements they have made as well.
The US Government has avowed its intention to hand over the sovereignty of Iraq to a representative Iraqi Government at a very early date.
Two meetings of Iraqi political leaders have now taken place.
The most recent, in Baghdad on 25 April, ended with an agreement to work to put together a transitional administration by 3 June 2003.
This administration will then work to promulgate a new constitution for the people of Iraq and deal with other long-term government issues.
I very much welcome the fact that a draft resolution has been tabled at the United Nations on the subject of how to deal with the post-conflict situation in Iraq.
I believe that there are a number of guiding yardsticks which must be adhered to in the context of addressing the future role of the United Nations in Iraq.
The United Nations must play a central role in the reconstruction of Iraq.
This must begin from a clear understanding that it is not the purpose of any United Nations involvement to legitimise the recent military conflict.
The United Nations must be an equal partner, and not have a subordinate position limited to acquiescing to decisions made by the coalition in Iraq.
It would be very unfair to the civilian population of Iraq to allow questions of principle to prevent effective United Nations engagement with immediate needs.
We should recall the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we must find: 'unity of purpose in the post-war phase in Iraq'.
The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time.
From the perspective of the European Union we must set out exactly the likely future role for the European Union in Iraq.
There was some general agreement at the last meeting of EU foreign ministers, held in Rhodes on 3 May, that the EU must play a stronger role in the post-conflict situation in Iraq.
The European Commission has already dispatched a needs-assessment mission to Iraq.
There is also agreement that the ChargÃ©s d'Affaires could return to Iraq from the Member States of the Union.
There has been no agreement to date on whether or not the European Union should appoint a special representative for Iraq.
This latter issue is one very important matter which must be given urgent political consideration.
The European Union should engage in the reconstruction of Iraq and in a situation where the United Nations is at the centre of this effort.
EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities, such as the rebuilding of basic social infrastructure, including health, education, water and sanitation services.
It is only right and proper that sanctions against Iraq be lifted.
They serve no purpose whatsoever at this juncture, as they were originally designed to target a regime which now no longer exists.
UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency should return to Iraq at the earliest opportunity and complete their mission.
The use of Iraq's oil revenues must also play a key part in the actual reconstruction of Iraq, but any use of such monies must be undertaken in the best interests of the Iraqi people, who must play a role in any such decisions as fully and as early as possible.
A central role for the United Nations would confer real legitimacy on whatever interim arrangements are put in place in Iraq.
It would also contribute to lessening political tensions in the Middle East region and to reducing the political instability that is so sadly but evidently there at this particular time.
Mr President, the lesson of the Iraq war is not that we should copy the United States and devise our own foreign policy, involving our own superstate army and military-industrial complex.
If we had had qualified majority voting on the Iraq issue, neither the British nor the French policy would have obtained majority support.
The solution is not to create a superstate, but for us to stick together in Europe in order to strengthen the UN.
If the UN decides that a dictator is to be disarmed, it must also have the power to implement the decision.
The UN should have its own rapid reaction force, and the EU's rapid reaction force should be made available to the UN.
The right of veto in the UN Security Council must be limited so that the UN can also take action, even if a small minority is opposed to its doing so. Otherwise, superpowers will act independently and so create justifications for anyone being able to act off their own bat using military assaults and terror tactics.
War criminals should be tracked down and brought before the International Criminal Court.
Pressure should be exerted on all countries to accept the International Criminal Court and the UN Pact.
The lesson is that we must uphold the international rule of law if we do not wish to end up as victims of the laws of the jungle and of the strongest and ourselves become targets for new generations of terrorists.
Only through the rule of law can terrorism and dictatorship be brought effectively to an end.
Mr President, 172 troops - 34 British and 138 American - gave their lives for the cause of Iraq's freedom during the war.
Today certainly, my colleagues and I salute what they and all the coalition forces did to ensure that Iraq could be free.
Throughout the debates that we have had on the Iraq crisis, I have made it clear that for us war was always a last resort.
If only the nations of the world had united in a determined way, then Saddam, in my view, could have been dealt with without the need for war.
Now that the conflict is over, the emphasis is rightly on the stabilisation of Iraq, on the building of civil society, on creating the conditions for a democratic state that can live in peace with its neighbours and also on restoring the Iraqi economy in the interests of the Iraqi people.
Of course there are great hurdles to overcome.
That is not in dispute.
However we should be in no doubt that only the removal of Saddam Hussein has made any of these things possible.
The second great task that can now be taken forward is progress towards a durable settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The road map to peace sponsored by the Quartet offers a solid basis for a resolution of this most difficult of issues in the Middle East: the parties in the wider region, the blueprint for a lasting peace, a secure Israel whose right to exist is recognised by the Arab world, and a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in harmony and peace.
There is much work to be done on both of these projects, but the opportunity is there now for a real and lasting peace to be forged in this vitally important region of the world.
As for the wider world, the crisis has created real questions about the United Nations and its ability to implement its own declared intentions.
NATO has suffered internal divisions of a kind never before experienced.
The European Union has demonstrated that it is incapable of speaking with a single voice, whilst some Member States have shown more interest in creating a counterweight to the United States, than in building a genuine transatlantic partnership based on common values.
It is time for some straight talking.
The actions of the gang of four at the Brussels summit last month clearly show the strategic error they are making in trying to divide the transatlantic alliance.
Whatever soft words they say, this summit was a calculated attempt to foment division between Europe and the USA, and if we have learned anything from the events of recent months it is surely that Europe and America must stand together to deal with threats to our collective security.
New structures and new military headquarters in competition with the United States would fracture an alliance that has served us well in Europe.
I am glad that the majority of European nations understand this and have had the courage to say so.
Finally, if Europe is serious about defence and security, it needs to provide the financial resources.
New and divisive structures are not needed.
What we need is increased capability.
I hope that Europe has learned a lesson from this crisis.
NATO and the transatlantic alliance must remain the bedrock of European defence.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is only a few weeks since the USA unilaterally decided to attack Iraq.
Acting without a UN mandate, the United States began a war of aggression in a flagrant breach of international law.
To be precise, it was not the USA alone that initiated the war: a whole string of allies, some of whom acted openly, but others secretly, also joined together in the 'coalition of the willing', or perhaps we should say 'coalition of the compliant'.
In addition to the self-appointed occupying powers - the United States, United Kingdom and Poland - the ranks of the coalition of the willing also included such major military powers as Palau, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and the Kingdom of Tonga.
The aim of this war of aggression was, acting in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.
There is no legal basis in international law for the attacking forces' additional objective of overthrowing the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein, nor is there any such provision in the Charter of the United Nations.
Nor do I believe that it should be the role of the international community to remove dictators throughout the world by means of warfare.
It also leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste to consider that Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was willing to send umpteen thousand British soldiers into Iraq to hunt down one dictator, while the same Jack Straw, when he was Britain's Home Secretary, decided to release another dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and thereby thus allow him to escape from the clutches of British justice.
The USA's unilateral war against Iraq achieved its objective of removing Saddam Hussein's regime.
However, the war also resulted in appalling collateral damage: the first immediate victim was the United Nations Organisation and international law, the second was the unity of the European Union and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the third was NATO, which also received its share of ideological cluster bombs.
The new doctrine of preventive war, launched by the chief ideologist, Richard Perle, the Lord of Darkness, has also shaken the foundations of NATO.
Among the questions that remain to be answered, Mr President and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are when this war will end and when the end of the war will be declared.
So, firstly, what is the European Union doing to ensure that end to the war is declared?
Secondly, where are the weapons of mass destruction on account of which the war was declared?
If the Americans are not prepared to tell us what the position on weapons of mass destruction is, then we in Europe should at least tackle them and demand a statement.
(Applause)
Mr President, I visited Iraq 12 days ago.
I spent 8 days in the south, reviewing the public health situation in my capacity as the World Health Organisation's Special Envoy.
I listened to the people.
I met with 50 tribal leaders, upwards of 20 000 Marsh Arabs, and I reviewed and inspected extensively hospitals and primary health clinics in Basra, Al-Amara and other smaller towns and villages.
I re-opened the World Health Organisation Office and I set up a clinic now dealing with 15 000 medical consultations a month.
The people are relishing their freedom.
Their joyfulness is tempered only by the continuation of the bitter legacy of Saddam.
Their lives were malignly regulated down to the smallest detail.
Saddam modelled his total control on Stalin, whom he emulated.
The ordinary Iraqi family's purchase, even of one bar of soap, was politically directed and controlled.
When sentenced to ear amputation, the prisoner had to seek out and pay the surgeon to perform the mutilation.
The more money the prisoner was able to offer, the more ear the surgeon permitted to remain intact.
A trade in human flesh, a cruel bargain with Saddam Hussein - for Saddam owned the Iraqi people's every movement from tear-sodden cradle to early and unquiet grave.
These systems are still intact and throttling the Iraqi people.
It is early days.
The coalition forces are doing fine work, particularly in the south and in delivering public health to the people of Iraq.
The United Nations - especially the World Health Organisation - is now fully engaged and is using its specialist skills to excellent effect.
However, the UN can only do so much in such a complex and difficult political situation.
Patience is needed, as is the continuing security provided by the coalition forces, to give the Iraqi people the time and space they need to unravel the evil web Saddam wove so skilfully around them.
The task now is to help the people to enjoy their freedom and to entrench it constitutionally and politically for future generations.
Mr President, we cannot shirk our responsibilities.
The war against Iraq, based on the falsehood that weapons of mass destruction were present in the country, US militarisation and the principle of pre-emptive, indefinite war, has endangered the whole human race, forcing us to live in fear of terrorist crimes and the suffering they cause.
We cannot fail to mention - it is our duty - that the USA's imperalist policy is destroying not just life, land, history and culture but the entire system of world relations, the United Nations Pact and international law.
We cannot just turn the page and pretend that nothing has happened.
We must build and rebuild our relations with the USA, with the countries of the world, with due respect for human and civil rights, pursuing justice and rejecting double standards, as in the case of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
Saddam Hussein has vanished into thin air, and, I, together with the Iraqis, can only rejoice, but the situation is unstable and the occupying forces must be replaced by an Iraqi government which includes women and is coordinated by the United Nations.
The European Union must do its part, promoting reconstruction and economic aid, the reestablishment of democracy and the access for Iraq to its own resources.
France, Germany, Belgium, the Pope and the crowds of pacifists have given the European Union and Europe credibility in that part of the world.
Let us therefore continue to pursue a path leading, as I said, to respect for rights and not oppression and occupation.
Mr President, we all knew that there was going to be a humanitarian disaster and that it was going to affect women and children especially, who make up the majority of the Iraqi population.
We MEPs who were in Baghdad and Basra witnessed this in particular.
The inspectors there told us - as did Mr Blix in the United Nations - that there were no weapons of mass destruction.
I do not know what we are surprised about.
But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers.
Chaos and the law of the jungle reign in Iraq and the citizens lack protection.
And I would draw attention to the fact that the majority of the future occupiers are members of the European Union: the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Spanish State, while the European Union is absent.
In this regard, Mr President, it seems to me ludicrous that Mr Poettering is still saying that we cannot create a European Union in opposition to the United States.
Quite the contrary: the United States - the extreme right governing there - is working against the European Union as a body with a presence in the world.
We are witnessing an unacceptable situation which this Parliament must condemn on behalf of the citizens of Europe who demonstrated against it.
Mr President, we must call for the full restoration of United Nations law and we must point out once again that the 'oil for food' programme and the inspections are the sole responsibility of the United Nations.
Otherwise, the established law will be broken, even with resolutions which the occupiers originally approved.
In any event, I would like to say in particular today that I reject the position of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, who has become a servant of the extreme right currently governing the United States.
He wants to turn the Spanish State into a new Puerto Rico.
Particularly in view of the fact that this goes against the views of the majority of the Spanish people.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all possible humanitarian assistance must be provided, of course; but above all, if this assistance is to be effective, the political presence of the European Union and the United Nations is needed.
Mr President, on behalf of the citizens of Iraq, we thank God that Saddam's reign of terror has been brought to an end.
It is to be hoped that we will not have too long to wait for the fallen absolute ruler of Mesopotamia and his two sons to be arrested, if they are still alive.
Precisely because of this Iraqi opposition circles are finally expecting clarification about the country's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
With these same newcomers to the Iraqi political stage we are seriously concerned about the continuing lack of public safety in the capital Baghdad.
Saddam's hand in this - his amnesty for almost 100 000 criminals just before the start of the military intervention by the Americans and the British - does not discharge the Americans in particular of their responsibility to provide for law and order in the administrative centre of the country.
In this they can also count on the expertise and assistance of Iraq's burgeoning democratic forces.
The huge task of reconstructing Iraq makes a substantial humanitarian contribution from the European Union equally welcome.
The food stocks of Iraqi families are totally exhausted.
A willingness to make sacrifices on our part will strengthen the transatlantic partnership. It will at the same time cultivate goodwill amongst the Iraqi civilian population.
Washington's diplomatic efforts to contain religious radicalism in the region likewise deserve European backing.
In this way Iraq's territorial integrity under democratic administration can also be safeguarded externally.
Mr President, in the wake of the dreadful attack in Riyadh and the triumphant return of Ayatollah Al Akim to Iraq, it is important to realise that the way in which the UK-US coalition has dealt with the issue of Iraq has considerably clouded perspectives.
Following 11 September, a relentless war was launched against Islamic terrorism by a coalition that consisted of almost the entire international community.
Close cooperation, in particular between the United States and the countries of Europe, where the 11 September attack had been planned, began to produce results, with significant blows to the Al Qaeda network.
The United States replaced this clear and virtually uncontested strategic approach with a much more hazardous project by borrowing the old domino theory, popular in the communist world in the 1970s, and applying it to the export of the democratic model to the Arab-Muslim arena based on a new Iraq democratised by the US.
As far as democracy is concerned, what we are currently seeing with the anarchy that has followed the dictatorship is that there are more and more calls for the establishment of Sharia law in Iraq.
If there were to be prolonged occupation, together with an ongoing general situation of insecurity, we would be facing a two-fold risk.
Firstly, the ongoing military occupation of a country where the Shiite holy sites are located would give considerable fresh impetus to Islamic terrorism and, at a local level, the restoration of order would inevitably have to involve the network of Shiite mosques.
Prolonging the current situation is therefore especially dangerous.
It could compromise the vital resumption of a firm, global strategy to combat the multinationals of Islamic terrorism. The triple suicide bombing in Riyadh demonstrates that it is just as prevalent as always in spite of the military action in Iraq.
In order to gather the international community together again around the urgent need to combat a form of terrorism that threatens us all, our immediate aim must not be to decide who to punish and who to reward, it is to prevent the situation in Iraq from deteriorating and ensuring that the military occupation is replaced as soon as possible with new Iraqi authorities who draw their legitimacy from the recognition accorded to them by the international community.
Mr President, in my contribution, I will rise above the coarse insults directed at Prime Minster Aznar by a Member of this House. As regards the current situation in Iraq, I think we need to distinguish between what can and cannot wait.
Re-establishing food supplies for people who have suffered under a long and cruel dictatorship and 12 years of embargo, Mr President, certainly cannot wait.
Concerning the provision of humanitarian aid, the European Commission and many Member States deserve to be thanked for their efforts.
Notwithstanding the efforts of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, I feel it is important to put things into perspective.
I will therefore take the liberty of quoting some figures regarding this aid.
The United States is the principal donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq. Its contribution totals EUR 964 million.
Great Britain is in second place with EUR 336 million and Japan is in third place with EUR 192 million. The figure for ECHO is EUR 100 million.
Then there are the figures for other countries.
Spain has donated EUR 60 million for humanitarian purposes, Australia, EUR 55 million, Canada and Germany EUR 50 million. I am sorry that Mr Wurtz is not present in the House as his country is contributing EUR 10 million in humanitarian aid, according to the figures of 13 May 2003.
Mr President, there is clearly a need to re-establish supplies of drinking water and electricity in Iraq, along with health services.
It is also clear that given the situation on the ground, the second priority has to be the formation of an interim Iraqi authority. Such an authority must be formed in a democratic manner and Iraqis must play a key role in the process.
