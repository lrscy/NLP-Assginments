'What is happening ... is a huge blow to the credibility of the Anglo-Saxon model of ... financial capitalism', he writes.
When will the European Council have such a burst of lucidity?
More generally, is this really the moment to be pushing free competition to the detriment of employment safeguards and trade union rights, as two alarming judgments by the Court of Justice - the Viking Line case and, more scandalously still, the Vaxholm case - have just illustrated?
Is it by going into a downward spiral on employment rights that the EU plans to deal with the challenge of globalisation?
Do you believe that Europeans will, in the long term, accept this unravelling of what they have gained, in the name of the free market and the holy grail of competition?
You are too easily reassured, Mr Barroso.
One opinion poll does not announce confidence any more than one swallow makes a summer.
Next, the climate.
Europe claims to be at the forefront of this battle, and in fact the targets set by the 27 Member States for reducing emissions are on the right lines.
But what happens to concrete measures, the moment the industrial lobbies get to work on the decision-making of the EU's highest authorities?
We will have a clearer idea tomorrow, when the Commission presents its new standards for carbon dioxide emissions for cars.
Finally, assistance to Palestine.
Well done for the financial commitment - provided that it is adhered to, of course.
But where is the EU's political commitment?
What about the clear need for the removal of 550 military roadblocks, for the end of the blockade of Gaza, for the effective freeze on settlement in the West Bank, for the release of prisoners, for an end to the humiliation?
When will we see an end to the self-censorship with regard to the occupier, to use the terms of the report by Mr de Soto, the former UN representative in the Middle East?
These are three areas, among others, in which the credibility of the European project could be won or lost.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, can I say how much I enjoyed watching you signing the 2008 budget for the European Union earlier this afternoon and - who knows? - perhaps this year the auditors might sign the accounts as well.
That would be rather fun would it not?
Mr SÃ³crates, I have no doubt you are delighted with your Presidency and the fact that last Thursday you got this Treaty signed in that magnificent monastery in Lisbon.
But I cannot join in the congratulations of the other Group leaders because to me this simply is not straight dealing.
Because what was signed at Lisbon was a constitutional treaty.
It is identical in content to the Constitution that was kicked into touch by the French and by the Dutch.
All you have done is you have dropped the 'c' word for fear that will cause offence, you have renumbered the articles and you have given us a treaty.
Frankly, what you have been engaged upon is nothing better than a giant deceit.
A deliberate attempt to force the Constitution upon the peoples of Europe but without having the courage to call it that.
It is dishonest; it is designed purely to stop there being referendums in Member State countries.
And, behind all of this, is this new and I think extremely dangerous form of Euronationalism, the desire to create this state.
And it does not take 'no' for an answer, and it is not prepared to stop at anything.
You only have to see in this Chamber when the anthem - the anthem which is not even supposed to be in the new Treaty - is played and you see people standing here, ramrod straight.
The European project is about nationalism.
To impose upon people a new nationality, a new legal order without first seeking their consent is a damn dangerous thing to do.
So please finish your Presidency well.
Keep your promise to your people in Portugal.
Give the people in Portugal a referendum.
That will encourage the other Member States to do the same.
Frankly, if this Treaty is as good as you say it is, then go out there and sell it to the peoples of Europe.
(Applause from the Independence/Democracy Group)
- (PL) Mr President, on 13 December the leaders of the EU Member States signed the Reform Treaty in Lisbon, i.e. the renamed, late lamented European Constitution.
Sadly the signatories did not know what they were signing; they did not know because a consolidated version of it does not exist.
Every so often the Treaty makes reference to some other document, and that leads on to more references.
It is deliberately this complicated so that no-one can get their head around what it contains.
To conclude, there are 25 pages of explanations, with three columns linking the article numbering of the old treaty to the provisional numbering of the Treaty of Lisbon, and to the numbering that will apply after the consolidated version is completed - total chaos.
Portugal, are you not ashamed that such a half-baked document bears the name 'Treaty of Lisbon'?
Portugal, are you not ashamed to have to accept the humiliation of the timetable imposed under the German Presidency as part of standardisation?
Portugal, are you not ashamed of cheating Europeans by presenting something for their acceptance that they do not want; something they would certainly reject in the event of a referendum, and something they have rejected once already?
Shame on you, Portugal!
(PT) Mr President, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations, this has been an excellent Presidency.
Commission President, congratulations for your support and commitment.
Interinstitutional cooperation worked and produced good results.
I also have to say that I did not grasp the meaning of Mr Schulz's speech and I did not understand the reference to the Bolkestein Directive that President Barroso inherited from the previous Commission.
In this Parliament, we have seen excellent cooperation between the President of the European Commission and the Commission itself with Parliament; all the MEPs worked together well - the Portuguese Members can attest to that - and the PSD members are proud of having contributed to the success of this Presidency.
Moreover, Portugal has always given of its best when it has had the Presidency of the Council.
That was the case in 1992 with Mr Cavaco Silva and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, JoÃ£o de Deus Pinheiro; it was the case in 2000, with Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Guterres; and it has been the case in 2007, for our third Presidency of the Council, with JosÃ© SÃ³crates and Minister LuÃ­s Amado.
I would like to highlight a symbolic measure that President SÃ³crates mentioned earlier: the Council's recent approval of the European Day against the Death Penalty.
This is the Europe that we can be proud of, the Europe of common values, finally shared by all Member States without exception.
I would also like to recall three structural measures that were taken in the course of these six months that I believe were the most important: the end of the institutional crisis, with the adoption of the Treaty and the proclamation of the binding European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the historic extension of the Schengen area, an issue which, as you know, I followed personally, taking in a further nine Member States and nearly four million square kilometres, which could be achieved this year only with Portuguese skill in finding a solution, and the adoption of the important strategic Galileo programme which some would prefer not to exist, leaving the United States, Russia and China with a monopoly.
Congratulations, Prime Minister SÃ³crates, and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
The European Presidency was a Presidency with results, but 2008 will be a quite different year - the sceptic in me would be surprised if the Portuguese do not demand results in national politics too.
I am among those who believe that he is a better President of the Council than Prime Minister of Portugal.
(PT) Mr President, how was it possible to do so much in so little time?
This question by an MEP sums up well the general opinion on the Portuguese Presidency of the EU: a success.
In response to Mr Carlos Coelho, allow me to say that I wonder how it was possible to achieve the results that everyone can see and acknowledge as EU President while, at the same time, in Portugal he achieved what he did; he almost seems to have the gift of omnipresence.
Also, if there is one thing the Portuguese Prime Minister cannot be accused of, it is of not having done his duty in both jobs and of not being where he should have been or needed to be.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have very little time to say much that I would like to say; two minutes are not very long.
But they are long enough to thank, congratulate and acknowledge many people's contributions, but also to draw attention to the fact that some doubted, some did not believe.
Fortunately, however, there were those who did believe and people with the fibre of JosÃ© SÃ³crates, Prime Minister of Portugal, will go down in history for their determination, precisely because they did believe, they believed and made it happen, which is why we have the Treaty of Lisbon.
I do not mean to steal anyone else's thunder, as others deserve credit too, but were it not for his and our determination we would not today have the Treaty of Lisbon, were it not for his and our determination we would not have had the Brazil summit, nor the Africa summit.
These are just three examples out of the many others I could mention.
Moreover, times have changed, wills have changed, the Polish Government has changed and now we can even celebrate a European Day against the Death Penalty.
Therefore we should be pleased, congratulate ourselves and above all thank the President of the Council and his whole team, the Portuguese diplomatic corps, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Secretary of State and the whole Government, and also the President of the European Commission and the Commission itself for their contribution, because it has been a great Presidency and I am very proud of that.
Thank you.
Mr President, the negotiations in Bali on climate change were a success, but we have to think further.
It was a successful first step on the road to Copenhagen.
The participants from the European Union's different branches did a very good job and the Portuguese Presidency held it together in a very good way.
But I would like to focus on the question marks and the problems we face, and this mainly concerns a couple of topics.
Firstly, the roadmap.
We have to keep track of every meeting on the road to Copenhagen.
We have to do it in cooperation and fully realising the measures or the tools of the new Treaty, and do it because there will be codecision on these issues in the future.
That means other working methods and more cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I look forward to this.
Let me now turn to the problems.
We have to engage with the G77 Group on forestry, the combination of technology transfer and the fight against poverty and climate change.
This could be better prepared than in Bali, and it is absolutely necessary to do this.
I have here in my hands the full Commission Lisbon Strategic Package.
It is not only the Lisbon Treaty but also the Lisbon Process that we have to merge together and with the work of climate change.
I think there is still much to prove if we are to talk the talk and walk the walk and fulfil the promises Europe made in Bali.
- (LV) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its achievements.
The Presidency has successfully managed to crown its full agenda with a new treaty.
This was a period during which agreement needed to be reached on the Reform Treaty, not only in order to increase institutional capacity, but first and foremost to ensure that the Member States retained faith in their ability to agree.
The Portuguese Presidency has set a standard that can serve as a good reference point for future presidencies, and we need to continue on this note.
The Treaty of Lisbon must develop its appeal, particularly since it will not be put to a referendum in the countries that rejected the earlier version.
We need to show European citizens and the rest of the world that Europe has really become dynamic and has achieved technical agreement, and that the European Union is not only an economic project, but also involves collaboration aimed at achieving social objectives.
The European Union will be able to demonstrate the benefits of the Treaty of Lisbon if it can agree on rapid, far-reaching economic reforms.
EU policies provide many solutions that are respected globally, such as decisions by the European Competition Network or actions to reduce climate change.
There are, however, quite a few areas where the European Union has for a long time been indecisive.
For instance, it was unable to agree on a common policy on security of energy supply and the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, which in a variety of ways will determine the European Union's competitiveness on a global scale in a variety of ways.
The European Union's ability to introduce internal reforms will determine its ability to act externally.
Dynamism within the European Union will increasingly determine its international status, its attractiveness in the eyes of potential Member States and also its absorption capacity.
The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon should mark a dividing line to dispel arguments about the European Union's ability to absorb countries that convincingly meet the accession criteria, and I hope that Ukraine will soon be given an opportunity to demonstrate its wish to join the European Union.
Thank you.
Mr President, 2008 is set to be a decisive year for us in the European Union and, indeed, the Lisbon Treaty will potentially shape the Union's future irrevocably.
Proponents of the Treaty here today state that its primary purpose is to streamline decision-making powers.
That is not true.
This in fact is again an ambitious political strategy to move decision-making in critical areas away from Member States to the institutions of the EU, institutions that remain beyond the democratic reach of citizens.
Provisions relating to national parliaments, citizens' petitions and subsidiarity are merely tokenistic.
In Ireland, we will have an opportunity to vote on this Treaty, and I am sure our Taoiseach must envy French and Dutch leaders who can ignore the views of their citizens or other leaders who are not obliged to put the Treaty to their people.
In Ireland our government pretends that our reputation as good Europeans requires acceptance of this Treaty.
In fact the values of democracy, of social inclusion, of building peace, to which the EU is rhetorically committed, are best protected by good Europeans rejecting this bad Treaty.
Irish people do not need the great and good of Europe telling us there is no alternative to Lisbon.
I should like to say to those EU leaders who have taken an interest in our country: if you are so keen to be involved in a referendum campaign, organise one in your own country.
If not, then let us get on with our debate and take our democratic decision.
Mr. President, I gave my apologies in writing for the events last Wednesday when I became aware that a member of my Group had pushed an usher.
The ushers behave very calmly and professionally and deserve our respect.
A peaceful visible demonstration ran out of control.
I am very sorry for that because the Lisbon Treaty deserves visible protest.
Prime ministers have cancelled the results of two referendums.
If it had been in Venezuela every one of us would have protested.
Now, all the prime ministers applauded their Danish colleague when he told the Summit how he had cheated the Danes on a referendum.
The new Treaty was negotiated behind the most closed doors I have observed in my 29 years in this Parliament.
One fourth of the members of this House were excluded from influence and knowledge on the re-mix of the Constitution articles into the Lisbon Treaty.
Prime ministers signed a treaty none of them had read in its final renumbered edition, and Hungary has now ratified something they also have not read.
The Council was asked to cheat the public by hiding and renumbering and changing the line spacing so a bigger treaty could be presented like a mini-treaty.
This behaviour deserves democratic protest.
- (DE) Mr President, there is no question that you have securely moored a lurching ship to the Tejo Quay here.
The issue is simply: what is on the ship?
Has what the former German President Roman Herzog observed so critically about the Constitution now been cleared up?
Does it not come ashore any more, is it no longer on the ship of the Reform Treaty?
Or are you simply pushing it aside?
You say that we have the capacity to act.
There is something in that.
It is just that this is still not a democratic value.
Even dictatorships are proud when they are able to demonstrate the capacity to act.
And what about the matter of justice - where is the progress there?
I think there would be a way out of this bureaucratic impasse and the waste into which you have manoeuvred yourselves here.
This would be the referendums.
It is a shame that you are avoiding these if you are so convinced that you have moored the right ship to the Tejo Quay.
Mr President, may I compliment the Prime Minister for his statement today and on his time as President-in-Office of the Council.
I am pleased that the European Council remains committed to action on climate change.
I welcome also the commitment to addressing the remaining barriers to completing the single market, although I am concerned that the Lisbon Strategy emphasis seems to be moving away from the need for economic reform towards the so-called 'social model'.
I suspect the Lisbon meeting was a gathering that the British Prime Minister will not look back on with pride.
He signed up to a Treaty on which he promised the British people a referendum.
He has now reneged on that pledge.
I believe the Treaty fails to address the fundamental issues of transparency and accountability - bringing Europe closer to the people - that the Laeken Declaration made a priority.
Mr Brown's behaviour in Lisbon was both extraordinary and maladroit.
By signing the Treaty at all, he upset the majority of the British people; by snubbing the formal ceremony, he insulted his fellow heads of government.
Even by his standards, this was breathtaking political miscalculation.
The announcement that there is to be a reflection group on the future of Europe is not welcome.
Why do we need yet another body when we have just had three years of self-imposed agonising over the Constitution?
Mr Brown says there will be no more institutional debate.
He said, and I quote, 'It is time to focus on the economy, on security, on the environment'.
Yet Mr Sarkozy in effect says, 'au contraire - it will think big'.
As he said, and I quote, 'the job of the group is to define a new European dream.'
I thought that is what Mr Giscard d'Estaing was supposed to have done.
I feel a little confused.
Perhaps the Prime Minister can help me.
- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, alongside all the successes of the last six months, the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon is certainly the absolute highlight of the Portuguese Presidency.
I think that this Treaty of Lisbon, which will also go down in the history books, is the third significant European treaty after the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty.
After the Nice Summit in December 2000, therefore exactly seven years ago, this Parliament showed a great deal of energy and commitment in achieving an improved European treaty and I believe the entire Parliament will thank you for the fact that it can now become a reality seven years on.
It can become a reality if all 27 Member States also ratify it, as has been repeatedly stated here.
Last week in Strasbourg I was shocked, to be frank, that there is a coalition of nine countries opposing Europe from the radical left to the radical right.
Let us not be fooled: many who say here that they want to include citizens in truth merely want to confuse them and obstruct Europe.
This is not about citizen participation, but about halting further European unity.
One of the visions of the Treaty of Lisbon is the creation of a European democracy, and this is new: it does not exist anywhere in the world.
May I say thank you that the regulation on the European parties has also come about under your Presidency.
We really have created a masterpiece at first reading.
It is also the basis for European political foundations and therefore for many platforms for setting up a European debate and publicity for Europe.
I should like to say in conclusion, Mr SÃ³crates, that we have planted a seed here, which in just a few years will grow into a tall tree with many branches.
I hope that these branches will already be visible in the campaign for the next European elections in June 2009.
Many thanks for your Presidency.
Mr President, I think our experience of the Presidency is that, where qualified majority voting is permitted to work, such as revising the financial perspectives to support Galileo, we make progress.
Where QMV can be deployed but is not - such as the Working Time Directive - decisions are missed, compromises do not emerge and no progress is made.
The Treaty of Lisbon extends QMV.
Let us in the future show complete self-confidence in deploying it.
But it is the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter that will endure as the lasting testament to a Presidency managed with skill, efficiency and charm.
Obrigado.
(SK) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today our sitting closes one of the most important EU presidencies of the last decade.
It has not been a typical six months in politics, with the presiding country striving to coordinate the EU Member States.
Following the highly successful German Presidency, which succeeded in concluding the period of reflection on the Constitution, the Portuguese Presidency successfully oversaw the signing of the so-called Lisbon Treaty.
As in the past, when Portugal entered the history books as a founder and discoverer of a new land, European modern history will remember Portugal as the founder of a new history within the framework of the European Union.
I believe that the position of the European Parliament will, in the context of this agreement, have a far greater importance than it has had to date.
Besides this fundamental document, the Portuguese Presidency is also to be commended for the European Union-Brazil summit as well as for the recently concluded European Union-Africa summit.
Both of these summits have laid solid foundations for the activities of the countries that will hold the presidency in the future and for increasing the influence of the European Union in those parts of the world.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for your endeavours and wish you a happy Christmas.
Mr President, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency.
I have a view, albeit a prejudiced view, that the smaller the nation, the better the presidency, but we will leave that aside for one moment.
Thank you particularly for the work you did on the EU-Africa Summit, the EU-Brazil Summit, the integrated maritime policy and - above all - bringing the signing of the Lisbon Treaty to a conclusion.
There will be no Treaty until all 27 Member States have ratified the Treaty.
There is a danger, in the way we speak here and in the language we use and in the tense of our verbs, that there is an assumption that this Treaty is going to be ratified by all 27 Member States.
My own Member State, Ireland, has to have a referendum, and we willingly have a referendum - even though I would be dishonest not to say that there was just a slight level of almost jealousy when I heard how easy it was for the Hungarians to ratify.
The difficulty will be with the referendum in Ireland, with the risk - as in the previous referenda - that our electorate will take out their increasing frustration with the present government by being tempted to vote against the Lisbon Treaty referendum when that is not their intention at all.
It would be really to give a kick to the government, a mid-term kick to the government you know where.
And I appeal to my colleagues in Fine Gael, who will be doing everything possible to make sure this government successfully achieves the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty through the referendum, to get out there and to sell the message, to engage with the people, to invest in the message in a PR machine that will ensure that we give Europe the answer that it actually deserves.
Nothing can be taken for granted.
We need to remind our Irish electorate that it is only since we joined the European Union that Ireland has become truly independent, culturally and psychologically.
Membership of the Union has broadened our horizons and encouraged us to look outwards.
Ireland's success in leaving behind the oppressive legacy of colonialism and in building the new relationship with the UK, which has underpinned the Northern Ireland peace process, must be seen as a significant part of modern European history, paralleling the fundamental rapprochement between France and Germany.
I admire Ireland's membership and contribution to the Union.
I look around me at home and I see a confident, pluralistic society far removed from the introspective sectarian Ireland in which our parents and grandparents were raised.
Europe has helped Ireland define our place in the wider world.
We deserve to return that to Europe by ratifying the Lisbon Treaty.
Take nothing for granted, colleagues, until it is done.
It will not be easy.
Ms Doyle, when you refer to the size of the country which has the Presidency, did you mean that the Irish Presidency could have been even better?
(Laughter)
(PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to acknowledge the work of the Portuguese Presidency, and that of Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates in bringing about the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon.
This is a major achievement for Europe, a very important and historic moment following years of deep crisis for the European Union.
Meanwhile, all of the EU Member States will need to ratify this Treaty during the coming year.
This will not be easy - we are currently witnessing the cynical manipulation of the instruments of direct democracy against European democracy.
I have no hesitation in saying that those who today view the institution of referendums with cynicism do not do so in good faith.
We witnessed this in Strasbourg a week ago, when various extremists from the European political scene raised the slogan of referendum, something that is of value in itself, against the European Treaty, and thus in fact against the European system of liberal democracy.
Mr President, today I also wanted to mention something of a very personal nature.
In Eastern Europe 25 years ago we raised the slogan of a Europe without borders against dictators in our country.
Today, this week, Europe really has become a continent without borders - the European Union - in a symbolic, technical and organisational sense.
This is a great moment for the peoples of the countries of the EU nations.
- (ES) Mr President, I would like to appeal for responsibility on the part of the Council, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission on the Soil Directive that is before the Council.
After wide-ranging debates, Parliament approved a proposal that was much more open, less bureaucratic and much more flexible than the Commission's.
It approved it after many debates, by 496 votes to 161.
This was a message we sent to the Council, that it was unable to negotiate sufficiently last week.
The Council and the Commission failed to understand that Parliament was proposing a new way of legislating in the Europe of 27, with different regulatory developments and experiences, and different bureaucratic systems.
We need to look for new ways of getting closer to the citizen.
The solution is not to legislate less, not a legislative blackout, but rather to find more open and flexible formulae as proposed by Parliament.
We proposed a document defining the result to be achieved - as Article 249 of the Treaty says - and, in exchange, to leave to the Member States the choice of form and methods.
If Europe wants to lead the way on climate change and the environment, it cannot rely only on policies based on regulation, taxation and the judicialisation of environment policy.
We need to learn to understand one another in liberty and flexibility.
That is what is being asked of a young Europe.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I will begin by saying that this has been a Presidency in the service of Europe and a pro-European project.
It has not been a Presidency to please everyone, but a Presidency for dividing the waters, receiving the praise of those who are in favour of Europe, but also suffering the protests of those who are against Europe.
We are proud of that, too.
Those who boo the speakers, those who try to disrupt the exercise of democracy in parliaments, need not apologise, because we have actually proclaimed here the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines tolerance as a fundamental European value, and tolerance even of those who do not understand the democratic spirit and behaviour.
Next, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say that I do not share the often puerile and infantile vision of those who believe that there is an absolutely fundamental separation between foreign and domestic politics.
In my country the Portuguese Presidency is taken very seriously and all our Prime Ministers, myself included, have had the good sense to regard its work as crucial and a priority whenever the Portuguese Presidency has come round, because the European project is also an internal political issue for Portugal, not just about foreigners and Europe.
No, it concerns us, the Portuguese.
This is why the Prime Ministers have always given a priority commitment to European action and the European agenda, because we are well aware that, in European affairs, we defend our interests through the European project.
Do you know what?
I also belong to a party, and fortunately a country, where we follow Churchill's rule: we never criticise or attack our own government abroad.
We save it until we get home; then we make up for lost time when the government is in a position to defend itself.
It is more loyal; that is how we behave in Portugal; that is the dignified way in which Portuguese tradition and the Portuguese political culture behaves when it has the EU Presidency.
Next I would like to emphasise one important reason why I believe we have made progress this past year.
We have made progress, if we look at Europe at the beginning of the year and we look at Europe at the end of this year, we will see that we have made progress, and we have made progress too in relation to the programme jointly defined by the three Presidencies, and that helped.
This coordination between the three Presidencies, duly linked to the Commission's programme, helped Europe and I believe that it is my duty to give you my own experience; I believe that this helped me a lot and helped to coordinate with the previous Presidency.
I have always said of the Lisbon Treaty that it owed much to the previous Presidency, Angela Merkel's Presidency and her leadership to obtain a mandate, without which we would not have had the Treaty.
Someone asked 'Why Brazil?'
That is an easy one.
For the same reason that we have a strategic partnership with China, India and Russia, and not having one with Brazil is a mistake, because nothing is achieved in the world - I am just stating the politically obvious - nothing is achieved in the world in the environment, or in trade, without Brazil.
Brazil today is a new international partner of major and vital importance and that is why I judge that the EU's external policy is better, more coherent and more comprehensive with a partnership with Brazil.
Next, perseverance at the Africa summit; someone mentioned that, perseverance.
That is it, we persevered.
I remember well, a year and a half ago when we talked about the Africa summit, no one really believed we could pull it off.
Everyone pointed to the difficulties and obstacles, but we persevered because we always felt that we were right, that it would be a mistake not to do it, and we always felt that there was a will to do it on both sides and we were right.
That is another reason why the summit was a success.
In the end, this Presidency moved Europe forward, that is what I wanted to say.
However, we only moved forward; it is not the end of the story.
No, we are far from the end of the story.
Just a small step; I am well aware of the scale of it; I am well aware that politics is a ceaseless effort, and as one task is completed there will be another one to be done.
I am aware, too, that on migration we need to make progress with the 'blue card'; I am well aware that we need to go further on flexicurity; I am well aware that there is much to be done, but we did move forward in all those areas.
We did not move backwards; we did not stand still; we moved forward.
After all, the European project over the past 50 years has consisted of nothing but small but firm steps forward.
That is why I am telling you this, because I am firmly convinced that with the Portuguese Presidency we moved forward and made progress and what we did was for the good of the European project; nothing else, the European project, as I said, because we were always guided by the interests of our own country, which are defended through the European project.
A country that wants to share its sovereignty with the others and wants to take part in this extraordinary adventure which is to see 27 countries share their sovereignty in areas that 20 years ago were regarded as areas of national security.
Sharing that sovereignty is giving an example to the world of cooperation for peace, for development, and this is the European adventure.
I just feel honoured to have made a small contribution to that and I would just like to leave you with the pride that the Portuguese feel for that.
My country has always been pro-European.
The Portuguese are very pro-European; they believe in Europe and, like me and many of you, they were also frustrated that Europe had been dragging its feet for three years.
They wanted to overcome the deadlock; they wanted to move ahead.
We have moved ahead and what is more we did so with a treaty that is named after our capital.
I also wanted to tell you how proud and honoured my country feels to have had the opportunity to serve Europe over the past six months.
Thank you very much.
Commissioner. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude a very interesting debate, I would like very quickly to highlight a point that Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates also mentioned just now, which I think is an important lesson for the future.
I think it is legitimate and fair - I have already done so and not just to be polite - to heartily congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its work.
The Presidency, however, also had the good grace to share the credit for this success with the other institutions and even with other Presidencies, notably the German Presidency, and the fact that we have already worked together with the next one, the Slovenian Presidency.
I believe that it is important to reflect on these conclusions of the President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Portugal, because, as Mrs Doyle rightly said, we have yet to ratify the Treaty.
We must not split the European camp.
In this Parliament, we have several political families, but after hearing some speeches, I had the impression that certain people think that we can now polarise the European debate again.
It is natural and legitimate that various paths for the future of Europe should be expressed, and that the various political families should submit proposals that are often contradictory.
What seems to me a grave error, which I frankly wish that no one will do again, would be to go back to attacking Brussels, or attacking the European Commission, or resort - on the right or the left - to facile criticisms of the European institutions.
It would be a very grave error.
The various political families, the various institutions, must make their proposals, but they must have the intelligence and political strategy not to split the European camp, especially not artificially.
As the Portuguese Prime Minister, the President-in-Office, rightly said, there is a time and a place for everything; there is the national place and the European place.
If we now split the pro-European camp, which ranges from left to right via the centre, but which is sincerely in favour of European progress, in my view that would be a very grave error.
I say this with the authority of a Commission President who has always tried to make a modern agenda compatible with European competitiveness as a social vocation, has even tried to correct mistakes made earlier, not by my Commission, and has endeavoured - working loyally with the Council and Parliament - to reach new consensuses in favour of Europe.
That is what I wanted to say, at Christmas time, in response to some speeches rather less in the Christmas spirit, to say that we at the Commission will continue our work fully committed, endeavouring to complete what has been an extraordinary project, that the work of the Portuguese Presidency - and I once again congratulate Prime Minister SÃ³crates and all his team - has left in a much better state than we have had for some time.
The truth is this: when we think where Europe is today and where it was two or three years ago, we are right to be confident and I therefore wish you all an excellent 2008, full of success for each of you personally as well as for Europe.
President of the Commission, many thanks to you, too, for your work.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to say just one thing: we have rightly complimented the Portuguese Presidency, we have commended the Commission, but without the European Parliament, this Treaty would no longer even be on the table and therefore we also have cause to be proud that we have always held our course with the great majority of the European Parliament.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - The signing of the Reform Treaty was the highlight of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, and the news that the Hungarian Parliament has already ratified it (despite not yet having the benefit of the European Parliament's views on it, as we will vote in February) is welcome.
There has been much comment on Gordon Brown's late arrival at the signing ceremony, which some claim as reluctance.
In fact, it can be read the other way: despite the diary clash (with his first appearance as Prime Minister at the Commons Liaison Committee) making it impossible to be there in time for the ceremony, he insisted on going anyway to sign in person rather than leave it just to David Miliband, which would have been perfectly possible.
in writing. - (PT) In this debate on the Portuguese Presidency, the President of the Council of the European Union placed special emphasis on the Treaty that takes up the essence of the so-called European Constitution, and to which he wishes to associate the name of Lisbon.
Unfortunately, this has not been a good Presidency for the workers and poor of the European Union.
One cannot be satisfied knowing that the Portuguese Presidency managed to consolidate the neo-liberal path, with even freer competition, so that economic and financial groups can impose their terms and prosper on the ruins of micro-enterprises and SMEs and the privatisation of public services, so that they can bring to bear their reading of flexicurity as a real weapon to exploit anyone who works, perpetuating the increasingly neo-liberal practical application of the Lisbon Strategy.
As was clear from the debate, the European powers will try to consolidate and expand their power, seeking to circumvent the right of the peoples of each country to express their opinion on the Treaty in a referendum, after a democratic discussion of the content of the text that is to be signed.
The propaganda campaign is being prepared by the powers and power elites which, in the various countries, support right-wing policies, attempting to escape referendums, except in Ireland, where it is compulsory.
Ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of the conclusion of the Portuguese Presidency I would like to express my satisfaction that as of 21 December 2007 the internal borders of the Schengen area will become a thing of the past.
Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks for your personal involvement and Portugal's spirited stance in striving to make the free movement of persons, one of the four fundamental freedoms of the Union, a reality for the citizens of nine Member States, including my own, Slovakia, by the planned deadline.
The road to this long-awaited freedom within the EU was not easy and on several occasions it seemed that the entire project had reached an impasse.
A year ago there was not much to celebrate, as the European Commission was advising at that time that the date of the enlargement of the borderless area be deferred to 2009.
This delay was caused by difficulties in the preparation of SIS II, designed to increase the potential of the present SIS and allow its enlargement to the East of the EU.
Several Member States were unwilling to seek a solution; the Portuguese representatives, however, did not hesitate.
Shortly after the first signs of a crisis, the approval of the elegant 'SISone4ALL' solution proposed by the Portuguese offered a glimmer of hope that the long-awaited enlargement of the Schengen area might be achieved.
Thanks to the constructive approach and the subsequent determination of the Portuguese Presidency this year, we will have a Christmas without passport controls.

Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session adjourned on Tuesday, 18 December 2007.
Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first of our meetings to be held in the new year 2008.
May I wish every one of you health and happiness and hope that together we are successful in the tasks that have been entrusted to us, namely to take the European Union forward to a positive future.
Allow me to make a few remarks about the work we have to do.
On the day the European Parliament held its last sitting here in Strasbourg, namely 13 December 2007, the Reform Treaty was signed in Lisbon.
In a short speech that I made - in the presence of the President of the European Council, JosÃ© Socrates, and EC President, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso - I expressed the will of the great majority of the European Parliament that the Reform Treaty should become a legal, and hence a political, reality by 1 January 2009.
This objective remains the priority of priorities for the year 2008.
On 21 December border restrictions were lifted for those nine countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.
These were indeed moving events.
For hundreds of years soldiers had forced their way across the national borders of our continent to inflict war, misery and suffering on others.
The removal of the barriers between our nations means this: our neighbours welcome us.
We are all common citizens of the European Union, and as it says in the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007: 'We are united for the better'.
(Applause)
Malta and Cyprus joined the European Monetary Union on 1 January.
Our common currency, the Euro, is therefore the official means of payment in both these countries.
We extend our warmest welcome to Malta and Cyprus.
(Applause)
The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was celebrated in Ljubljana on 9 January at an impressive ceremony attended by members of the European Council, Commission and Parliament.
The Intercultural Dialogue will be a key feature of our work during the coming year and will remain so.
I would ask you all to be present tomorrow for the statement by the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun.
Let me now move on to two final items: our legislative work this year will be significantly influenced by climate and environmental issues.
As legislators we owe much responsibility to climate and environmental protection, on the one hand, and to the protection of European competitiveness and to the safeguarding of jobs, on the other.
Together we have to strike the right balance between the economy and the ecology.
The European Union is based on values, rights and responsibilities.
On 12 December 2007 the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights here in this very Chamber.
This marked a significant event for the citizens of the European Union and for the European Parliament too.
During the signing a number of members interrupted the proceedings with loud heckling and attempted to prevent the speakers from being heard.
Nothing can justify such behaviour.
(Applause)
Free speech is the basis of democracy and of parliamentarianism.
Every Member of the European Parliament is entitled freely to express his or her opinion in any of the designated debates.
It is our common duty to protect this right at all times.
What is more, to prevent speakers from addressing the European Parliament, and especially when they are guests in this House, offends against the basic rights of freedom, democracy and parliamentarianism.
(Applause)
This also means that it contravenes our Rules of Procedure, which cannot be accepted under any circumstances.
I therefore intend to take action, as provided for in the Rules of Procedure, against those Members who continued in their attempt to interrupt the proceedings, despite repeated requests from the Chair to desist.
(Applause)
The same applies to those Members who behaved in an unseemly way towards our ushers, who were only carrying out their proper duties.
(Applause)
The new year will pose great challenges for us.
However, I am convinced that we will overcome these by showing respect and consideration for each other.
It is very much with this in mind that I would again wish you all the very best for 2008.
(Applause)
Approval of the minutes
The Minutes for the sitting of Tuesday, 18 December 2007 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, before we get to the agenda, I would like a little clarification on an item on the agenda for tomorrow morning, which you have already mentioned: the address by the Grand Mufti of Syria.
His will be the first of a series of speeches by religious leaders before the plenary of this House in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
I would like to know why the Conference of Presidents has chosen to interpret intercultural dialogue exclusively as an interreligious monologue and whether it feels a part-session is an appropriate platform for religious messages.
(Applause)
Finally, I would like to know whether the Conference of Presidents is willing to consider widening the list of guest speakers and making it more representative by including women and non-religious organisations.
The ALDE Group has suggested that Ms Jahangir, the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, should be invited to address the plenary as well.
I hope you can enlighten me.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs in 't Veld.
If I recall correctly, this was in fact a unanimous decision taken by the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has doubts about this, so we shall check it out.
In any case, it was a decision taken by a very big majority, wherein we also said that the list did not have to be conclusive and that we would also be calling on the various committees of the European Parliament, in particular, to propose further activities on which we could then vote.
Mrs in 't Veld, you can be assured that in this case the discussion was as broad as possible and that we also remain open to further proposals, though of course these will have to be decided on by the Conference of Presidents or by Parliament.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to point out that my Group did not agree.
I would just point out once more that your Group was evidently not in agreement.
We shall check this again in the Minutes, not because we question what you have said but to ensure that the Minutes are also accurate.
In any case, the decision was taken by a majority of the kind rarely seen in the Conference of Presidents.
Mr President, I would just like to add to the point made by Ms in 't Veld.
As I said in an email addressed to you and copied to other Members this morning, another regrettable fact is that it seems that you have made the Grand Mufti comparable to the Pope and the UK Chief Rabbi as a European representative of his particular religion.
I think that sends a very bad signal to Muslims who are European.
The visit tomorrow demands every courtesy - although one would like an exchange of views about human rights abuses in Syria.
I hope, however, that in your future list of invitees this year you will make sure that a European representative of Islam is invited and not somebody from outside the EU who might be taken to represent Muslims in Europe - which he does not.
Mrs Ludford, even with all goodwill and understanding for one another it will surely never be possible to reach a hundred per cent agreement on matters of this kind.
Even so, I can tell you that the Group chairmen reached their decision by a large majority.
With goodwill it will also be possible to balance this out through the activities of our various committees so that everyone feels included in the result.
I would now really like to ask that you treat our guests, when they arrive, with consideration and respect.
After all, we want to promote dialogue not prevent it.
This is essentially my plea to everyone.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 10 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No amendments.
Tuesday:
The PPE-DE Group has proposed that the two Demetriou and Cashman reports on the control of persons at the EU's external borders be postponed to a subsequent sitting.
- (EL) Mr President, this report seems to have the Council's full approval in substance, but there is a procedural issue, since Coreper has not yet met - I think it is to meet tomorrow or the day after.
Furthermore, the Slovenian Presidency has asked, for procedural and official reasons, for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part-session in Belgium.
There is no objection to this postponement.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
Wednesday:
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe moved that the debate on the statements of the Council and Commission on the situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto be concluded with the submission of motions for a resolution.
Mr President, we have over the holiday break seen a number of very worrying developments in Pakistan, not least, of course, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
We have the opportunity to discuss this matter this week.
It is the view of my group that we should close our debate with a resolution, in particular since we should take a position sending a message to the Pakistani authorities in advance of the visit of Mr Musharaff to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House.
Does anyone else wish to speak in support of the motion?
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is very poor practice indeed for important debates to be concluded without a resolution.
This Parliament is here to take clear positions and not just to be a talking shop for group chairmen and other group spokespersons without the adoption of resolutions.
Mr Musharraf will be coming here and he should know what this Parliament thinks about the situation in his country, so that we can argue the matter out with him.
I believe we should be bold enough to put an end to the old habit of postponing the adoption of decisions for fear of acting on our own courage, by voting for a resolution.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
In view of the shortage of speaking time for the Wednesday afternoon sitting, the Socialist Group has moved that the debates be extended to 6 p.m.
With the agreement of the Council, Question Time can be extended until 7.30 p.m.
(DE) Mr President, you have said everything there is to say as far as the explanatory statement is concerned.
It is a good thing that Council Question Time has not been shortened as a result.
I just wanted to bring this to your attention.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The agenda was therefore adopted.)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
- (MT) May I express my thanks for your good wishes to my country, Malta, which together with Cyprus joined the Euro area two weeks ago, bringing the number of countries using the Euro as their currency to 15.
This means that the majority of EU Member States now use the same currency.
During the celebrations held in Malta two days ago the Presidents of the Council and the Commission and also Mario Mauro, Vice-President of the European Parliament, all congratulated Malta on the rapid progress it had made in the three years since it joined the European Union and on its transition to the Euro, which is going well and without any problems.
In fact, despite the fact that the dual circulation period runs until the end of this month, I can state that after just two weeks almost all transactions are already being carried out in euros.
The people of Malta and Gozo are proud to embrace the Euro and to have made another great step forward in the process of European union.
(FR) Mr President, in December the European Court of Justice handed down a long-awaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe.
It sends a negative signal to our citizens, who are concerned about the risks of social dumping.
What does the Court say in this so-called 'Laval' ruling?
It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement, in particular with regard to the minimum wage.
Under the 1996 Directive, however, posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State.
The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law.
The European message is thus no longer clear: on the one hand, the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model; on the other hand, the Court of Justice discredits this model.
Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue. Otherwise, it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back, which would be entirely unacceptable.
Mr President, I rise on a matter which refers particularly to one Member State but, I believe, has wider European implications.
This year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
One institution which does much to promote intercultural dialogue is the British Council.
It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.
The work of the British Council in Russia is perfectly legal.
It is regulated by a 1994 cultural agreement between London and Moscow.
I therefore request that the matter be raised by colleagues with Russia in the context of our interparliamentary dialogue and that you, Mr President, use any opportunity which presents itself to express concern to the Russian authorities that a cultural matter, regulated by a perfectly normal agreement between two countries, is being trodden upon in an attempt by the Russian authorities to stifle political debate.
(PL) Mr President, the House has debated the problems associated with the demographic shortfall threatening Europe on many occasions, that is to say, we have discussed the consequent social problems.
At the same time, VAT on children's goods in the European Union is charged at the basic rate, in other words, at the highest possible rate.
Children's goods were subject to a special lower rate in Poland before my country joined the Union.
One of the legal implications of Poland's entry into the Union unfortunately involved raising the VAT rate on children's goods, which ran counter to the family-orientated policy adopted by Poland.
I call on the European Commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all Member States of the Union, and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children.
This would help us all to implement the Lisbon Strategy.
(ES) Mr President, the Commission's Work Programme for 2008 states that the citizen is and should be the core of the European project.
Extrapolating on this idea, I believe that the European Union is not approaching the Kosovo process in the correct manner.
We cannot continue to debate whether this or that international situation is appropriate for recognising Kosovo's independence.
One question must take precedence over all the others: what do the people of Kosovo want?
They are the most important of all.
The key to resolving the conflicts lies in two elements: respect for human rights and recognition of their right as a people to decide freely on their future.
I believe that the European Union should use these words as a reference for situations that arise both within and outside its borders.
- (CS) I would like to talk about an awkward issue, which is the widespread campaign against smoking and smokers in the European Union, a campaign which is also based on legal acts passed by the European Parliament.
There is no doubt that the motivation for the campaign is a noble one, as it relates to citizens' health.
However, in my opinion it is also highlighting issues which are not dignified and which discriminate against a large section of society, which has practically been criminalised due to its dependence on smoking.
The heavy financial losses of pub-type establishments in the countries that introduced a ban on smoking in restaurants cannot be overlooked either.
I presume that the attention that is given to smokers should also appropriately be given to the tobacco industry.
It is not a secret that for decades some ingredients have been added to tobacco, such as nitrosamines, which are nitrogen compounds that cause cancer and an increased absorption of nicotine.
In most cases the damage to a human being is caused not by nicotine but by these very admixtures.
In my opinion, tobacco production and the composition of tobacco products should also be subject to regulation.
Mr President, three years ago this month, Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by IRA members in Belfast.
Abhorrence at that murder reached this House when the McCartney sisters brought here and put their case for justice in respect of that.
Three years on, justice still evades them.
Why?
Primarily because the party which could help the most - Sinn Fein - is still more interested in protecting their own than seeing the killers brought to justice.
Indeed, the situation has worsened, because pressure on Sinn Fein has been eased by their admission to government, with the result that, for the sake of maintaining that government, those like my former party the DUP are prepared to let Sinn Fein off the hook.
Tragically, justice for Robert McCartney is secondary to maintaining the 'chuckle coalition' at Stormont.
Likewise with the more recent murder of Paul Quinn, undoubtedly by the military wing of Sinn Fein - it, too, will be shamefully whitewashed and swept under the carpet.
That is what happens when you treat with the forces of terrorism.
(EL) Mr President, in our first part-session of the New Year, I would like to talk about the political crisis, which continues to beset Lebanon be mired and the role that our Parliament should play.
Together with the complex economic and political problems faced by this friendly nation, there is still an institutional vacuum, because since 23 November 2007 it has not been possible for its parliament to elect a president; this election has been postponed 12 times.
Thus parliament remains closed and there is no possibility of discussing problems and prospects, or of putting to good use all the parliament's constitutional powers to elect a president.
I am aware of your sensitivity and the messages that you have sent to try to achieve this aim, Mr President, but I want to stress once again that we must express our deep unease concerning the consequences of this crisis for the suffering people of Lebanon, as well as for peace and stability in the region.
Our democratic duties oblige us to do this, as do our obligations within the partnership.
The association agreement with Lebanon provides for a stable political dialogue between the European Parliament and the Lebanese Parliament; we must make good use of this opportunity and send an effective message.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Slovenia, the only country of the former Yugoslavia to have joined the European Union, has now taken over the Presidency of the Union.
On the occasion of this historic event we would like to wish it every success with its Presidency.
Nonetheless, there has never been a more pressing need to resolve the Yugoslavian crisis once and for all, be it the Kosovo issue or speeding up the accession of its Balkan neighbours.
The only solution for the countries that were part of the former Yugoslavia is swift accession to the Union, in accordance with the established criteria.
Peace requires an ambitious vision and, in particular, the will to move beyond the Balkans' history and look towards a European future.
To date, the Kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement.
The European Union has also been a victim of this deadlock, this syndrome.
Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons, Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise, if the EU's foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed.
We know, nevertheless, that Mount Triglav in Slovenia symbolises determination and accomplishment.
Let us hope therefore that it will be the symbol of 2008!
(SL) Croatia announced an environmental/ fishing zone in the Adriatic in October 2003.
Slovenia and Italy objected to it.
This led a year later to the signing of an agreement between Slovenia, Italy, the European Union and Croatia.
According to that agreement the zone does not affect the Member States.
In spite of that, the Croatian Assembly decided unilaterally last year that the environmental/fishing zone would affect the Member States as well from 1 January of this year at the latest.
The Assembly thereby made the lives of people living around the Adriatic difficult.
This unilateral decision by Croatia presented problems for fishermen, for example, because it reduced their fishing territory and the port of Koper lost its access to international waters.
The Assembly's decision that the environmental/fishing zone should affect the Member States from 1 January of this year is contrary to the international obligation accepted by Croatia and gives reason to doubt its credibility.
Obligations adopted by a country should not be violated in modern, democratic, legal states.
It totally contradicts the political culture of the European Union.
I therefore wonder if Croatia truly wishes to become a member of the European Union.
If it does, it must act immediately and start complying with the agreement on the environmental/fishing zone as well as with all other agreements reached thus far.
(HU) The SzigetkÃ¶z, lying partly in Austria and Slovakia and the Hungarian stretch of the Danube, is one of the most beautiful areas in Europe.
It is an island of biodiversity with its natural features, the wealth of its fauna and flora, its water habitats and the traditional way of life of the people who live there.
Unfortunately the flow rate of the river nourishing this region has dropped to danger level over the past decades due to hydrological interference.
It is not just in the interests of the area affected but in the interests of Hungary and the entire Union that this unique natural asset is not lost to future generations.
We already have good laws, such as the Water Framework Directive, which should in principle protect the region.
However for these to be successful they need to be enforced at national and Union level.
It would be desirable for Slovakia, regardless of the Nagy-Duna matter, to cooperate with Hungary in stabilising the water supply to this area.
I would like to invite you on a tour in this romantic landscape in the Spring, but unfortunately we cannot do it without water, and so we need every possible assistance.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fate of two French journalists, Pierre Creisson and Thomas Dandois, who are currently in prison in Niger. They are accused of undermining state security, which carries a possible death sentence in Niger.
There is no doubt that the two journalists and their driver, Al-Hassane, broke Niger laws by entering a prohibited area. In my opinion, however, it was for sound journalistic reasons because their aim was to report on the Tuareg rebellion, and they also intended to return to the capital to question the Niger authorities so that they would have as broad a view as possible.
I therefore believe that it is essential for us to take action to help these two journalists: firstly, because they risk being sentenced to death, a punishment that is out of all proportion with their actions, and secondly, because Niger is considered to be a friend of ours and a country that we help a great deal. It would not deserve the reputation that this attitude could generate.
I believe, Mr President, that you and my fellow Members could be of great assistance if you participate in this request for reflection, for clemency from President Tandja, so that these two journalists can be released. Even though they did break Niger laws, their actions do not warrant such a long imprisonment.
We shall monitor all this very carefully.
(PL) Mr President, I take the floor today as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also as a citizen of a country that has been forced to fight for its independence and freedom on many occasions.
I should like to draw the attention of the House to the lack of respect for human rights and denial of freedom of expression in the People's Republic of China, as this affects the inhabitants of Tibet.
The latest example of the regime's policy towards Tibet is the repression of the monks who expressed their delight at the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama.
The Dalai Lama has also received the Nobel Prize and has been fighting for respect for human rights over several decades.
We cannot allow Tibet or any other 21st century nation to be extinguished by a dictatorship, a tyranny, or by the sadistic desire to exert political dominance.
The House must say 'stop'.
It must say 'stop' to attacks on a culture that is deemed to be the most peaceful culture on earth.
As free people committed to the fundamental values of the European Union, we should do all in our power to ensure that the people of Tibet can also come to understand the true meaning of the word freedom.
(DE) Mr President, we are very shocked at the Russian Government's closure of all the regional offices of the British Council.
These regional offices have been sacrificed as a result of the worsening relations between Russia and the United Kingdom.
Can civil society in Russia expect nothing more than this kind of provocation?
The murder of Alexander Litvinenko has still not been solved and Russia refuses to cooperate in the matter.
The chief suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, has been a member of the Duma since the end of 2007.
The circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Politkovskaya have also still not been explained.
Is criticism being stifled under a mantle of secrecy or is it simply being eradicated?
The EU must call on Russia to respect human rights and the rule of law.
We can set an example by naming our press office after Anna Politkovskaya.
(PT) Mr President, following on from the third round of negotiations between the Polisario Front, the only legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, and the Kingdom of Morocco, which took place under the auspices of the United Nations on 8 and 9 January, I must stress the current necessity and importance of demanding full respect for the inalienable right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination.
This is the only fair and lasting solution to this dispute and is also in accordance with international law and the UN resolutions.
The Moroccan authorities must be told to end their dilatory manoeuvring, which is aimed at delaying and, if possible, boycotting the current negotiation process.
The Moroccan authorities must also be told to end the repression and colonisation of the occupied territories of the Western Sahara.
Mr President, Mr Hu Jia, an AIDS campaigner, a human rights activist and nominee of this Parliament for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 was arrested in Beijing on 27 December 2007 by the Chinese authorities and charged with subversion.
I am an admirer of the progress made in recent decades in China; however, the arrest of Mr Hu Jia by the Chinese sends out completely the wrong message, one that is very difficult for us to understand.
Are the Chinese going to ignore the commitment they made to the international community when they promised to improve the human rights situation in China in return for the Beijing Olympics?
We as a parliament need to respond very firmly to protect this man who is now incarcerated, most probably for cooperating with the European Parliament when he gave testimony to the Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007.
We also need to lend support to those campaigners in China seeking his release.
Since diplomatic language alone would only be regarded as acquiescence in Chinese culture, I believe we need a strong parliamentary resolution - hopefully this week - to protect Mr Hu Jia.
I urge you, Mr President, to raise the case of Mr Hu Jia with the Chinese authorities: it is imperative they hear the views of this Parliament.
Mr President, I rise to raise what may seem, on the face of it, a rather mundane issue: the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive of 2000 in Ireland.
The sad fact is that this Directive is being implemented in Ireland by the Irish Government by charging schools for water usage.
Because most schools in Ireland are funded to a large extent by voluntary fundraising, this essentially means that parents must raise the money to pay for the water.
That would be bad enough, but the Irish Government has decided to blame Europe for this decision, when of course it is entirely a matter for the Irish Government as to what policy it implements in relation to implementing the Water Directive.
The sensitivity of the issue arises because we are having a referendum in Ireland to make a political decision, and a cowardly political tactic to blame Europe for the Government's decision runs the risk of alienating all the parents in Ireland against Europe.
This is, in my view, a serious matter and I would urge the President of Parliament and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, to make it clear to the Irish Government and to make a public statement to the effect that they are free to charge or not to charge schools for water and that they should not be taking risks with the future of Europe with cowardly political tactics.
Mr President, in some of our Member States it is possible for people to walk in off the street and receive training in the use of guns, and indeed Magnum guns, without any identification whatsoever, or without having a gun licence.
I raise this here because there is evidence to suggest that organised criminals in Ireland are coming to parts of the European Union for such training and then returning to Ireland and murdering people through gangland murders.
Often innocent bystanders are murdered as well.
I raise this because, in November, Parliament approved a new directive, and that directive is now with the Council.
I urge the Council to approve this directive this month so that it will pass at first reading.
Secondly, I want to ask the Commission not to wait until this is transposed into national law in 27 Member States - that could take up to two years - but to start implementing some of the provisions, one of which is to set up a contact group of the 27 Member States with the Commission to start working to counteract the illegal use of weapons.
I urge that this be done without further delay.
(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
We have been keeping an eye on Georgia for some time now.
The Presidential elections are over and finally the result is clear.
Revolution, it is said, devours its own children.
President Saakashvili was probably somewhat overcome by his fear of it.
The exercise of physical power by a country is the sign not of the country's might but of its weakness.
Objectively, we should note that following the suppression of demonstrations there, Georgia at least tried to hold democratic elections.
Democracy, however, is not a thing.
It is a way of thinking and cannot be removed one day or transplanted from one country to another.
Considerable opposition has emerged in Georgia.
In the name of democratic progress we should help government circles to understand the nature of the essential ingredients of democracy.
Georgia must find the strength within itself to step back from crisis.
Parliamentary elections are in the offing.
The country needs democratic reforms to continue and the people are expecting nothing less.
It would be wrong of us in the European Union to stake things on one individual.
What we should do is support institutions, provide expert assistance, and honestly and openly point to any aspects which are incompatible with democracy.
Finally I would like to say that what is happening in Georgia is perhaps also the key for Armenia.
Presidential elections are also in the offing there.
(PL) Mr President, for the period 2008-2012 the European Commission has allocated Poland the right to emit only 208 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
That is almost 30% less than the amount the Polish Government applied for.
Poland has appealed against this decision to the European Court of Justice, but unfortunately it is not known when in the future the Court will rule on the matter.
The Polish economy therefore has to adjust to the low limit set.
Cement works, steel works and other undertakings have to cut their production.
Most importantly, there will be a marked rise in the cost of electricity.
It is estimated that prices will rise by approximately 10% this year and by 20% over four years, because the emission limits have also significantly affected the electricity-generating industry.
Imposing emission limits in this way, and sharing the burden involved unfairly, will not only slow down the development of new Member States such as Poland, but it will also impact significantly on the cost of living for their citizens.
I wish to register a strong protest against this.
(FR) Mr President, on Friday, 11 January I was refused access to the Lille-Lesquin Detention Centre for foreigners.
My visit was part of the European Action Week against the detention of foreigners in Europe.
Mr President, in July 2003, following, in fact, a request by the then President of our Parliament and Vice-President Onesta, the French authorities were obliged to stipulate that the rules that apply to visits by Members of the French Parliament and Senators also apply to Members of the European Parliament.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to speak to the French authorities once again to ensure that the commitments they made at that time are fully respected and, in particular, that Members of the European Parliament are treated in the same way as Members of the French Parliament.
This is all the more pertinent as the Members of this Parliament are currently examining a proposal for a directive on the return of third-country nationals, which could have very serious consequences for the detention of foreigners.
I would add that unannounced visits to detention centres are aimed at preventing ill-treatment, which generally goes unpunished in France, as indicated in the most recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
(RO) I am speaking today to bring to your attention the position of Romanian farmers one year after Romania's accession.
In Romania, agriculture is still inefficient or not efficient enough, and yet it is a vital occupation for most of the population.
Farmers make up a significant proportion of the working population, but there is also a significant number of elderly farmers.
In this context, I welcome the Commission's decision not to activate the safeguard clause in this field; however, this is not enough.
In 2008, European disbursements will amount to 25% of the European average; only in 9 years' time will Romania be able to reach that average.
Over the last few years, Romania has been quick to transpose the acquis in the qualitative, health and phytosanitary fields.
Adjustment costs can be a major obstacle to Romanian farmers taking advantage of the common agricultural policy.
Romania is the second largest agricultural producer in Central Europe, after Poland, and it is only by capitalizing on European funding that this potential can be intelligently exploited and put to good use.
(SK) The December session of the European Parliament was incorrectly informed that radio broadcasting for minorities in Slovakia is about to end and that the public service is closing down the RÃ¡dio Patria broadcasting in minority languages.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Slovak broadcasting service is not preparing any restrictions concerning RÃ¡dio Patria.
On the contrary, since January 2007 RÃ¡dio Patria has, for the first time in its history, an independent broadcasting radius, which covers 100% of the Slovak Republic.
It broadcasts daily 8-10 hours of high-quality programming that consists of news, journalism and culture.
That is more than ever before.
No other European public service offers a similar range of broadcasting services for national minorities.
Mr Chairman, it is sad when a Member of the European Parliament imagines that in a democracy one can say anything without having verified whether it is correct.
Such attacks result in tension and they are detrimental to the good name of the country.
(SL) Slovenia has taken over the Presidency of the European Union, and the Prime Minister of its government, who is also the President of the Council of the European Union, has already made two assessments of the extremely dramatic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which differ from the earlier assessments of the situation in that country.
He said that the situation was so dramatic as to be worse than in Kosovo.
This provoked very heated reactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the institutions of the Federation and in those of Republika Srpska, as well as among the population as a whole.
Even the High Representative, Mr LajÄÃ¡k himself, had not given such a bleak assessment so far.
It seems to me, therefore, that the assessment is unrealistic, incorrect and unprofessional and does not provide the motivation for institutions or citizens of that country to be more successful in getting closer to the European Union.
It seems to me that, at this point in time, with issues as sensitive as Bosnia and Herzegovina, we need more harmonisation among the institutions of the European Union.
(PL) In September 2006 the European Parliament appealed for an end to trade in seal products.
A record number of Members supported that declaration.
Unfortunately, however, despite such strong support and Parliament's subsequent adoption of the so-called Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, calling for a total ban on trade in seal products on the territory of the European Union, no positive outcome has been achieved.
The ban has proved ineffective and has not put an end to trade in seal fur within the Union, which remains one of the largest markets for such fur.
Young seals just a few days above the age protected under the ban are hunted for commercial purposes and sold legally.
The hunting methods fail to comply with even the most elementary principles.
The animals are skinned whilst still alive and their bodies then dumped in the water.
This slaughter will continue as long as the European Commission does not impose a total ban on trade in all seal products.
Mr President, we have two million drug addicts in the European Union.
We have a drug epidemic, which has to be tackled head-on.
Fifteen years ago in Ireland, drug addiction was confined to Dublin.
Now it is in every city, town and village: heroin, cannabis, cocaine.
People are dying every day in Ireland and within the EU from drug addiction.
I welcome the current eight-year EU drug strategy.
But we have to ask ourselves realistically: is it working?
We need to tackle the drug problem on all fronts.
First of all, we need to cut off supply.
Secondly, we need to try and persuade users to stop using drugs and to try and persuade people never to start using them, by means of high-profile advertising campaigns to simply frighten people.
Last but by no means least, we need more and better international cooperation.
(RO) 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
This is an opportunity for all 27 Member States to promote their culture, history, language and traditions.
The Union's motto is âUnity in diversityâ, and 2008 should make a real contribution to strengthening cohesion within the Union, using intercultural dialogue as a basis.
Over the centuries, Romania has been under various influences - Byzantine, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman.
86% of the Romanian population are Eastern Orthodox, and Romania is the only Romance-speaking country where Eastern Orthodoxy is dominant.
I would like to emphasize that 18 denominations enjoy official recognition in Romania.
However, intercultural dialogue should include interdenominational dialogue.
I would like to ask the 34 delegations of the European Parliament to enhance their promotion of European values on other continents in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and to facilitate the knowledge of other cultures and traditions.
It is my hope that the intercultural dialogue of 2008 will make an effective contribution to fostering peace, one of the European Union's fundamental values.
(DE) Mr President, the matter I wish to raise follows directly on from what Mrs Å¢icÄu has just said: the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
I agree with this and respect the fact that the Conference of Presidents has taken certain decisions, but I note with some regret that the religious representatives that are to speak here, with the exception of the Pope, all come from outside Europe.
Do we not have enough religious leaders here in Europe who can be invited to address this House?
I therefore believe that it would make sense, and indeed you have just touched on this, Romania being a large Orthodox country, to invite as speakers to this House not only the Pope and Protestant church leaders - for there is also an intercultural dialogue between Christians - but Orthodox representatives too.
I would therefore request that you also consider extending an invitation to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomaios as part of this Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
(ES) Mr President, with this new year two new countries have joined the Euro zone and adopted our single currency.
This brings to the forefront once again a demand that should already be a reality in an advanced, modern and progressive Union: gender equality on new coins.
This has been a constant theme in history: women have scarcely ever been portrayed on newly minted coins.
Female figures, contributions and work have never been given any symbolic recognition, not only in this respect.
Gender equality is one of the values on which we are building the European Union and in that context equality should extend to all areas.
It is important to recognise and support the action of so many women in different spheres - science, culture, education, politics - whose work, lives and names should be recognised, studied and remembered.
In some countries, such as my own, Spain, the Parliament has approved a proposal to this end.
This Parliament and the Commission should take the necessary initiatives and recommend to all the Member States that they take the appropriate measures to ensure that when Euro coins are being minted, equal consideration be given to references and images of both men and women.
Mr President, one of my colleagues has suggested that a mundane matter has been brought up in this House, and that is the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland.
I think it is anything but mundane.
If it is mundane, we need to have more debates on it, because the Irish Government has got itself into hot water by blaming Europe for forcing it to charge schools for water, when in fact the issue is how it is underfunding schools and how badly it is communicating and implementing this important piece of legislation.
What is at risk is the view the Irish have of the European Union, because we constantly blame Europe for decisions that we are unhappy with, even though the government is party to the process of decision-making.
At a time when we are facing a referendum on the Reform Treaty, not only are parents looking at the EU with a side glance and believing it is the problem, but farmers and other lobby groups are also certainly not happy with the European Union at the moment.
Therefore, the Irish Government needs to explain fully how it is implementing this Directive; it needs to fund the schools properly and it needs to answer the question of if and when domestic rates will be levied on Irish people.
That is what we need to know at this stage.
That concludes the item.
CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework (debate)
The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, the report that we are discussing is in fact only a report on a report, namely that which was drawn up by the Commission on the motor car of the future.
However, on 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
The public is therefore naturally interested to see how the European Parliament will react to this proposal and the extent to which the decisions taken by Parliament are consistent with others that have been adopted more recently.
We have just been debating and voting on the report presented by my colleague Chris Davies and it is therefore important that we should also be consistent.
I would like to say something about this at a later point, for the CARS 21 report also covers many aspects that have nothing whatsoever to do with CO2 emissions.
It is very important that we should concern ourselves in this House with the subject of motor vehicles.
Why?
Because we have been discussing the Lisbon agenda for years now, and because all this while we have been debating the competitiveness of European industry.
Here we have a sector where we really are competitive.
In the premium market, for example, Europe has been setting the standard at international level.
More than 80% of the world's top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe.
The industry is one of the cornerstones of Europe's economy and is also a key factor for European competitiveness.
CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century.
This is a Communication from the Commission, which in 2005 set up the CARS 21 High Level Group in order to draw up proposals for a future regulatory framework for the EU automotive industry.
The aim of this exercise was to identify the adjustments that would have to be made to the automotive industry in order to keep this sector competitive in the years ahead.
It is not possible, at this point, to go into all the proposals that were made.
However, the members of the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have drawn up a list of 89 of these.
I cannot deal with them all here, but they relate to issues such as road safety, environmental protection, the internal market, global trade, research and innovation, and many other things besides.
Let me just single out a few of the aspects involved.
We need to complete the internal market for car tuning parts and spares, for example.
It is unfair that German automotive tuning companies, for instance, are not allowed to sell products such as wheels in Italy because that country bans after-market tuning parts, while Italian manufacturers on the other hand can export to any country they choose, including Germany.
Here Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts and we also need equal safety standards for the automotive tuning sector.
In addition, we need to introduce an EU-wide type-approval system, for there are blatant discrepancies in this area at the present time.
Here is something else too: we need a more simplified system for regulating type-approval procedures for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere.
Some national states have set high obstacles and built up a massive bureaucracy that makes it very difficult for dealers and private buyers of used vehicles.
Europe needs a common regulatory system in this area.
This will also be an important tool when it comes to fleet renewal.
We are developing a climate-protection policy in many other areas and we need it here too, which means we need to adjust and adapt.
Another important issue concerns research funding.
The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States.
The growing number of mandatory targets, such as legislation on CO2 emissions, requires continuous adaptation on the part of the car industry.
If Europe is to strengthen its position in this market, both the Member States and the European Union will have to invest far more in vehicle research, and not just in developing alternative drive systems but in other areas too, such as energy storage.
We are already five to ten years behind our Asian competitors when it comes to research into storage battery technology.
Now to the subject of CO2: in coordination with Chris Davies, the rapporteur for the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have once again set out a number of central parameters.
These are based on the concept of penalties instead of bans, with vehicle weight being a key parameter, but they are also centred on a realistic assessment of when the CO2 legislation can take effect.
Parliament has decided that the target date should be 2015.
We have also voted for the figure of 125 grams as the basic emission target.
If I could now just make one comment to the Commission: the penalty that you have specified in your proposal is 15 times higher than that imposed on CO2 emissions from chimneys.
This makes CO2 from vehicle exhausts 15 times more expensive than that which is emitted from chimneys.
For this reason we require a realistic rating.
What we have at present is too ambitious.
I should like to express my thanks to those colleagues who helped put this report together.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the significance of CARS 21 extends far beyond the automotive sector.
It is also the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
Here for the first time, and by working closely with all the parties involved, we are attempting to reach joint agreement on a long-term, stable framework for the development of one of Europe's key industries.
I am very proud to say that we have been successful in this.
This is all based on a quite clear division of responsibilities.
We told the European car manufacturers that they could not expect us to introduce protectionist measures in order to safeguard them from the growing competition coming from other parts of the world.
We also said to them, however, that they could count on having a set of stable, reliable and predictable framework conditions and, more importantly, sufficient time - which is something Mr Chatzimarkakis just mentioned - in order to prepare themselves for the mandatory requirements to come.
I should at this point just like to say something about the position of the European car industry: this is one of the very few market sectors in which Europe continues to be the undisputed global leader.
It is a key industry for Europe, for technological development, for growth and, last but not least, for employment.
I put up a vigorous defence against those voices in Europe who give the impression that there is something immoral, even criminal, in building, purchasing and driving motor cars.
The car is part of our European way of life and it must be affordable, it must be safe, it must be reliable and it must be clean.
This is precisely what CARS 21 is all about.
The European car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the European Commission has put forward in its proposal.
I should at this point also like to make something else quite clear: I am not against them either.
The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars - with no ifs, ands or buts - will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
This is not inconsistent with the 125 grams mentioned by Mr Chatzimarkakis, because 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of bio-fuels.
There is absolutely no disputing the fact that this will be our next target.
I am also confident that the European car industry will benefit from such a legislator-driven innovation surge in that the sector will not only be producing the safest and best-quality vehicles but also the most environmentally-friendly cars in the world.
I have not the slightest doubt that this will happen.
In the course of the debate there were some suggestions made that I did not like at all, namely - and I will not put too fine a point on this - the attempt to pit manufacturers of large cars against those who build smaller vehicles, or to play off drivers of larger cars, those who can afford and wish to own such vehicles, against those who can only afford or prefer to drive smaller ones, the motto being: big car bad, small car good.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, introduced a noteworthy argument into the debate when he wrote to the Commission President that the ability to spend a lot of money on a car - in other words to buy a big and expensive vehicle - did not entitle you to produce more pollution.
This is certainly an argument worth reflecting on.
I do not live in France but I know that in France there are people who live in large castles and who need a lot of energy to heat these buildings.
I also know that in France there are people who live under the arches of bridges and who generate no heating costs whatsoever.
Where is the difference?
If it is immoral to drive a large car and therefore to cause more pollution than someone who drives a small vehicle, then it is also immoral to live in a detached house and to generate more heating costs than someone who lives in a one-room apartment.
I would just like to draw attention to the fact that while this argument may seem quite convincing at first glance, on closer inspection it would mean that the CO2 issue would, in a roundabout way, lead us down the road to pervasive lifestyle regulations in Europe.
That is something we certainly do not want and the Commission does not want it either.
We want to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry and there is no reason why this should not be possible.
I believe that in the consultation process that is about to commence we shall have to weigh up very carefully exactly what we can and want to ask of manufacturers, consumers and other road users.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have to say to you that we are expecting a very great deal of them.
Everything that we have already agreed on by way of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards, which have already come into force, will make European motor cars much more expensive.
The regulations that we will be introducing to give pedestrians better protection, in other words those measures directed towards vehicle design that will protect pedestrians more effectively in the event of their being involved in an accident, will also cost a great deal of money.
The compulsory introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive too, and on top of this there is the cost of CO2 reduction.
We are doing this against the backdrop of a situation in which there is one particular sector of Europe's automotive industry that is under attack from international competitors, a sector that is already earning the least revenue, where export opportunities are declining and where imports are exceeding exports, namely the small and medium-sized vehicle market.
I am quite concerned for the future of a large number of European manufacturers.
I am fully convinced that it is absolutely vital for all industrial products, and this includes the motor car, to be taken to the maximum level of eco-friendly development that is technically feasible.
However, I am not of the opinion that we should do this in such a way - and this applies to all industrial products, not just cars - that we compromise the international competitiveness of our industries.
We have to be quite clear about one thing: if by our policies - and I say this with next week's debate very much in mind - we cause industries to abandon their European facilities and to set up production sites elsewhere in the world, the effect on the environment will certainly not be a positive one, for in these other places they will be then be producing their goods under much worse environmental conditions.
If the steel manufacturers were to move out of Europe to Kazakhstan, believe me, in that country the rules are far less strict than here in Europe.
The result would be an increase in emissions and at the same time tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of jobs would be lost.
I would appreciate it if these points were not forgotten in the course of the impassioned debate to come.
A modern European industrial policy and a modern European environmental policy can demonstrate that economy and ecology are not natural opposites, and that it is possible to solve the ecological challenges of the future by way of a rational economic approach combined with modern technology.
This was the subject discussed by all those involved in CARS 21, which is being debated here today, and this was the ultimate outcome.
I believe the result is one that deserves the broad support of the European public at large.
(Applause)
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, I was responsible for drafting the relevant report for the INTA Committee.
Here we essentially focused on three key aspects.
First of all, we called on the Commission to ensure as a matter of urgency, and with due care and diligence, that all recommendations are examined to determine to what extent they impact on the multilateral stage - the so-called Doha Round - and on the bilateral agreements.
These bilateral agreements were of special interest to us, as here in the case of Korea.
However, we also focused attention on other countries such as India and the ASEAN states.
It is important to ensure that market access is only opened up provided that we are also able to have appropriate guarantees from the other side.
This relates especially to the so-called non-tariff trade barriers.
Secondly, we wish to see greater coordination when it comes to setting international agreements and international standards.
Thirdly, we would urgently recommend that when examining internal competition we do not lose sight of international competitive conditions, which have changed considerably in recent years.
We now recognise that we have many more international competitors to deal with.
Mr President, the automotive sector, which provides the European economy with a significant number of jobs, needs an ambitious framework that provides for coherent, integrated measures, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, to cope with the new challenges.
Our industry is the world's largest producer of cars and second largest producer of lorries, and it has good after-sales services.
As such, it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements, increasing productivity, improving safety and benefiting the environment.
To achieve this, economic efficiency is crucial.
It is what is going to allow us to meet all of the objectives and guarantee affordable prices for fleet renewal, i.e. purchasing vehicles, and for maintaining them during their useful life.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has highlighted this aspect and expressed its support for efforts to improve competition and the protection of intellectual property rights, and to improve the tax treatment of the sector.
These points are to a large extent incorporated in the report and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur.
reporter of the opinion of the Employment and Social Committee. ?
(LT) I congratulate Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis for preparing this report.
The car industry really is one of the most important ones.
2.3 million people work directly in it and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors.
This makes 7 percent of all the people working in the industrial sector of the Community.
Members of the Community must take care of those people who could lose their jobs due to structural changes in advance and prepare for this appropriately.
Currently, problems are solved only when they occur.
We have to ensure that Community funds allocated for enterprises undergoing reconstruction directly reach the employees.
Most especially, it is necessary to support those who want to start their own business - I have in mind the Globalisation Fund.
Humanity is the most important when various changes take place and our responsibility is to take care of the Community's citizens, protect them from unemployment and effectively use social guarantees.
Only this can help to gain the confidence of people.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to add to the debate by introducing two figures, so that we all know what we are talking about.
There are now 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars.
Last week Tata Motors brought out a cut-price motor car that averages five litres per hundred kilometres, but five litres is still a lot for such a small car.
This all goes to show that in the years to come hundreds of millions of private cars will appear on the roads of the emergent nations - China, India, other Asian countries, South America and the African states.
In the light of such a scenario, we are surely not planning to protect those European manufacturers who believe that they have to market two-tonne limousines with fuel consumption rates of seven, eight, ten litres or more, simply because we have a so-called competitive advantage in this area.
I find the current debate to be nothing more than a fiasco.
Mr Ferber of the CSU recently threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDU/CSU Group would not support a second mandate if Mr Barroso continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry.
Mr Verheugen, if you pardon my saying so, you surely cannot be cross with Mr Sarkozy.
Why are you cross?
Because he and Mr Prodi wrote a letter that sought to ensure that the Commission would not set the growth curve at 80, as the German car industry wanted, but that a compromise would be found.
I find what Mr Prodi and Mr Sarkozy did in relation to this debate to be absolutely and completely legitimate.
Nor am I surprised that here again an FDP politician has naturally fallen into line behind the German car lobby.
If I may say so, Mr Chatzimarkakis, your report falls behind what Chris Davies produced, because instead of footprint you are now giving priority to vehicle weight, and because instead of 125 grams based on vehicle technology you are now calling for an integrated target of 125 grams.
This means that today Parliament has backtracked somewhat.
As for the argument about a timeline, what are we doing there?
By setting the date 2012 we are only trying to bring more quickly to market technology that already exists.
The most important element is missing: where is the target for 2020?
Mr Verheugen, you are calling for a solid framework.
How should I, as a car-industry manager, know which direction to go in when Europe's policy-makers fail to set any terms of reference specifying how energy efficient I should be by 2020.
There is no mention of this either in the Commission's proposal or in yours.
If this Parliament is to do anything when it comes to the report on the legislation then it should produce a proposal on where we need to be by 2020.
That is what we need: stable, long-term planning.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, I want to start my speech by agreeing for once with Mr Turmes.
This report is all about giving a crucial industry a stable framework within which to meet the societal demands that we are placing on it - whether they concern environment or safety.
Whether Mr Dimas has achieved that and done a proper impact assessment in comparison with what is in the CARS 21 report, I beg to differ.
One of the things I would like to ask Commissioner Verheugen to do is to take a message to Mr Dimas and ask him to explain how the process that he is currently using to develop this regulation is in any way compatible with what is in the CARS 21 proposal.
I declare an interest in this because I was a member - a working member - of the High Level Group.
This is the third report.
The High Level Group made its report, the Commission made a very good response accepting most of the recommendations of the stakeholders and now this Parliament, thanks to the good work of Mr Chatzimarkakis, is going to convincingly endorse those conclusions.
But there is one other group that characteristically is conspicuously missing from this debate, and that is the Member States.
One of the most important recommendations of CARS 21 is an integrated approach.
Member States have a major stake in this, so why are they not here this evening?
They are the ones who behave idiosyncratically in their national regulations and undermine the achievement of that stable framework, that internal market, that achievement of the environmental and safety goals that we want to achieve, those targets of reducing road deaths - where we have very ambitious targets and where they can make big investments in infrastructure and driver training.
Why are they not here?
We need to send a clear message to them.
One of the things that we ask from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is for this Parliament to take an initiative in getting other national parliamentarians together in this House to talk in the framework of CARS 21 about how they, as national and local politicians, are going to contribute to these overall goals of achieving a competitive car industry with the highest possible technology and preserving and developing jobs and employment, while achieving the goals that we all want to meet in terms of science, safety and environmental improvements.
(Applause)
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to include a few suggestions in the opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century, given its high strategic value for growth and jobs in the Union, but also in view of the need to do more, by adapting vehicles and infrastructure and applying technological innovation, to make European roads safer.
I believe that all of this can indeed be done by reducing emissions, but an integrated approach should have been pursued to this end, as proposed by the CARS 21 Group; I do rather get the impression that the Commission has somewhat disregarded this approach.
I particularly deplore the failure to emphasise the policies needed to attain the accepted cost-benefit principle.
Furthermore, I note that, in order to achieve the aim of increasing the use of biofuels, it is vital to promote the necessary locally-based facility network enabling citizens to obtain supplies.
Otherwise this aim will not be achieved.
I will conclude by saying that I had hoped - and still hope - that judicious approaches will be taken to ensure that the cost of technological adaptation can be met on a level playing field guaranteeing free competition and genuine competitiveness within the EU.
As a matter of fact, I have also drawn the attention of my fellow Members and the Commission to the importance of maintenance, but with little success.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative, which we believe was an exemplary example of stakeholder involvement.
We say yes to the integrated approach, which we believe is fundamental to the success of this initiative.
But, like Mr Harbour, I would raise the question about Member States' commitment, given their unilateral desire on occasion to legislate or implement fiscal regimes which undermine the integrated approach.
Yes to simplification, replacing 38 directives with UN regulations - as long as we are not seen as abdicating our right to legislate should we need to - and yes to the development of technologically driven solutions such as ECOR.
But I would hope that the Commission could take more action, as Ms Mann has suggested, on intellectual property rights, particularly in relation to China.
We would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and we believe it is fundamental to address non-harmonised implementation, the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive.
We have to improve cross-border inspections of vehicles and cross-border enforcement of traffic rules in other Member States, because otherwise the whole situation becomes very disparate.
But, like Mr Turmes, I believe that what we should be looking for is a framework which extends to 2020 and beyond.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on having taken the initiative to create a high-level group, CARS 21, to examine the European automotive industry.
In 2003 several Ministers for Industry, including myself, were in favour of this new method, which involves examining a given industrial sector in detail in order to find the appropriate solutions for it.
You will recall that this method was successfully applied to the textiles sector, for example.
It enables us to involve the stakeholders and to achieve an integrated approach.
I have just one wish for the future: representation that gives greater consideration to the diversity of professions covered by the sector and even greater involvement of the European Parliament.
That being said, I would like to mention three of the proposals put forward in the excellent report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis.
The first is the importance of stressing that the automotive sector is a source of jobs, competitiveness, growth and innovation and thus calling for greater investment in research and development, particularly in the areas of hydrogen motors, fuel cells or hybrids.
The message is clear and research into vehicle technologies will certainly have to be one of the priorities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
Secondly, as regards the contribution of the automotive industry to the fight against global warming, the targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions are in line with the Davies report we adopted in October.
We must give the industrial sectors time to prepare.
As a result, I believe that it would not be wise to bring forward the 2015 deadline.
Nonetheless, the fight against greenhouse gas emissions must also involve tax measures that act as an incentive for fleet renewal.
Finally, I am pleased that our rapporteur calls for the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts and for greater efforts to combat the import of counterfeit spare parts.
The safety of the citizens and the survival of thousands of European SMEs are at stake.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to point out that it is essential to take into account the pressure on the European automotive industry and the ever-increasing competition.
I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis for his excellent collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate him on having achieved this very dynamic result, which augurs well for this important sector of our economy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, setting up the CARS 21 High Level Group was exactly the right thing to do.
The results speak for themselves.
We had two representatives of Parliament in this Group - Malcolm Harbour and Garrelt Duin - and they produced some very good work.
As the shadow rapporteur for this report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I only wish to deal with the environmental issues.
However, as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy too, I am firmly convinced that preserving and increasing the competitiveness of the European automotive industry is closely tied to the question of how eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable vehicles stamped 'made in Europe' will be in the future.
I therefore welcome the fact that we were quick in implementing the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and that the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles has now been put forward.
This source-based legislation will enable us to help the towns, cities and communities of Europe to meet the particulate emission targets that have been set and in this way to provide a better air quality.
However, it remains a mystery to me that when it comes to emissions reduction people are always trying to postpone the 2012 deadline set for the introduction of the CO2 legislation and move it back to 2015.
That is not right.
We have had the Bali Climate Conference, where Europe put forward a very assertive front.
However, when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards.
Car manufacturers have known since 1995 that something had to be done in the area of research and development to produce environment-friendly models.
I think that a set-up time of 12 years would be sufficient to achieve the 120 g/km target by 2012, and this includes any complementary measures.
That is something quite important.
Climate change will certainly not wait for us, which means that we have to act now.
It is also important to ensure that CO2 output will have peaked by the year 2015 so that we can then set about reducing these emissions.
Here every industry will have to play its part, including the vehicle manufacturers.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the car industry should have reduced its emissions by a great deal more than it has, but we are where we are and it takes time to achieve change economically, so I welcome the rapporteur's proposal to set a target of 125 g by 2015, to bring it in line with the vote of this Parliament last October.
I think it is ambitious, but it is achievable.
And, to a significant degree, it now reflects the Commission's proposals for only a very gradual phase-in of penalties after 2012.
But I am sorry that the rapporteur has proposed that the target values should be based on weight, because this removes an incentive to reduce the weight of cars and it goes counter to the vote we had in October.
So, please, let us be consistent.
In its proposals, the Commission has recognised that footprint may have great merit; it simply says that we have not got the data to establish the credentials for that yet, so let us get the data as fast as we can and keep the options open.
We do not want to fight our business leaders and our entrepreneurs.
On the contrary, if we are to combat climate change and reduce the threat that now hangs over the survival of billions of people in the poorest parts of this planet, we have to get them to accept responsibility for their actions.
I was wrong in November when I claimed here that Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, had said that he did not give a toss for the environment so long as he could stuff his pockets and those of his airline full of gold.
That may be the impression his scorn for environmentalists sometimes creates, but I apologise and withdraw the claim, and look forward to taking up his offer of a debate.
But if we are to tackle the problem of climate change, we need people like Mr O'Leary and his counterparts in the car industry on side, working with us, pushing the boundaries of innovation and leading from the front.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that in this case the rapporteur has done a great deal of work and demonstrated considerable skill in how to negotiate and how to compromise. This concerns in particular the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry.
We must be realistic and keep in mind that the industry belongs among the top industries in Europe and at the same time is one of the key employers.
As mentioned earlier, the industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields.
In my opinion, reducing emissions in this industry will be a very difficult task.
In my view, the result here is a respectable and realistic document.
It is important, too, for it to support the endeavour to simplify significantly the legislation affecting the automotive industry: there are more than 200 regulations in existence today.
In this vein, I have tried, in my role as shadow rapporteur, to support the report with my amendments.
Their main objectives were to prevent the ambitious plans from tripping up the development of the field in Europe and our ability to compete in the world.
(SK) Please allow me as an introduction to thank the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for his excellent report, which takes into consideration and pragmatically addresses all aspects of the regulatory framework, which are so important to the future of the automotive industry.
When we talk in this report about the European automotive industry's ability to compete under the conditions of global development, we have to take into consideration, above all, those aspects that could significantly limit this ability.
I thought originally that it was not necessary to remind the European Commission of the significance of this industry to the economic and social development of the European Union, but since the Commission came up with the proposal of setting emission standards for new private cars, I am no longer so sure.
If that is correct, then the Commission would obviously pay more respect to the majority view of the European Parliament, as well as to the views of the expert groups who are advocating a more integrated approach.
The European Parliament is also critically considering the time within which the European automotive industry is able to meet the technologically ambitious emissions targets such in a way that would have the minimum impact on the European industry's ability to compete.
The European Parliament expressed this clearly in the report by Mr Davies and in this very report: by majority vote the committee expressed its belief that the car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 g/km by 2015.
If we really hope to reduce emissions throughout the automotive sector, we must have a more comprehensive understanding of these issues.
The proposed step would definitely lead to a slowdown in the exchange of old cars, besides other negative impacts, such as the inability of less wealthy citizens to purchase new cars.
This aspect would be most likely to prevail in the new Member States where the level of exchanging old cars for new is, for economic reasons, low.
This certainly would not contribute to the reduction of CO2, quite the contrary.
(NL) Mr President, transport emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions.
The number of cars per thousand inhabitants is increasing fast all over the world, so cars really must become sustainable.
However, this is a message that is scarcely to be heard in the response of the Commission to the CARS 21 report and in the report itself.
The document speaks about making cars cleaner and the competitiveness of the automotive industry but it makes no connection between these two things, while it is obvious that sustainable and economical cars are the future.
Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
The European automotive industry meanwhile is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2.
That is unfortunate for the environment but it is also unfortunate for employment in the European Union.
The CARS 21 High Level Group was a missed opportunity to put in place a vision of a sustainable automotive industry, a vision that provides an answer to the real challenges.
Innovation is the key word here.
In the United States a hydrogen highway is being laid and the market is being prepared for electric vehicles.
Where are the European initiatives?
Some car manufacturers have the prototypes ready, but there are still no hydrogen vehicles on the road.
It is time for governments and industry to unite and work together in order to make rapid progress.
Research alone is not enough.
The setting-up of high level groups is an excellent idea in theory, but unfortunately CARS 21 was dominated by a conservative branch of industry.
It is really important that the composition of high level groups does justice to the challenges we are facing.
Millions of new cars are going to come on to the market over the next few years and it would really help if they were clean and economical.
(DE) Mr President, car manufacturing is one of Europe's key industries.
It employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility.
It must therefore be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness.
At the same time, however, we need to remember that in today's global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions, and that, at the end of the day, we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations.
I essentially want to focus on the CO2 issue, which is without doubt one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing here.
Lifestyle criticism, which Mr Verheugen mentioned, has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate.
It is very 'in' to criticise individual lifestyles.
Claude Turmes has just done as much.
The thing is, if we were to withdraw all the two-tonne limousines from the market, as he would dearly like to do, the CO2 reductions would scarcely be measurable, but the damage to the national economy would be enormous.
Let me now comment on the proposed CO2 regulation that is currently on the table.
Mr Verheugen has said quite clearly in this respect that he has no wish to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism.
However, when I look at the penalty payments now being proposed for minimal deviations from the prescribed limits, I tend to be of the view that this is precisely what the Commission has done.
In actual fact, the regulation that we are discussing and approving here today is hostile to innovation, for the money that the car manufacturers will have to pay out is needed for innovation and research.
Mr President, the car of today is, in some ways, very much the same as that of 100 years ago but, at the same time, it is extremely different regarding security, efficiency and its effect on the environment.
This proves one thing: the strength of competition develops technology at a pace we cannot imagine.
It also underlines the need for Europe to have a competitive car industry if we are to contribute to the global agenda and to better standards for the environment in the global economy, because, if we do not, we will not be able to influence that development.
Those who call for a policy that would decrease the competitiveness of the European car industry do not contribute to a better environment - it is important to state that.
It is also important to state that the target of 125 g, as stated in the report, is acceptable and a step forward.
But the important thing is not to discuss emissions from individual cars - big or small - because we need big cars and we will need small cars: they play a different role in different parts of our Union, in our countries.
What we need is an overall development that decreases emissions in all sorts of cars.
Therefore, it is important to support new cars, because they are better, to support better road systems, better transport systems, better fuels and better engines.
That can only be done by a competitive European car industry and that can only be achieved if we have the right policies to balance the environment and competitiveness, and this report makes a good contribution towards that.
(RO) First of all, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Rapporteur for the work done on this report.
I consider this to be an extremely important debate.
The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledge-based economy only if it invests enough in research and especially if the results can be integrated into industrial production.
Climate change is one of the major challenges of the century.
In major urban areas, traffic and pollution constitute a problem for 66% of European citizens, and 70% of the citizens expect the Union to show active involvement in dealing with these problems.
The automotive industry should be capable of delivering less polluting products; however, the industry needs support in its research activities and it is especially important that any constraint should take into account the time required to develop new types of cars, from concept to design, manufacturing, testing and marketing.
We should also take into consideration market demand and in particular the citizens' buying power.
In this context, I believe that Member States should be encouraged to devise tax incentives for end-users, so as to encourage them to invest in greener cars.
Such a system was introduced in Romania as early as 2003, with very good results.
The development of the European automotive industry will lead to the preservation and creation of a significant number of jobs.
(SV) Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for a good piece of work on an important and sensitive matter.
We all know how important the car industry is in the EU.
Our car industry, not least in my home country, is a leading contender in the fields of development, research, performance, the environment and safety.
A successful car industry is important to the Union.
We are talking about jobs and growth, but also about responsibility for our environment, for the global climate.
The Commission proposes far-reaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhausts, improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels.
The rapporteur has misgivings about targets which are so difficult for industry to attain that they can jeopardise the competitiveness of companies, but we have heard that before in this debate.
I have also heard such arguments back home.
I can understand and share those misgivings, but I believe that it would be unfortunate in this situation if Parliament were to lower the level of ambition.
I am quite confident that the EU car industry can cope with targets set at high levels through research and development.
It has demonstrated its ability to do so in the past.
The people of our countries do not want to pay too much for their cars, but they also know that we must get to grips with climate change and that we need to act quickly.
- (DA) Mr President, I should like to join the many Members who have thanked the rapporteur for the excellent report we are discussing here.
It is clear that, given so many cars, the increasing mobility and an increasing desire to give even more people the opportunity to drive, the issue of emissions is a key problem that we shall have to address.
Carbon dioxide is not toxic to humans in itself, and a little more CO2 in the atmosphere would actually make plants grow slightly faster.
It is, however, ruinous to the climate, and so it is important that we do what we can to reduce CO2 emissions.
In my opinion, we must place greater reliance on research, to enable us to develop engines that run at a significantly higher temperature than is currently the case - possibly using ceramic or other materials, and especially by means of a much more widespread use of software for control purposes.
I believe that the objectives laid down will be easy to achieve.
There is no reason to believe that, given a concentrated, targeted effort and substantial research resources, Europe should not be able to achieve the objectives it has set itself, and make itself the leading industry within the automotive sector that it already is.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report as it urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets.
It also follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations, such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions, the need to ensure appropriate lead-times and the protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry.
I would like to highlight a number of issues.
The first of these is the fact that the road safety objectives are a key element and here, too, we need an integrated approach that incorporates vehicle technology improvements, infrastructure measures, and education and information.
As regards trade, and in particular the negotiations with Korea, it is important to ensure that Korea abolishes the existing non-tariff barriers and does not create new ones.
It is also essential to emphasis the crucial role played by the better regulation principles, i.e. proper impact assessments, the cost-effectiveness principle or appropriate lead-times, in creating a competitive regulatory framework for the automotive industry.
In this respect, the roadmap is an integral part of the final CARS 21 report and should be respected.
There are clearly some structural problems and, of course, it is necessary to establish general conditions to make the automotive industry in the EU sustainable.
The only way to do that is to enable our industry to remain in the forefront of technological, ecological and social innovation with the support of a highly skilled labour force.
Consequently, one very important aspect is the commitment to education and training for workers in the car industry.
Community environmental, road safety, and energy efficiency legislation requires proper training for workers to enable them to adapt more easily to changes, both of a technical nature and as regards regulation, and to enjoy the same or better job prospects.
In addition, in order to guarantee the future of the European automotive industry, it is crucial to strengthen in the Union the rights of workers and their trade unions to information and consultation.
One example that illustrates this is the recent agreement between Ford and the General Workers' Union in the Valencia factory, which will allow new investment for modernisation and for the production of new models.
Participation strengthens the sector, and in cases where restructuring is necessary can mitigate its negative effects.
As a result, it is essential to emphasise the need to reinforce, with the corresponding revision, the Directive on the European Works Council.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage.
It is clear that both the car manufacturers and consumers have finally been convinced of the urgent need for a change of course.
It is also clear that a change of course and change of mentality will only be possible, will only be achievable, through compulsory measures, and this will require measures in a number of different areas.
Anyone who is still thinking defensively is wrong, in my opinion.
A significant number of European and other medium-sized cars already meet the new standard of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
Even German cars, Mr Verheugen: the new Golf TDI 1900 is already on 115 grams per kilometre, so it really is possible in Germany too, and I think that we have to vigorously pursue that route further.
Environmentally-friendly technology: that is what it is about.
It is a sector that has huge potential for growth and offers huge opportunities.
It is good, therefore, that the Commission is forcing the issue.
We need to invest now, as you have already said, Commissioner, in order to lead the world in this field.
I have checked the figures: the Seventh Framework Programme contains over EUR 4 billion of loans for the transport sector.
That is a great deal of money but in the view of Parliament - it is in Mr Chatzimarkakis's report - not enough to fulfil our high ambitions.
That is why we are asking for more loans to be earmarked for research into new technologies at the budget review.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, it is also high time that the Council moved more swiftly, especially in the tax field.
There is a proposal before the Commission to couple vehicle tax to the emission of harmful substances.
What are the national governments waiting for?
They are not represented here, unfortunately, but I hope that the message will get through to them.
Why are the governments waiting to take action on this proposal?
It is the only way to really get the environmentally-friendly car adopted in the short term.
(PL) Mr President, we are all fully aware that the European Union's car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year.
Most importantly, it also accounts for 2.3 million jobs.
A further 10 million jobs in associated sectors are indirectly dependent on this industry.
It is worth noting that it is not only the quantity but probably essentially the quality of the jobs provided that accounts for the key role the car industry plays in the economic life of the European Union.
The best way of illustrating this success is by reference to the EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation.
Despite all this optimistic data, the European car industry is facing some very serious challenges.
I fully support the final report of the CARS 21 High Level Group and the European Commission's communication on the subject.
Nonetheless, I should like to call for further action aimed at creating a genuine single internal market in cars.
