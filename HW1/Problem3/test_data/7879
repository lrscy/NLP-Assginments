This is where the EUâs unique collection of instruments puts it at a comparative advantage, but, if we are to work efficiently, we need to deploy them all â civil, military and sectoral â in a coherent way.
We have to make long-term plans for crisis regions, targeting and deploying as an integral whole our Community instruments â not only overseas aid, but also the prospect of closer relations with the EU.
In addition to that, there is the help we give with nuclear non-proliferation, in the shape, for example, of the enormous amount of aid the EU has given for nuclear safety and non-proliferation since the beginning of the 1990s, not to mention our commitment to fighting terrorism, the spread of small arms and landmines, and drugs.
I mentioned earlier another key instrument for implementing the European Security Strategy, by which I mean, of course, our development policy.
Here we are again trying to move forward, not least with the UNâs Millennium Goals in mind, for it is here too â as I said earlier â that we Europeans must set the pace.
Let me now also draw your attention to the Commissionâs forthcoming proposals for reform of European crisis management and civilian protection, which we will be presenting next week in a communication to the Council and to your House, the details of which you will of course have an opportunity to debate.
I will also take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its support for the European Security Research Programme, on which the Commission is working very closely with the European Defence Agency.
I also want to stress that I attach importance to Parliamentâs proposal for a regular debate on the Security Strategy, which would also involve the parliaments of the Member States.
We are right to cite democracy and the rule of law as essential values underpinning Europe, and hence also as integral parts of our foreign policy.
The European Union can, however, be strong on the international stage only if its actions really are coherent, and so, if it is to face up to the new challenges, it needs more than just the common foreign and security policy in the strict sense of the term.
The common foreign and security policy is one among several instruments that the EU possesses in the foreign policy sphere and complements our other policies.
The success of this broad-based approach is, I believe, demonstrated by the concept of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which illustrates one of my own particular priorities; the export of security, stability and prosperity to our neighbours and facilitation of structural reforms, all of which clearly has a security policy dimension to it.
The European Neighbourhood Policy parallels exactly our European development policy in being a long-term and intelligent security policy in the regional context.
We have already made a start on implementing this.
It is being used to gradually deepen our relationships with our partner states, above all through the detailed joint action plans, which give them clear prospects for drawing closer to Europe.
Parliamentâs forthright support for the neighbourhood policy was very important to me, and it still is.
I therefore look forward with interest to Mr Laschetâs report.
One can â and I will â describe the European Neighbourhood Policy as our security policy on a regional scale.
It helps to promote stability and reform in regions with a crucial geopolitical impact through their long-term association with Europe and through specific joint activities, such as anti-terrorist cooperation.
This makes it an essential instrument in implementing the European Security Strategy.
We have already concluded detailed and ambitious plans of action with seven partner countries, of which Ukraine is one, and five more are in the pipeline.
One of the last things I would like to say is that the reports also put a great deal of emphasis on the need for institutional reforms.
This is something that our new Constitutional Treaty will renew in fundamental and positive ways, and these the Commission very much endorses.
I am therefore very interested in your detailed proposals and will take note of them.
We have for some time been making preparations for the Treatyâs implementation, in order that it may become operational at once following what we hope will be its successful ratification.
This will be accomplished not least through the establishment of a Joint Foreign Service, concerning which very profound discussions are going on between the Council and the Commission.
These reforms really are important.
Even more effective collaboration between the EU institutions is indispensable.
Mr Kuhneâs report rightly highlights the obvious need for the EU, as an actor on the global stage, to be endowed with the financial resources it needs.
For that reason, I, too, am confident that we will soon be able to come to an agreement on the reform of our foreign aid instruments that the Commission has proposed.
At the same time, though, it is also clear that institutional reform and improved finances can be no substitute for the political will that we need.
It follows that Europe needs even more to think of itself as a global player.
As the forum for a broad, transparent and democratic debate, your House plays a crucial role in articulating that political will.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Kuhne report, I should like to take this opportunity to offer Mr Kuhne my warmest congratulations on the exceptionally difficult process which he has been through in order to be able to find a compromise between so many opinions in such a strong and excellent report.
I wish to touch on four points: security policy, in its present form, quite rightly focuses not on military means, but on all the other means which the European Union can use in order to promote the fight against all the causes of insecurity in Europe.
One of these is terrorism, but it is not the only one.
We have to be very careful, when preparing such a strategy, not to get carried away with the danger of the day and ignore so many others.
Within this framework, it is very important, when we act abroad, that we act with respect for human rights.
Guantanamo-type phenomena cannot be tolerated by the European Union.
I emphasise this, because even the United States did not imagine a few years ago that it would be able to tolerate them, but we can see what is happening.
I would prefer that we start applying the brakes now, rather than deal with this later, when we are not ready.
My second point is that, as Europeans, we need to promote democracy.
Both the rapporteurs and the Commission quite rightly emphasised that the way in which democracy is promoted in Europe is very different from the way in which it is promoted by other major powers on Earth.
Let us keep it that way, with the UN always with us.
We cannot act outside its framework.
My third point is that Parliament must be kept informed of and must debate questions of foreign policy.
It cannot keep being ignored in procedures which touch on fundamental rights, such as, for example, the famous PNR, the information given to the United States allegedly in order to fight terrorism.
Parliament has instituted proceedings against the Commission on this and will, I hope, win its case.
My fourth and final point concerns the famous SITCEN, which is an important service.
My committee does not know exactly how it acts, what the boundaries on its action are or how it collects information, but information and the collection of information and personal data are equally sensitive as far as this Parliament is concerned, irrespective of whether they are collected by SITCEN or by anyone else.
The question of the principle of availability of information and its exchange are being discussed in my committee at this very moment.
It has not reached a decision and I thank and congratulate MrÂ Kuhne for the importance which he attaches in his report to cooperation between our committees.
The need to combat terrorism does not sanctify any means.
We need to take serious account of this in this Chamber and in this Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Kuhne most warmly for his wide-ranging report.
I believe it to be of the utmost importance that Parliamentâs line on this Security Strategy is supported by four major political families in this House â the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Liberals and the group to which I belong, thereby putting us on a footing unheard of 10 years ago.
The report discusses the Security Strategy devised by Javier Solana, and this House shares his view of the threats.
The three major ones are, without a doubt, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and conflicts among our neighbours with direct effects on the European Union as a result of floods of refugees having a direct impact on the public in it.
What is absent from his analysis, in my view and that of many others, is homeland security, which is normally at the heart of all defence policy.
If we consider the attention given to homeland security in the United States in comparison to how little we hear about it here in the European Union, then I think there is a deficit here that must be made good.
There is also, I believe, a need to add to the conclusions drawn as to what must be done.
As the conclusion put forward in this report cannot be turned into practical actions, I believe it important that the next thing we need is a White Paper on European security and defence policy containing perfectly clear specifications of substance and timescale â rather clearer than what we have been given to date.
It is important that the crisis intervention force, which was very much virtual in nature when it was decided on in 1999, has today become active in reality: in Macedonia, in the Congo and now in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I was there on a visit with the defence sub-committee when, for the first time, a British general, bearing on his sleeve the European emblem with its stars, introduced himself to me as a European soldier, I realised that something had happened here that would reverberate throughout history; you, Mr Schmit, may mention âEuropean troopsâ or the âforces of the European Unionâ, only in passing, but there is no doubt that this is a development with historic significance.
It is in Macedonia that the general approach of relying on more than merely military action to deal with a crisis is proving itself; the European Unionâs strength lies in the civilian aspect of peacekeeping, where we are doing more than the United States.
It is a good concept.
On the other hand â as we have seen in the sudden emergence of unrest in Kosovo â it is vitally important that we should not lose sight of the fact that our troops must remain capable of intervening and also of taking robust action if it is necessary to protect minorities.
These are two of the tasks that our troops have to cope with there, and they are equally important and difficult.
Among the things we learned from our visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina was that the combat troops that are currently being mustered, some of whom â we hope â will be capable, as soon as possible, of short-term intervention and deployment, need the best equipment.
What they are being called upon to undertake there are peacekeeping missions, but, should they need to carry out peacemaking missions or combat operations, the very diverse equipment that our troops there have will prove very much a disadvantage.
We demand that what are being termed the European battle groups, which are currently being assembled, should be equipped as uniformly as possible, that they should be the first to get the latest equipment and should get it without delay, and that this be made a matter of priority.
As we were also told when we were there, there is also a need for helicopters if large areas are to be secured, and also for additional mine-proof vehicles.
We were told that it would take until 2010 for Bosnia-Herzegovina to become free of mines, so mine clearance is proceeding too slowly, and this needs to be made an additional financial priority for our work.
Â Â  .
We are today discussing the report on the external performance of the European Union in 2003.
I am especially pleased that the rapporteur, Mr Brok, has stressed that the involvement of the European Parliament should not be limited to a discussion after the event.
I am therefore taking the liberty of considering in particular some matters that have been on the agenda in the past year and of taking a look at the future.
The development of the European security strategy, which is also up for discussion here, will have an important part to play in this.
The Kuhne report â and I commend the rapporteur â gives an excellent evaluation of the concrete impact of this security strategy to date.
I would like to ask the Commission but also the Council and of course the High Representative to take these recommendations very seriously.
There are two points I would like to highlight.
Firstly, there is the military dimension.
Europe can only play a central role if we are also willing and able, if necessary, to take military action.
The prevention of conflict escalation to the point where military intervention is necessary is and remains the prime concern, while when it comes to the actual use of military means the emphasis must continue to be placed on interaction with other tools: humanitarian intervention, the guaranteeing of legal order, the institutional structure, democratisation and economic development.
In the first major European military mission, the Althea mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, an abundance of experience is currently being acquired with such a combination of civil and military capacity.
Apart from a material side, the development of the European defence arm also and in particular has a political side.
The European Union must develop a political framework that allows us to use military means where this is considered necessary.
My second point is about the interfaces between internal and external security, which come very much to the fore in the struggle against terrorism in particular.
The connection between them is insufficiently developed in European policy at the moment.
The Council has rightly asked the High Representative to bring forward proposals in this area and I urge him to involve Parliament in this.
Attention to this is sought in the Brok report but also in the Kuhne report.
The implementation of the common foreign and security policy is not unfortunately always as common as I would like.
Nevertheless, my evaluation of the past few years is not all that negative.
The European Union has played an important part in the revolution in Ukraine.
The prompt reaction of the Presidency and the good coordination between Parliament and Council, and the action of the High Representative and the Heads of State of Poland and Lithuania made a significant contribution to the positive outcome of that political crisis.
The efforts of France, Germany and the United Kingdom within the EU in the conflict involving the Iranian nuclear programme has in my view so far been a good example of how things can be tackled in a European way.
The outcome is uncertain but the diplomatic approach, the model that is being used in this process, is very important in our view.
The basic principles of European common foreign and security policy, multilateralism, preventive involvement, a broad approach in which democracy and social and economic development take centre stage, conflict resolution and a halt to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have our full support in the rank and file.
We cannot emphasise enough, though, that collectiveness is a condition, because only by acting collectively can Europe bring its political weight to bear.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Kuhne on his report, which has turned out to be really outstanding.
I also want to say how very grateful I am to him for his constant and frank cooperation, the result of which has been broad support from the relevant groups in this House.
The European Security Strategy is the timetable for European foreign policy for the coming years and decades, albeit one containing very many questions as well as good answers.
A common foreign and security policy worthy of the name may well be a European goal, but it is not yet a European reality.
What this report spells out is that Parliament supports the Council and the Commission in their efforts to overcome the self-seeking attitudes that the nation states still have in this area.
At the heart of the report is the statement that the traditional concepts of security no longer hold water.
What do we mean by internal or external security?
Which crises can we effectively prevent by civil means?
At what stage in a conflict we have been unable to prevent are we obliged to deal with it by military means, as opposed to the civil means we had used previously?
When, following the end of a conflict, can we again consider going back whence we came without jeopardising peopleâs safety, and what instruments do we need to that end?
Such are the questions that we Europeans must answer; this report does so, whenever it is able to, by reference to the great significance of civil and military cooperation.
That is why we endorse this report and will be voting in favour of it.
In deliberating all these questions, it is clear to us in the Liberal Group that the principles of the UN Charter remain the central benchmark.
That is why it is so absurd for the Communists to make assertions about the alleged militarisation of the EU.
Having had so much experience of military build-up, though, they surely ought to know what they are talking about.
This report is an intermediate step; it spells out the fact that, at the beginning of the third millennium, we have to develop not only the instruments of our foreign policy, but also the thinking underlying it.
It is precisely for that reason that I am glad that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have been mandated to join together in thinking about how, at a time when terrorism is being fought, the protection of citizensâ rights can be ensured and, where necessary, improved.
If we are to defend our values, we must also treat them with respect.
I might add that I believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which I belong, I would like to give a warm welcome to both these reports and, above all, to express my gratitude for the constructive cooperation.
There is one item in the Councilâs Common Position that I would like to highlight.
Mr Brokâs report is most emphatic in demanding active cooperation with Parliament.
It will not be enough for us to be merely informed, and that after the event.
I say that in advance of the debate on the Constitution.
The European Security Strategy is not a matter of statistics.
As threats change, we will be required, again and again, to ascertain where there are deficits â as there are today in the civil sector â or where we need to change direction, but we will be able to get it across to people that European security policy is credible, and communicate to them the positive aspects of it that the Constitution will strengthen, only if you work together with Parliament.
If Parliament opposes you, you will not manage it.
I can tell you that there are substantial indications that we are on the right road, such as the attempt by three European states to join with Iran in finding a peaceful solution to the proliferation issue, and the endeavour to reinforce the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, for it is on these things that our multilateral policy depends.
The second of these indications â and one to which reference has already been made â is that international law is being applied.
Those in this House who oppose the Constitution on the grounds of alleged militarisation are thereby ignoring the fact that it incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will therefore form part of Europeâs foreign and security policy; they are also negating all the progress we have made, throwing us back to Nice, throwing us back to the sort of renationalisation that we are currently seeing in Germany, which believes it will be given its own seat on the UN Security Council, or that it will, on its own, be able to get the China embargo lifted.
That is not a common European security policy; it is a reversion to a policy that we, in our motions for resolution, criticise rather than endorse.
We Europeans are stepping out in new directions by taking on civil and military responsibilities.
The decisive moment will come, in the foreseeable future, in Kosovo.
We will be able to make use of these instruments, which will ultimately help to reconcile societies to some degree and to stabilise Europe, only if we, along with our societies and the European public, carry on in the same direction towards the one peaceful and multilateral objective with the help of transatlantic cooperation, an objective that our people expect of us.
You, who represent the Council, will have to pay attention to what this House says; without its support, the peoples of Europe will not be behind you either.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I find the Kuhne report extremely worrying and dangerous, because it does not recognise the primacy of the United Nations and international law in European security and defence policy.
The report places the UN on the same level as NATO and other organisations and institutions, clears the way for approval of the theory of preventive military intervention, which violates international law, and lumps military intervention together with humanitarian action, implicitly relegating humanitarian development aid to a functional role subordinated to military and security policies.
It also claims that NATO and the European Union are complementary, ignoring the subordinate role of the European Union within NATO and the need to promote an independent and non-aggressive European foreign policy.
Lastly, it fails to say that the application of international law and UN resolutions and the end of military occupations are the only conditions for a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.
EU support for non-proliferation should also include calling on Israel to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report clearly shows where the European Union is heading.
It calls for the common foreign security and defence policies contained in the European Constitution to be initiated without waiting for the inconvenient and unpredictable matter of its ratification by the Member States.
The report contains the telling line that the fight against terrorism blurs the traditional distinction between foreign and domestic policy.
This is another example of how any argument will be used in order to promote European integration in any and all spheres of policy.
The threat from terrorism makes national borders and national interests all the more vital, not less so.
This report is another step in the process of the European Union attempting to further its foreign policy and military ambitions in order eventually to rival the United States of America on the world stage.
Meanwhile, all talk of an ethical foreign policy is put into perspective by the European Councilâs intention to lift the embargo on arms sales to China, which Mr Brok rightly criticises and which is driven by the requirements of the French arms industry.
Parliamentâs opposition to the lifting of the arms embargo on China will, of course, be ignored by the Council, demonstrating once again the irrelevance of this Parliament.
Britain should regain control of its own foreign, security and defence policies.
The only way to do that is through the UK Independence Partyâs policy of unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of myself and the Europe of the Nations Group I would like to express our recognition to the honourable Member Mr Kuhne for his well-executed report on the European Security Strategy.
This includes the extension of the concept of security in line with the current situation, offers a reasonable opinion concerning current events in the field of European security, and points out deficiencies.
I will deal with just one aspect.
I think that in his report Mr Kuhne has demonstrated in a wholly justified fashion to the European Parliament the need to promote participation in implementing the European Security Strategy.
Fulfilling this objective is a comparatively complex task for European Members of Parliament, and, of course, also for the European institutions.
We must, however, admit that we do not have the requisite security of information and specialist back-up within the European Parliament to be able to discuss thoroughly and with a solid grounding the activities of the relevant Directorate-General within the Commission and of the Council in implementing the European Security Strategy, not to mention the possibility of more or less understanding measures taken by national governments, with their mutually reciprocal actions, in implementing security and defence measures.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that that is a serious problem.
In fact, there are various problems relating to aspects of joint security in the European Union.
At the basis of them are shortages of a financial nature, as well as of the development of military capabilities, a lack of security of information and deficiencies of other kinds.
During the past months, during which I have been a European Member of Parliament for the first time, I have had the opportunity to gradually understand how security policy in Europe is formed, and who the most important players are.
Therefore it seems to me that I am fully justified in saying that the report is of a sufficiently high quality.
Since 70% of European Union citizens support the need for a single European defence policy, we should agree that monitoring the implementation of the European Security Strategy ought to be one of the priorities for the widening of the scope of the European Parliamentâs activities.
The threats of the 21st century â trans-national terrorism, the unlawful proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts and Islamic fundamentalism â impose a duty on everyone to understand our global challenges, and the European Parliament must play an active part in preventing them.
Â Â  Mr President, the common foreign and security policy covers a great many primary and secondary aspects and it is of course impossible to be exhaustive in this short space of time.
Two points nonetheless.
First and foremost I would like to point to a gap in the list of priorities and that is the support for Europeans or people of European origin in other parts of the world.
Above all I am talking about southern Africa, not just South Africa itself but also Zimbabwe.
It is high time that the European Union started to take strong measures to bring an end to the attacks on farms and the systematic expropriations of farms run by Europeans.
Such action would for that matter be in the interest of the whole population there.
I refer for example to Zimbabwe, the country that used to be known as the granary of Africa and that is now ravaged by starvation, in part and in the main because of the mismanagement of dictator Mugabe.
Another problem that deserves more attention is nuclear disarmament.
The report places the emphasis on compliance with the non-proliferation treaty, but overlooks the colossal security risk posed by poorly guarded or semi-abandoned nuclear facilities in former Soviet states and a number of other countries, and the misuse that can be made of them by terror organisations such as Al-Qaida.
We must as the European Union sit down urgently with the countries and international organisations concerned and ensure that the necessary resources are released to defuse this ticking time bomb.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this House feels very strongly that significant progress was made last year regarding the European Security and Defence Policy, and that it was therefore possible to break the impasse following the Iraq conflict.
We welcome the establishment of the European Defence Agency and believe it will play an important role with regard to the supply of new equipment.
We also welcome the inclusion in the Constitutional Treaty of provisions creating a future for the ESDP, in particular on the subject of structural cooperation, that is, the solidarity clause.
Another very significant development was the Commissionâs announcement of the European Programme for Security Research that will be operating with a budget of at least EURÂ 1Â billion as of 2007.
Finally, probably the most important event of last year was taking the stabilisation mission in Bosnia over from NATO.
This is actually the European Unionâs first major military operation.
In this context, we also feel very strongly that the four questions raised over six years ago, when the notion of a European Security and Defence Policy was first floated in Cologne, remain relevant.
Firstly, what action is required to ensure that our defence capabilities are in line with our aspirations and challenges, the challenges that have now been enshrined in the European Security Policy?
Secondly, how can the cohesion of the European Security and Defence Policy be assured?
Thirdly, how can the ESDP be developed without detriment to the defence commitments of the majority of Member States that are also members of NATO?
Fourthly, how can financial resources be managed wisely at both national and Community level?
These questions are addressed primarily to the Commission and the Council, because Parliament, the Commission and the Council will have to work together to come up with the answers.
If we fail to do so, the ESDP will be simply a paper policy, and we shall be powerless.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join many of my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteurs for two important reports that present a thorough overview of Europeâs foreign, security and defence policy and the progress made, and propose highly convincing guidelines for Europe to have an effective presence as a global actor on the world stage.
The Constitutional Treaty may strengthen Europeâs role with innovations that will ensure closer integration and cooperation, and right now I believe it is fair to bring forward â as they say â a collaboration between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Europeâs central objective is to promote effective multilateralism, which means ensuring security and also the expansion of democracy, human rights and opportunities for development and growth.
In short, it means controlling globalisation by prioritising political, civil and economic methods but not ruling out military methods as a last resort, and consequently keeping open the option to use force in legitimate circumstances.
In order to have legitimacy, however, the authority of the United Nations system needs to be restored, as the Brok report quite rightly points out.
That authority has been shaken and weakened partly by the theory and practice of preventive and unilateral war.
Europe has no choice but to condemn that theory and practice, and I believe the resumption of cooperation between Europe and the United States has to take this matter of principle into account.
In this context, I believe there is great value in the demand made by many Members â and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner as well â that Europe should have a seat at the United Nations, as it would represent a quality leap in the relationship between the European Union and the United Nations.
I should like to underline one priority in this picture, which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis in the Middle East.
We have quite rightly pointed out the new opportunities and hopes.
I should like to add a word of concern, however: the meeting between George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon itself revealed a fairly sharp disagreement over the Israeli policy of expanding the settlements, which in practice means the annexation of East Jerusalem and part of the West Bank.
If this policy were to go ahead, any hopes for peace would soon be cast aside.
If even the US Administration is now voicing its criticism, Europe needs to do so too, strongly and clearly, in order to prevent decisions that might jeopardise any hope of peace and .
Â Â  First and most of all I would like to congratulate Mr Elmar Brok on his excellent report that provides a coherent, forward-looking and realistic view of common foreign and security policy.
All too often we forget how young this policy actually still is.
I can remember quite vividly that 20 years ago the words security, foreign policy and least of all defence policy were not even allowed to appear in European texts or in programmes of European political parties.
Ten years ago there was an embryonic common foreign and security policy, but it was carefully wrapped up in a separate, almost exclusively intergovernmental pillar.
Today we have our own separate vision and strategy â still in the making it is true â but whose originality cannot be denied.
This originality is above all that we want to take responsibility for both the civil and the diplomatic and military aspects of such a policy.
I would like to underline that the constitutional treaty contains a number of especially important demands in this area, which for that matter is also one of the main reasons why this constitutional treaty deserves to be ratified.
In this annual report there are calls to involve the European Parliament and the national parliaments more closely in the preparation and implementation of common foreign and security policy and not to limit this involvement to discussions.
The three-monthly exchange of views with the High Representative and with the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy in which representatives of the national parliaments will be able to take part offers an excellent opportunity for this.
That is one aspect of the proposals that we are glad to support.
Â Â  Mr President, for the sake of avoiding excessive sameness, here comes a different position.
The European Security Strategy states that âthe first line of defence against new threats will often be abroadâ.
In no way does the Kuhne report dissent from this.
The European Security Strategy is meant to be binding on all EU Member States.
It is meant to commit EU military policy more and more to planning for pre-emptive warfare.
The Kuhne report calls for even more rearmament in order to ensure that the EU, relying on NATO capacities, can intervene militarily across the globe.
According to what we have heard, the EU is meant to become a global player, and primarily in military terms.
It is for precisely this reason that my group has produced a minority opinion.
On the one hand, it is asserted that there is no military build-up in the European Union; on the other, as we have heard, everything is being done to rearm, including drawing up plans for the EU to wage âregional wars to secure raw materialsâ.
The EUâs Constitutional Treaty, which I hope the French will scupper, its Security Strategy and the âEuropean Defence Paperâ stand for a Europe characterised by rearmament and the prospect of future wars.
Take a serious look at these criticisms.
Polemics have had their day.
As you will see in France, they only trip you up.
Â Â  Mr President, one minute and thirty seconds is much more than I need, given that the vast subjects dealt with in this portmanteau report presuppose the existence of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a diplomatic service and a common foreign policy.
Yet as far as the common foreign policy is concerned, we have only the vaguest of vague outlines, given that it was decreed in 1992 by Title Five of the Treaty of Maastricht.
Moreover, there is no common policy and there cannot be a common policy, for the very good reason that there is no agreement between the principles, the traditions, and interests and, therefore, the policies of our different nations, starting, moreover, with the vital issue of our relations with the United States of America.
As for this minimum condition, the creation of a common diplomatic instrument, it presupposes the adoption of the European Constitution.
Well I am very sorry to have to tell you â though to most people it is no secret â that it is highly likely that this project will never see the light of day and that all your scaffolding, constructed as it is on the complete absence of popular legitimacy, will collapse of its own accord.
I could, therefore, stop there and not exhaust my speaking time and your nerves, but I should not like to prevent you from dreaming, because your dreams are of great interest to the advocates of sovereignty who are currently campaigning in France and elsewhere.
When, at our meeting, we tell French people that in Washington there is a person who is known by the pompous title of Ambassador of the European Union to the United States, they are highly amused.
When we tell French people that the said Constitution will bring with it a so-called Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that the holder of that office will be, as if by chance, a former Secretary-General of NATO, then the French people are even more amused, or intrigued, or scandalised.
By all means then, ladies and gentlemen, you Europhiles and Euromaniacs of all kinds, please carry on supplying us with such amusing arguments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Unionâs common foreign and security policy may not be a virtual policy, as sceptics maintain, but it certainly looks far better on paper than it does in practice.
If, like the authors of the draft resolution, we look to public opinion surveys for the will to implement this policy, its future seems distinctly uncertain.
If the 60% of Union citizens that support the common foreign policy is in future reduced to 45%, and the 70% support for the common defence policy is reduced to say 47%, should we suddenly abandon this notion?
We should guard against relying on public opinion surveys.
The House is divided on the issue of the degree of support for the idea of a common security policy and a common foreign policy.
We need to face up to that fact.
Nonetheless, we are all of one mind on a number of issues.
The first is that Islamic terrorism is a real threat.
The second is that military action cannot be the first course of action when it comes to dealing with certain problems.
The third is that we must follow the joint EUFOR activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina carefully.
True, the Union did previously undertake the Concordia mission in Macedonia, but that was relatively minor, as were the police activities we were involved in, for example in Bosnia-Herzegovina or, more recently, in Africa
Finally, we can speak with one voice when it comes to insisting that the Council complies with ArticleÂ 21 of the Treaty on European Union concerning consultation on the main foreign policy actions for the coming year.
It is not a question of the Council deigning to provide the information. It is actually bound to do so.
Â Â  As a major international player, the European Union bears a global responsibility.
In view of this fact, I should like to emphasise that the success of EU foreign policy depends upon our partnership with the United States.
In spite of the differences that exist between us, the United States, of all the global players, is the closest to Europe, and it is not only common values that unite us.
The partnership is a natural result of our common interest in achieving stability throughout the world, in strengthening the rule of law and democracy and in ensuring that global markets operate properly and that raw material resources throughout the world remain available.
The North Atlantic Alliance continues to act as a fundamental guarantee of European and US security, yet the challenges we are currently facing are by no means only security-related.
I would therefore like to call on the Commission and the Council at this point to present an action plan for a strategic partnership between the European Union and the United States, which would put our dialogue on a broad range of global issues on an institutional footing.
The partnership would tackle matters ranging from the functioning of financial services to the stabilising of international order, as well as global agriculture, the fight against Aids, water availability, global climate change and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
One of its aims should be the establishment of an EU-US free trade area, which could potentially act as a driving force for the global economy.
We learnt from President Bushâs visit in February that the Americans are aware of the need for a strong partner on the other side of the Atlantic.
It is therefore my belief that the European Union should seize this opportunity to strengthen a partnership that could act as a key to world order and stability.
Â Â  â The European security strategy challenges us to consider the Unionâs role in world governance, and the reports by Mr Kuhne and Mr Brok make excellent contributions towards addressing this challenge.
If they are to be effective and coherent, Europeâs foreign security and defence policies must place the accent firmly on the citizens, promoting human rights, international and humanitarian law and multilateralism in international relations.
In other words, they must be rooted in the concept of human security, as emphasised in the Kuhne report, in line with the Barcelona report on the Human Security Doctrine.
The importance of this area is all the greater given that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism must continue to be at the forefront of Europeâs priorities in terms of security.
We must incorporate these concerns into every aspect of external relations, in particular the new neighbourhood policy, and in this context the Union must have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as has previously been said.
The EU must also strive to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament treaties and to tighten controls on exports of nuclear material and arms in general.
The Union must also ensure that its action plan to combat terrorism works closely in tandem with its foreign and security and defence policies, as part of the integrated global strategy for fighting terrorism recently announced by Kofi Annan.
The development commitments made by the European governments in the Millennium Declaration must also be honoured.
Poverty and injustice are fertile breeding grounds for terrorism.
If we are to achieve a security and defence policy resulting in greater strategic independence for Europe, greater capacity and greater integration of defence resources, and a genuine internal market, the European Defence Agency must provide us, for our debates, with information on policies relating to the procurement, development and research of equipment.
It is now up to the Member State governments to lay the groundwork for this new agency to work.
The next financial perspectives must demonstrate that our governments are committed to the success of European security, which largely depends on the resources at its disposal in the Union.
I shall conclude by relating that last week in Sarajevo, along with Mr Von Wogau and other Members of this House, I witnessed the proud British General in charge of EUFOR actually handing out national honours.
I could not help thinking that, had there been a foreign policy and a European security and defence policy in place 15 years ago, Europe might have prevented the war in the former Yugoslavia or might have stopped it at an earlier stage.
The important work of the Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina is proof that, with the appropriate resources, Europe can and must take on more responsibilities in European and worldwide security.
Â Â  â Mr President, both the reports being debated today clearly present the identity and the aggressive imperialist character of the European Union.
They confirm the joint strategy of the European Union with the United States of America against peoples and countries which, apart from anything else, will be founded on the ferocious doctrine of preventive war, which is mentioned in the reports and clearly referred to in the Constitutional Treaty.
They set as an immediate priority better preparation of the European Union for new strategic interventions, jointly with ÎÎÎ€Î and the United States of America or independently.
In the name of the security of the European Union, countries and areas for new interventions are being photographed, starting with the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East and extending over almost the entire planet, on the pretext of strengthening the international order.
The philosophy behind the common foreign policy and defence policy and the European security strategy is the European version of the imperialist doctrine of the United States of America on protecting US interests, in the name of which hundreds of interventions have taken place and have spread death and destruction to all the corners of the planet.
We believe that the peoples are waking up.
They will resist and they will not allow the implementation of this policy.
We ultimately ask the following question: who is threatening whom?
The European Union has forces in a great many countries in the world.
It participates in an endless network of bases, has participated in three wars and, moreover ...
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, critical though I may be of individual aspects of Europeâs Constitutional Treaty, it does strike me as important that the common foreign and security policy be strengthened.
If Europe is to assert itself as a power for global peace, it will need to speak to the outside world with a single voice, as well as possessing the capacity to get its way in matters of military and security policy.
Although I believe that every tendency leading towards the development of a centralised European state must be energetically repudiated, I do think it is right that there should be a single EU foreign minister with extensive powers and responsibilities and a strong position within the EU.
This leads me to welcome the development of a European Foreign Service.
It is unacceptable, though, that such a foreign service for the European Union should be dominated and sustained only by the larger Member States of the EU.
Smaller Member States, Austria among them, must be involved in the shaping of European foreign policy, just as the European Parliament must have equal rights with the Council in deciding what that policy should be.
If the smaller Member States are to contribute in the same way as the larger ones to the common European defence policy and to the operation of the single European rapid reaction force, they must also be guaranteed the same right to be consulted.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there are two of Parliamentâs statements in this report that I would like to revisit, and they have to do with the foreign and security policy situation in the Far East.
It is my belief that the Peopleâs Republic of China, by passing its Anti-Secession Law, has put the region in a much more precarious position.
The Anti-Secession Law is something that we should firmly repudiate; by enacting it, the Peopleâs Republic of China is attempting, without any justification, to legitimise its military threats against Taiwan and to acquire the right to attack it.
This is in breach of international law, and completely unacceptable.
Taiwanâs 23 million citizens have the inalienable right to take their own democratic decisions on their future: on whether they want to be reunited with the mainland or to continue as an independent and sovereign state.
We should all be calling on the Peopleâs Republic of China to stop making threatening gestures and instead begin direct dialogue with Taiwan on the basis of mutual recognition in order to bring about between the two countries and secure peace in the Far East.
I am addressing the representatives of the Council when I say that, if this is to happen, the arms embargo on China must not be lifted.
The European Council was right to impose it in 1989, and we can see that the position as regards human rights and the rights of minorities has indeed improved, although these are as yet far from adequate.
This House has observed on many occasions that the situation in China as regards fundamental civil, cultural, religious and political rights does not even meet the international standards that China itself recognises.
I hope that the President-in-Office will take some note of that.
Particularly at the present time, and in view of Chinaâs ongoing infringements of human rights, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message and would also appear to be a reward for the Anti-Secession Law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have received a document describing European policy in the area of security, which is the most difficult policy for any country or international organisation to tackle.
This document will constitute a basis or a point of reference when it comes to establishing how best to consolidate the policies of Member States, and to ensure that foreign policy is more effective.
We would do well to remember that the costliest way of conducting foreign policy is not to have one.
The Union is failing to take advantage of the opportunities open to it in many areas, precisely because it lacks policies.
Allow me to mention another plain truism, and now I am addressing in particular those who have been pontificating on militarisation in the House for some time.
Defence capacity is a of an effective policy.
Military capacity is essential.
We would also do well to remember that the principles drafted concerning the safeguarding of our security in the broadest sense can constitute an excellent starting point for dialogue with our American partner, and a basis for the creation of a new kind of transatlantic relationship.
On the one side there would be the United States, uncertain as to the difference between leadership and hegemony, and on the other the European Union which is just starting to develop its role in this particular area.
We shall need to bring patience and creativity to this process, but expertise will also be required.
In this connection, I believe that MrÂ Kuhneâs report represents a good commitment for all the European institutions, helping them to consider European security.
In addition, it is significant that MrÂ Kuhneâs report is being debated at the same time as the annual report on the European Unionâs foreign policy.
This represents good input and a fine contribution by Parliament, helping to ensure that we can at long last speak of a real European policy rather than a virtual one.
Â Â  Mr President, if you take the view that the European Union should evolve into some sort of integrated European State, then it is both logical and necessary that it should have its own currency, its own police and judicial system, its own diplomatic representation, its own army and defence budget and all the rest of the panoply of statehood brought together under the legal framework of a constitution.
The two reports before us today derive their inspiration precisely from this impulse.
I have to say that British Conservatives take a rather different view.
We are fundamentally opposed to further European political integration.
In fact, we would seek to unwind and repatriate many of the excessive powers that Brussels has accrued.
Not surprisingly, therefore, we oppose the very idea of a European constitution as well as its detailed ingredients.
The reports focus particularly on security and defence policy.
They seek to enhance the EUâs military credentials by distorting the nature and role of NATO and then sidelining that organisation while wastefully duplicating its structures, seeking to displace the nations as actors in the transatlantic security relationship while claiming ownership of their capabilities, and subscribing to misplaced ideas of socially engineering our armed forces.
I do not believe that the European nations have strategic security interests that should be separated from those of its transatlantic and other allies.
There may be times when Europeans should bear primary responsibility for provision of military forces in their own region.
That is precisely what has happened in the past ten years or more in the former Yugoslavia, where it is mere sleight of hand to imply that the EUFOR military operation in Bosnia is fundamentally different to that which was there before.
Of the 7Â 000 troops in NATOâs SFOR, over 6Â 000 were European.
It is dishonest, therefore, to pretend that the EU is contributing to any enhancement of security when most of its Member States are reducing rather than increasing their defence expenditure and the EU itself is merely replicating the planning, decision-making and command and control systems of the highly successful organisation that is NATO.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, new security threats have emerged since the end of the Cold War.
These include international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime and a whole range of regional conflicts.
It is becoming apparent that no country, no matter how large, is in a position to deal with these security threats on its own, and it is for this reason that the EUâs common foreign, security and defence policy should be extended and strengthened.
This is a belief held not only by theÂ majority of Members of this House, and not only by Council or Commission representatives, but also, and above all, by the European public.
This is a point that has already been made in this House.
Something else that is becoming apparent is that we cannot overcome any of these threats by military means alone; instead, we need to make use of a combination of both military and civilian means.
Both the reports tabled today and both the rapporteurs provide clear and detailed answers to the question of how this could be achieved.
The success and future development of the common foreign, security and defence policy depend on two conditions being met; the European Constitution must be ratified, and appropriate funding must be set aside.
You cannot have more European security for less money.
Â Â  Mr President, I will focus on two key issues.
I wish to begin by saying a few words about the European External Action Service.
It is of the utmost importance that the service be situated in the Commission.
We must avoid all attempts to water down the new service by placing it primarily in the Council.
Under no circumstances should the service be allowed to develop into an uncontrollable intergovernmental agency which starts to live a life of its own.
Only with maximum parliamentary accountability can we be assured that Europeâs noble goals for the rest of the world are achieved.
Fighting poverty, defending democracy and advocating human rights are all issues in which we can, and must, cooperate based on common values.
An intergovernmental service would be at risk of falling prey to many and more sectoral and strategic interests, and our common values and goals would be lost in the mix.
Secondly, we need to take both an ambitious and realistic approach to European foreign policy under the new Constitution, if and when we get it.
The Constitution advances European foreign and security policy in many key respects and we must ensure that these commitments are upheld.
Even though the developments embodied in the Constitutionâs clauses of mutual solidarity â as well as in increased rapid reaction capability â are reflections of current practice rather than being innovations, we have to ensure that they are interpreted in an ambitious, concrete and binding fashion when they take effect.
The inclusion of mutual security guarantees in the Constitution should also be welcomed and consolidated.
The opposition of some Member States can be countered with a few simple arguments.
NATO is, and will remain, the backbone of European defence, there is no doubt about that.
We proposed European guarantees simply to complement NATO provisions with a much-needed European dimension.
They also support and consolidate decades of European political and security cooperation, which has existed outside the scope of the EU.
They do not constitute a radical rewriting of Europeâs foreign and security ambitions: they simply establish that Europe must finally be mature enough to begin matching its economic muscle with some political voice and commitment.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, in recent times the European Union has increasingly become a driving force in the creation of a new international order.
This has particularly been the case since last yearâs enlargement.
The success of European integration means that the European political system is becoming more attractive to the people of countries beyond the Union.
Certain US analysts are now referring to so-called European soft power and to the European dream that is coming true before our very eyes.
Terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, the collapse of nations and organised crime all call for a global dimension in the Unionâs external actions.
In addition, they call for greater democratic accountability concerning those actions.
To this end, we should be referring to the letter and the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty regarding matters with a bearing on the common foreign and security policy.
The future European Foreign Service must play a crucial role in this area, assisting the European Unionâs foreign ministers.
As soon as the Constitutional Treaty comes into force, it will be essential to make every effort to invest the solidarity clause with real meaning as regards the defence matters provided for in the Treaty.
Â Â  Mr President, the report by Mr Brok contains many fresh, visionary and encouraging ideas.
I want to add some remarks on the problems of the new, non-state terrorism.
First, what more could we recommend than what Mr Brok does?
The fight against so-called terrorism calls for a clear description of political terrorism.
Its aim is to achieve concrete political goals, and what are those goals?
A distinction needs to be drawn between the new, political, non-state terrorism, which allegedly has no exact state address, and the traditional state terrorism, which is found mainly where democracy fails.
That sort of political terrorism tends to provoke revengeful responses by certain groups and organisations, as is now happening with Russiaâs terrorist â or terrorising â war in Chechnya.
The democratic community cannot successfully confront any abstract concept of terrorism , as it would be rooted only in ideology or fanaticism.
No, the real enemies to be fought are terrorist organisations and states that use such methods and support such organisations.
Two fresh efforts have been made to find addresses in Afghanistan and Iraq.
They are now the only places where terrorist organisations appear to be on the defensive.
In the field of defence, this would more than fulfil Europeâs desire to compete with the United States.
Finally, there is a sort of diabolical profit to be made from this phenomenon of non-state terror, as democracies may now perhaps realise more clearly what their endangered values are.
When creating the concepts and structures of the European security and defence policy, we should concentrate more and more on the question: for the sake of what, for what Europe are we working?
Surely not for a consumerist and suicidal Europe that is losing its identity and sense of values, despite talking so much about it?
That is defending the indefensible.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think that this debate has once again demonstrated the extremely valuable contribution which Parliament is making towards the broad lines, the broad concepts, of the common foreign and security policy.
It has also demonstrated that this dialogue, which Parliament wanted so much, exists in a very practical form, and I understand why Parliament is seeking this contact, this dialogue with the Council and the Commission.
The debate has shown that this dialogue exists not only , so that we can talk about the past, but also in relation to present and future policies.
Moreover, I believe â as someone has said â that we should not pursue a foreign policy which is against the wishes of Parliament.
Since I have had the pleasure of representing the Presidency, I have never had the impression that the Council was pursuing a policy against the wishes of Parliament.
On the contrary, I have had the impression that the policy was pursued entirely together and, moreover, todayâs debates and also those during previous sittings on the Middle East, Lebanon, and a few hours ago the Balkans, show that Parliament is involved not only in the analysis of our policy, but also in the conception and future directions of that policy.
I cannot help but notice that there is a broad consensus on the general lines of this policy, on all its facets, and on the idea that Europe must have security, on the fact that that security is not merely security in political and military terms but rather an overall security which includes aspects such as the environment or human rights.
I am also particularly sensitive to what has been said on the value of symbols and on what goes far beyond symbols, in other words the fact that an encounter with military personnel who wear the European stars on their epaulettes is something to send a shiver down your spine, and effectively demonstrates that Europe is on the move, that the unification of Europe is on the move, and that we have just completed a further stage, in particular by means of our security and defence policy.
I should like to make just one final comment, on the subject of China.
At the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Jarzembowski, I adopted a position, and I see that gradually the position I adopted is being confirmed.
I believe that we should face up to reality: we must develop a relationship with China, because it is a country which is increasing in importance.
We must therefore engage with China in a general dialogue which covers all aspects.
Thank you very much for your contributions. I think that this has been a fruitful debate, a useful debate and a debate which demonstrates that the dialogue between the various institutions of the Union is working.
Â Â  . Mr President, like my colleague I think it was an interesting and comprehensive debate because it has shown that many specific questions have been tackled under banners of the CFSP and EDSP.
Many of the individual issues will resurface in other debates we hold.
Of course we have not forgotten human rights.
Human rights have been mentioned by many of you and I think they are already intrinsic to our whole policy.
It is very important that we become a global player with a European Charter of Human Rights and, hopefully very soon, a Constitution.
There is an issue that was not mentioned in this debate, but I would like to mention it because it is so important for security and development.
This is the gender issue that is being so well promoted in Europe, including as part of our development and neighbourhood policies.
This is part of the overall policy we want.
I would also like to agree with the comment that the European Union needs to work with partners to avoid nuclear and other sensitive materials coming into the hands of terrorists.
This is a key objective in our joint work action plan.
I also agree with Mr von Wogau and others who said that there is a very important link between internal and external security.
This is also key for close cooperation between the different directorates in the Commission and DG External Relations.
Finally, there was a very specific question on demining.
It is not only a problem in Bosnia.
It is an issue throughout the world and we are therefore very happy that the Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines was held in Kenya, where we saw that this issue that has been promoted by the European Union has come forward very strongly.
There are many more things to be done, but we have a good, comprehensive basis.
Let us work together on that basis.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0163/2005).
Â Â  . In answer to your question, Mr SeppÃ€nen, I should like to remind you that the procedure for adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament is laid down in Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty and in Article 108(5) of the Euratom Treaty.
Under these rules, the European Parliament determines the Statute and general conditions governing the performance of its Membersâ duties, after consulting the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting by a qualified majority.
The President of the Council intends to bring to a successful conclusion, if possible during the first six months, the negotiations regarding the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, including those concerning its entry into force.
I can assure you that work is ongoing to arrive at this conclusion.
Â Â  Minister, some Member States of the Council have not accepted the proposal for a compromise which was being discussed by Parliament and the Council last time.
Do you intend to propose the same sort of package again or do you have your own proposals for amendments to this package, and what would these possible amendments be?
Â Â  . You will recall that we were very close to reaching a compromise under the Irish Presidency.
Unfortunately, we have fallen at the final hurdle; it was a compromise that had been negotiated between the Council, and the Irish Presidency in particular, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other.
I believe that a good many elements of this compromise remain of value and, therefore, I believe that it is a good starting point.
For obvious reasons, however, it is necessary to define where adjustments are required.
We are working towards this.
I can assure you that we are working, within the Council but also with Parliament, on acceptable solutions: acceptable, I hope, to all Member States if possible, or at least to a qualified majority among them.
Â Â  I wonder whether the President-in-Office of the Council has had a chance to study yesterday's vote in the European Parliament on the discharge.
If so, does he agree with me that Parliament's lack of will, or ability, to reform its own house demonstrates the urgency of the need for the Statute and that the only way to enhance the reputation of this institution is through the achievement of a Members' Statute?
Â Â  You are the only ones who can judge on the organisation and internal workings of Parliament.
I leave that responsibility entirely to you.
I can assure you that the Presidency is determined to find a solution with Parliament and with the Council.
This is the commitment that we have made and I hope that we will succeed.
Â Â  I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he accepts that the Members' Statute and the package of allowances of this Parliament are being taken together, as was agreed in November or December twelve months ago, just before the Irish presidency.
The Members' Statute is urgent because it could enable us to clear up the whole debate surrounding the allowances.
Yesterday's vote on the budget discharge showed that those who are politically honourable and who accept the agreement made eighteen months ago, stood by it despite pressure from the media and others to do otherwise.
We need reform; we need reform of the whole package: Members' Statute and allowances.
Could you guarantee that within this presidency we will have a Members' Statute put to us?
Could you guarantee that those colleagues who jumped ship at Council level last time, when we thought we had a compromise under the Irish presidency, will be on board this time around?
Have you had negotiations or any assurances from those countries?
Â Â  . Any solution must be all embracing: a sort of package, as you described it.
I cannot guarantee at this stage, of course, that we will have everybody on board.
You will probably recall the fundamental reasons behind the failure of this package that had been negotiated.
They were rather exceptional reasons.
We hope that a solution can be found this time around, that everybody will be able to support this solution, and that nobody will let themselves be influenced by certain articles in newspapers that I will not name.
Â Â  We have a time-limit under the Rules.
Each question is followed by two supplementaries.
This is my first time in the Chair for Question Time, and, because of the importance of the subject, this is the only time I will break the rule.
Â Â  I wish to join with other Members in urging the Presidency to expedite this statute.
I was struck by the hypocrisy of Members who opposed the discharge of the accounts yesterday, having drawn expenses themselves from those accounts they now say they oppose.
I have never seen such hypocrisy in my life and it was very distasteful.
I would urge the Presidency to bring forward this Statute so that this matter is regularised once and for all in terms of both our remuneration and expenses for our work.
There is absolutely no chance that the hypocrites who kicked up a fuss here yesterday will refund the money to put right what they say is wrong with the accounts they refused to discharge yesterday.
This is absolutely disgraceful behaviour.
Â Â  I think the presidency has answered that already.
Â Â  Mr President, if the Statute now comes into being, the European institutions must actually be aware that everyone is being paid independently of their countries.
Are, then, Members from all countries to be paid equally in future?
Will there be a substantial difference from officialsâ salaries, or is an effort being made to strike a balance?
Â Â  . With regard to the first point of your question, I believe that if there is indeed one key principle of the European Union, it is the non-discrimination principle.
I believe that it must also be applied in this instance.
The second part of your question had to do with balance, and this is perhaps a matter of subjective judgment.
Although I am unable to give you a clear answer to that question, I do believe that our discussions are proceeding on the basis of a balanced package.
Â Â  . Let me answer Mr Evans.
On 10 March 2005, in anticipation of the annual spring meeting of the European Council, the Council, within the context of the environment, adopted a contribution to the deliberations made regarding the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
Generally speaking, the Council is emphasising the need to take action from 2005, in particular to confront climate change and to promote eco-innovation, in addition to the efficient use of energy and resources.
It has, in particular, asked the Spring European Council to recommend sustainable consumption and production methods of which eco-efficient innovations are a contributory part, with a view to disassociating economic growth from the use of resources and degradation of the environment.
It has, moreover, invited calls for the Commission to draw up a European initiative in 2005 in favour of energy efficiency, in addition to a Green Paper comprising a list of significantmeasures.
In substance, the Council has first of all recommended the implementation, as a matter of urgency and in its entirety, of a course of action promoting eco-technologies â ETAP â to guarantee the prospect of a fair and competitive market for eco-innovations.
Secondly, it has advocated the vigorous promotion of eco-innovations and eco-technologies in all sectors of the economy, particularly in the energy and transport sectors.
Finally, it has recommended alleviation measures intended to reduce the long-term risks and costs connected to climate change, resulting in an economy that emits low levels of carbon. This will be achieved, in particular, by reinforcing the deployment and development of high yield renewable energy technologies and of new fuels.
Â Â  I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that response, and very wholesome it was too.
May I draw your attention to the last point, where I refer to the power of the oil industry, which to my mind tends to ride roughshod over governments and strangle new initiatives in this field.
I wonder whether you agree with me, either personally or in your capacity as President-in-Office, that if similar investments had been made in alternative energy sources, funded by the oil industry, then we might have made the sort of substantial progress that Council is now making.
Do you think we should put pressure on the oil companies to reduce our dependence on the world's diminishing supplies of fossil fuel?
Â Â  . I believe that the current situation with regard to the oil market, and the level of oil prices in particular, will encourage many parties to invest in alternative energy sources and renewable energy sources.
This is where a balance will come about.
We know, in fact, that the price of oil is due to some economic developments in certain areas of the world and also to some trends in financial speculation.
The consequence of this will be to make renewable energy sources more appealing and, through these mechanisms, we will perhaps succeed in putting pressure on oil companies and in taking steps which favour the energy sources of the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I too believe that the only way to deal with the greenhouse effect is to make use not only of renewable energies, but also of nuclear power and energy-saving measures, but, if the questioner is asking what should be done to promote the generation of electricity from wind, wave and tide power, and whether these new initiatives are being hindered by the oil lobby, I would ask you what initiatives are being set in motion in the nuclear energy sector, and whether these initiatives are being interfered with by the renewable energy lobby.
Â Â  . I believe that this is a question faced by every country at national level.
Every country must choose the methods of energy production with which it has the greatest affinity.
I believe that you have expressed, it seems, an affinity with one particular energy source.
I understand your position; I do not necessarily share it.
The Council, I believe, leaves it to every Member State to choose the options it favours.
Â Â  . For some years now, employment guidelines have sought to promote active ageing with a view to increasing the average retirement age particularly the specific guideline 5 of the 2003 guidelines, which were renewed unaltered in 2004.
The European Council of Stockholm has, moreover, set the ambitious objective of bringing the employment rate of people aged between 55 years and 64 years up to 50%, whilst the European Council of Barcelona has set an additional ambitious objective, namely the raising by five years, by 2010, of the average retirement age, which is currently 61 years according to Eurostat estimates.
The Council looks upon maintaining older workers in active employment as a major challenge, as is evident from the key messages it has recently adopted for the attention of the Spring European Council.
In these messages, it points out that it is appropriate to give priority to this issue in reforms seeking to ensure social adequacy and the viability of future pension plans, according to the circumstances of each individual country.
An increase in longevity will indeed require a new delay in the age at which workers exit the labour market, which presupposes the progressive dismantling of incentive measures for early retirement.
Â Â  â Mr President, within the framework of the freedom of European citizens and the abolition of age and other types of discrimination and with the prospect of making use of the accumulated experience of workers of pre-retirement age, will provision be made for joint European political bases, so that young people can also benefit from the experience of people taking retirement, without being prevented from taking up the jobs which belong to them?
Â Â  . As a matter of fact, I believe that maintaining the active employment of older people must not be at variance with the employment of young people.
The European Council, in deciding upon the relaunch and revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy, has taken an initiative with regard to young people, to offer them greater employment prospects.
I believe that the two can go hand in hand, provided that other means of managing employment are perhaps implemented.
Yet managing employment takes place primarily within the business community and businesses should take note of what you have said, namely that experience, and therefore also age, has its price and its worth.
Â Â  I am delighted that this item is on the agenda and that the issue of active ageing is being followed so intently by certain colleagues up in the gallery.
It is an issue that affects many of us.
Could you confirm the active ageing policies of the European institutions, and specifically that there is no longer age discrimination in the employment policies that you and your colleagues operate as employers?
You referred to the role of employers and the EU institutions are themselves employers.
I did ask Commissioner Kinnock this question, but I never managed to get a straight answer.
I wonder if you could supply one?
Â Â  . If I have understood your question correctly, there is no policy of discrimination with regard to older peoplewithin theinstitutions.
Moreover, I recall that last year, the Commission proposed a report for the Spring Council that was focused on the idea of active ageing.
I believe that it is the responsibility of the institutionsto promote this idea.
I do not believe that there is a genuine policy of discrimination within the institutions.
One encounters people of all ages there with, of course, the retirement age as the limit, but that is another debate.
Â Â  . The European Council of December 2004 notes with satisfaction that the progress made by Romania, in the implementation of the and undertakings entered into, has allowed the formal closure of all outstanding chapters in the accession negotiations.
Today, you have, I believe, decided to give your assent to the accession of Romania.
Noting the evaluations and recommendations presented by the Commission, the European Council has judged that Romania would be in a position to assume all of its ensuing obligations at the time scheduled for its accession.
At the same time, the European Council clearly pointed out that the Union would continue to carefully follow â and I believe this has been amply stated this morning â the preparations carried out by Romania, as well as the results obtained.
The Council thus assures the honourable Member that, as in the past, the subject of children will be followed very closely.
It is noted moreover that, in its 2004 report on the progress made by Romania on the path to accession, the Commission recorded steadyprogress in the reorganisation of child protection, in particular as a result of the closure of outdated large institutional facilities and the implementation of alternative procedures.
For its part, the European Union has provided financial support towards Romaniaâs efforts, with a view to improving the quality of state-run child care organisations.
Whilst there remains work to be done and improvements to be made, it can be said that, by and large, the living conditions of children placed in Romanian state-run institutional facilities have decidedly improved, and that the Romanian authorities will continue with their efforts to fully implement reform of the child protection system, as of course, all the institutions, and particularly the Council and the Commission, have called upon them to do.
Â Â  President-in-Office, my question referred to young adults as well, and perhaps I should have added 'with disabilities', because there are some issues around this.
Could you advise me on the state of the rollout of the national pilot project for the reform of institutions under ANPH, and specifically in relation to Negru Voda, and when this pilot project might be rolled out nationally?
Â Â  . I believe that that is a question to be addressed primarily to the Commission and I regret to inform you that I cannot provide you with further details.
The question needs to be addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  . The Council reminds the honourable Member that the organisation of electoral procedures, like the rules relating to the entitlements of the voter, are governed by the national law of each Member State.
Whilst considering it important that the right to vote may be exercised as fully as possible within the Union, it is not for the Council to express an opinion on the issues raised by the honourable Member.
Â Â  I would not only like to ask a supplementary question but would also like to re-ask the original question, because I notice that the Minister has now ducked the previous question as well as this one, which is not very appropriate.
I accept that this is a matter for Member States.
My question is whether the Council can, by encouraging use of best practice, use its influence so that we can better learn from each other.
My attention has been drawn specifically to the case of British expatriates in Spain who have told me that, whereas they used to be able to vote in their home country of the UK provided they had been registered within the previous 20 years, our present government has now made it more difficult by reducing this time to 15 years.
Do you know of any other Member State that is making it more difficult for expatriates to vote and would you not wish to encourage your colleagues to make it easier?
Please answer and do not say nothing.
Â Â  I turn to the Minister.
I believe that MrÂ Bushill-Matthews is on to something here, but we are both Conservatives!
Â Â  . Frankly, I believe that the Constitution has defined the competences of the Union to a greater degree.
Here we have an area that is genuinely outside of the Unionâs competences.
It is therefore the responsibility of each Member State â I can only repeat what I have already said â to define its electoral rights, even if one can hope that these rights are as extensive, as effective and as well organised as possible, but that remains a competence of each Member State.
Â Â  . In responding to questions on this issue, the Council has already had, and myself for that matter, on behalf of the Council, I have often had the opportunity to stress that, if religious freedom is guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, certain conditions for the operationof non-Muslim religious communities, in accordance with the practices in force in the Member States of the European Union, must still be laid down.
In its 2004 Regular Report, the European Commission reported on some instances of progress made by Turkey in this fieldbut equally it recognised significant shortcomings that must be improved, particularly with regard to the legal personality and property rights of non-Muslim communities, in addition to training of the clergy In this regard, important legislation on basic rights still remains under consideration by the Republic of Turkey Prime Ministry.
The Commission had been invited to comment on this legislation, which is currently being reviewed.
The European Councils of 16 and 17 December 2004 decided that Turkey adequately fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria in order for accession negotiations to be opened with the country.
At the same time, the European Council clearly indicated that the full and effective implementation of the political reform process must continue to be closely monitored by the Commission.
The Commission is asked to look into all the areas of concern registered in its Regular Report and recommendation,including of course, religious freedom, and to regularly brief the Council.
The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that it will continue to closely monitor the progress made by Turkey on this issue, particularly on the basis of an Accession Partnership setting out the priorities of the reform process, of which a revised text proposal will be presented to the Council by the Commission in the Autumn.
The Council can further assure him that, as in the past, the Union will not fail to raise outstanding questions in the various forums of political dialogue and within the bodies instituted by the Association Agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, as that will be one of this yearâs most exciting and important issues, I would like to ask the Presidency of the Council whether it might not be reasonable for the Council to report to the public and to this House, at certain intervals, on how negotiations are actually progressing, for they are being conducted by the Member States rather than by the Commission.
We would like to be advised on a regular basis as to what progress has been made on the important issue of church property and freedom to actively practice a religion.
Â Â  . I think, Mr Posselt, that you are jumping ahead a little, as we have not yet entered into negotiations with Turkey.
We, and in particular the Commission, are, so to speak, in dialogue with Turkey to ensure that the reform processes to which it committed itself are followed through.
I can assure you that, when the time comes after 3Â October, if we enter into negotiations with Turkey, Parliament will of course be kept informed of the progress of those negotiations.
Â Â  . The issue of the inclusion of the Shiite movement Hizbollah on the list of terrorist organisations has been examined several times by the bodies of the Council and remains open.
The honourable Member will be aware that a decision in this regard must meet the conditions laid down in common position 931/2001 and that it requires unanimity.
Furthermore, in its conclusions of 16Â MarchÂ 2005, the Council reaffirmed its support for a sovereign, independent and democratic Lebanon and reiterated its call for immediate full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which calls in particular for the disarmament of the militias present on Lebanese territory.
The European Council endorsed this approach at its meeting in Brussels on 22 and 23Â MarchÂ 2005.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer to my question.
It was not, however, really an answer to the question I asked, which was not about disarming various organisations in Lebanon but about ensuring that the Middle East peace process could continue under stable conditions.
We know that terrorism is the most serious threat to that being possible.
We know that, via Hizbollah, Iran funds and supports terrorism and has the unambiguous intention, clearly declared on a variety of occasions, to take steps to annihilate Israel.
If the point is not made to Iran that it is unacceptable to support acts of terrorism and if Hizbollah is not declared a terrorist organisation, the question must be asked: in what way is Hizbollah not, in fact, a terrorist organisation?
In what way, moreover, can it be made clear to Iran that it is not permissible to support terrorism?
Â Â  . I think that your question goes beyond the rather more precise subject of Hizbollah.
There have been debates regarding the best approach to take in this particular case, and there are various possible options.
Obviously, the greatest threat to the peace process is terrorism.
We still need to find a better way to combat this scourge and, at the moment, I can only confirm what I have just said: that the approach taken at this stage is not, for now, to include the organisation to which you referred, that is to say Hizbollah, on the list.
That is not to say that we do not consider the activities of that group to be dangerous, but it is the approach we have chosen and it has also not been criticised by some of our most important partners.
Â Â  I wish to support the Council in the approach it takes to Hizbollah.
There is a certain logic.
If you oppose terrorism â which we all do and we know Hizbollah has links to terrorism â then proscribe Hizbollah.
However, that would be a very short-term approach, because there will be no permanent settlement in the Middle East without the active participation of Hizbollah.
Therefore, while the Council is right to keep the issue of proscribing this organisation under review, it would be far better in the short run to have a dialogue.
Â Â  Given the financial connections between Iran and Hizbollah, is the Councilâs âsoftly softlyâ approach to Iran, as illustrated by its weak attitude to Iranâs pursuit of its nuclear ambitions, also at work on this subject?
Are we seeing that same âsoftly softlyâ approach to Hizbollah because of the Iranian connection?
I believe Hizbollah to be one of the most pernicious and vicious terrorist organisations at work in our dangerous world today and it should be treated accordingly?
If the experience of my part of the world teaches us anything, it is that cosying up to terrorism does not work.
What has happened with the IRA since demonstrates that beyond all doubt.
Â Â  . I do not think that the issue here is whether or not to take the âsoftly softlyâ approach.
You have also put this question in a wider context.
We do indeed also need to enter into dialogue with Iran regarding its attitude and its support for terrorist activities, and also regarding its attitude towards a peaceful resolution to the problem in the Middle East, and we are doing so.
We have done so and we are also in the process of doing so in this overall approach that we have adopted and that we are currently applying in that country, particularly in the context of non-proliferation.
With regard to Hizbollah, to respond to Mr Martinâs speech, I think that it is a complicated group.
Indeed, that organisation has several wings, including a parliamentary wing, because it is represented in the Lebanese Parliament.
It is for that reason, too, that my response emphasised this Lebanese wing, which we cannot exclude or separate from the more specific context of terrorism against Israel.
Â Â  . The European Council of JuneÂ 2000 established that all the countries of the Western Balkans were potential candidates for EU membership.
Subsequently, in JuneÂ 2003, the European Council reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the EU, once they meet the established criteria.
It is therefore essentially up to the countries concerned âÂ I think that the debate we have had on the Western Balkans has adequately demonstrated thisÂ â to set the pace at which they come closer to the EU by aligning with the and by meeting the criteria established by the Copenhagen European Council.
On 16Â MarchÂ 2005, the Council reaffirmed the European Unionâs commitment to the accession of Croatia and adopted the framework for negotiations with that country.
It also referred to the importance of full cooperation with the ICTY on the part of all the countries of the Western Balkans.
That is an essential requirement for closer relations with the EU and I think that, in the previous debate, I did emphasise this once again.
In that regard, after deliberation by the Council and in the absence of a common agreement, the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia has been postponed.
The bilateral intergovernmental conference will be convened by common agreement as soon as the Council has established that Croatia is cooperating fully with the ICTY, and you will be aware that, to enable the Council to take this decision with full knowledge of the facts, we have set up a group chaired by the Presidency, and involving the next two Presidencies as well as the Commission and the High Representative.
The first meeting with the Croatian Government will take place on 26Â April, to discuss precisely this aspect of cooperation with the Hague Tribunal.
Â Â  Your answer was very helpful, but, if the fugitive general is out of Croatia, what evidence will the Croatian authorities be able to give to you to show that they are cooperating with the International Criminal Court?
It seems that they are now in a bind.
If he has left Croatian territory they will be unable to capture him. If they cannot capture him, how can they show willingness to comply with the International Criminal Court?
Â Â  . Mr Martin, I think I have already had an opportunity to provide a clear answer to this question.
We have never said that the opening of negotiations with Croatia depended on arresting General Gotovina and bringing him to The Hague.
That has never been seen as a condition.
The condition is Croatiaâs cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, which means cooperation involving the provision of all information leading to his arrest.
Indeed, if the general is somewhere else, I do not know where, we cannot oblige the Croatians to arrest him if he is not in their country.
I therefore think that this condition must not be confused with the more general one of full cooperation with the tribunal, in other words the provision of all information leading to the arrest of General Gotovina.
If he cannot be arrested because there is not enough information to allow it, that does not mean that Croatiaâs accession would be permanently blocked.
That would be unfair on that country.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
On 8 April 2003, as a consequence of attacks by United States forces, JosÃ© Couso, a Spanish and European citizen working as a cameraman for the Tele 5 station, Taras Protsyuk (Reuters news agency) and Tareq Ayoub (Al Jazeera) died while doing their job of reporting events.
Up to now, the US authorities have not launched any investigation or judicial proceedings.
However, the same authorities have agreed to open an investigation, with Italian involvement, in relation to the unjustified attack carried out by the same forces when the Italian and European citizen Giuliana Sgrena was freed on Friday, 4 March 2005.
What steps must be taken to ensure that an investigation is carried out with sufficient guarantees that it will clarify who bears criminal responsibility and who is liable to pay compensation in relation to the murder of the European citizen JosÃ© Couso, and of his fellow journalists who died while doing their duty of informing the public?
Whilst carrying out their work as journalists JosÃ© Couso, a Spanish citizen (cameraman for the Spanish TV channel Tele 5), Taras Proyuk (Reuters press agency) and Tarek Ayoub (the TV channel Al Jazeera) were killed by the United Statesâ attack on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad on 8 April 2003.
The US authorities have remained totally silent about this dramatic murder ever since and there have not been any investigations or judicial process.
However, the same authorities have decided to start an investigation, together with the Italian Government, into the unjustified attack by the same forces on 4 March 2005, which caused the death of Nicola Capilari, following the release of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrana.
What steps will the EU take to ensure that an investigation is started, with adequate guarantees of impartiality, to ascertain responsibility for the murder of JosÃ© Couso and his colleagues, who died whilst carrying out their duties?
On 8 April 2003, as a consequence of attacks by United States forces, JosÃ© Couso, a Spanish and European citizen working as a cameraman for the Tele 5 station, Taras Protsyuk (Reuters news agency) and Tareq Ayoub (Al Jazeera) died while doing their job of reporting events.
The US authorities have not yet launched any investigation or judicial proceedings in this matter.
However, the US has decided to open an investigation, with Italian involvement, into the unjustified attack carried out by the same forces on 4 March 2005 during the release of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena, which caused the death of Nicola Calipari (head of Sismi).
What steps must be taken to ensure that an investigation is carried out which will make it possible properly to establish both criminal responsibility and liability for compensation in relation to the murder of the journalist JosÃ© Couso and his colleagues while they were carrying out their task of informing the public?
On 4 March 2005, the freeing of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrana led to the killing of the Italian citizen Nicola Calipar by the US army.
Under pressure from Italian public opinion, the Italian Government and the USA have decided to carry out a joint investigation to attempt to clarify this unhappy event.
But the cases of the Spanish Tele 5 cameraman, JosÃ© Couso, the Ukrainian Reuters cameraman Taras Prosyuk and the Al Jazira television cameraman Tarek Ayoub, who were all killed as a result of an attack carried out by US forces on the Hotel Palestine in Baghdad, have not been the subject of any investigation or court proceedings to date, as far as we know.
Given that JosÃ© Couso was a European citizen, what steps could be taken on the part of the European Union with a view to carrying out a joint investigation with the US authorities, so as to throw light on what happened and, where appropriate, determine who was responsible?
On 8 April 2003, US armoured vehicles fired at the 14th floor of the Hotel Palestine in Baghdad, where several journalists covering the war were staying.
JosÃ© Couso, a Spanish journalist, lost his life in the attack, as did two other journalists, Taras Protsyuk and Tareq Ayoub.
Two years on, the US authorities have still to carry out a credible and independent investigation in order to clarify the course of events and the reasons for such meaningless deaths.
What steps does the Council intend to take to secure an investigation and uncover the reasons behind the US attack on the Hotel Palestine on 8 April 2003?
On 8 April 2003 two cameramen, Spaniard JosÃ© Couso working for the television station Telecinco and Ukrainian Taras Protsyuk working for Reuters news agency, were killed in Baghdad when the American army fired on the Palestine Hotel, where several hundred non-embedded journalists were staying.
On the same day, 8 April 2003, Jordanian journalist Tarek Ayoub from the Al-Jazira channel was also killed during an American air raid.
According to Reporters Without Borders, the report provided by the American authorities on the circumstances surrounding these tragedies is inadequate.
It does not identify those responsible, and conceals the lack of communication between the soldiers who fired on the Palestine Hotel and their superiors with regard to the fact that journalists were present inside the building.
What steps might be taken by the European Union with a view to an independent inquiry being held into the circumstances surrounding the death of JosÃ© Couso, in order that the culprits are identified and tried and the victim's family receives compensation?
Â Â  . The Council has on many occasions condemned the massacre of civilians, including journalists, and has always emphasised the need for the authorities concerned to carry out extensive investigations each time an incident occurs.
The Council is aware of the fact that a number of incidents have still not been properly explained and have still not been investigated thoroughly.
It will continue to bring up these incidents and to call for investigations within the desired timeframe.
With regard to the specific incident referred to in the questions, the investigation carried out by the United Statesâ authorities concluded that the American forces were not to blame.
The victimâs family, however, has filed a lawsuit against the American soldiers involved.
Under those circumstances, the Council does not think it would be appropriate to comment on the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, your reply is very disappointing because we are trying, or we have tried, to sell all the European citizens the idea that, on the basis of the Treaty establishing a Constitution, everything relating to common security is going to require a single policy for all the Member States.
Five days ago was the second anniversary of the death of this journalist and the European Union is being asked not just to use judicial channels, which the families have already done, but to call on the United States Government through political channels to carry out an impartial investigation.
Everybody knows that the place where this journalist died, the Palestine Hotel, was a non-military target that should have been protected and in which all of the accredited international press was based, and the response of the United States authorities is not, therefore, acceptable and we want the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to demand clearly and vigorously that the United States Government open up an impartial investigation.
I therefore regret your reply and I hope that you will accept the view that we should continue to demand this investigation as firmly as possible.
Â Â  Mr Schmit, I am rather disappointed by your response.
It amounts to saying that, because the family has reacted and is taking legal action to defend the interests of a brother, a cousin, in other words a loved one, the Council has nothing to say.
That means, if we understand correctly the answer you have just given, that the Council would only have reacted if the family had been inactive, which is a completely incomprehensible, not to say intolerable, response.
You have two choices.
Either you have the courage, on behalf of the Council, to say that you are completely satisfied with the investigation carried out by the American authorities â you have the right to do so, but, in that case, have the courage to say that the American authoritiesâ investigation, which concluded that nothing had happened, satisfies the Council completely.
Have the courage to say so in public, in this forum.
Or you say that you are not satisfied and that you are going to call for further explanations.
Passivity, though, is never an answer, and it does not help to bring people closer to their government and their institutions.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me start by publicly expressing our satisfaction at the steps taken by the President of the European Parliament and one of Parliamentâs Vice-Presidents, MrÂ Vidal-Quadras Roca, specifically, to secure the release of the French journalist, MrsÂ Aubenas, and her colleague, MrÂ Al-Saadi, who have been held hostage for exactly 100 days today.
This is an occasion for me to remind you that, in Iraq, a number of journalists and other press employees have been victims of kidnappings, which is rare during a war, and there have been several dozen kidnappings.
I would like to insist, on the strength of both my experience and my new functions, that the Council should submit a request for a joint investigation, before the people take to the streets to demand it, as happened in Italy for MrÂ Calibari.
It is something that is both moral and technically feasible.
Â Â  . First of all, I would like to thank MrÂ Cavada for reminding us that it is now 100 days since MrsÂ Aubenas and the person accompanying her were taken hostage.
I think that I can, on behalf of the Council, and certainly on behalf of the Presidency, express our full solidarity with MrsÂ Aubenas, and with all the hostages in Iraq, because there are others.
There is another group of three Romanian journalists who have been taken hostage.
This is the time to express our full solidarity with them and also our desire to do everything we can to secure their release as soon as possible.

I also understand, in a way, the disappointment that has been expressed, but I cannot go any further: now that a lawsuit has been filed, and the families are taking legal action, I cannot, at this stage, get further involved and express a political opinion on the matter.
Believe me, we will continue to follow closely all these matters and incidents, some of which have been particularly tragic.
Â Â  . The importance that the European Union attaches to relations with the Andean Community and to progress towards its integration can clearly be seen from the Guadalajara summit between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in MayÂ 2004.
On that occasion, the Heads of State or Government welcomed the decision of the concerned parties to open the process leading to Association Agreements, including a free trade area.
This prospect should give new impetus to strengthening the regional integration process.
In the meantime, the prior joint assessment phase has been launchedÂ âÂ this will involve technical assessmentsÂ âÂ and the joint ministerial meeting planned for the end of May in Luxembourg will be a new opportunity to go into a subject so essential to our future relations in more detail.
The European Union welcomes the desire reiterated by the Andean political representatives to continue along this path, as it does the increasing closeness of relations between Mercosur and the Andean Community.
With respect to the fight against drugs, the European Union welcomes the high-level meetings with specialists in the Andean countries regarding drugs and their precursorsÂ âÂ the next of these meetings will take place during the first half of this year in Lima.
The two parties will keep up their efforts to combat this scourge with an approach based on cooperation and co-responsibility.
In terms of commercial policy, the European Union is giving the Andean countries a prime position in the proposed GSP+.
In the aim of basing sustainable political relationships on the interests and participation of the population, the Council would finally like to emphasise the important contribution resulting from the meeting with representatives of civil society from the Andean countries which took place on 3Â March in Brussels.
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful for the explanations the President-in-Office of the Council has given me and I simply wished to ask a brief supplementary question.
With regard to the progress of the negotiations with these countries, when there is also talk of the creation of a broader Latin American system, in particular by means of the union between the Andean Community and Mercosur, I wished to know whether the negotiations with Mercosur and the Andean Community are related to each other, are parallel negotiations or are linked in some way.
Â Â  . If I understand you correctly, MrÂ Medina Ortega, it is a process between the Latin-American countries, in other words between the countries of Mercosur and those of the Andean Community.
I think that the European Union does indeed have the aim of encouraging all forms of regional integration, the wider the better.
I think this is an approach that can only be encouraged.
And if these countries succeed in further improving their cooperation, or even integration, I think that it must also be taken into account in the relations they have with the European Union.
Â Â  . As the Council has already had the opportunity to tell the honourable Member during the part-session in March, the Secretariat of the Council has not been informed of the activities of the Member Statesâ secret services in the fight against organised crime.
No provision in EU law obliges the Member States to provide the Council with such information.
As the Council told the honourable Member during Question Time in March, that does not mean that there is no contact between the national secret services of the Member States in this particular field.
Â Â  Like all of us here in this Chamber â or all those who should theoretically be in this Chamber at this moment â you represent the public.
We in Parliament do not want to know the operational secrets. Of course we do not, because that would be very damaging.
But we want to know, on behalf of the public whom you represent and whom we represent, whether an elected politician is in charge of coordinating the activities that the secret services jointly carry out.
Is anybody watching what they are doing?
If you say the Council is not doing so, then who is?
Who is elected?
Who is coordinating and supervising this work?
It is very alarming if you say nobody is.
Â Â  . I think that supervision of the secret services is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, and that it is the Member States who must ensure that the activities of the services concerned take place within the limits of the rule of law and in accordance with their legislation.
Â Â  As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 17 to 41 will be answered in writing(1).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  Honourable Members, this is my first session in the chair and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of this House for the trust that they have placed in me.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Wurtz on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, Mr DÃ©sir on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and MrsÂ Flautre on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on redundancies at Alstom.
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of Alstom Power Boiler has left us all with our backs to the wall with respect to our commitment to create a Europe of full employment, with a strong high-tech industry, a Europe that cares about the environment, a Europe that is free from the technological and financial domination of the United States.
What is this about?
A subsidiary of the Alstom group, whose creative, research and production resources are established in EuropeÂ âÂ 250 employees in France, in VÃ©lizy, 300 in Germany, in Stuttgart, and a number of plants in the Czech Republic, Portugal and PolandÂ âÂ but whose headquarters are in the United States, in Connecticut.
This companyâs expertise is in the manufacture of boilers for generating steam and electricity.
It is the world leader in the production of clean coal and is developing new technologies for CO2 capture.
With the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the need to diversify energy sources, it is clear that such technologies have huge potential.
However, for reasons that are unclear, the management of Alstom has decided to transfer the European expertise to the United States, to reduce the workforce in VÃ©lizy by four fifths and to halve that in Stuttgart, probably with the aim of eventually closing the main European sites.
The pretext for this siphoning-off of European expertise was a pseudo-study carried outÂ âÂ what a surpriseÂ âÂ by the Americans, announcing that the market was expected to shrink by a third over the next four years.
Following the example of the employees of Power Boiler, we cannot take this study seriously, especially when we know the enormous demand in this field that is emerging throughout the world.
As they say in my country, though, when you want to kill your dog, you accuse it of having rabies.
A lack of a real long-term industrial strategy, a frantic scramble for immediate profits, those have been the main characteristics of the Alstom Group since it was privatised.
The Commission, and also the French Government, must also take some of the responsibility.
Fortunately, the employees at the European sites affected, supported by their trade unions, have not thrown in the towel.
The employees in VÃ©lizy, in particular, have come up with a counterplan based around withdrawing the company from the Alstom group for a sales price in the region of one symbolic euro, creating a European public limited-liability company grouping together the VÃ©lizy and Stuttgart sites and retaining the plants in the Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal.
This plan is based on the voluntary participation of the employees.
It has the advantage of fitting in with the demands of 7Â JulyÂ 2004 drawn up by the European Commission with regard to Alstom on the subject of the disposal of assets, the aim being to safeguard and increase employment and European technological potential compared to the United States.
This cooperation between European employees is at the forefront of the application of European law, as it will result in the creation of a European public limited-liability company.
We must work fast, though, as the companyâs intellectual property is on the way to being transferred to the United States and Switzerland and Alstomâs general management is working to put the company in financial difficulties.
If, ladies and gentlemen, we are committed to the growth of industry and employment, we must do all we can to support this initiative.
It is true that the directive on European public limited-liability companies and the regulation on the involvement of employees in corporate governance have not yet been transposed into French law, but it is always possible to look ahead.
It is a question of political will and I expect the Commission to show this will.
So, let us not disappoint these workers, whose jobs are threatened but who are so proud of their unparalleled technical achievements and are always ready to innovate.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted to see you in the chair for your first sitting, inasmuch as your appointment to this post is connected to some excellent news for my group and for European socialists: the victory of the socialists in Portugal.
Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Member, MrÂ Henin, I am one of the authors of this question to the Commission.
A few weeks ago, we received here a delegation of employees of the Alstom group made up of representatives of both French and German trade unions from the two sites of this subsidiary that specialises in boilers.
These workers are now affected by the announcement made by their management on 16Â FebruaryÂ 2005, of the closure of the company or, at any rate, of major cuts in jobs and activities, both in Stuttgart and in VÃ©lizy: 150 jobs out of 350 will be lost in Stuttgart, and 150 out of 200 in VÃ©lizy.
This means that, in the end, these two sites will probably be doomed.
A few months ago, on 7Â JulyÂ 2004, the European Commission approved aid granted by France to Alstom subject to strict disvestment conditions but with the aim, not only of re-establishing sound competition conditions, but also of safeguarding the long-term future of the Alstom industry and of its various subsidiaries.
The subsidiary Alstom Power Boiler, as has already been mentioned, is a company that specialises in the construction of power station boilers.
It is a technological leader in Europe, and in the world, in a number of fields, particularly in difficult and clean combustion and CO2 capture.
From the point of view of the European Unionâs priorities in terms of the Lisbon strategy, which we have debated recently and which will serve to ensure that Europe develops its competences and its technology and becomes the most competitive economy in the world, and also from the point of view of our objectives with regard to sustainable development and clean energy, this company is a strategic tool, and the fact is that, obviously, many jobs depend on it.
That is what justified the agreement given by the Commission in July 2004 to a considerable quantity of aid: EUR 3Â billion granted by France to the Alstom group to help with its restructuring.
In its final decision, the Commission stated that, with regard to the Power Generation and Transport sectors, the restructuring plan was adequate to ensure industrial recovery.
It considered the planned job cuts to be proportional to the level of over-capacity in these industries, and felt that the estimates of the costs of this restructuring and of the saving that would result seemed realistic.
Today, though, the groupâs management is going beyond the job cuts announced at that time, and is going beyond the disvestments to which it committed itself.
Consequently, I think that the European Commission needs to take an interest in the decisions that have just been taken by the management of the Alstom group.
Indeed, as the Commission is always very scrupulous with regard to compliance with the competition rules after aid has been granted, it must be equally scrupulous with regard to the consequences for employment.
After all, unless I have misunderstood, Commissioner, it seems to me that the ultimate justification for granting aid for the restructuring of a business is to keep this activity going, particularly and ultimately because it makes it possible to save jobs, because it generates a multitude of benefits, tax revenue, etc., but above all because it makes it possible to save jobs.
The Commission cannot be hemiplegicÂ âÂ it cannot, having granted aid, only look at the effects on competition and respect for competition.
It must also ensure that this aid actually does contribute to maintaining activities and employment on all sites, insofar as it was indeed decided, when this aid was approved in JulyÂ 2004, that the planned job cuts were adequate and that it is therefore not justified to go beyond that.
We are therefore now counting on the Commission to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and that the two sites in question are not closed down.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am standing in for my colleague, MrsÂ Flautre, with whom I have been following this matter for five years.
I think that MrÂ DÃ©sirâs speech set out the real problem.
I said to former Commissioner Monti years ago that the day would come when the Competition Directorate-Generalâs main task would be not so much to refuse aid as to see whether that aid was properly used.
What authorises a country to award State aid in apparent violation of ArticleÂ 87 of the Treaty?
It is the fact that Europe considers it to be in its interest because, if this aid were refused, jobs would be lost that could not be replaced.
A source of expertise, and of work in the interests of the EUâs objectives, of its citizens and of its consumers would disappear.
In their great wisdom, the Competition DG and the Commission granted this aid to Alstom a year ago.
It was not a case of bowing to pressure from the French Government.
It was a case of expressing an opinion on the fact that, in the condition in which Alstom was proposing to continue, yes, it was worthwhile for a state to grant it aid.
It was good for the whole of Europe.
Well, if this assessment was right a year ago, it is right today.
However, Alstom is in the process of proving that, when it asked for this State aid, it was not trying at all to maintain the supply of clean technologies in Europe, it was not trying to contribute to the objective of full employment in Europe.
It was simply trying to obtain State aid according to the principle of the privatisation of profit and the nationalisation of loss.
This is something that neither the left nor the right in Europe can accept.
I therefore believe that we have here a key example on which the Commission should base its policy.
If the fairly extensive list of authorisations for granting State aidÂ âÂ there are a dozen cases in ArticleÂ 87, which is also retained in the ConstitutionÂ âÂ really forms the basis, so to speak, of industrial policy in Europe, this is the time to prove it.
The Commission must say whether the aid granted a year ago simply served to bail out the Alstom groupâs shareholders or whether it really served the interests of the people of Europe, their future, and in particular compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, too, wish to begin by congratulating you on your office and wishing you success in your term of office.
This issue can â and indeed must â be considered from two angles, first in terms of industrial policy and secondly in relation to the monitoring of state aid.
Being myself responsible for industrial policy, I feel myself on very safe ground when I say that it is in Europeâs political interests not only to maintain, but also to extend, innovative technologies, modern enterprises and modern jobs in Europe.
It is of the utmost importance to the European Union that we should retain in Europe a strong industrial base, without which we will not be able to maintain our competitiveness in global markets.
It is with this in mind that I tell you, in my capacity as the Commissioner with responsibility for industry in Europe, that I am very much concerned that Alstom should successfully complete the restructuring it has started and continue to exist as a healthy, successful and profitable business.
So much for the industrial policy aspect.
Today, though, it is not industrial policy that we are talking about.
What is at issue is the monitoring of state aid.
It is indeed the case that the aid by the French state could not have been granted had not the Commission approved Alstomâs restructuring plan.
The Commission did so and imposed conditions on both the plan and the aid.
The honourable Members are quite right to say that it is the Commissionâs task to ensure that those conditions are complied with and that the aid is used for the purpose for which the Commission approved it, and we are checking to see that this has been the case.
In particular, the Commission stated at the time that approval of the aid was conditional on certain areas of the business being disposed of and on operational restructuring being carried out.
The question to be answered this evening is whether or not the present supplementary restructuring plan runs counter to the Commissionâs decision.
If this restructuring plan is not in breach of the conditions, then it is the companyâs management, rather than the Commission, that is responsible for implementing it; Alstom is not run by the Commission, but by its own management.
Although I have been informed by the departments responsible that the Commission has not, so far, had any indications that the conditions it imposed on the granting of aid have been breached, I can assure you that we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation and will be paying very close attention to see that the conditions are complied with to the letter.
As a matter of principle, the Commission is committed to seeking, in partnership, solutions that take account of all economic, social and environmental considerations.
In its latest communication, âRestructuring and Employmentâ, it explicitly envisaged the mobilisation of all social forces to better accompany restructuring, with the aim of bringing about sustainable development of competition and employment.
In particular, the Commission proposes the organisation of reinforced sectoral and regional follow-up, with special funds being made available to support the implementation of this strategy.
Retaining and improving Europeâs capacity for innovation, research and development is also of strategic importance.
Only a few days ago, the Commission presented a framework programme on research and innovation.
I am well aware that our options are very limited indeed where job losses are concerned, and I share your sentiments in this regard, but the Commission must adhere strictly to the law as it stands.
I have given you an undertaking that we will examine this case with great care and will take action if it should emerge that the conditions attached to this aid have not been met.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Alstom group has been causing grave disquiet for many months.
It is the future of Alstomâs 25Â 000 employees in France that is at issue.
We have had to fight hard and our government has put itself firmly on the side of the Alstom employees.
It was our Minister for Finance, MrÂ Sarkozy, who negotiated with the Commissioner at the time, MrÂ Monti, so that we could grant the aid that saved Alstom.
It was of course a question of safeguarding the future of the employees, but also of saving a jewel in the European energy and transport industry.
This evening, we are talking about VÃ©lizy and Stuttgart, but also about Brno in the Czech Republic and SetÃºbal in Portugal, and large numbers of subcontractors throughout Europe.
Today, the announcement that 350 jobs will be lost, including 200 in VÃ©lizy at Alstom Power Boiler, increases the worry for the employees still further.
It is true that the weakening in the market for boilers is clear, but it is not at a level that would justify such job losses.
It is not down to the Commission, of course, to dictate the management of companies or to manage, on behalf of governments, social assistance for any redundancies.
It is worth pointing out that Alstom Power Boiler is a leader in the field of the production of clean coal and is developing technologies for the capture of carbon dioxide.
We are therefore not talking about a company condemned by ossification and obsolescence.
Acceptance of its migration across the Atlantic or, even worse, its disappearance, is like looking at the future through a rear-view mirror.
The employeesÂ âÂ and we must congratulate them for thisÂ âÂ have developed a plan based around the concept âlet us create the European champion in clean combustionâ.
They have, with the help of experts, developed a plan for the future covering all aspects: the legal structure of the new company, technological aspects, commercial aspects, social aspects.
We must welcome this approach, which represents a refusal to cave in.
It has been brought to the attention of the European partners: the Commissioners responsible for employment and social affairs, enterprise and industry, trade, competition, and environment, who are awaiting your conclusions.
Commissioner, today you must look ahead to the cultural and social revolution set in motion by the draft constitutional treaty.
In future, social rights, with the constitutional treaty, will prevail over the perfection of the internal market which had the upper hand in previous treaties.
Social dialogue will be institutionalised, but above all we must formulate an industrial policy that favours skills centres and will safeguard the social market economy proposed to us as a social model in ArticleÂ 3 of the constitutional treaty.
The question being put to you today, Commissioner, is this: how do you see the future philosophy of the constitutional treaty?
Do not be the clerk of the old Europe, but instead put in place the new Europe, the one intended by the constitutional treaty.
You have a good opportunity to do so, by safeguarding the future of Alstom Power Boiler.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the Commission will be aware, we have almost 300 jobs at risk at the British cellophane plant in Bridgwater in my constituency in the United Kingdom.
This plant has been taken over by a company called Innovia, which currently has plants in Kansas, Carlisle and Bridgwater.
What is being proposed threatens to rip the heart out of the town of Bridgwater; allowing for suppliers to the company, almost one thousand jobs are at risk in the area.
Tonight we have an almost unprecedented request from all parties â Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat â in the region and in the United Kingdom, who are united in their reaction to this appalling decision by Innovia and are asking for the Commissionâs help and assistance.
What leads the company to make this decision?
The plant in Kansas has never in its history made a profit; the plant in Bridgwater has never in its history made a loss.
But we have a proposal to close Bridgwater.
Why?
Because the State of Kansas, led by a Democratic majority, who, in spite of the opposition of Republicans in the State House of Representatives and the State Senate, has offered Innovia certain things.
The first is a bribe of USDÂ 2Â million to shift jobs from the European Union to the United States.
The second is a five-year tax holiday, which means that all the taxes paid by the workforce will be paid back to the company over the next five years.
And, most interestingly, it has offered a suspension of environmental regulations, which will allow the cellophane to be produced cheaply and re-exported back to the European Union.
I should like to ask the Commission whether these financial bribes are allowable under WTO rules.
If not, will it raise the issue with the US Government?
What will be done when Innovia produces cellophane in Kansas and dumps it back on the European market?
How will the Commission tackle that problem?
Also, while I agree that at the moment the WTO rules do not forbid environmental dumping, and while we recognise that different countries may have environmental standards that differ from ours, we object to the suspension of those different standards, something we are increasingly likely to see because of the Kyoto Agreement.
In the European scheme of things, this is comparatively small beer.
Nevertheless, it is very important for the region.
It is also very important in terms of the precedent it sets for the future, because if the United States, its companies and its State governments can get away with this on one occasion, there is absolutely no reason why they will not do it again and again.
Therefore, this is an important issue of principle that the Commission needs to take seriously, and I expect some action.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, my group has decided to join this oral question in order to supplement it.
The question raised by MrÂ Ford relates in particular to compatibility with WTO rules.
For my part, I would like to come back to a question that concerns the European Union and the situation within the EUâs borders.
During the last parliamentary term, the Ecofin Council agreed on the designation of around 60 national tax measures within the European Union that were considered to result in harmful competition as understood in particular in the work carried out within the OECD.
The provisions of what is known as the Primarolo Code of ConductÂ âÂ from the name of the official who chaired this working groupÂ âÂ related both to standstill clauses and to rollback clauses, in other words to the gradual dismantling of the national provisions thus identified by common agreement within the Ecofin Council.
I have noticed that we no longer talk very much, neither within Parliament nor in the media, about the situation with regard to that dismantling process and I would like to know what the Commissionâs opinion is on that process.
I am well aware that the issue essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and that there is agreement between the Member States within the Ecofin Council.
That said, competition policy is an exclusive competence of the EU and the Commission has a very important mission in that regard.
From this point of view, therefore, I believe that the Commission should have a role of monitoring and providing incentives, or at least of warning and providing information, regarding verification of the commitments made within the Ecofin Council.
I will supplement this question by sayingÂ âÂ and you know this as well as I doÂ âÂ that we are still a very long way from harmonisation of corporation tax and of the tax base within the EU, which were debated by the Prodi Commission on the basis of its work with regard to a common minimum level for company taxation within the EU.
This is a development that my group considers desirable.
We therefore see the decisions taken within the Ecofin Council as a and I really hope that the Commission will be able to comment on this process this evening and in the coming months.
This is because I think that the problems we are encountering in some countries with regard to the draft European Constitution are not helping us, unfortunately, and that there is a legitimate concern that harmful competition will continue and get worse within the European Union.
That is why, in my opinion, it is an extremely important policy mission to ensure that, at the very least, the commitments made within the Ecofin Council are met and that the Commission, just like Parliament, plays a part in the development of this process.
Â Â  . Mr President, I rise on behalf of my Group to add my concern to that expressed by previous speakers about this terrible situation in relation to an innovative and, frankly, quite remarkable company in the constituency that Mr Ford and I represent.
Innovia Films is a profitable company, which has developed a process discovered in the United Kingdom in 1898.
I suspect that had that process been discovered in Scandinavia in 1998, it would have been viewed as best available technology, plastic packaging would have been banned and cellophane would have been used instead.
Sadly, for cellophane, it was discovered rather earlier.
However, I welcome the cross-party support that is being shown for the campaign to recognise the problems being caused by the policy of the Americans and to deal with this issue.
This morning we debated the outcome of the European Council meeting held to review the Lisbon Agenda.
In the resolution adopted by Parliament with cross-party support, we agreed that there has to be such a thing as industrial policy.
If there is industrial policy, then we have to look at how we can support companies like this one.
When I wrote to Commissioner Piebalgs on behalf of the company some while ago, in order to see whether any kind of support was available for that company, he replied that there are programmes that support new and innovative systems, but this case would not be eligible for such support.
I wonder if we should not be looking again at our industrial policy.
The letter from Commissioner Mandelson to Mel Dando, one of the trade union officers involved, looks at the problems that we have encountered with the policy at the plant in Kansas, as regards declaring a tax holiday and suspending environmental regulations.
Mr Mandelson points out that the measures, in the form of tax exemptions, appear to be subsidies but do not fall into the prohibited category.
He then goes on to point out that there are no provisions in the WTO agreements that cover environmental dumping and says that, therefore, these measures appear not to be in breach of current WTO rules.
My question to the Commission will be this: if there are no provisions in the WTO agreements that cover environmental dumping, why not?
What is the Commission doing to ensure that we have provisions to cover environmental dumping?
This incident, affecting, as Mr Ford said, perhaps not a huge number of jobs when viewed on a European scale, but a very large number of jobs when viewed on the scale of a small industrial town like Bridgwater, is one that could be replicated right across the European Union if we found that the policy of different States in the United States of America in this area was about to rob us of jobs in this way.
This is the ugly face of capitalism.
We have here a buy-out of a company by a consortium dedicated to asset-stripping and to returning as much money as possible to the investors without looking at the general health of our society and our industries.
It is the kind of case on which the Commission should take action.
I hope that Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner here tonight, and Commissioner Mandelson will raise this case with the Americans and see what we can do to get action to save the plant in Bridgwater and to save potentially many other hundreds of thousands of jobs across the European Union that could be affected by this kind of development.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to debate fiscal and environmental dumping with regard to British Cellophane in Bridgwater.
British Cellophane has had a long and honourable history spanning more than 50 years.
It has an enormous background of industrial muscle and might in Bridgwater. Bridgwater is also one of the leading industrial towns in the West Country.
Over the long term, the workforce at British Cellophane has been reduced but it has always had an outstanding productivity level, an outstanding relationship with its employees and has given outstanding help to the town at all levels.
Cellophane is a massively important commodity throughout the world.
British Cellophane produces approximately 60Â 000 tonnes per year. The commodity has been produced in highly productive, motivated and profitable plants.
In the past few years the company has changed dramatically: it was bought by Candell Investments and I should like to talk about three of its five plants.
Two plants are in Britain and one is in America.
The two in Britain are productive, motivated plants, one in the north and one in Bridgwater.
I wish to dwell on the third plant in Kansas.
Kansas State legislators have spent an enormous amount of money to keep the plant there.
We are talking about millions of dollars, not a few hundred thousand.
They voted publicly to give public money to the plant and they have also been given a five-year environmental holiday to further undermine British Cellophaneâs prospects.
It does not stop there.
The plant is unproductive and does not make a profit.
Why would one give money to a plant that does not make a profit and is not productive, whether it is in China, Australia or America?
Three hundred UK jobs in a profitable, highly productive plant are being put under threat by a plant that does not meet the WTO rules.
Every year British Cellophane puts approximately GBP 20 million into the economy from wages, direct and indirect goods.
We are talking about a profitable and highly productive plant.
It has done everything to change and it out-performs the Americans by far.
It produces more and better quality goods.
The plant has done everything to stay profitable.
We should not allow it to be sacrificed simply because an American plant can get away with something that we cannot.
The subsidies are unfair trade, involve unfair dumping and the use of unfair competition against profitable plants.
We should not allow this to happen.
If this is a world of free trade, the World Trade Organization should be asked to consider this matter.
I ask the Commission to take this up urgently.
There is cross-party support for this.
I believe that the WTO should act. I urge the Commission to take up the case.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by dealing with the specific case at issue.
The Commission is aware of the plans for the closure and possible relocation of the Innovia Films plant in Bridgwater and we have asked the services to examine whether the measures taken by the State of Kansas constitute a breach of WTO rules.
We will also explore, in cooperation with the Member States concerned, whether any other remedy is available under international law in this situation.
I wish to add that my own political judgement with regard to this case is absolutely the same as that expressed by honourable Members in the debate.
If US State aid rules apply in Kansas, that is certainly a practice that is not allowed here.
However, fortunately or unfortunately, the State of Kansas is not part of the European Union.
In particular this involves looking at the possibilities offered by the complaint procedure in the context of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, which state that OECD enterprises should refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated in the statutory or regulatory framework related to environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial incentives or other issues.
It should be noted, however, that these guidelines and the recommendations that may result from the complaint procedure are not legally binding.
As regards the WTO, the Commission is evaluating the compatibility of the measures taken in Kansas with the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures.
These rules, while in principle allowing WTO members to decide on their own fiscal regime, prohibit tax exemptions when they directly promote exports.
That is the case that we have to examine: whether the measures in Kansas directly promote exports.
If so, they run against WTO rules.
I wish to add a few general remarks on the role of the WTO in the area of environmental policy.
Let me first stress that WTO members have explicitly recognised the importance of working towards sustainable development and making international trade and environmental policies mutually supportive.
The European Union plays a particularly active role in this respect, but the work is not complete.
WTO members are free to choose their own environmental policy at national, regional and, in the case of multilateral environmental agreements, global level.
This also implies that any action against illegal breaches of existing regional, national or international environmental legislation should be taken at those levels.
The appropriate answer to âenvironmental dumpingâ at global level is, therefore, to enhance environmental governance by means of legally binding instruments such as multilateral environmental agreements, and the Commission is active in that field.
As regards the other question raised, about harmful tax competition in the European Union, all EU Member States are committed to the code of conduct on business taxation.
The code aims at combating specific tax measures that affect, or may affect, the location of business .
Almost all the harmful tax measures identified following a peer review process have been or are in the process of being removed.
More generally, the Commissionâs tax policy aims at promoting the principles of the code towards third countries in order to tackle harmful tax competition on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
In this respect, the Commission has already included a reference to the principles of the code in several international agreements with third countries and aims at including this reference in future agreements.
Furthermore, the Commission supports the OECD efforts to remove harmful tax practices.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow the four Members who have already spoken by addressing to you another question on the problem under discussion.
It was in 1992 that we joined with the United States in adopting the New Transatlantic Agenda, which provides for various dialogues, some of which work well, and others less so.
We know that the business dialogue works very well, as does the consumer dialogue, but we have been noticing for many years that there are serious problems with the dialogue that is meant to bring employees together â the labour dialogue, as it is known.
There are various reasons for this; to some degree, it has to do with the different traditions in America and Europe.
The next summit is scheduled to be held in the summer, and, as a matter of urgency, I would ask you, when preparing it, to get together again with the Council and, as a Commission, to consider what you can do to support this dialogue.
Although this is something that should be left to the trade unions, I have learned from experience that it will be necessary to review what we in the various European institutions can do to really keep this dialogue going or, perhaps, to resurrect it.
I would have thought this example would be a good one for you to refer to in an attempt to revive this dialogue.
I would, moreover, recommend that you raise the problem in the context of the business dialogue and talk to the businesses themselves in order to see whether it might not be possible to come to an understanding, so that the OECD guidelines to which you have referred are actually implemented in practice, rather than being set aside by various states â in this case Kansas, although any other might well have done likewise.
That strikes me as enormously important, for, in a global context and with competition at international level certainly not becoming simpler, but rather more difficult, it is only right that the states operating within the OECD framework should actually play the game by the rules.
Perhaps you might say where you stand on this point, and say whether or not you can consider including this as an item for discussion.
If I might turn to the second point you addressed, that the Commission and the Council â like, I would add, this Parliament â have for many years been pressing for more intensive discussion within the WTO, and for it to include labour standards, environmental standards and social standards, let me say that it would appear to me to be right and proper â although I know it will be very difficult â to return to this issue during the current round, and I can assure you that this House will again refer to it in a resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to discuss this question by the Greens and, potentially punishable offences against the WTO apart, to address a couple of questions to its author.
Mr Juncker, your question expresses the fear that the removal of barriers to trade might result in tax dumping.
In it, you also make reference to subsidies undermining the multilateral trade system.
Do you not believe that there is a connection between high taxes and high subsidies?
Do you assume that, in a world without tariffs â which are barriers to trade â and the competition to which they give rise, social and environmental standards would invariably and inevitably fall?
As you never fail to mention competition in the same breath as words like âharmfulâ and âdumpingâ, are you afraid of it?
What does actually bring prosperity and jobs â the exchange of goods and services in open markets without barriers to trade or, instead, more fragmented markets with high barriers to trade?
Do you, like me, take the view that only a competitive national economy is in a position to comply with high environmental standards?
If so, should we then not abandon, once and for all, the constant pretence that low taxes and open markets amount to the same thing as low environmental and social standards?
I would also be interested to learn what the Commissioner thinks about this.
Â Â  â Good evening, Mr President.
It is a pleasure to have a compatriot in the chair for this eveningâs sitting.
In the case before us, a British cellophane factory has been enticed to relocate to the State of Kansas, purely on the basis that that State has derogated fiscal and environmental legislation.
Unfortunately, this is not an exception to the rule, because the rule itself has encouraged such action.
This case, in common with the Alstom case that was discussed earlier, clearly illustrates a well-known problem, namely that of relocations for reasons of anti-social or anti-environmental competition.
I could give you similar examples in Portugal.
Indeed, the day before yesterday, workers came to Strasbourg from Yasaki Saltano, a firm that has two plants in Portugal, and 10 altogether in Europe.
This Japanese multinational has employed 7Â 500 people in Portugal, yet today it employs half that number.
Just yesterday the board issued the threat that without further government support 500 more workers would be laid off in August.
It should be pointed out that this company was given land and infrastructure free of charge, that it had enjoyed Community funds for years, that the level of work-related diseases, such as arthritis, among its workers is abnormally high and that this is the argument used by the board not to issue redundancies but to persuade the sick to resign.
Mr President, this lie has to come to an end some time.
It is sad to see the Commissionâs impotence in such cases, which shows that it has given up.
The United States and the EU call one day for the end of protectionism at the World Trade Organisation, only the next day to reinstate it or establish comparable benefits based on unfair criteria.
The breaking of protectionism must be accompanied by higher levels of social rights and tighter environmental controls.
This is the alternative to the neoliberal order in which there will be no more Kansases to complain about.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I note with satisfaction that we have this evening debated issues that really ought, in fact, to be debated and decided upon in this House.
It is, unfortunately, all too common for MEPs to devote themselves to debates and decision-taking that, according to the principle of subsidiarity, do not belong in this House.
In this case, the matter is clear, however.
The EU has a common trade policy.
Parliament therefore has strong reasons for monitoring compliance with the rules governing global free trade.
Such a system is the most important way of increasing prosperity in both poor and rich countries, but the system presupposes that individual countries and trading blocks will not engage in protectionism, which often takes the form of customs duties and other trade barriers.
It may also take the form of subsidies or special rules for certain forms of production, designed to attract or retain activities that would otherwise not cope with international competition.
Such issues are regulated by the WTO.
I agree with the other speakers in the House who have demanded that the Commission as soon as possible take measures against countries and EU Member States that breach the WTOâs regulations.
It is, however, important to be aware of the fundamental difference between permitted and prohibited instruments, or between production-friendly policy and dumping.
It is not prohibited to choose a generally low level of tax in order to promote growth.
What is forbidden is to favour selected companies or industries with tax benefits.
That is called tax dumping.
It is also permitted for a country to have relatively low ambitions in terms of environmental policy during a phase when the country is poor and has to give priority to growth.
That is what todayâs rich countries did when they were poor.
What is prohibited is to allow special dispensations from current environmental requirements with a view to favouring individual companies or industries.
That is known as environmental dumping.
I propose that, in its analysis and in the measures it takes, the Commission clearly distinguish between legitimate rules for promoting growth and prosperity, and illegitimate dumping methods.
Â Â  . Mr President, in view of the fact that Commissioner Verheugen has stated that the Commission is investigating whether the subsidies are directly promoting exports â which would be illegal â I should like to ask him, on behalf of the Commission, to write to the company to ask it to defer its decision on the plant closure, which is due within 15 days, until that has been established.
Â Â  . I shall pass on that question to my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who is in charge of the file.
I should like to say to Mrs Mann that I take note of and fully accept the recommendations.
I will ensure that the issue is discussed at European-American business round tables and in other fora.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission on discrimination against workers and companies from the new Member States in the EU internal market by Mr Protasiewicz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (B6-0173/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, in less than three weeksâ time it will be a year since the enlargement of the European Union.
For millions of citizens of Central Europe, enlargement meant the fulfilment of dreams about a common Europe governed by fair principles and with equal opportunities for all.
In preparation for enlargement the new countries opened their markets wide, allowing in a flow of Western companies, goods, services and workers.
This often took place against a background of heated internal debate and despite strong protests by many groups, mainly those representing workers.
The latter feared the loss of their jobs and argued strongly that national markets should be protected from unfair Western competition.
Nonetheless, we felt that above all membership of the European Union meant being part of the common market in which freedom to undertake economic activity anywhere on the territory of the Union is guaranteed.
At the same time, we were convinced that the European treaties laid down fair rules for all actors, regardless of their country of origin.
Unfortunately, over the last 11Â months there have been numerous instances of discrimination against entrepreneurs from the new countries wishing to undertake economic activity in some of the countries of the so-called old Union, and also against their employees.
The most blatant cases of discrimination are taking place in the Netherlands, Austria and Italy.
The legal systems of those countries allow companies and workers to be treated differently depending on whether they come from the so-called old Fifteen or the new Ten.
A specific example is the requirement imposed on the latter to apply for permits for expatriate workers even before the start of economic activity.
This is a very time-consuming procedure that can take up to six weeks in Austria, and the requirement is imposed only on companies and workers from the new countries.
Economic entities from the old Fifteen are not required to present applications of this kind.
Instead, they are simply required to notify the relevant authorities and provide them with a single sheet of information and a list of expatriate workers.
They can begin to provide services immediately without any unnecessary delay.
Should the authorities wish to undertake checks, these may take place whilst work is in progress, without interfering with the companyâs economic activity.
This is a clear example of discrimination sanctioned by national law, resulting in violation of the conditions for fair competition in the common Union market.
There are also a number of other countries where although there are no formal discriminatory provisions, the administration and officials behave in such a way that, in practice, it is impossible for companies from the new Member States to exercise their activity freely.
I have with me a collection of complaints from entrepreneurs who received particularly unfortunate treatment, even though they had complied with all the formal requirements.
The kind of treatment both the owners of the firms and their workers were subjected to whilst their work was in progress includes having their hands stamped, being handcuffed, having dogs set on them and even being arrested for no good reason.
I am sorry to have to say that Germany and France are countries where this kind of treatment is imposed all too often.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner what action the Commission intends to take to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Treaty regarding equal treatment for companies and citizens?
Has the Commission already undertaken an audit of the provisions in Member States with a view to ensuring a level playing field for economic entities from the new Member States?
If so, what was the outcome?
If not, when will this audit of legal provisions and practices be undertaken so as to prevent discrimination?
I should also like to draw attention to a view shared by a large number of my fellow Members.
We feel that unless the Commission becomes actively involved in combating discrimination against companies and workers from the new Member States, we shall fail to achieve the economic objectives identified in the Lisbon Strategy.
In conclusion, I should like to say that I trust the European Commission is aware of this situation.
Commissioner Verheugenâs presence in the House today in his capacity as Vice-President of the Commission gives me reason to hope that this is indeed the case.
Â Â  . Mr President, if there is anyone in this House who knows what the problems in the new Member States are like, it is I, having spent five years being responsible for enlargement, so you do not need to tell me about them.
Turning to the case to which you have referred, the Commission has received complaints in respect of one particular Member State, which is accused of breaching Community law by requiring work permits for workers from the new Member States sent or to be sent to this Member State to perform services.
The Commission has therefore taken the necessary action against this Member State, has sought to bring infringement proceedings against it, and will ensure that the situation is corrected.
The Commission knows nothing of any other complaints.
There have not, in particular, been any complaints relating to freedom of establishment, to which you have referred, and which was not implemented as recently as 1Â May 2004, but rather as long ago as the mid-1990s.
If you know of cases of discrimination in connection with the freedom of establishment, the Commission would be obliged if you would communicate that information.
The only official complaints received by the Commission have to do with freedom of establishment in one single Member State, and the necessary action has been taken to deal with it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of equal treatment for entities from the various Member States is one of the cornerstones of the European Union.
We are today discussing cases of discrimination against entrepreneurs and workers from the new Member States on the markets of old Europe.
I should like to query if it is appropriate for the French administration to ask Polish entrepreneurs wishing to provide services in France in what way they think they are better and can therefore justify being allowed to operate in France.
I have undertaken a good deal of research, and have found that in most cases entrepreneurs from SMEs in the new Member States rarely complain to the relevant authorities about the discrimination they have experienced.
These entrepreneurs have only limited resources at their disposal and make a conscious decision not to engage in lengthy and expensive legal proceedings.
They are simply afraid of further persecution by the host countries, given that the average entrepreneur is in a very weak position when pitted against the whole apparatus of the state.
One of the tasks entrusted to us by our constituents is coming to the defence of the victims of discrimination.
We are therefore guardians of the fundamental principles of the Union, and would do well to ask ourselves what condition Europe might come to be in if discrimination is not combated first.
There are two issues of crucial importance to the future of the Union.
One is the Lisbon Strategy and the other is the draft services directive.
We all understand that discrimination paralyses the internal market and prevents it from operating properly, which in turn makes it impossible to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is therefore in all our interests to ensure that the internal market really does become a single economic entity free from discrimination.
This cannot be achieved if numerous national barriers are erected.
In conclusion, I should like to point out that the instances of discrimination on the internal market discussed in the House today are regrettable obstacles to our joint efforts to integrate.
If we allow these obstacles to remain, we shall all have to suffer the consequences.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would need two hours to detail the problems that migrant workers face coming into and working in Ireland.
We have the reputation of being one of the most generous countries in terms of allowing access from the ten new Member States.
That is true.
