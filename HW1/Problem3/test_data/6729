The area is not without problems, but the EU as interested and friendly outsiders can assist in dialogue and progress, so I am happy to support today's proposal and would be happy to support more.
- Commission legislative programme (2006) (RC-B6-0636/2005)
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the European Parliamentâs joint resolution on the Commissionâs work programme for 2006.
We believe that the Commissionâs main priorities should be to develop the internal market, strengthen the EUâs foreign and security policy, continue with its work on the planned enlargement and make efforts to strengthen the EUâs competitiveness.
We are, however, doubtful about certain parts of the resolution in which the principle of subsidiarity is not respected, for example those parts in which a desire is expressed to overhaul maternity and paternity leave in the EU and to increase efforts in the sphere of tourism.
Â Â  . I fully support this Resolution, especially Para 9 which stresses the need to take full account of the quality of public services in completing the internal market; calls for a framework directive on services of general interest; insists that the single market can only be developed in a context of fair competition, fighting social dumping and promoting cohesion; calls on the Commission to contribute to the fight against the ârace to the bottomâ approach in all fields, including in relation to maritime re flagging.
We must listen to the 100,000 people who took to the streets in Ireland last week to express their anger at the 'Race to the Bottom' threatened by the actions of the Irish Ferries company and the Bolkenstein Directive.
100,000 people expressed their anger and made it clear they will not accept a European Union based on the lowest common denominator in social, employment, and public service provisions.
I call on Commissioner McCreevy as a matter of urgency to reintroduce Manning of Ferries Directive, unblock the Temporary/Agency Workers Directive and fundamentally amend the Bolkenstein Directive.
Â Â  . This resolution, which has regrettably been adopted, albeit by a very narrow margin, is one of Parliamentâs most damaging resolutions in support of current Community policy.
There are key aspects of the resolution that are tantamount to an attack on fundamental democratic rights and the Treaty on European Union. A case in point is the call for âa properly coordinated interinstitutional campaign and strategy facilitating the rapid adoption of the European Constitution based on the existing draft Constitutional Treatyâ, which disregards the ânoâ votes delivered by the people of France and the Netherlands in referendums on the so-called European Constitution.
Similarly alarming is the call for improved computer systems and increased use of biometric data, for example the Visa Information System (VIS) and the Schengen Information System (SIS II), for the purpose of reducing immigration, and for repressive measures and the erosion of fundamental rights to be stepped up, on the pretext of combating terrorism.
In the area of internal market and monetarist policies, the emphasis is on the all-too-familiar tools of neoliberalism, namely liberalisations purporting to increase competitiveness, the integration of the financial services markets and the enlargement of the euro zone.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues support calls for a renewed focus in achieving the Lisbon objectives, to stimulate growth and employment and to give sufficient resources to framework programmes on research, competitiveness and innovation.
The completion of the internal market should be a priority and the initial steps taken by the Commission to withdraw unnecessary regulation are welcomed.
However, we are concerned that there are continued attempts to facilitate the rapid adoption of the EU Constitution and implement legislation for an "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice" which we do not support.
Â Â  . â The Commissionâs legislative programme for 2006 illustrates a concept of Europe that is now obsolete:
- an antidemocratic Europe, following an underhand âplan Dâ to force on us a constitution that the French and Dutch rejected;
- a Europe without borders, open to worldwide immigration, allowing, in particular, the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants regularised in Spain and Italy to settle in other Member States;
- an antisocial Europe, which, by implementing the ultraliberal Lisbon Strategy, causes our businesses to relocate and dismantles our employment law (the Bolkestein directive, which MrÂ Chirac promised in April was dead and buried, will once again be put to a vote here in Parliament);
- a Europe with no identity, which, by opening accession negotiations with Turkey, an Asiatic, Muslim country, will soon be European only in name;
- an antinational Europe, dissolving our nations into a bureaucratic superstate.
Today, our people need not the umpteenth legislative programme, but a different Europe, founded on the principles that identify it: the freedom of its nations and the spirit of its civilisation.
- Human rights in Tunisia (RC-B6-0646/2005)
Â Â  . The European Union must publicly condemn the breaches of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia so that Tunisian public opinion is aware of it.
The Tunisian Government is quite happy engaging in backroom diplomacy to brush under the carpet the increasingly worrying situation of the 401 political prisoners, the five political parties not permitted to speak freely to the Tunisian citizens, and the large number of associations that cannot operate freely.
These lawyers, journalists, workers and intellectuals are being repressed and gagged.
Let us, for once, address the people of Tunisia directly to tell them that the European Parliament will not fall into the trap set for it by MrÂ Ben Ali by continuing to accommodate a dictatorship that is no longer even attempting to disguise itself.
Â Â  . The Community budget provides for funding and specific programmes to protect consumers, for example by supporting organisations or bodies involved in protecting the interests of consumers and promoting the involvement of such organisations and bodies in the Community-level decision-making process.
We therefore feel it is only right that the new Member States should fully enjoy the same support for their activities and that high levels of consumer protection should be promoted in all EU Member States.
This is especially important in the new Member States in view of the amount of deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation that their economies have undergone in the so-called transition process to market economics and now that they have joined the Union there are hardly any consumer protection bodies.
That being said, we do not share the rapporteurâs underlying philosophy regarding the concept of âconsumerâ and consumer protection, from the perspective of completing the internal market, promoting the entrepreneurial spirit, and attempting to create a âconsumerâ culture in those countries via a market economy approach.
Such a philosophy severs the cultural roots that were in place before the transition, when a personâs value was not measured by their capacity for consumption.
Nowadays, the focus has shifted towards âsellingâ that value and towards promoting the kind of consumerism that fuels the contradictions inherent in capitalism.
Â Â  According to the rapporteur, the general public and businesses in the ten new Member States are unaware of the rights and opportunities offered by the harmonised EU legislation on consumer protection.
We fully share the view that consumer protection is a significant issue. We are, however, critical of quite a few of the measures proposed in the report, for example the following:
â the fact that the rapporteur recommends that consumer awareness be given higher priority in school curricula throughout Europe, this being something we believe should be decided on at national level, and not by the EU;
â the fact that the Commission is to conduct a âstrategic information and education campaignâ to prepare consumers for the introduction of the euro in the new Member States;
â the fact that the Commission is to prepare a special strategy for promoting the development of a consumer culture in the new Member States, something that can be implemented independently by individual Member States;
â the fact that consumer organisations are to obtain extensive EU funding, without the report specifying the relevant amounts;
â the fact that the new Member Statesâ governments are called on to fund the formation of consumer organisations, something that we believe should be decided on at national level.
We regret that the European Parliament is again using a very important political issue to introduce new budget headings and unduly far-reaching EU measures.
Â Â  â () I voted in favour of this report because I regard it as very important for all regions that are unable to initiate their own development measures without financial support.
I myself live in one of the poorest regions of Europe â the PreÅ¡ov region â where GDP is less than half the European average.
I therefore welcome the fact that job creation and the promotion of growth are to be viewed as the paramount aims of state aid.
From the standpoint of cohesion, it is very important to adopt transparent criteria that allow all disadvantaged regions to receive financial aid.
The inclusion of regional governments in the distribution of state aid is a very positive step, because this guarantees the transparent allocation of these funds.
In connection with this report, I would like to express my doubts regarding the British proposal for the Financial Perspective, as it disregards one of the basic objectives of the EU â the levelling of regional differences.
Â Â  This report addresses the issue of state aid to enable neglected regions to develop.
The June Listâs position is that regional policy can be conducted at national level so long as it does not distort competition in the internal market.
Â Â  . We are very disappointed that most of our proposals were not approved, not least those concerning the problems of relocations and the protection of public services, on which state aid has an impact.
As regards the former, the report does not put forward one single practical proposal, and the latter is not even mentioned.
We welcome the fact that, despite the Commissionâs original proposal with regard to regional state aid, those regions affected by what is known as the âstatistical effectâ will retain the same regional state aid status as the convergence regions until 2013, without any review period.
This alone does not, however, lead us to change our minds and vote in favour.
We continue to vote against because Parliament has accepted the Commissionâs proposed policy on state aid, which, on the pretext of tackling the problem of unfair competition, is aimed at reducing the amount of aid and at placing restrictions on the Member States by specifying what aid can be granted horizontally.
Let us be clear that the Commissionâs proposed new reform of state aid provides for substantial reductions to the scope in which state aid can be granted.
This reform would, to all intents and purposes, go against the idea of a public policy that places state aid at the forefront of support for âcohesionâ countries as they strive towards regional development.
Â Â  .
In its initial draft, the European Commission planned to ban State aid to business in France as of 2007.
This draft, like that of the Bolkestein directive, is part of the implementation of a highly competitive internal market that was agreed during the Barcelona summit, where France was represented by MrÂ Chirac and MrÂ Jospin.
MrÂ Koterecâs report introduces a number of improvements: France will retain the option of granting State aid, but that aid will be considerably reduced.
European regional policy, which is largely paid for by French taxpayers, is therefore not content with being more and more stingy towards our regions (the French-speaking region of Hainaut has lost the structural funds under Objective 1 as a result).
By preventing France in future from having an independent industrial policy, it is compromising the very existence of hundreds of businesses, which, in the absence of targeted public aid, will either have to relocate their activities or to shut up shop.
That Europe, a Europe which manufactures unemployment and which is antisocial because it is antinational, was rejected by our fellow citizens on 29Â May.
They want a different Europe, a Europe that, in respecting national sovereignties, will respect employment.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrÂ Koterec on his outstanding report on the role of state aid as a tool of regional development.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my support for the rapporteurâs opinion that in the new programming period the ceilings of aid intensities applicable to the EUâs outermost regions should be exactly the same as those in force during the previous period (2000-2006).
I also endorse the rapporteurâs view that, in this connection, the status described in Article 87(3) of the European Community Treaty should automatically apply to the outermost regions, which is, after all, laid down in the Treaty approving a Constitution for Europe.
Â Â  . I abstained on the final vote on this report as while many of the inconsistencies in the report were amended in the votes, the report could still do better in terms of clarity and precision.
Many of the amendments of my group were sadly unsuccessful, though would have improved this report, which I believe comes too late in any case in order to influence the thinking of the European Commission on this vital matter.
Â Â  . I am pleased that the Commission listened to the Member States and redrafted their proposal on regional selective assistance (RSA).
I agree that there should be less but better targeted state aids.
However there is still much to be done to ensure that there is flexibility.
Scotland has directly benefited from regional selective assistance securing thousands of jobs and helping many companies successfully develop.
We have to allow this to continue.
- EU development policy (RC-B6-0653/2005)
Â Â  . I voted for the joint resolution on the issue of extraordinary rendition.
No one can yet be convicted in Europe of illegal activity, but the weight of evidence suggests that European law has almost certainly been breached in a number of Member States and applicant countries.
The work of the Council of Europe's rapporteur on the subject supports that conclusion.
I support the establishment of a temporary committee, but we have to be careful not to bolt the stable door after the horse has bolted.
The particular circumstances around extraordinary rendition will have been investigated to death by the time our committee is established.
Rather, we need a wider investigation that looks at causes rather than symptoms; an investigation that looks at protecting democracy at home and abroad that looks at how we can fight terrorism protect human rights.
Â Â  We share the view that it is very important to make EU aid effective and that coordination of the existing aid efforts is needed.
It is encouraging that the resolution addresses these aspects of development policy.
The June List believes, however, that the EU should not concern itself with aid issues.
This important area must mainly be dealt with at national level.
Measures must be coordinated internationally within the framework of existing international organisations that possess legitimacy and experience.
We are critical of certain wordings in the resolution, such as the wording to the effect that the EU should step up its present aid efforts.
For the above-mentioned reasons, we have chosen to abstain from voting on this issue.
Â Â  . The British Presidency has pulled off the historical feat of achieving unanimity in terms of the criticisms levelled at it.
All Member States and political parties are unanimous in recognising that there has been no tangible result.
In June, Prime Minister Blairâs rhetoric of reform aroused great expectations; six months on and nothing has been achieved.
The negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective are a telling example of the way in which the United Kingdom has conducted its Presidency.
Jack Straw showed tremendous insensitivity when he described the British proposal as disciplined, fair and geared towards enlargement and greater economic competitiveness, while vehemently criticising the Luxembourg proposal as unrealistic and unbalanced.
The response to this could hardly have been clearer.
The Luxembourg proposal could have lasted the pace, having enjoyed the support of 22 of the Member States, whereas the British one has been rejected by every Member State and every political group in Parliament.
The United Kingdom has dug itself into a hole and has no idea how to extricate itself.
The European Project and the citizens who believe in it have no truck with the kind of national self-interest thus far demonstrated by this Presidency.
- The CIA and the illegal transportation of prisoners (RC-B6-0649/2005)
Â Â  MrÂ President, we abstained on the joint resolution on the covert transport of prisoners suspected of Islamist terrorism by the CIA.
Without wishing to take a position on the facts, we feel that, whilst protests must be raised against such practices, assuming they have indeed occurred, those protests should come from the governments of the Member States, some of which are allies of the United States.
However, we also feel, and I would like to state this quite clearly, that this situation is not right.
The law exists, and it also protects those who break it in the most shameless way, by which I mean terrorists.
It is completely contrary to our traditions for people to be detained with no access to the outside world and no opportunity to defend themselves.
One of two things is true: either those detained by the United States are considered to be prisoners of war and have to be treated as such, for example receiving regular visits from the Red Cross and being freed at the end of hostilitiesÂ âÂ I am thinking in particular of the prisoners of war captured in AfghanistanÂ â or they are considered to be criminals under ordinary law by virtue of the actions of which they are accused and can therefore be defended by lawyers, have the opportunity to defend themselves and be told the charges against them.
That is the cornerstone of our civilisation.
We must not let terrorism destroy our basic values!
Â Â  . It is absolutely vital that the European Parliament supports the proposed establishment of a Committee of Inquiry to investigate prisoner abuses in alleged CIA-operated prisons, and secret flights over EU.
Europe must stand up to the Bush administration which seems to see us as 'client states' who will rubber-stamp their every excess.
It is ridiculous that the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, seems to expect us to tolerate their excesses on the premise that their actions may save European lives.
I expect it is also the case that European security strategies will save American lives - but neither they nor we should do so using torture.
I fully support my Socialist Group's demand that this whole matter be investigated by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry.
That Committee must also be mandated to investigate the whole issue of protection of human rights and democratic transparency in the context of the fight against terrorism.
I hope that all MEPs endorse the demand now being made by Socialist MEPs and agree to the Committee of Inquiry being established immediately.
Â Â  The resolution addresses a serious issue; but what, in this situation, are speculation and loose assertions, and what are facts?
We welcome a special committee of inquiry in the European Parliament.
Any inquiries in search of the facts of this matter are welcome.
Various political groups are now, however, trying to play politics with this issue.
We think there are not enough facts to enable us to express a definite view one way or the other.
The European Parliament has, as usual, been late in considering amendments and motions for resolutions in plenary.
In this situation, we have therefore tried to avoid adopting unduly sensitive positions until the facts of the case are known.
We merely wish to express our definite view that cooperation within the intelligence sphere falls within the area of competence of the Member States and is something that they themselves can decide on in the context of bilateral and multilateral relations.
Â Â  . More and more facts are coming to light about the US security services and agencies, such as the CIA, illegally kidnapping people, flying them to Europe, detaining them and then subjecting them to isolation and torture.
These disgraceful and unlawful acts, which violate the most basic rights, deserve forthright condemnation.
This is especially worthy of condemnation because, contrary to what some would have you believe, this is not some isolated incident or a series of unsubstantiated allegations.
Quite the opposite, the reports emerging of this appalling state of affairs are merely the tip of the iceberg of US imperialism, which, under the cloak of the so-called âfight against terrorismâ, rides roughshod over the United Nations Charter and international law, and uses the UN for its own ends.
Although it likes to play with words, the US administration has never denied the existence of the flights, the kidnappings or the illegal prisons.
It is crucial that this appalling situation be thoroughly investigated and that measures be taken to stop such unlawful activities from happening.
Â Â  . I voted as I did on this resolution because, along with many concerned London constituents, I believe there should be an objective investigation of allegations, both of the alleged use of EU countries by the CIA for the transportation of prisoners, and the alleged use of European soil for the illegal detention of prisoners.
Â Â  . The first lesson from the affair around the CIA flights must be to close the US and NATO military bases such as Aviano in Italy, Ramstein in Germany and Kogalniceanu in Romania in the EU and the future member states.
After all, they are the infrastructure for the torture flights.
EU interior commissioner Franco Frattini plays things down, wherever this is possible, and pushes the responsibility back to the member states.
This is all the more dishonest, since the affair quite clearly also has an EU dimension.
The EU, in the security political arena and precisely as far as the so-called struggle against terrorism is concerned, has agreed on a close cooperation with NATO and the USA.
Agreements on secret service cooperation and on the unlimited transfer of information classified secret are part of the âBerlin plus agreementâ, which allows the EU to take military action using NATO capacities.
In February 2003, there was agreed directly with the USA a close cooperation in the transport of suspects.
The scandalous behaviour in this sense is not only that of the US government, but the blame must also rest with the EU officials and the EU governments in the know.
Â Â  . The presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners should be condemned and investigated thoroughly.
I am pleased that the UK Government has stated categorically that it will cooperate fully with the Council of Europe investigation.
Â Â  . Every year Parliament introduces a âset of recommendationsâ in one of its own-initiative reports on EU candidate countries, whereas there is no mention of any âset of recommendationsâ that the Bulgarian people might have for the EU.
We are once again seeing an utterly unacceptable exercise in interference.
For example, Bulgaria is called upon to carry out âsubstantial structural reformsâ, and is then congratulated on its âprivatisation programmeâ.
Naturally, if that be the right word, greater transparency is called for in the âprocesses of public procurement, tendering and contractingâ, much to the delight of the large economic and financial groups in the EU.
It does not stop there, however.
Bulgaria is called upon to introduce âmeasures to bring greater flexibility to the labour marketâ and âto increase mobility of the workforceâ.
The country is also reminded âthat it needs to make increased efforts in all areas of the internal marketÂ âŠ so as to guarantee its effective functioningâ.
Precedence is given to âresolving issues of land ownershipâ, yet who will be keeping an eye on this?
There are other areas that I could mention, but I think these are enough to show the EU âat its bestâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the fact that we voted in favour of the compromise amendment presented last night by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament â to which I personally contributed â even though I believe that this amendment is weaker than the text in Article 21, which we had contributed to defining.
We voted in favour of this amendment for the sake of the children, because we wanted this Parliament to adopt a united, strong and determined stance and send out a message to Romania so that the issue of international adoptions might be successfully resolved.
We do not expect this to happen before Christmas, but we do still hope that it happens so that these children â whose right to a family is a priority, as is decreed by all the legislation in force at international level â can be reunited with their parents.
This is a question of a human right and a fundamental right that Parliament wants to highlight to Romania, because, among the various things that the country must do to comply with the European acquis, it must above all ensure respect for human rights â in this case, the right of children to experience the joy and happiness of a family.
Â Â  . The report before us reaffirms the EUâs desire to see Romania become a Member State on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, but attaches certain conditions to that accession.
The rapporteur expresses his concern at persistent delays in a number of areas, such as improving administrative capacity, combating corruption and implementing the âacquis communautaireâ in certain areas of agriculture, public contracts and the environment.
It is clear to see that these demands are nothing short of interference in Romaniaâs political life, in areas such as the countryâs right to food sovereignty and safety, public contracts and administrative capacity, which should be left to the Romanians to address.
The aim is more to appease the interests of the economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries than to improve the well-being of the Romanian people.
We therefore opted to abstain.
Â Â  . I voted for the Moscovici report on Romania, but I believe that, on some key issues, the Romanian government must make accelerated progress - namely the widespread, institutionalised discrimination against the Roma, clearing up allegations of the use of alleged illegal detention sites and state corruption.
Â Â  . I should like to begin by welcoming Parliamentâs initiative in drawing up this report, as I feel that the role of women in this and other sectors is crucial to the sustainable development of the EUâs economic and social fabric.
As regards this particular report, I am in favour of the proposals put forward to the Commission aimed at fair treatment between the sexes and equal rights at work.
Furthermore, womenâs networks in the fisheries sector in the EU should be set up, and women should be involved in Coastal Action Groups and in the new Regional Advisory Councils.
I also welcome the approach made to the Commission for specific aid to back up the initiatives proposed in Mrs Attwoollâs report.
Â Â  This report recommends far-reaching EU measures aimed at improving the situation of women within, primarily, the fisheries sector.
The June List believes that the EU is a union of values and that women and men should be treated entirely equally and have exactly the same opportunities and rights.
We believe, however, that research projects, programmes of measures, womenâs networks and special professional training should be devised on a national or local basis and not be regulated and controlled from the top by the Commission and the EU.
We have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . Women play a similar role in the fisheries sector and fishing communities as they do in farming communities, which is to support activities relating to catching.
This work comes on top of the work they do in the home, is often unpaid, is potentially damaging to their health and carries no guarantees of social protection.
Women account for only 3% of the workforce in catching, yet there is a much larger proportion of women active in harvesting and aquaculture, which shows that progress has been made in bringing more women into the workforce.
Gender issues continue to take a backseat in this sector, and levels of female involvement in fisheries bodies and associations remain very low.
Against this backdrop, we support the setting up of womenâs networks and associations in the fisheries sector at both local and national level.
These will enjoy Community support and will have the following objectives: to make the role of women in the sector more visible; to increase the involvement of women in the decision-making process on the common fisheries policy; and to draw attention to the need to preserve fisheries as an economic, social and cultural activity that is of key importance to the development of fishing communities in different countries.
Â Â  . Women's role in fisheries is often forgotten and yet women play a pivotal role.
This report gives recognition to women in the fisheries sector and should be wholeheartedly supported.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to the House for the endorsement given to this written statement by some 400 Members.
There has been support across all party and national boundaries for the idea that there should be one telephone number in Europe that children can call in order to express their worries and needs.
In so doing, we are giving hundreds and thousands of disadvantaged children a great big Christmas present, and I hope that the Commission is listening very carefully to this appeal.
I hope that we will not leave it at that, but that the worries and needs of the weakest members of our society will continue to spur us into action.
My warm thanks to all those who have made this commitment and will continue to do so in future.
Â Â  The next item is five motions for resolutions on the human rights situation in Tibet and Hong Kong(1).
Â Â  . â Mr President, my group has serious concerns about human rights in China.
We have regular reports of the continued use of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons with reports of the use of torture.
Those concerns are particularly true in Tibet, where we continue to receive many reports of violations in particular against Buddhist monks and people who follow the Buddhist faith.
As for Hong Kong, we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory.
I would note, however, that in far too many countries in the world the demonstration on 4Â December of tens of thousands of people in favour of such universal suffrage would not have been permitted.
However, we have a problem.
ParagraphÂ 14 of the resolution â on which we have asked for a split vote â invites the Dalai Lama to address Parliament in what would be seen as his capacity as a head of state.
I do not believe it is our place to make such a momentous change to our one-China policy in the middle of an urgency debate.
I personally have met and talked to the Dalai Lama on two occasions.
I have no objection to his being invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs or anywhere else.
However, I and the PSE Group will not be able to support this resolution if that paragraph remains in place.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is unfortunate that we have to keep on drawing the attention of this House to the human rights situation in China, and, much though Europeans would like to see that situation improve so as to enable us to maintain intact and fruitful relations with China, it would appear to have been getting much, much worse recently.
Again and again, we come up against the problem that the Dalai Lama is treated as a separatist, even though he has always explicitly supported the âone Chinaâ policy, does not support any secessionist movements, and even though his own requests for negotiations on autonomy are couched in the most pacific terms.
The second point I would like to make is that monasteries are now being used as places where pressure is exerted not only on monks, but also on the general population, in an attempt to re-educate them, and it is because this sort of thing is unacceptable under any circumstances that I ask you to vote in favour of this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, two months ago we adopted an urgent resolution in this House regarding Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and he still has not been released from detention.
Once again we are here, this time to seek to highlight the âpatriotic educationâ campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries.
Last month five Tibetan monks were arrested in Drepung Monastery.
We hear they have also been tortured in detention. But what is their crime?
Their crime is that they refused to sign declarations denouncing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.
Public education began as a tool of repression in 1996 in China, but it has escalated since 2005.
The Chinese Government is attempting to brainwash the people.
This is not public education, it is a suppression of human rights.
No doubt the Chinese will again say this is an internal matter for China, but the international community cannot sit idly by when peace-loving people are subjected to this kind of treatment.
We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan monk Ngawang Jangchub, who died in October during a âpatriotic educationâ session.
The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights.
If it does not, the least we should do â and I mean the least we should do â is maintain our EU embargo on trade in arms.
Unlike one of the previous speakers, I would like to see the Dalai Lama coming here and addressing Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was at the beginning of October that the 28-year old monk Ngawang Jangchub died in his cell in the Drepung monastery.
His death resulted from his interrogation by cadres of the campaign for so-called âpatriotic educationâ.
The object of this is that critics of the regime should be brought back into line by means of drastic physical and mental re-education measures.
Over 10Â 000 monks and nuns in Tibet have been obliged to undergo brainwashing since 1996, something that constitutes a flagrant breach of freedom of opinion and religion.
The intention is that threats, periods of detention, and torture should induce the inhabitants of monasteries to denounce the Dalai Lama, in writing as an enemy of the state and a separatist.
Mrs Lynn has already described how, on 23 November, Chinese security forces occupied the Drepung monastery near the capital, Lhasa.
When they arrested five senior monastics, 400 monks mounted a peaceful demonstration for their release.
The police and special units responded promptly to this by sealing the monastery off from the outside world for days on end.
Are human rights resolutions adopted by this House a matter of indifference to the Chinese?
It is evidently not enough for them that the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, and the Council should intervene.
Or are they no more than footnotes to the loudly-heralded dialogue between the EU and China?
Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me remind the House of our debate in October, on which occasion we demanded, as a matter of urgency, an improvement in the conditions under which the highly regarded Lama Tensin Delek Rinpoche were being held, which were putting his life at risk, in order to make it possible for him to receive a fair trial.
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, has just published the results of his inspection of Chinese prisons, labour camps and police stations.
He confirms that torture is taking place, and that prisoners and persons regarded as suspect are being mistreated.
The effect of the Chinese system of re-education through work is that people can be sent, without a court having passed sentence upon them, to a camp for up to three years.
That is a manifest offence against their personal integrity and against the dignity of every human being.
Â Â  .Â Â MrÂ President, in OctoberÂ 2005 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Chinese authoritiesâ unjust imprisonment of the Lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche.
This resolution achieved nothing, however, as Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is still being detained and tortured, in spite of his poor state of health.
It merely demonstrated the extent to which human rights are violated in China.
The Chinese authorities are currently implementing a policy of âpatriotic educationâ, and forcing Tibetans to sign declarations in which they reject the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and acknowledge that Tibet is part of China.
Anyone who refuses to sign such a declaration is threatened with persecution and arrest.
As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly, Tibetan monks are at particular risk.
These extraordinary âpatriotic educationâ sessions have already resulted in the death of one monk in unknown circumstances and the arrest of five others.
What is more, the 7Â 000-strong Drepung Monastery has been occupied by the Chinese Special Forces since 25Â November, and hence completely cut off from the outside world.
In view of the situation in Tibet, it is clear that the international community must continue to exert pressure on China to improve the conditions in which prisoners are held and to abolish the use of torture and the death penalty.
In addition, the Tibetan people must be supported in their fight for life and a continued national identity.
It is also worth mentioning in passing that only a dozen or so of the over 3Â 000Â Buddhist monasteries that were once found in Tibet are still in existence.
In the hope that we will finally achieve our goal by adopting yet another resolution, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the Chinese authorities put an immediate stop to such blatant violations of civil liberties.
Â Â  . Mr President, due to time constraints I will make only one comment, a self-critical one, with regard to Hong Kong.
We are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800Â Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing.
To be fair, however, such a system is arguably better than the previous system whereby the ex-British colony was administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England.
I cannot recall the European Parliament passing any resolutions at that time condemning Britain for imposing such an undemocratic system on the people of Hong Kong.
Then again, what right does this House have, even today, to criticise British colonial policies?
It dared not do so in the past, and I expect it would not dare do so now concerning Britainâs occupation of approximately 300Â square kilometres of Cyprus as a colony, where thousands of Cypriot civilians are governed by an administrator appointed by the Queen of England.
Before I become too controversial for my honourable British colleagues, let me finish by saying that in this resolution we call for the setting of a timetable for the election of Hong Kongâs Chief Executive by universal suffrage.
Nevertheless, we should, in the near future, pass a resolution calling for an end to Britainâs colonisation of Cyprus.
Â Â  , . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we can finally be certain that the yeti does not exist, because if it did the Chinese authorities would already have made it sign, as part of their patriotic education programme, a statement describing the Dalai Lama as a dangerous individual, and they would have publicised it.
I consider the Dalai Lama to be a tremendously honourable man and I would be very honoured if he were to come to speak in this House.
More seriously, faced with a dictatorial regime which restricts, imprisons, tortures and kills its people, how can we express our indignation beyond our little debate this afternoon?
Given that, in 30 monthsâ time, the worldâs young people will gather in Beijing for the Olympic Games and that the Chinese Government intends to take advantage of this event to celebrate its pseudo-democratic model, I would modestly suggest that we should allow our athletes to bear a message of peace, democracy and freedom so that they can be the champions of the Tibetan cause, otherwise we will do a great disservice to everyone in that part of the world.
Â Â  , .
Mr President, the British colonial government did not leave behind a parliamentary democratic structure in Hong Kong but, rather, created the expectation that the Peopleâs Republic of China would introduce that system over there.
When Hong Kong was handed back to China, the formula of two systems in one country was devised.
People laboured under the illusion that, for Hong Kong, this would mean that, unlike in the rest of China, a parliamentary democracy on the basis of universal suffrage and a multi-party system could exist.
It was thought that it could thus be a trial area for future developments in the rest of China.
We now know what those two systems come down to: capitalism under the control of the governing party in the largest part of China, and capitalism without that control in Hong Kong.
There is a lack of democracy in both cases.
The situation in Hong Kong, where a small selected group has been given the responsibility of self-government, is of course preferable by far to the situation in Tibet, where violence, intimidation and re-education are the instruments employed by the central authority.
Although my group has not been among the signatories of the resolution, I am prepared to endorse it.
Moreover, I should like to remind you that the Dalai Lama has already addressed this Parliamentâs plenary.
Â Â  , .Â Â MrÂ President, todayâs debate on violations of human rights centres on Tibet.
On 23Â November, officials from the Public Security Bureau closed one of the oldest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on the orders of the Chinese authorities.
They arrested one of the most senior monks, and four others whose fate is unknown.
A policy of âpatriotic educationâ, which amounts to indoctrination, has been introduced in the country in order to boost support for the Chinese Government among the Tibetan monks, and to combat the influence of the exiled Dalai Lama.
Tibet has been brutally occupied by China since 1950.
The Tibetans have not given up their peaceful fight for freedom, however, even though at least one fifth of the countryâs inhabitants have died of hunger, been tortured to death or been executed.
Nearly all of the countryâsÂ monasteries, which once numbered over 6Â 500, are in ruins.
The Holy Father John Paul II reminded us that the seeds of destabilisation, rebellion and violence are inevitably sown when human rights are neglected or even abused.
There is an urgent need to restore peopleâs awareness of the dignity of every human being, made in the image and likeness of God, so that it can be used as a sound foundation for freedom, justice and peace on earth.
The Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China, however, even imposes strict controls on religious practices and places of worship.
It limits the number of monks and uses exile as a punishment, especially for anyone who is not suitably submissive.
Yet notwithstanding the massive scale of the tragedy in Tibet, it is worth noting that the problem of human rights violations, which is an issue that has already been raised in this Chamber, affects the Chinese nation as a whole.
The people of China have been repressed for years, and all manifestations of civil independence in the country are stifled.
There is detailed documentary evidence of the methods and instruments used to inflict torture on prisoners and of the brutal treatment they receive, even if they have merely voiced their discontent.
Such practices are proof of the cruel barbarity that prevails there.
The situation in China in recent times can be described as a highly explosive mixture of Communism and capitalism.
The laws of economics have become the only driving force behind development in the country, and there is no longer any place for human rights or moral standards.
While it may well be the case that those in power are responsible for human rights violations in individual countries, we should not forget that the moral relativism of the Western world is also partly responsible.
Adamant claims are made that this latter promotes human rights, and yet companies from more or less every country in the world find it hard to resist the huge consumer market and the cheap workforce, especially in the âreeducation through workâ camps.
The prospect of enormous profits helps them to shut their eyes to the tragic situation of prisoners, and to the fact that the materialistic civilisation that is emerging is heading for disaster, at the same time creating poverty and hell on earth for some and paradise for the rich.
We are therefore calling for the international community to stop treating China as if it were a giant labour camp and a cheap workforce, and for human rights to be respected not only in Tibet and Hong Kong, but throughout China.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the problems in connection with the persistent violations of human rights in Communist China is the lack of credible, consistent and firm protest from the European Union.
We are always paying lip service to human rights, but we do not act on the basis of what we say.
The European Union and most Member States are more interested in Chinaâs economic potential than in having human rights respected.
Just think of the European Councilâs attempts to lift the arms embargo against China or the way in which European trade missions get in each otherâs way in China these days.
I was also embarrassed when I heard a while ago that the Belgian Government had denied the Dalai Lama access to its territory, because this could be harmful to our contacts with Communist China.
We are currently debating the situations in Tibet and Hong Kong, but we could also debate the threats to Taiwan or the existence of the lao gai concentration camps in China.
It is time Europe sent a strong message, for example by inviting the Dalai Lama to visit this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in China, in particular the detention of monks and closure of monasteries in Tibet, as well as constitutional developments in Hong Kong.
These issues are very high on the agenda of our dialogue with China.
The Commission also welcomes and supports the General Affairs and External Relations Council's conclusions of 12Â December, which voice strong concern over Chinaâs human rights policy â in particular, with respect to the rights of minorities.
On 12Â December, the General Affairs and External Relations Council also approved the Commissionâs negotiating mandate for a new partnership and cooperation agreement with China.
The mandate also stipulates that a partnership agreement with China will contain a standard clause on human rights.
I wish to stress that, for many years, we have not concluded agreements with other parties without such a human rights clause.
As regards Hong Kong, the European Union supports democracy throughout the world as the best means of creating legitimate, stable, accountable and transparent government, of protecting rights and freedom, and of upholding the rule of law.
It supports early and substantial progress towards the ultimate goal of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, as set out in the basic law, in line with the wishes of the people of Hong Kong.
It is important that we maintain pressure on China to work towards universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
As regards the situation in Tibet, the European Union has put Tibet very high on its agenda with China.
It has, in particular, mainly focused its attention on the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
The present situation in the region, which we follow very closely, raises grave concern, especially with respect to the exercise of religious freedom.
We are worried to see that the local authorities have imposed a strict framework setting limits on the exercise of this freedom, and we deplore the recent cases of detention of monks and, in particular, the blockade of the monastery of Drepung in Lhasa.
We hope that a solution compatible with both Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon.
In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative but a peaceful process based on dialogue.
We have called for years, and will continue to call, for the establishment of such a dialogue.
We, therefore, fully support the process which has been taking place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
We firmly believe that only such a direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue.
In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be made subject to any precondition.
On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of the climate of confidence that appears indispensable, if a solution is to be reached.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Russia.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for having made it possible for us to arrive at a joint resolution on the position of NGOs in the Russian Federation.
Consensus is also important because that way it is easier for us to influence the decision-makers in Russia.
As now these are particularly urgent matters, we Social Democrats wanted just to focus on this issue covered in the statement.
The issue is also an urgent one for the Duma, which will return to the matter in five daysâ time.
In the next parliamentary sitting we will be debating the resolution on Chechnya.
We fully agree with Russiaâs human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin that the draft law goes against Russiaâs own constitution.
It also goes against international law.
I hope that Lukinâs opinion carries weight, because he has chaired the European Parliament-Duma joint delegation for many years.
The freedom of NGOs to operate is an essential part of democracy and stable civil society, which the Russian leadership had said it supports.
As a member of the Council of Europe, Russia has committed itself to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and, for example, its plans to restrict freedom of association conflicts with that totally.
Parliament is worried about recent developments in Russia, and now the Duma has an excellent opportunity to contribute to the development of democracy.
It can show that changes can be made.
Obviously we hope that that will be the case.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is alarming to observe the changes in Russian society, with the grossest human rights abuses exemplified by the new law intended to make NGOs dependent on the state, the ongoing repressive measures directed against the former Yukos bosses Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, and by the state of war in Chechnya.
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are being held, contrary to Russian law, in prison camps in Siberia, a long way from Moscow and north of the Arctic Circle, in temperatures of -Â 50Â°.
Lebedev is seriously ill.
Contact with their family members and lawyers has been made extremely difficult; they have no access to information and are not allowed newspapers.
Their defence counsel, Yevgeni Baro and Yuri Schmit, are themselves facing trial next week on a charge of defamation.
The Russian justice systemâs denial of human rights is made all the worse by the ever-tighter restrictions placed on the freedom of the press.
We should be clear in our own minds as to what is going on here and call upon the Council and the Commission to use their influence on Russia to get human rights respected.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is only true and fair to say that in recent years, Russia has, overall, made significant progress towards the respect of human rights, and this we must praise.
Unfortunately, there are still a number of areas where progress is much needed in this vast country, with its very long and unique history and culture, and it must be encouraged to proceed with the outstanding issues, where reform is necessary.
Such an issue is that of NGO legislation.
It is a well accepted fact that NGOs and non-profit-making organisations are often key to developing a strong and well functioning civil society.
Such organisations, ranging from children's charities to consumer groups, are not present in very large numbers in Russia.
It is, of course, a fact that Russia has suffered severely from terrorism in the last few years and public sentiment, expressed through elected representatives, may, when dealing with certain NGOs, especially those in Chechnya, border on the extreme and tend to be unduly legalistic and severe.
Although this may be understandable under certain circumstances, it is not acceptable in terms of proper respect of human rights.
We therefore call on the Russian Duma to listen to our advice and take the necessary time to review and impose the amendments concerned with the legislation, in the light of the recommendations expressed in the Presidential review, the Council of Europe provisional opinion and this resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, for years, the point was driven home in Western Europe that Russia was undemocratic and that a very great deal needed to change there, and, indeed, sweeping changes have taken place in Russia over the past 14 years.
Its economy now resembles Americaâs to a greater degree.
The discrepancies between rich and poor that have come about as a result are now more pronounced than in the European Union.
In the areas of democracy and human rights, the situation is certainly no better than it was in the final years of the Soviet Union under Mr Gorbachevâs leadership, and the oppression in Chechnya outstrips the crimes of Stalin.
Where democracy and human rights are concerned, Russia is continuing a bad tradition.
It is not so much Russia that has changed, as the perception of that nation in the countries of the European Union.
Before, we in Western Europe saw the East, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, as an economic rival and military opponent.
These days, we consider Russia to be an ally and supplier of energy.
According to the former German Chancellor, who is now on Russiaâs payroll, Russia now boasts a flawless democracy.
In those circumstances, it hardly comes as a surprise that there is increasingly less room for independent television stations and that freedom of association and assembly is being curbed.
The citizens are given less and less opportunity to get involved in government policy.
The return to a blemished past is hastened by a law that places non-commercial organisations of citizens under government control and that has the power to suspend their funding and to dissolve them.
This House therefore has every reason to endorse the criticism made by the Council of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Russia remains the largest country in the world and because it is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE it is under greater scrutiny and criticism by the EU in terms of fundamental democratic rights.
It currently enjoys privileges, such as the PCA Agreement, a strategic partnership based on the Four Common Spaces Agreement, and eventual ENPI and EIB funding benefits.
Russia continues to be a democracy, albeit an imperfect one.
However, for some time now, concerns have been expressed that the Kremlin and the , so-called men of power close to President Putin, have been attempting to restrict freedom of the media and NGOs, in particular, where it was felt that they were interfering with Russian strategic interests, such as the bloody conflict in Chechnya, or the strategy of reversing some of the controversial sell-offs of the oil and gas sector in the early 1990s in order to increase the patronage of the state.
A handful of men, such as Khodorkovsky, benefited enormously.
He was convicted of several criminal offences and had his extensive Yukos holdings renationalised.
His controversial trial followed with accusations internationally of political manipulation of the judicial system.
More recently, on 23Â November, the Duma approved the law restricting freedom of association and the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in Russia by imposing fiscal and residency requirements of registration, which the Council of Europe, in a provisional opinion, has seriously questioned as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
However, much to his credit, President Putin has listened to the objections and asked to rewrite aspects of the bill which infringe fundamental human rights and which are not legitimately necessary to fight terrorism, as was mentioned in Chechnya in particular, and money laundering.
I hope reason prevails.
We all wish to see a democratic, European Russia with whom we can all share fundamental common values of basic human rights.
Â Â  , Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution, especially Recital I and paragraphs 8 to 13, which take the broader view of the issue that Mr HorÃ¡Äek and I wanted to see.
It is often the case in these debates that we take up the cudgels against small-time dictators and neglect to address the human rights situation in major states that are of strategic and economic importance to us.
I am glad that we are, today, spelling out how things stand in China and Russia, for if we do not, we run the risk of our economic dependency on them â for it is a regrettable fact that we are economically dependent on them in some areas â causing us to take a one-sided view of human rights or making us blind to the issues at stake.
For years on end, the German Government minimised the importance of such things as the war in Chechnya or the smothering of human rights in Russia, or even passed over them in silence, and when you see the position that the former German Chancellor, MrÂ SchrÃ¶der, has now taken on, you can quickly understand why they did so.
We must take care that Gasprom, the partly state-owned Russian energy giant, does not start to play the sort of role once played by the United Fruit Company in Latin America.
While we must cooperate economically and politically, we must not mince words when telling what is really going on as regards human rights.
I am thinking here not only of the prisoners languishing under unspeakable conditions in Siberia, about whom Mr HorÃ¡Äek has had something to say, but also of the attempt at silencing independent organisations â NGOs, in other words â as successfully as the Russian media already have been.
I am very much obliged to Mr DeÃ for seeing to it that we end up using more renewable energies, for Europeâs dependency on Russian energy is bringing us to the point where we start keeping our mouths shut about things that must not be hushed up.
Â Â  ,.Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to a dangerous trend in Russia.
The public prosecutorâs office and the judiciary in this country are increasingly being used as political weapons by PresidentÂ Putinâs regime.
On 9Â DecemberÂ 2005, the Russian public prosecutorâs office charged the Neftyanoi Bank with money-laundering and tax fraud.
The Bankâs director, Boris Nemtsov, is one of Russiaâs most able liberal politicians, and a key member of the anti-Putin opposition.
This is particularly significant in view of the forthcoming presidential elections, which will be held in 2008 and which will determine the future of democracy in Russia.
In a statement given to my partyâs headquarters for its NovemberÂ 2005 newsletter, MrÂ Nemtsov said that there was a risk that a state-controlled and monopolistic capitalism could be establishedÂ in Russia.
He also expressed his belief that the country is currently undergoing a process of, and I quote, âLukashenkisationâ.
The European Union should waive the requirement for Russian citizens to hold visas before they can enter EU Member States.
The abolition of visas would serve as a guarantee for Russian civil society that the country will become more democratic.
Â Â  ,. Mr President, every normal democracy has what is known as a fourth estate: a collection of critical journalists and citizens, active NGOs and non-profit organisations which, as representatives of civil society, monitor the authorities, the government, the administration and parliament without any constraints or censorship.
Except in Russia, where people or groups, business people and journalists that are too critical of the Kremlinâs and Putinâs policy are gagged.
To top it all, the Russian authorities now also intend to silence domestic and foreign NGOs.
I am delighted that six of the eight groups have managed to table a joint resolution that will allow us to dot the iâs and cross the tâs. It will give people like Mrs Alexejeva and Mr Gari Kasparov a shot in the arm and will also give a boost to the many who are active in NGOs, like Mr Nikitin at Bellona, and to NGOs like Immemorial, Greenpeace, Social Verdict and the Civil Society Contact Group.
It also backs up the words spoken by the previous co-chairman, with myself, of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, Mr Lukin, who emphatically condemns the draft legislation in question.
The resolution before us deserves our overwhelming support.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, democracy and freedom are under threat in Russia.
This is the main thrust of the resolution, which is a response to new rules according to which it will no longer be possible in future to bring any amount of money into the country provided that it is used to support the development of civil society.
The second reason for the resolution is the influence exerted by the government over the majority of media outlets.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Duma will soon adopt a similar resolution on the European Union.
Freedom, and consequently democracy, are after all also under threat here following the adoption of a proposal for the mandatory retention of telephone calls, text messages and emails for the police.
In Italy, PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Berlusconi controls a decisive share of the television market, and indeed of the media market in general.
Foreign owners clearly dominate the media in the Czech Republic, where 80% of the press is in the hands of two German groups.
This constitutes a clear threat to the freedom of information, and the situation is similar in Poland and the Balkan States.
Is noÂ one in the House concerned in the slightest by this state of affairs?
It is my belief that this House will unanimously reject this motion for a resolution once it has given a small amount of thought to the matter.
If it does not, our electorateâs opinion of us will be far from flattering.
Unless, of course, Members of this House have drafted a motion for a resolution condemning media monopolies in EU Member States.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is a shame that we are discussing human rights violations in Russia on a Thursday afternoon.
This is particularly regrettable as we spent a great deal of time debating Tunisia on Wednesday, when all the Members of the House and the media were present.
Freedom of speech and thought is one of the European Unionâs fundamental values, and it is the cornerstone of democracy.
This is reflected in the activities of the hundreds of thousands of NGOs that constitute the third most powerful and influential force in Europe.
Yet it is an unfortunate fact that laws are being adopted in Russia which are alien and incomprehensible to us in Europe.
Russia is moving ever further away from democratic standards, and we cannot stand idly by and watch fundamental rights being denied in a country that has a privileged relationship with the EU.
We cannot remain indifferent in the face of changes that are so blatantly undemocratic.
Russian NGOs will find it more difficult or even impossible to obtain foreign funding.
The new restrictions will apply to as many as 450Â 000Â organisations in Russia, including foreign and international organisations operating in the Russian Federation.
The new law prohibits the activities carried out in line with the rules previously in force by Russian branches and representations of foreign and international organisations.
What this means is that they will have to shut down their current branches, and submit applications to set up new organisations that will be independent of the parent NGOs.
Foreigners who do not have permanent residency in Russia will lose the right to form civil organisations, as well as the right to sit on the boards or be members of such organisations.
Certain Russian politicians have claimed that NGOs are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia, but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy.
The European Union should make known its strong opposition to such a reprehensible attitude, which is symptomatic of the increase in xenophobia among Russiaâs political elite.
The existence of 450Â 000Â NGOs in Russia, and the fact that they are so active, testify to the popularity of this aspect of public and social life in Russia.
The European Union should support this manifestation of civil society.
Â Â  Mr President, although I fully support the proposed resolution, I would just like to point out that the Council and the Commission are applying double standards in respect of the Eastern States.
Here is a concrete example: the widely known and regular violation of human rights in Belarus and Russia.
Russia, furthermore, is engaged in the genocide of a nation, which is something that is not happening even in Belarus.
Nevertheless, the Council and the Commission treat the two States completely differently.
The doors to European Union States have been slammed in Lukashenkaâs face, yet President Putin is welcomed with open arms.
If these double standards are only being applied because of Russiaâs oil and gas, resources that Belarus does not have, then such a policy is immoral, although the European Union is supposed to be the standard-bearer of human rights, as well as moral policy.
I do not believe that the Council and the Commission are unaware of the principles of moral policy; however, these principles should not be sold for oil and gas.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope that this empty Chamber does not reflect our lack of interest in what happens in Russia, however understandable the situation is here on a Thursday afternoon.
What happens in Russia is in our interests; its interests are our interests.
Sadly, the clock in Russia is now being turned back nearly to Soviet times.
There is, at the moment, no independent judiciary, there is no free television, and the political opposition has been totally marginalised.
I will not even talk about what is happening in Chechnya; human life is very cheap there.
Regarding NGOs, what happens to them is another link in this far too long chain of sad events in Russia.
We cannot be the victim of the âNIMBYâ syndrome: not in my back yard. Indeed, it is all in our back yard.
It concerns us all.
Old habits die very hard in the Soviet Union, but we have to help Russia to come back towards democracy and universal values. First of all, it is in the interests of the Russian people: they deserve liberty, democracy and transparent governance.
We also cannot work with a partner who does not adhere to international rules.
We have to help Russia become a confident nation which sees that there is no conflict between strength and a democratic, thriving civil society.
We have to speak with one voice; otherwise, we reduce our position to something insignificant.
We cannot have a good Christmas, we cannot have a good conscience, if we do not see what is happening to our near neighbour.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
It is an undeniable fact that organisations known as NGOs and MPOs have a vital role in our civil society, both in large countries such as Russia, as well as in small countries such as where I come from.
In Russia, the number of the many organisations which exist is around seventy thousand.
Less than three weeks ago the parliament known as the State Duma passed some amendments, through the first reading, which had an impact on these organisations.
One must appreciate the thought both within Russia as well as outside Russia about these amendments which can have an impact on human rights.
However, one must mention that in certain countries there was a small number of these organisations which were abused for illicit and illegal aims.
On the other hand, the amendments proposed by Russia have a negative impact on those organisations known as âbuona fideâ.
On a positive note, the Council of Europe was asked for guidance and even the President of this country, Putin, made some proposals to the new chairman.
To conclude, I would like to say that the solution is not to place these organisations in the same category, but to have the necessary legal tools within the parameters of the European Convention so that those which are not genuine will be identified.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commissionâs view on human rights in Russia.
There are a number of issues which give us cause for concern and which we raise regularly with Russia within the framework of the existing strategic partnership.
Let me begin with Chechnya.
We were glad that the elections took place there on 27Â November, and that they took place without violence.
Given the troubled history of this region that in itself is an achievement.
We hope they will be a step in the process towards peaceful democracy there.
However, there are a number of reports of irregularities, and we expect that these will be properly investigated.
But much more needs to be done if Chechnya is to progress to democratic stability.
Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation, a culture of impunity remains.
It is essential that the authorities fully investigate cases of disappearances and allegations of torture and bring the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, to justice.
Russia should also implement its expressed willingness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Rapporteurs.
It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya is seen to be carrying out his duties impartially and effectively.
I should also express our concern at the evidence of continuing harassment of NGOs including those receiving support from the European Community, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod. This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme.
In that context, I should draw attention to the proposal for amending Russian legislation on NGOs which is currently before the Duma.
We have been concerned that it could make the operations of many NGOs, especially foreign ones, more difficult, and could therefore potentially jeopardise the Commissionâs efforts to help build up civil society in Russia, as well as our humanitarian aid programme in Chechnya.
The amendments have been presented as necessary to enforce Russiaâs right to protect itself from terrorism.
Of course, we respect that right, but action taken must be proportionate and must respect international commitments regarding civil society, notably those relating to the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
My colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner raised these concerns with Foreign Minister Lavrov during the Russian Governmentâs visit to Brussels on 7 December.
He expressed understanding and said that amendments would be made to the bill to address these issues.
We were, therefore, pleased to note that changes to the draft law have now been sent from the presidential administration to the Duma and welcome the prior consultations held with the Council of Europe on the matter.
However, we remain concerned that the present draft law could still lead to constraints on the legitimate activities of NGOs.
We urge the Russian Parliament, therefore, to use the second reading on 21Â December to take the Council of Europeâs opinion fully into account.
We will continue to follow this matter closely, including the implementation of any new law adopted.
Finally, let me say that we want to address these issues in a spirit of cooperation with Russia.
The EU-Russia human rights consultations, which began this year, are now a regular feature of our dialogue and provide an opportunity for frank and open exchanges.
In addition the Commission, as well as being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the North Caucasus through ECHO, has agreed a EURÂ 20Â million programme for socio-economic recovery there â a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region.
We will continue to take all opportunities to contribute constructively to that process.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Ethiopia and new border conflicts.
Â Â  . Mr President, as head of the European Union Election Observation Mission in Ethiopia, I helped to persuade Ethiopian opposition leaders not to boycott the May elections, assuring them that the world and the European Union in particular were watching.
They felt that the electoral process had been set up by the regime not to achieve democracy but to fool the international community.
Despite being elected by the Ethiopian people, they are now in jail.
They have been on hunger strike since 28Â November, face a possible death penalty, and yet are neglected by European leaders. This is in spite of the fact that, in early September, I warned European governments, the Commission, the US Government and the UN Secretary-General that the regime might be planning the selective repression of Ethiopian opposition leaders.
How could European governments fail so miserably those who trusted the European Union, those who fought and continue to fight for democracy in Ethiopia?
How could European and American leaders fail so miserably the Ethiopian people and such an important country: the second most populous in Africa and the headquarters of the African Union?
What message are they sending to all Africans?
How can the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council continue to turn a blind eye to massive human rights violations inside Ethiopia, forgetting how this could lead to another devastating war with neighbouring Eritrea?
How can Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council, continue to allow in his Commission for Africa Mr Meles Zenawi, who is keeping imprisoned and threatening with the death penalty the elected opposition leaders, journalists, human rights and development campaigners and even the Ethiopian representatives of the Global Call to Action against Poverty?
This is the third resolution since July in which the European Parliament, across all political groups, has expressed its deep concern about the situation in Ethiopia.
How can European leaders fail to act upon repeated appeals from this Parliament when the lives of Ethiopian prisoners are at stake?
Â Â  . Mr President, Ethiopia is one of the countries that receives most international economic aid; the European Union alone provides almost $500 million per year.
We cannot therefore remain on the sidelines in view of the events that are taking place in that country, particularly following the brutal and entirely unjustified policy of human rights abuses and mass imprisonment of opposition leaders, human rights activists and NGO workers implemented by the Ethiopian authorities.
The extremely harsh and unjustified repression of people who were protesting against what they believed to be electoral fraud cannot go unpunished.
Firstly, therefore, the European Union must demand of the authorities in Addis Ababa the immediate unconditional release of all political prisoners, as well as the journalists and editors being held.
Secondly, it must be ensured that humanitarian aid, which is still so necessary to the population, is channelled via NGOs and the United Nations and, thirdly, that the maintaining of the arms embargos on the region is guaranteed, as well as strict compliance with the code of conduct on arms exports.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall begin with the Eritrean border.
The Ethiopian Governmentâs decision to move back its forces has been very welcome.
This is a highly tense situation and it is not helped by Eritreaâs eviction of members of the UN mission.
When we were in Edinburgh, the Eritrean Ambassador to the EU told me that Eritrea wanted the situation resolved, but Ethiopia was refusing to take action.
This morning the First Secretary at the Ethiopian Mission to the EU told me that Ethiopia wanted the situation resolved but needed channels of discussion on the process of implementing the boundary commission decision.
If it is fundamentally the case that, despite past animosity, there is now the will for peace on both sides, could the Commission and Council not play a more active role in bringing the two sides together?
Secondly, on the situation inside Ethiopia, the Council will be aware that a cross-party group of us who observed the 15Â May elections wrote to Hilary Benn, the British Secretary of State for International Development, on 23Â November.
We detailed our concern at the loss of life and the human rights abuses which have taken place there since June.
I am told that an answer is awaiting the Ministerâs signature.
This may be the political equivalent of a cheque in the post, but I understand that the Council and Commission are committed to pursing a robust discussion on democracy and human rights issues under ArticleÂ 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
I hope it will indeed be robust and that the option of initiating urgent consultations under ArticleÂ 96 of the Cotonou Agreement will be borne in mind if progress is not forthcoming.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I should like to ask the Commissioner, in connection with the resolution on the situation in Ethiopia, whether the European Commission, or any other aid donor, has suspended aid to Eritrea following the latterâs flight ban on UN helicopters monitoring the situation on the border between the two countries.
This ban is a gross violation of the terms of the truce, and it would only be sensible to take clear action on this matter.
I realise that Ethiopia, all valid criticism notwithstanding, has made more progress towards what we call democracy than its rival in East Africa, but I cannot help but wonder why the authors of this resolution have not called for talks to be held with the descendants of the dynasty that previously ruled the country, and for the restitution of the property of this dynasty and of the old hereditary aristocracy.
It would be only logical to do so, in view of the fact that we have adopted resolutions today calling for the future EU Member States to make such restitution.
Today we have adopted resolutions that call for restitution, but I would ask whether this is not a clear-cut case of double standards.
We are unyielding in our calls for restitution only where Bulgaria and Romania are concerned.
We do not make similar calls in the case of Ethiopia, since it would be all too obvious that they are pointless.
I support the resolutions, but I am astonished that neither the current head of the Imperial Family of Ethiopia or even President Putin will be asked to appear before the European Parliament, even though His Holiness the Dalai Lama was called on to do so in the resolution on Tibet.
I am sure that it is only me that thinks that the European Parliament may well be applying double standards.
Incidentally, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commissionâs response is to the recent adoption by members of the Australian Parliament of a law which curtails civil liberties and which, , allows people to be detained for 14Â days.
Â Â  . Mr President, if you look hard enough on the map of the Horn of Africa, you find a little island of stability called Djibouti.
All around it, the situation is precarious.
Somalia scarcely exists as a state any more; the domestic situation in Eritrea is highly critical, with the opposition suppressed, and in Ethiopia, the situation after the elections is exactly as the EUâs principal observer, Mrs Gomes, has described it.
Not only that, but Ethiopia is subject to the destabilising influence of Eritrea, which we know to be supporting guerrillas fighting in Ogaden, and the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia is still threatening to erupt into open warfare.
Today, here in this House, we are focusing on the domestic situation in post-election Ethiopia, and so the demand we have to make is no vague one: we must call upon the government to desist from deploying disproportionate force to suppress the opposition and the general population, and must release all political prisoners and journalists without delay.
I heard recently that three more had been arrested, so the most up-to-date state of affairs is that 15 journalists are in custody.
The International Red Cross must also be given access to the camps in which so very many people are being held.
The countryâs prime minister has again said that he will not only put the political leaders on trial, but also the 3Â 000 other detainees with them, and that there would be no mercy whatever â not even a Christmas amnesty.
As the Ethiopian Government is quite clearly bent upon confrontation, we call on the European Union to give thought to the possibility of imposing â as we already do against other regimes â targeted sanctions against those in power in Ethiopia, which would, I believe, send out a clear signal.
If these people are no longer permitted to travel to Europe on shopping trips, perhaps it will also dawn on them that they can no longer count on our support, and that we have no confidence that they are leading their country in the right direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, the fact that we, in this House, are already adopting the third resolution on Ethiopia in less than half a year shows how grave and disturbing the situation in that country is.
Heartening though it is that the Ethiopian authorities have set 8Â 000 people at liberty, the figure does demonstrate that mass arrests have taken place, while the government has hitherto always declined to make known either the total number of persons actually detained or the locations at which they were being held.
Our resolution therefore demands that the Ethiopian Government give information as to the total number of persons detained and the places where they are being held, allow access to them by the International Committee of the Red Cross and their families, and ensure that they get legal advice and medical care.
Â Â  .
Mr President, human rights violations in Ethiopia are not a new thing. Nor is condemnation of these violations new.
Twice in 2005 this Parliament passed resolutions on the situation in Ethiopia, and twice we were disappointed by the response.
Recently the Ethiopian ruling regime undertook an alarmingly gigantic crack-down operation against political leaders, human rights defenders, independent journalists, NGO workers and young people voicing opposition to the government in Addis Abba.
Thousands of civilians have been arrested and detained without trial.
About 8Â 000 have now been released, but an unknown number still remain in custody.
We are also most concerned about troop movements on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean sides of the border.
The fear of a new war is now real and the devastating hostilities of the recent past may once again become a nightmare reality of the present.
We call on the Ethiopian Government to respect the human rights of its citizens and we also call on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Governments to show restraint, abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and, in the spirit of good faith, resolve their border differences peacefully.
I will conclude by saying that what we heard from Mrs Gomes was most disturbing and serious and I hope the Commission will be able to give answers to the questions she posed.
Â Â  .Mr President, yet again we turn our attention to Ethiopia and yet again the situation has not improved and if anything got worse.
Reports get worse and worse.
We now hear that some eighteen thousand youths have been arrested in Addis Ababa and have been taken to an open field by the Dedesa River and imprisoned.
It will need to be a very big field.
The Ethiopian authorities must be put under strong pressure by us to reveal how many of their citizens they are mistreating.
This motion for a resolution has a number of ideas as to how, but I would be grateful for your update, Mr Commissioner, on what your plans are and what action you will be taking.
The government must disclose how many, particularly how many young people, have been imprisoned and how many killed.
Also, what is the Commission's view of the prospective establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into this whole business?

We have much to do on this, colleagues, so I would, in closing â as I believe the last MEP speaker of 2005 â wish you all a restful holiday, a happy Hogmanay as we call New Year in Scotland, and I look forward to seeing you in 2006 when we will be able to redouble our efforts on this dreadful situation.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, although I hope our wishes for a joyful Christmas will also reach the people of Ethiopia, I believe that the holiday season will be a sad time for many of them.
I say this because a not insignificant number of Ethiopians are Christian, and Ethiopia, which is one of the two largest countries in Africa, has Christian roots.
As I see it, this is a further reason why the many EU Member States that share these Christian roots should defend human rights in Ethiopia.
I trust the Commissioner will not act like a certain African bird today.
I refer to the ostrich, which is known for its habit of burying its head in the sand.
I hope that MrÂ Verheugen will speak boldly about the will and determination of the European Commission and of the EU authorities to stand up for human rights in a country in which such rights are indeed being violated, whatever anyone may say.
I have faith that the Commissioner will do so, and this faith gives me hope.
I should like to wish both him and the House as a whole a merry Christmas.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the internal political developments in Ethiopia since the elections on 15 May.
The democratisation process has come to a difficult crossroads.
The Commission condemns the killings of innocent civilians by the security forces on the streets of Addis Ababa and in other cities of the country in July and November.
The arrest of thousands of people for sympathising with the opposition parties is unacceptable.
The Commission also condemns the arrest of opposition leaders who have completed three weeks of hunger strike, putting their lives in danger.
The Commissionâs concern has been expressed in writing by Commissioner Louis Michel, as well as in Addis Ababa by the European Union and United States' ambassadors, and by the Donor Ambassadors Group.
The Ethiopian authorities have been duly notified of our concerns but have not yet reacted in a constructive manner.
As an immediate reaction to the events, the Commission and other donors have agreed to reconsider the implementation of development aid.
Budget support is already delayed, whereas humanitarian aid, food aid and other programmes continue at present.
On the political front, the European Union Heads of Mission will launch a structured political dialogue with the Ethiopian Government, according to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The Heads of Mission in Addis Ababa have proposed to the government a detailed structure for the dialogue and performance indicators to measure progress on the political and human rights situations.
These indicators mainly relate to progress in the democratisation process, the respect for human rights and the rule of law, as well as issues of regional peace and stability.
At this stage, the Commission does not consider that consultations, as foreseen in Article 96, should be opened because there is still hope that political dialogue can achieve positive results.
In the longer term, the Commission will need to work on the strengthening of democratic institutions in Ethiopia and the promotion of open dialogue between the government and civil society.
Currently, the Commission is promoting the advocacy role of Ethiopian civil society with the aim of enabling them to play a stronger role in the democratisation process.
In our view, these efforts must be continued, despite setbacks to the democratisation process.
On the Ethiopia/Eritrea peace process I would like to recall the European Union position on this matter.
The European Union encourages the parties to abide by the Algiers Peace Agreement, as well as by the final and binding decision of April 2002 of the Ethiopia/Eritrea Boundary Commission.
Eritrea and Ethiopia should respect and implement UN Security Council Resolution 1640(2005).
Furthermore, the initiative is with the United Nations Security Council because the United Nations is the guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and can enforce international law.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Â Â  . I am concerned about the deteriorating situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea which threatens to lead to a new war.
It took the Eritreans decades and the deaths of tens of thousands of freedom fighters to achieve independence.
Since then the human rights situation in Ethiopia has remained dire, while in Eritrea it has deteriorated from adequate to very poor.
Nevertheless the shadow of conflict hanging over the region makes it even more difficult to see human rights significantly improve in either country.
Therefore it is important that the Commission and Council press both countries to return to the troop deployment levels of 16 December 2004, and for Eritrea in particular to reverse its decision to ban helicopter flights by the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea and to ask some members of the Mission to leave.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, it was a request for a split vote on paragraphÂ 14, but having discussed it with some of my colleagues from other groups, we can make it very simple. It is a split vote on the word âaddressâ.
If that falls, then we will be able to support the resolution. It will then read: âUrges the Conference of Presidents to invite His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament during 2006â.
I hope that split vote will go through so that we can support the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to ask about the split vote from a procedural point of view.
Is it in order to have a split vote when it has not been put in writing before the actual part-session begins?
I just need a ruling on that and to know which rule you will be speaking to.
Â Â  Mr President, this matter should not be treated as more important than it is; the word âHead of Stateâ is nowhere to be found in the resolution.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the plenary before, and we can, for once, leave the practicalities of the arrangements to the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15Â December 2005.
Â Â  Colleagues, the new year is usually a time of optimism for the future, but this year we were all saddened by the tragic and untimely death on New Yearâs Eve of Phillip Whitehead, the wise and able Chairman of our Committee on the Internal and Consumer Protection.
Phillip was highly respected across this House.
He arrived here in 1994, bringing with him his experience as a producer of television documentaries and as a national politician, together with his strong and unwavering support for an active role for his country in the European Union.
Today, I would like us to remember him and his achievements here, from laws on the media, to others on food safety; from his tireless defence of the rights of consumers, to his work in helping to make the historic enlargement to central and eastern Europe a reality.
I would also highlight the wisdom, political skill and good humour he brought to bear in piloting the controversial and complex services directive through his committee.
Dear Phillip, we will all miss you.
I ask all of you here today to share a minuteâs silence in his memory.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of labour mobility and the mobility of students is very important for my country, Slovakia, as well as for other new members of the Union.
At this point, I do not intend to speak about transitional periods, through which other Member States of the European Union have imposed considerable restrictions on the movement of labour.
However, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to Austria, the country currently holding the Presidency of the EU, to amend its laws on the admission of foreign students, including those from Slovakia, to Austrian universities and to repeal the âNumerus Claususâ provision in favour of the principle of equal opportunity.
This could be achieved, in my view, by introducing admissions exams or probationary semesters.
This would be a step towards attaining the pan-European objective of building a knowledge-based society.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the group of European Socialists, I wish to express our deep sorrow and disenchantment over the senseless deaths of eighteen civilians in the Pakistani village of Damadola as a result of bombing by American aircraft.
I would like to state here that I fully respect the efforts undertaken by the United States in the fight against global terrorism, as well as the joint actions of the US and EU in tracking down the masterminds and perpetrators of terrorist attacks against civilians.
On the other hand, there is nothing in our democratic societies that precludes us from expressing reservations about attacks that cause the deaths of civilians in any country, especially if the victims are women and children.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Russian-Ukrainian energy crisis has exposed the true face of Russia as an economic partner â a hidden threat to use the energy sector for political purposes.
When my country, Lithuania, decided to restore its independence and secede from the Soviet Union 15 years ago, it experienced similar behaviour on the part of Russia â an economic and energy blockade.
By repeatedly emphasising the significance of Russia as a strategic partner and its exceptional position among other countries, the European Union is offering Russia concessions.
The main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the European Union energy sector on Russian resources.
Is it not obvious, however, that Russia could resort to the same tactics it used on us in respect of the European Union if it experiences difficulties?
Therefore, I invite everyone not only to discuss the development of a common energy policy, but also to take actions to develop such policy immediately.
Â Â  MrÂ President, four years ago, the United States was transferring its first prisoners of the war against terrorism, hooded and chained, to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay on its naval base in Cuba.
Around 500 people, from 35 countries, are still being held, without charge or sentence, deprived of the rights recognised by international law.
There are an increasing number of reports of torture and of poor treatment of the detainees in this centre.
In fact, the prisoners remain in a âlawlessâ situation.
They are often put in isolation, sometimes for months on end, for having infringed the campâs strict operational rules.
Several have attempted suicide.
The United Statesâ plan to have the detainees tried by military commissions will only heighten the injustice because these commissions are not independent and because they admit statements obtained through the use of force or torture.
In these conditions, is it not about time we lent our support to those in Europe who are calling for the closure of this centre?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that we all want to reinvigorate the debate on European policy, but that does presuppose not only the political will, but also a comprehensive information and communications campaign extending throughout Europe and tailored to the various target groups.
Awareness is, after all, dependent on information.
There is no single reading and exercise book for all schools throughout the EU; with the support of the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, the Austrian journalists Wolfgang BÃ¶hm and Otmar Lahodynsky have written one that could, with only a few amendments, be used in all the EU Member States.
I ask you, Mr President, to see to it that this book is published and made available in all the EU-Infopoints and EU information offices.
We have also produced an EU pocket quiz aimed at young people, with 40 questions and answers, and that, too, does not need much adaptation to make it suitable for all the EUâs Member States.
I ask you, Mr President, to do your part in getting these two publications included in Plan D and hence in making it possible for a single European reading book and an information campaign to be kicked off.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a short while ago we received a delegation representing the port workers who held a massive demonstration today in our town.
Trade union representatives have condemned the violent acts carried out by a few uncontrolled elements, right here in Strasbourg and towards our Parliament, but they have drawn our attention to the dangers posed by the port services Directive with regard to the status of port workers, and to the quality and security of port services.
The representatives have called on MEPs to do as they did two years ago and reject this directive that is both pointless and harmful, when it comes back to Parliament.
This directive is both harmful and pointless because, as the port workers have pointed out, European port services are the most competitive in the world, and there is no need to intensify competition in our ports.
Â Â  Mr President, we started this year with an urgent meeting of the representatives of the EU States concerning the supply of gas from Russia.
The Russian-Ukrainian energy crisis served as a wake-up call for the European Union.
The dependence of the European Union energy sector on Russia, where from 50 to 90 percent of all energy resources of the States of the European Union originate, has long been a reason for concern to the citizens of the European Union, as well as residents of Central and Eastern Europe.
It is an open secret that the EU energy sector is still being managed and regulated in such a manner that some members of the European Union often gain at the expense of other states, at the expense of other EU States or in violation of those States' interests.
This should not be the case.
Therefore, considering the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the growing demand placed on energy resources, I invite you, Mr President, to endeavour to develop a single European Union energy policy, while making the drafting of the project a priority on the agenda of both the Commission and the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, last week the Austrian Presidency announced that the period of reflection on the European Constitution was closed and that it intended to present a new proposal at the June summit.
On the other hand, in France, the Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Sarkozy, proposed an original method for reviewing the proposed text, which would be based on a study by a group of experts, which would tour the European capitals and set its conclusions out in a short text that could be passed by the national parliaments.
I wish to draw your attention, Mr President, to the fact that neither proposal makes any provision whatsoever for the grass-roots verdict which sparked the review of the road being taken by the European Union.
Some months after the Dutch 'no', it would be a good idea if we were to study the experience we have acquired and how we can put it to optimum use, in order to remedy the democratic deficit which has developed between the institutions and the citizens.
Inflammatory statements, therefore, and anti-democratic processes will certainly not create a European Union of the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, a radio station owned by the Catholic leadership in Spain has embarked upon a campaign of apology for Francoism and coups dâetat.
The European Union has been built upon the values of freedom and plurality, and in several of our countries holocaust denial or advocating Nazi-fascism are crimes.
It is not a crime in Spain to defend the crimes of Francoism, but those people who do so must be morally reprimanded.
As a final example of that radio stationâs crazed attitude, one of its so-called âjournalistsâ passed himself off as President Zapatero in order to secure a fraudulent interview with the President-elect of Bolivia, Evo Morales.
Masquerading as the President is a crime punishable by ten years in prison in the United States, but we are not calling for prison sentences or precautionary closure; we are asking this Parliament to apply a moral penalty, which could perhaps consist of one hundred Our Fathers and fifty Hail Marys in penance for their sins.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, an investigation in Poland has revealed that the driver responsible for the accident that claimed the lives of six people, including the MEP DrÂ FilipÂ Adwent, had traces of amphetamine in his blood at the time. This affected his ability to control the lorry he was driving.
I refer to this tragic accident in the light of the report recently published by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
It emerges from this report that drug addiction is one of the most serious threats we face, and that it is becoming a particular problem among the younger generation.
As we have seen, it is no longer only addicts that are put at risk by this problem, but society as a whole.
How many more people, whether addicts or innocent victims such as our colleague, must die before the European Commission, Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States react by drafting tough anti-drugs legislation?
The latter is what is needed instead of the texts tabled to date, which provide a greater level of protection for the free market than for precious human lives.
The report sets out proposals regarding the effectiveness of measures to prevent drug addiction and tough regulations, and I would call on all legislators to ensure that these proposals are incorporated into both Community and national law.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the recent dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas supplies and the relentless rise in oil prices are indications of how vulnerable Europe is when it comes to supplies of these vital commodities.
Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on imports, which often come from regions that are highly unstable.
We already import 60% of our oil, for example, and this figure will rise in the future.
It is becoming apparent that no EU Member State, no matter how large, will be able to tackle such problems by itself in future.
I should therefore like to call once again on the European Commission and the European Council to speed up preparations for a proposal on a common energy policy, which should also tie in with the common foreign and security policy.
I do not believe that we can continue with the present situation, dependent as we are on the good will or otherwise of certain authoritarian or totalitarian regimes in our vicinity.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to condemn the fact that this weekend the terrorist organisation Batasuna, the political wing and cradle of the criminals of ETA, intends to hold its congress in the Basque Country.
As you will know, Batasuna has been illegalized in Spain and appears on the European Unionâs list of terrorist organisations, and it would be truly scandalous for Batasuna to hold this event, because it would constitute a direct affront against the rule of law and freedoms of a Member State of the European Union, Spain.
It would be a democratic indignity for Europe, a surrender to the thinking of the ETA-Batasuna terrorists and, above all, a betrayal of the victims of terrorism and an insult to their memory.
Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine an illegalized party such as the Nazi party wishing to hold a congress in Germany or Austria?
Can you imagine Al Qaeda wanting to hold an event in New York?
It is unimaginable.
Well in Spain, the terrorists want once again to side-step the law.
Over recent days, regrettably, there have been comments from the Basque nationalist government and Spainâs Socialist government aimed at rolling out a red carpet for these terrorists, which they can walk unhindered at their coming congress.
The European Parliament must condemn this event that ETA-Batasuna wants to hold and speak out in favour of strict compliance with the Law on Parties.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope you will send a message of congratulations to the Council on its decision to meet henceforth in public when discussing codecision legislation.
This meets a long-standing demand of the European Parliament, and the British Presidency is to be congratulated on achieving this breakthrough.
The UK Presidency was quite a good one for the European Parliament in other respects too.
It agreed, firstly, to reopen Council discussions on the comitology system in order to give Parliament the same rights of scrutiny and call-back as the Council.
Secondly, it agreed to take the data retention proposals as first-pillar legislation under codecision rather than as an intergovernmental third-pillar fix, as some other governments wanted.
Finally, it set an example as to how presidencies should deal with Parliament, with a record number of ministerial appearances, including no fewer than four by Prime MinisterÂ Blair himself.
I hope the Austrian Presidency will do as well.
It has not started well on the institutional front, with Chancellor SchÃŒsselâs quite ill-informed attack on the Court of Justice.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are a number of national governments which do not accept the institutional role of the European Parliament.
They believe that the European Parliament 'moves' on a smaller scale than the national parliaments.
Let us make one thing clear: our role, our institutional role, is as important as that of the national parliaments.
The Greek government is reviewing the Constitution.
It has called on the parties of the Greek parliament, but it has not called on the parties in the European Parliament.
This is clearly a slight.
I should therefore like you to intervene, so that the national governments see the role of the European Parliament which befits it, by which I mean that its role must be similar to that of the national parliaments.
It is unacceptable for the Greek government not to accept as a debater our party, which obtained 4.5% here and 6% in the opinion polls, precisely because it feels threatened by our ascent.
We therefore want the right to democracy.
We want the right of coexistence.
Please contact the president of the Greek parliament and make him understand that this is illegal and reckless.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating the Year of Mobility.
Mobility is understood to mean a change of workplace and place of work.
In order for this change to succeed, certain means are required, the most basic of which is multilingualism.
We therefore fail to understand why a knowledge of the language of the country of origin of European citizens living in other countries in the European Union is not maintained with lessons in the mother tongue right from nursery and school age, so that this can be maintained and developed, both by the specific host country and by the country of origin and the European Union as a whole.
I trust that the European Commission will strengthen the teaching of the mother tongue of migrant workers.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with Mrs Flautreâs condemnation of the scandalous fact that Guantanamo Bay has now been in existence for four years.
Several dozen legal residents of the EU are still incarcerated there, including some of my constituents: BishaÂ al-Rawi, Jamil al-Banna and Omar Deghayes.
The EU needs to exert united and cohesive pressure on the United States, which it has never done before.
Citizens of future EU Member States are also incarcerated there.
I refer specifically to five Bosnian citizens and one legal resident who were abducted by United States agents in JanuaryÂ 2002, in defiance of Bosnian court orders, and held incommunicado for two years.
I call on the Bosnian Prime Minister, Adnan Terzic, to press for their release and for the EU to encourage and support him.
Also in the context of the so-called war on terror, it is shameful that the British Government withheld from the British Parliament for six weeks a letter from Louise Arbour, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, expressing deep concern at some of the proposals in the current anti-terrorism legislation going through the UK national parliament, despite a request that the letter be brought to the attention of the House of Lords.
Everyone must heed what the United Nations says.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for Austria, for the second time since its accession to the European Union in 1995, to hold the presidency, in which capacity much will be expected of it in terms of initiatives.
I thought it was particularly good news that, just before the beginning of the Austrian Presidency, some of the export refunds for live animals were at last done away with.
I now want to appeal directly to the presidency, and in the strongest terms, to urge it to abolish all export subsidies for live animals in short order, while, in the medium term, imposing restrictions on live animal transports within Europe and ultimately to establish that animals are a core object of European legal protection.
Even today, even in Member States of the EU, all kinds of animals are being transported or kept under appalling conditions â one example recently reported by an Austrian animal welfare organisation was in an animal sanctuary in Italy.
This sort of thing needs to be stopped with the utmost speed.
Â Â  Mr President, to some peopleâs annoyance it would seem, there has been press freedom in Spain for a long time.
While some radio stations invent suicide bombers, therefore, others are busy providing serious information.
I am aware, thanks to COPE, that on 29 November of last year, the President of the Autonomous Community of La Rioja sent you a letter, Mr President, asking you to cooperate and actively to defend Spanish, in the knowledge that the Commission had cut the number of translators and interpreters in that language by 33%.
That letter was sent to President Zapatero, as well as Commissioner Almunia, but none of you have done anything to defend Spanish on this occasion.
I would therefore ask you, in order not to discriminate against the Spanish compared to the other citizens of the Union, to do something in support of the language you and I share, because you have been elected to this House on a Spanish list.
Â Â  Naturally I have been elected from a Spanish list.
I could have been elected from a list from any other country of the European Union, as you know.
But I do not believe, Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a, that Spanish has in any way been discredited in this Parliament.
If you know of any specific case that I must deal with, I would ask you to tell me about it, but I do not believe that anybody has noticed any undervaluing, insult or lack of consideration towards the Spanish language in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, there are currently 84 Lisbon directives which the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been implemented by 1Â June 2005, but only 13 have been fully implemented by all Member States.
The Biofuels Directive should have been implemented by the end of 2004, but the following Member States have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Estonia, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia.
The Lisbon Strategy is in dire straits because of the failure to implement legislation by Member States.
Mr President, I should like to ask you to write to the Commission, on behalf of Parliament, to ask what it is doing to speed up the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and what action it is taking against Member States which fail to implement and take seriously the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan, I shall communicate that to the Commission, which, incidentally, will present its new proposals for the Lisbon Strategy at the next Conference of Presidents.
That will be a good opportunity for the political groups to draw attention to the issue that you referred to in your speech.
Â Â  Mr President, please allow me to clarify to this Parliament that the decision on the request to hold a meeting referred by Mr Iturgaiz earlier is currently in the hands of the Spanish justice system and it therefore falls to the public prosecutor and the judge to make the decision, in a country under the rule of law, such as Spain, in which the justice system is independent, and furthermore according to a procedure that has been debated and agreed in the Spanish Parliament; it is therefore an entirely democratic decision.
Finally, I would just like to point out that this Parliament has historically supported processes aimed at peace and the eradication of violence.
We hope and we are convinced that this will continue to be its practice.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent human cases of bird flu infection in Turkey show that the risk of a pandemic has increased, and a majority in the Dutch parliament has now decided that it would be useful to introduce disinfectant matting at airports.
Although the Minister, Mr Veerman, has rejected this proposal, arguing that this should be done at European level, I myself welcome the Dutch parliamentâs initiative.
The minister is, of course, right that it would be better to regulate such matters at European level, except that the problem with discussions on bird flu at European level is that people are always full of good intentions, but when push comes to shove, the Commission would not in any case be able to take action within 24 hours of a crisis.
Secondly, in both the British and Belgian press, a discussion has been started as to the extent to which businesses are prepared for a possible pandemic, and I think this also begs the question of to what extent the European institutions and also this Parliament are prepared for one.
I think there is absolutely no reason to panic, but if there was a pandemic with travel restrictions, then this would also have implications for us, of course, and I wonder to what extent any consideration has been given to this.
Â Â  Mr President, President Barrosoâs final proposal for the 2007-2013 financial perspective contains the following, seemingly contradictory, proposals.
In general point 4 it is stated that: âthe maximum total figure for expenditure ... for 2007-2013 is EUR 862.363 millionâ and that âall figures are expressed using constant 2004 pricesâ, but that âthere will be automatic ... adjustments for inflationâ.
The British rebate under point 78 is qualified as follows: âDuring the period 2007-2013 the additional contribution from the UK shall not be higher than EURÂ 10.5Â billionâ.
These two points seem to be in conflict and raise the question of whether the EURÂ 10.5Â billion is subject to an automatic annual technical adjustment for inflation.
If so, there will be a substantial extra cost.
British Parliament votes are expressed in current sterling values and are not subject to automatic adjustments for inflation.
Exactly how much is the EU expecting the British taxpayer to pay, and is this legal?
Â Â  Mr President, the Groups of the European Parliament have debated the decision of the European Council of 16 December 2005.
The various political Groups rejected it, and their criticism is justified in many respects.
At the same time, I would very much like to warn the European Parliament not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.
A great number of agreements have been reached on the rules of the utilization of funds, which are considered positive by the ten new Member States.
What we failed to agree on in the European Parliament is the issue of non-refundable VAT, the application of the n+3 rule for cohesion funds, that PPPs and the involvement of private resources have become possible and that assistance for housing refurbishments is becoming possible.
These are all very important issues for the new Member States, and it would be very important that the interests of new Member States are not damaged in the course of the Parliamentary Debate.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to inform my colleagues of an unhappy event that happened to me over the festive season.
On New Yearâs Eve, I was abducted in Nicosia by Turkish occupying forces and accused of trespassing over the Turkish army line of separation imposed on Cyprus after the Turkish invasion of 1974.
I was lucky to be arrested and not be killed: the orders given to Turkish guards are to shoot anybody seen near this line.
A number of innocent civilians have already died in this way over the last few years.
Subsequently, I spent three days in jail in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in atrocious conditions, and no permission was granted to the United Nations, my relatives or the European Parliamentâs representative to visit me.
I was presented handcuffed on two occasions before a Turkish military court and on one occasion before an illegal civilian court in the Turkish-occupied sector of Nicosia.
I was eventually released on bail of over EURÂ 25Â 000 and am summoned to appear before the Turkish occupation courts on 20Â January; otherwise a warrant for my arrest will be issued.
If found guilty, I face a three-year jail sentence.
Â Â  This very morning, in fact, I signed a letter addressed to you in response to what you had told me about this matter.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to alert the House to violations of human rights by German officials and courts.
The problem relates to Poles who were previously married to German spouses but are now divorced, and who are treated as no better than paedophiles.
The courts invariably award custody of any children to the German parent, and take it for granted that the German language and culture are superior to their Polish equivalents.
âEarly Germanisationâ and âchildren of German descentâ were phrases used in Nuremberg by criminals charged with the Germanisation of Polish children.
Similar phrases are used today by officials working for the , the German Child and Youth Welfare Office, to justify German-imposed bans on meetings between Poles and their children.
Even if such meetings do take place, speaking Polish is strictly prohibited, and it is instilled in the children that everything associated with the Polish language is inferior.
The claims that the Polish language has a negative influence on the childrenâs education, but such assumptions are racist.
Poland has already experienced a German education system claiming to be superior to all others at earlier stages of its history.
Is this what passes for respect of human rights in Germany?
Such practices violate one of the European Unionâs basic principles, namely the promotion of the linguistic and cultural diversity of its citizens.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I wish to return to the subject of todayâs demonstration by port workers against the proposal for a directive on access to port services.
The demonstrators included dockers from both the old and the new Member States.
I myself represent Western Pomerania, a region in Poland that includes ports such as Szczecin and ÅwinoujÅcie.
In common with my political group, I am opposed to the proposal for a directive that the House will consider shortly.
Yet something odd is going on within the Commission.
Even though there is little public support for this proposal, which was rejected by Parliament during its previous term, and even though there is no convincing evidence that a regulation of this kind is the right solution, the proposal has been tabled at the last minute.
I very much hope that the present Commission in general, and CommissionerÂ Barrot in particular, will not make the same mistake when it comes to other economic sectors.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the deplorable situation of migrant workers in the Union and the legal limbo they often find themselves in.
I am not talking about illegal or economic immigrants, but legal migrant workers from Member States of the EU, new and old, who in my own region are predominantly Portuguese and Polish.
I want to illustrate the situation by referring to my own country, but the situation is the same across the European Union.
We in the United Kingdom have a workersâ registration scheme whereby individuals can register upon payment of GBPÂ 70 (EURÂ 100), so that after 12Â months they are entitled to draw social benefits.
To do that, however, they need a national insurance number.
We have a Catch-22 situation here: to get a number you need to make an appointment, but the phones go unanswered; so, no appointment, no national insurance number, no signing up for the workersâ registration scheme, no legal basis for work, no protection and no benefits.
Â Â  â Mr President, on Tuesday 12 January, a major rally was organised in the town of Rethymnon, in Crete, against racism and xenophobia, following the murder of a young Albanian economic immigrant.
A rally is being organised in a few days' time in Barcelona against racism in sport, and in football stadia in particular, which is taking on dangerous proportions.
I propose, Mr President, that you take an initiative towards the Austrian Presidency and the European Commission and suggest that the spring Council in March discuss an integrated strategy on combating racism and xenophobia which includes measures and short-term and long-term policies.
This will be a symbolic and material initiative to combine policies on economic development and on combating unemployment and poverty with policies against racism and xenophobia.
Â Â  â I am grateful, Mr President, to have the opportunity, in the Chamber, to salute the port workers, including a hundred Portuguese workers, who are today holding a demonstration at Parliament and are staging a blockade in a number of EU countries .
The port workers are fighting for, among other things, job protection, job security, vocational qualifications, collective work contracts and union rights.
Accordingly, they are demanding that the directive on port services be rejected, a directive that has already been rejected by Parliament and yet has inexplicably been re-submitted by the Commission.
I therefore call on Parliament to do its duty and reject it again.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I too agree with MrÂ Liberadzkiâs objections to the Port Services Directive, although I would have preferred this battle to be fought with words rather than stones.
Two French policemen have been seriously injured today.
I rose to speak about another issue, however.
The recent gas crisis involving Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the need for a common energy policy.
There are a great many risks associated with a situation in which individual Member States take measures on their own initiative that serve the sole purpose of enhancing their own energy security, by which I mean gas, oil and electricity supplies.
It follows that what is needed is genuine cooperation and the establishment of harmonised measures in this field.
I am not talking about excessive and overly bureaucratic standardisation, but about a realisation of the fact that the EU Member States form a community that shares common goals and threats.
Economic measures that are justified and understandable at national level should be seen in the broader context of political, geopolitical and energy security concerns.
This is a task that faces the European Parliament too, and so I welcome the fact that the President of Parliament has decided that Council and Commission statements on this issue will be included on the agenda.
Â Â  Mr Czarnecki, we shall examine your proposal.
This morning I received some representatives of the workers and I have asked them to put an end to the actions that are taking place around Parliament.
The delegation of dockers, of the workers who were demonstrating, entirely agreed with me on the need to try to prevent these demonstrations of a violent nature, and I am sure that they are doing everything they can to control their troops.
It is never easy; as we know from experience, every organisation has its percentage of rebels.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on homophobia in Europe.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Community competence with regard to the measures necessary to combat discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty.
Furthermore, the Commission would point out that the ban on this type of discrimination is explicitly provided for in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
On this basis, the Commission endeavours, and will continue to endeavour, within the framework of its powers, to take a hard line against homophobia.
Combating sexual orientation discrimination is a crucial element in the fight against homophobia.
Directive 2000/78/EC, which paves the way for a general framework promoting equal treatment in employment and occupation and covering all the forms of discrimination included in Article 13, is a practical example of this action, and the Commission is ensuring, and will continue to ensure, that this directive is implemented in the Member States.
The Commission is nonetheless aware of the fact that legislative action must be backed up by other initiatives aimed at combating de facto discrimination, humiliating practices, prejudice and stereotypes.
Allow me to mention two practical measures taken by the Commission.
The first measure consists of an information campaign, launched in 2003 and entitled âFor Diversity â Against Discriminationâ. This campaign is currently under way and is aimed at promoting a positive image of diversity, as well as informing the public about anti-discrimination laws.
Organisations defending the rights of homosexuals are among the partners involved in this measure, and several initiatives have accordingly been taken, such as an information campaign and an effort to raise the publicâs awareness of the forms of discrimination suffered by homosexuals.
The second initiative lies within the framework of the recent proposal aimed at making 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
The objectives will be to inform people of their rights, to promote diversity as an asset and an opportunity for the Union and to highlight equal opportunities for all, whether in terms of economic, social, cultural or political life.
The Commission considers that organisations involved in combating sexual orientation discrimination will be able to benefit a great deal from this last measure.
The fact remains that the Union and the Commission can only act within the framework of the powers granted to them by the Treaty.
For example, the Commission can open a possible infringement procedure against a Member State, but it can only do so if a violation of fundamental rights has been observed with regard to the application of Community law.
It is, however, the responsibility of the Member States to exercise powers over and above those possessed by the Union and to take the necessary measures to combat homophobia.
In any case, whether it is a question of situations falling within, or outside, the framework of Community law, it is clear that the Commission totally condemns any demonstration or expression of homophobia.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all the political groups involved in drawing up this resolution.
I pay tribute in particular to MrÂ Cashman, MrsÂ in 't Veld and MrÂ RomevaÂ iÂ Rueda for their work.
I wish to raise three issues on behalf of myself and my group.
The first is that this resolution is not about homosexuality as such but about homophobia, and for us this is really an issue about human rights and whether you approve of beating other people because of their sexual orientation.
We all agree that there is a lot to do in all Member States and within the institutions.
A lot of pressure needs to be applied.
Commissioner Frattini referred to ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty and ArticleÂ 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I agree with that; but the key here is to get the Member States to abide by them.
That is really why we are having this debate: to get the Member States into line.
The second issue concerns the two problems we are facing in fighting homophobia.
The first is the inequality in the legislation of the Member States.
We have all heard of the problems linked to free movement: one couple being accepted, for instance, in the Netherlands but not being accepted and getting the same rights â social or otherwise â for instance, in Italy.
The second problem is a worrying development in many Member States â I do not want to pinpoint any one in particular.
We all see and face the problems of hate crimes and discrimination.
We must also remember that this is not only about sexual orientation; it is also about gender identity and gender expression.
My final point â which goes slightly beyond the scope of this matter â is that we must remember that there are still 75Â countries that consider homosexuality to be illegal and 9Â countries which impose the death penalty for it.
We must get rid of that.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Europe is, in fact, built on absolute principles: equality, tolerance and humanism.
No exception can be made to these fundamental principles; they are simply vital, and the authorities must defend them at all costs when they are attacked.
Verbal abuse is hurled at some of our fellow citizens, and real forms of discrimination are emerging.
The most appalling thing of all is the fact that outright beatings have led to several deaths in various Member States of the Union.
What have the victims of these vile acts done?
Nothing.
They are simply of a different sexual orientation - they are homosexuals â and the text before us, which we are debating this evening, provides for an important bill.
By voting in favour of this resolution, we are saying loud and clear that we wish to put a stop to the difference in treatment suffered by homosexuals on EU soil and to see them guaranteed the same rights.
We emphasise this point: the laws must be the same for everyone.
Finally, we solemnly call for an end to the homophobic remarks that stir up hatred, especially when these condemnatory words are uttered by the highest State authorities.
These authorities are the guarantors of equal treatment for all.
It is our duty, under Article 13 of the Treaty, to safeguard each personâs fundamental rights.
This is our common vision of democracy and of our values.
We need to be vigilant on a daily basis.
The fight against homophobia must, if necessary, be conducted through the use of legislative provisions, such as already exist, I might add, in several Member States of the Union.
The Europe of 25 means fraternity and equality.
Let us waste no time in eradicating the bad seeds sprouting here and there.
We have a duty to oppose hatred and the rejection of others.
I can only repeat today the words of the German pastor, Martin NiemÃ¶ller, who resisted the Nazis: âWhen they came to arrest my Communist neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not a Communist.
When they came to arrest my gypsy neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not a gypsy.
When they came to arrest my Jewish neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not Jewish.
When they came to arrest me, there was no one left to speak up for meâ.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in times of growing intolerance, an overwhelming majority of this Parliament have sent a very clear signal, and that is cause for rejoicing.
All too often, homophobia is justified under the banner of other fundamental rights, namely freedom of religion and freedom of opinion.
Some Member States hide behind the principle of subsidiarity in order to legitimise discrimination and, with all due respect, Commissioner, even the Commission often uses this faint-hearted excuse to look the other way.
I expect the Commission to be right behind the fundamental rights of all European citizens, irrespective of where they live, for that is what we in this Parliament do too.
The fundamental rights are not a matter of subsidiarity.
They are indefeasible and universal for all citizens of the European Union.
Solemn declarations and moral indignation are not enough, though; they also, as is specified in our joint resolution, have to be backed up by a whole host of things.
We must invest not only in information and education, but also in improving the legal position of homosexuals.
While I am on the subject, I should like to insist once more â and I would like to hear from the Commissioner what plans are under way in this respect â on what is referred to as the horizontal directive that prohibits all forms of discrimination, not only in the workplace, but everywhere.
Furthermore, it is scandalous that some Member States should still not have fully recognised the fact that homosexuals were the target of the Nazi regime.
I hope that the Austrian Presidency will be able to put this to the Member States in the Council and can subsequently recognise homosexuals as being the victims of the Nazis.
Finally, I should like to hear when the Commission will at long last do as it has repeatedly been asked to do and table proposals for removing obstructions for the free movement of persons for married homosexual couples.
It is unacceptable that Europeans, when crossing the border, should lose their rights on the grounds of their sexual orientation, including rights of ownership, pension entitlements, social security, even custody over their own children.
I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it will table further to a request by the European Parliament to this effect that dates back to October 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, more than a year ago, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, gave a plenary speech in response to statements made by Mr Buttiglione, a candidate Commissioner, in which the former made a number of clear promises.
I have read up on this speech once again.
Anti-discrimination and equal opportunities were to be a top priority for this Commission, with a group of Commissioners to monitor all Commission action and major initiatives in this area.
It will act as a political driving force.
Well, my question to the Commission is what exactly this working party has achieved over the past year, for the disappointing list drafted by Commissioner Frattini does not really do justice to this enormous pledge and there is plenty of work to be done.
As Mrs in 't Veld has already said, it remains unacceptable that there should be European rules that prohibit the discrimination of people on the basis of the colour of their skin, say when renting a house, but that homosexuals are still outside of the law.
Why is the right to equal treatment of people, irrespective of their sexual orientation, restricted to the labour market?
In Poland, a number of freedom demonstrations have been banned, and there is every indication that the authorities want to stand in the way of gay emancipation over there.
My group is concerned about this, as it is about a number of developments in Latvia and Lithuania, and also in other countries.
It is worrying that the groups often do not dare speak out on this issue.
Take the Liberals.
Where inefficient spending of European subsidies is concerned, they insist on naming and shaming, but when we talk about basic European values, nobody says a word, and that I believe to be wrong.
I therefore hope that individual Members will now vote in favour of the amendments so that we can address the issue as a whole.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I too am opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but we should exercise caution in granting ever more rights to homosexuals.
I am delighted that we are holding this debate today.
The rights of homosexuals must be defended wherever possible.
It is not that long ago that homosexuality was removed from the World Health Organisationâs classification of diseases.
I am all in favour of such a move, but I am not sure whether it is a good idea to legalise homosexual unions.
These latter should perhaps be given backing for the purposes of inheritance law, but homosexual couples must not be allowed to adopt children.
Such practices are distasteful, outrageous and scandalous, and there have not been any psychological studies showing that they can be regarded as normal.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President, there can be no question that we are faced in Europe with a situation in which homosexuals sometimes suffer violence or contempt at the hands of the police services.
That much can be learned from reports on such matters.
Nevertheless, I cannot help but think that this debate is largely a waste of time.
My opinion stems from a belief that it would be a very good idea indeed to restore a sense of proportion to this heated debate, and to avoid succumbing to hysteria when describing the situation of homosexuals in Europe.
âHysteriaâ is the only appropriate word for descriptions that paint a picture of resistance movements, arrests and war.
MrsÂ Roure provided us with a good example of such descriptions in her speech.
I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to two facts.
Firstly, violence against homosexuals represents only a fraction of the violence which is endemic in our societies, and which is a problem faced by every EU Member State.
We have seen one example of it today, and we saw further examples a few months ago in France.
This is only one aspect of a much larger problem.
Another facet to this question is that every EU Member State, whether old or new, has its own institutions.
It has become apparent that these latter, by which I mean courts, ombudsmen, and even public opinion, are capable of providing effective protection for the rights of minorities.
If we were to approach this debate from a legal perspective, we would come up against a whole series of problems and obstacles in the shape of Treaty law.
Fortunately, we will not be able to do anything to change this.
There is no consensus in Europe that the Treaties should be amended in order to give the EU jurisdiction over such key matters as the recognition of homosexual unions and their implications outside the borders of the Member State that has authorised them.
It therefore follows that there is no reason why the EU should be called to act on such issues such as homophobia.
There would be an inevitable consequence of doing so, however.
The credibility of the integration process, which is already being used by some as an ideological weapon, would be undermined.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in my opinion it is legitimate to ask whether MrsÂ Buitenwegâs approach to the issue of homophobia in Europe is one that should by adopted by any politician.
Do we have the right to impose our way of thinking on voters, or to tell them how they should approach the problem of sexuality and sexual minorities?
It is my belief that sexuality is a private matter for every individual, and that everyone should exercise this sexuality in line with their own morality, religion and culture, and in accordance with local customs.
The European Parliament cannot therefore set itself the goal of winning general approval in Europe for homosexuality, and it should not expect such a thing.
We must not forget that while some countries in Europe are more tolerant, others have more conservative social norms.
Yet homosexuals are attacked and beaten up in even the most tolerant countries, such as the Netherlands and France.
I need only mention the case of the homosexual Sebastian Nouchet, who was doused in petrol and set alight in France.
If we are going to hold a debate on such matters at all, we should therefore focus our attention on ways of preventing an escalation of homophobic hatred.
We will not succeed in doing so, however, unless we manage to draw a line between protection of the right to sexual privacy, and violation of the right to displays of this sexuality.
I should therefore like to make it quite clear that any minority that feels the need to demonstrate the fact that it is different is naturally free to do so.
No minority may be discriminated against in this regard.
As a matter of fact, a whole system of judicial and constitutional bodies, including an ombudsman, has been set up in Poland to protect this freedom and to ensure compliance with European legislation.
Any bans on homosexual demonstrations are of an incidental nature only.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that the law should benefit sexual majorities as well as sexual minorities.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to express my disappointment at the statement made by Commissioner Frattini, which was more a repetition than a statement.
Commissioner, we know you are concerned and we know the Commission is concerned, but the Commission should be judged on what it does.
Infringement proceedings must be brought against any Member State that fails to transpose or implement the appropriate directives already in force in a number of Member States.
I agree that we must campaign and educate, but that in itself is not enough.
A proposal for a horizontal directive directly related to the race and ethnicity directive promised by PresidentÂ Borroso must be brought before this House.
I am saddened by some of the contributions this afternoon.
This is about equality, not about promoting homosexuality.
It is about giving homosexuals the equal rights and equality that others take so much for granted.
I am gay.
I am a homosexual, born to an ordinary man and woman.
Because of that some people will wish to take away my right to talk about my sexuality, to celebrate my 22-year relationship and to be part of a wider community.
Some would vilify me, take away my democratic rights and use hate-speak against me.
I could decide to go on a gay pride march, but that gay pride march could be banned.
Why?
Because society is preoccupied with what it perceives as my sex life.
A judgement has been made on it.
Where is the morality in that?
Where is the morality in preaching and promoting discrimination and hatred, sometimes behind the shield and the excuse of religion or belief?
I say to Commission Frattini and the entire Commission, as well as to this House, that if we do nothing when we see people beaten to death, vilified and discriminated against then we are condoning and becoming complicit in those beatings, in the hate-speak, the defamation and the ill-treatment.
Even in the United Kingdom, where enormous advances have been made, a young man was kicked to death just before Christmas for no other reason than he was homosexual.
If this House does nothing then it is party to every single blow that was rained upon that individual and other men like him and on gay women across the European Union.
That I should even have to make such a statement here in Parliament makes this a day of great sadness.
Â Â  Mr President, I have to acknowledge that, as Mr Cashman has said, even in my own constituency of London we continue to see prejudice and homophobic crime.
Just recently a gay man was killed purely out of murderous prejudice.
A few years ago we had a hate-crazed bomber who specifically intended to kill gay customers of a bar.
Of course he killed others too.
But we are largely looking at private hate and prejudice.
What is so shocking about developments in some Member States is the crude official intolerance: the banning of Pride demonstrations, inflammatory language even by Prime Ministers, police failure to protect marches, and so on.
We need European legislation to outlaw hate crime on grounds not only of race â which we have still not achieved â but also of sexual orientation.
And we need to equalise the treatment of race, gender and sexual orientation in generalising the ban on discrimination not only in the workplace, but also in the receipt of services and in the supply of goods.
The patchwork that we have at the moment is not good enough.
I look also to Commissioner Frattini to lead the effort to greatly improve the generalised protection of both women and minorities.
Â Â  Mr President, now that we are well into the 21st century we cannot just condemn homophobia: we must fight it politically and legally.
The only way to look at homophobia is as a combination of ignorance and impunity.
According to the Treaties, the European institutions are responsible for ensuring respect for the rights and freedoms of its Member States.
This means combating ignorance and the impunity of homophobic statements and actions, which are not just taking place, but which are increasing in some European countries.
I profoundly regret statements such as those that have been made in Poland or decisions such as those taken in the Latvian Parliament, which fundamentally violate the principle of equal rights, a principle which must prevail in the construction of the shared values upon which the European Union is founded.
I would therefore urge the Commission to condemn homophobia and to set up legal and political mechanisms so that this problem will one day be confined to history.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not think there is anybody in this House who would accept homosexuals being discriminated against, attacked, intimidated or whatever on account of their orientation, but that is not, in fact, what todayâs discussion is about.
The question for discussion is whether it is still possible to criticise the spirit of political correctness that is gradually suffocating the free expression of opinion.
Although the time when homosexuality was a taboo subject is fortunately in the past, these days it has become taboo to raise objections about some types of behaviour or complain about some homosexuals, even though this is completely unrelated to discrimination, hatred or whatever.
The Buttiglione case is still fresh in the memory.
For example, anyone who is opposed to homosexual marriage is promptly written off as homophobic and criminalised.
Commissioner Frattini talked about diversity a moment ago, but it is important that we remain open to diversity of opinion, for the sanctimoniousness of 19th century sexual morals is gradually giving way to the sanctimoniousness of political correctness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has prided itself on having spearheaded the fight against discrimination where equality between men and women, the status of ethnic minorities, the situation of disabled people and, more recently, respect for peopleâs sexual orientation are concerned.
Article 13 of the Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and numerous directives make it not only the right, but also the duty, of our Assembly to continue to fight for the equal rights of homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals.
In view of the substantial progress recorded in this area in many Member States, some people had hoped, if not for this matter to have been settled, then at least for it to have died down.
No such thing has happened, and a real upsurge in homophobic language and violence can even be observed.
The recent remarks made by Polish political leaders dismayed us, with the European Commission, I am afraid to say, only reacting to them in a very half-hearted manner.
Other unacceptable speeches of this kind have been made in other countries, including France.
Violent acts, ranging from insults to torture and murder, are to be deplored everywhere.
These crimes are taking place in a particularly worrying international context, in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Senegal.
Homosexuals are being persecuted because of the way in which they live their lives. Worse still, in Iran, two have been executed.
We are therefore delighted to welcome the Commission statement on homophobia in the European Union.
Our colleague from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, MrÂ Stubb, had prepared a resolution, on behalf of our group, calling on the Commission and the Member States to take practical legislative and operational measures to combat these forms of discrimination.
Today, it is a resolution common to five political groups that we are examining.
One can only be delighted to see that, in this Chamber, the fight for human rights has transcended partisan borders.
The pious hopes contained in the Commissionâs statements must now be very swiftly replaced by a practical and comprehensive directive.
Equally, it is up to each one of us to continue this fight in our respective countries for a form of equality that consists not only of the right to other peopleâs indifference towards their sexuality, but also of the right to be different.
Â Â  Mr President, attacks on homosexuals are bad news, and we are getting that news from every corner of the European Union.
The Vice-President, Commissioner Frattini, has told us what means the Commission has at its disposal to deal with homophobia and what it is actually doing with them, but what I should like him to tell us is whether that is meant to be enough.
Are we really meant to find it acceptable that discrimination in the Member States should go unpunished and that they should fail to transpose the anti-discrimination directives?
That is why there is a need for a build-up of political will, and this debate helps to bring that about.
Five groups have come together and agreed on a text that denounces discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and which is intended to protect homosexuals, lesbians, transgendered people and bisexuals.
The fact is, though, that more needs to be done; transposing the anti-discrimination directives cannot be something that Member States are left to do as and when they feel like it, and â as has already been said â if their authorities interfere with the right to demonstrate by, for example, banning gay pride marches, then they have to be called to account.
Fundamental rights need to be reinforced and must apply not only in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, where the rights of same-sex couples are fully recognised, but throughout the European Union too.
I am absolutely outraged by what I have just heard said about the right to adopt being under attack.
What determines whether or not a child will develop and flourish is the parentsâ love and devotion, not their sexual orientation.
That is where discrimination starts, and, although â thank God â we punish it, there are powerful voices in places like the Vatican who speak out in its defence, thereby encouraging even more flagrant manifestations of homophobia.
I will therefore close by saying that morality is a private matter for private citizens themselves, but what we in this House have to do is defend the law, and that is what five groups are doing.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether I will live to see homosexuality accepted and lived as something completely normal.
I wonder whether the time will come when politicians will no longer be able to make political capital for themselves with discriminatory comments about homosexual people, and I wonder when same-sex partnerships will be recognised as sharing responsibilities and enjoying equal rights.
There is something about the view â as expressed in the Popeâs definition â of homosexual couples as merely convenient arrangements for the purpose of pursuing meaningless sex that betrays a contempt for people, and it bears no relation to the reality of life as lived by homosexual couples.
Discrimination against homosexual lifestyles and their marginalisation begins in peopleâs heads, and our adopting a directive on the subject will not put a stop to it.
The events in Poland are no more accidental than the latest utterances of one Italian minister are slips of the tongue; rather, they are expressions of an attitude of mind.
Combating homophobia is an educational task, and it is intended that 2007 should be the Year against Discrimination.
The Commission needs to give the fight against homophobia the same level of priority among its activities as the combating of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am disappointed by Commissioner Frattiniâs speech, for what he is doing is retreating and saying we will intervene only when rights are infringed, but if the core principles of the European Union are violated, we will do nothing â indirectly admittedly, but that is what you said, Commissioner!
The fact is that sexuality and sexual orientation are fundamental rights too, and they too are in the Treaty.
Where the violation of those rights is on an official footing, in Poland, for example, where these people are on the receiving end of enormously discriminatory utterances on the part of leading politicians, and persecuted and injured when they take part in these demonstrations, which is an offence against these young peopleâs human dignity, the Commission stands by and declines to intervene, on the grounds that European law has not been broken.
