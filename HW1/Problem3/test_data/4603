Greeceâs links with its western Balkan neighbours are also being examined in this context.
In the last few years, the Commission has allocated large amounts of money to road and rail projects relating to Greeceâs main links with its northern neighbours from the Trans-European networks budget, the structural financial instruments or the Phare and Cards programmes.
The Commission also intends increasing its efforts in the 2007-2013 financial perspectives with all the details I gave just now and do not want to repeat.
It is up to the countries concerned to take the initiative of preparing and proposing projects that could be supported financially by Community funds and European Investment Bank loans.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his detailed reply.
My interest arises from the fact that the economic area in the region continues to be fragmented and isolated and its regional and European integration continues to be hampered.
My supplementary question is this: does the Commission really intend to place greater emphasis on those transport networks which, on the one hand, promote the unification of southern Europe and, on the other hand, by connecting them with the trans-European networks, help the interconnection of these countries â the countries of Southeast Europe â with the European Union and the integration of the economic area as a whole.
Â Â  Mr Papastamkos, it is true that it is a priority.
We have enlarged Europe and with the imminent prospects of enlargement with Romania and Bulgaria, the neighbourhood policy is beginning to take shape.
I therefore think that in this new context we shall have to give priority to those corridors and transport routes to which you have drawn our attention.
I would also like to say that I am expecting much from Mrs Loyola de Palacioâs report; she is obviously putting a lot of thought into it and I am sure she will be consulting all the Member States.
Â Â  Mr Guardans CambÃ³, the Commission is ensuring that the Member States implement the in the area of rail transport.
By now, the Member States should have transposed the directives relating to the ârailway infrastructure packageâ and the directives on railway interoperability.
So far as the opening up of the rail freight market is concerned, the Member States ought to have transposed the âinfrastructure packageâ directives, in particular Directive 2001/12, by 15 March 2003.
The Commission brought infringement proceedings for non-communication of transposition measures, or at least some of them, against Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Luxembourg.
The Court of Justice found against those countries in October-November 2004.
Infringement proceedings for incomplete or incorrect transposition have been brought against the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain.
The Commission will continue to ensure that the Member States fully comply with their obligations to transpose Community law.
It will do that in particular for the directive to which you refer, which must be transposed by 31 December 2005.
The Commission is following the actual implementation of the new regulatory framework for railway infrastructure access very closely through a working group made up of the Member States and market participantsâ representatives, who are invited to exchange their analyses and experience of the development of the competitive market with the Commission.
There are also other bodies whose task is to observe and evaluate non-discriminatory access to the market, such as the regulatory and consultative committee set up by Directive 2001/12 on the development of the Communityâs railways, which I have already mentioned, and a large number of working groups, such as the railway regulatorsâ working group or those of the authorities that issue railway licences and safety certificates.
May I say to you, Mr Guardans CambÃ³, that I for my part believe this is a very important question because it is essential that we have a strong rail transport industry if we are to avoid Europe always having to use road transport; that would be harmful both to the environment and, by creating bottlenecks, to the European mobility we need if Europe is to be competitive; it would also be detrimental to the comfort of its citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, as you have said, a lot of hopes have been placed in this liberalisation of rail transport.
As you know, however, as happened in their day for goods, it is the case that safety certificates in particular âÂ to give you an example involving a country you perhaps know better than othersÂ â prevent genuine liberalisation.
It is what, in goods transport, are called measures of equivalent effect, restrictions having an effect equivalent to genuine restrictions.
I would therefore like the Commission to check not just that liberalisation as such has been implemented, as a principle, but also to ensure that there are no concrete obstacles to its actually being put into effect on the ground.
Â Â  Mr Guardans CambÃ³, I can tell you that I fully share your concern.
We must see to it that there are indeed no more or less hidden barriers to this opening up of the rail market.
You mention safety certificates in particular.
There is clearly a need for an independent authority that is able to issue safety certificates on a completely objective basis.
You also refer to a number of Member States which I know well.
Let me assure you that I ask just as much of them, and you will see that presently.
Â Â  Thank you for also coming to ask me about one of the important questions which will, I hope, enable us to improve road safety in Europe.
The Commission confirms that it is looking into the feasibility of an initiative to introduce daytime use of dipped headlights on all motor vehicles.
As you point out, this measure appears in several national highway codes and has in any case been recommended in other Member States.
If the examination proves positive, the Commission intends submitting its proposal after the publication of the mid-term review of the European road safety programme I mentioned just now and which is expected in the second half of this year.
We shall see how to respond to this suggestion.
In the meantime, the Commission will continue its consultations with the circles concerned, in particular the motor industry.
We need, for example, to look at the possibility of introducing, for new vehicles, special lights that would be switched on automatically when moving off.
These new lights will use less power than dipped headlights, because one of the objections made to us is about the energy used by having them on during the day.
When we come to update the road safety programme, we will try to answer this question in the light of all the experience and of all the lessons drawn from that experience.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your answer, which I found encouraging.
We must make use of every option for promoting road safety: all the various existing options and those which are becoming available in the different Member States.
There is naturally concern about having to wait for a review and about not being able to take initiatives.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks that the Commission will present more than one proposal for a directive following the mid-term review, because that possibility was in actual fact mentioned in the road safety programme we have now.
Â Â  Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I do not intend to delay the taking of decisions.
I believe the technical documents will be available in the next few months and then of course the Commission will have to shoulder its responsibilities and make proposals.
I would like to thank you in advance for your support because this is an area where, as you know, some Member States will always have reasons for rejecting certain measures even though we know they will cut the number of road deaths in Europe.
Â Â  Could I ask the Commissioner if he would circulate the research that has been done to show that cars running with daytime lights significantly reduces road accidents.
Can I also ask his view in relation to this being an issue best applied by Member States?
If the Commissioner is interested in the issue of safety there are many areas in which the Commission could involve itself â for example, I note that in France, taxi drivers do not have to wear seatbelts but once they cross into Germany, they do.
Is this not a matter best left to Member States?
Â Â  There are already Member States where the use of dipped headlights is compulsory: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Hungary and Sweden.
France introduced them as a recommendation during the winter of 2004/2005.
We will be able to begin talks with the motor industry to get new vehicles fitted with devices that automatically switch dipped headlights on as soon as the engine is started.
Then we will see how to introduce the use of dipped headlights during the day on all motor vehicles.
As you pointed out following Mrs Hedkvistâs question, a recent study has shown that using dipped headlights during the day will help to reduce the number of road accidents appreciably: by between 5 and 15%.
There was also a problem with motorcycle drivers, but I think all these problems are being resolved.
That is what I can say with things as they are at present.
I am asking Parliament to be a little patient so that we can really prepare this package of additional measures for improved safety on Europeâs roads.
Â Â  First, let me go back a bit: the Commission is making the study on dipped headlights available to you.
I did not have the information, but the study is available to you.
Now I will answer Mrs Vincenziâs question. As set out in its White Paper, in its Communication of 16 February on strengthening the rights of passengers, the Commission promised that in 2005 it would look at the best way of improving and guaranteeing passengersâ rights in the different modes of transport.
This Communication approaches the question of passengersâ rights in the road sector from the point of view of international coach services.
So far as road safety is concerned, Mr President, and we have already spoken about it at some length, the 2001 White Paper proposed cutting the number of casualties by half by the year 2010.
In the countries of the present Union, the Union of 25 Member States, 50 000 people were killed in 2001; there must be no more than 25Â 000 in 2010.
The European Parliament and the Council have adopted this ambitious target.
In 2003, the Commission adopted an action plan concerning the vehicle, user behaviour and the road infrastructure: three aspects.
Well, this year we are going to publish a review of the efforts made to reach that target.
As I said, and I want to stress this, we will have to make new legislative proposals, one of which will be concerned in particular with road infrastructure audits and inspections.
I would nevertheless like to add, for Parliamentâs information, that motoristsâ behaviour will also have to be taken into account, and we shall have to see what we can do to bring some harmonisation to the rules in force throughout the Union in this field as well.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
I would, however, ask you to be more explicit about the interpretation of Article 16 of the EC Treaty, from which it seems to me that one can infer that users have a right to mobility and hence to having minimum safety standards drawn up in the field of services.
I ask you, therefore, whether we can begin to class motorways, or at least toll motorways, as a service in the public interest.
The reason would be, in part, to prevent the legitimate call for safety â which has resulted in the Charter of Passengersâ Rights being drawn up for the airline sector and also in future for the railways â from making such carriers less competitive in comparison with the motorways.
I believe that putting all those involved on a level playing field and increasing safety for everyone should be an explicit objective.
Â Â  What we must do is draw up rules for the road that will apply along the length of the major routes, rather as we have done for air and rail transport.
So far as possible, we are in fact going to demand that the same rules be applied for Trans-European networks.
As you know, we are touching here on problems that come under the third package of Justice and Home Affairs measures.
It is the whole problem of sanctions; it is the whole problem of controls and offences.
Clearly, all this now needs to be harmonised; it will no doubt be rather difficult to achieve, but it is necessary.
In any case, so far as Trans-European networks are concerned, we are very definite that we want this improvement.
We are thinking of presenting a proposal for a directive on greater security and safety in Trans-European transport networks before the end of 2005.
Â Â  . I would like to thank MrÂ Howitt for his question.
Thank you Mr Howitt, because this gives me the opportunity to reiterate how important the Commission believes it is for persons with reduced mobility to be able to count on being treated fairly by being guaranteed appropriate assistance so that they can travel throughout the European Union with confidence.
Only three months after taking office as Commission Vice-President responsible for transport, I submitted to the College a regulation which gives real and tangible rights to persons with reduced mobility travelling by plane.
It seeks to ensure them fair treatment by preventing carriers or tour operators from refusing to carry them because of their reduced mobility except for justified safety reasons.
The proposed regulation therefore asks airport managers to provide the necessary assistance at airports free of charge and asks carriers to make the necessary assistance available on board aircraft, also free of charge.
The regulation would apply to cases of departure, arrival or transit in airports located in Member States.
It goes without saying, MrÂ Howitt, that I am very much counting on Parliamentâs support and I am confident that, with the Council, you will work on this dossier diligently so that it can be adopted quickly.
The contacts I have had with disabled personsâ organisations have enabled me to gauge the hope to which this regulation, which is the start of a policy of non-discrimination towards the disabled, gives rise.
I can tell you that I will continue to treat this as an essential concern, since I am convinced that guaranteeing accessibility and mobility for all is for us a European ideal.
That is the reply I wanted to give you, Mr Howitt.
You are right, there has undoubtedly been some delay, but today we are hard at work and we must now press on resolutely.
Â Â  Commissioner, you can count on my support, and, I hope, that of Parliament.
We criticise the Commission when we need to, but you have put forward an excellent regulation and I hope it will be passed swiftly.
I hope you will be pleased to hear that one low-cost operator, Easyjet, which serves Luton airport in my constituency, has said that prices need not go up because of this draft regulation.
That comment removes some of the scare stories about the regulation.
Could the Commissioner answer one question which was put to me: why, if this is right for air travel, should it not apply to other modes of transport?
Â Â  In its communication, the Commission gave an undertaking, in accordance with the White Paper, that during 2005 it would examine the need for legislation to extend the rules on the protection of passengers with reduced mobility to other modes of transport, in particular shipping and international coach transport.
Having said that, Mr Howitt, you have clearly understood, so far as rail transport is concerned, that the third railway package contains a legislative proposal introducing minimum rules for assistance to persons with reduced mobility.
I know that Parliament feels strongly about this third railway package and that it does not want the packageâs various measures to be broken up.
I believe this is very important and that the measure concerning persons with reduced mobility will be added to those that came into force on 17 February 2005, that is last Thursday, on denied boarding, cancellation and major delays to a flight. All this has shown Europeâs citizens that the Union, its Parliament, its Council and its Commission are also there to make everyoneâs daily life easier and to make things safer for everyone.
In any case, I thank you for having underlined the importance that should be attached to persons with reduced mobility.
Â Â  Questions 53 and 54 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  . One of the main issues in the proposed Council regulation laying down general provisions of support for rural development from the EU rural development fund is the review of intermediate less-favoured areas.
The Commission proposed a revision of the existing classification based, to a large extent, on socio-economic criteria which change over time.
It seems that, decades after their designation, some of these areas would not qualify as LFAs due to the evolution of their socio-economic features.
This was the reason for the critical observations made both by the Court of Auditors in its special report on Less-Favoured Areas, and by the European Parliament.
Our own evaluation studies also confirmed these observations.
The Commission cannot ignore these observations and this explains its proposal.
From the new period onwards, LFAs should be addressed on the basis of objective natural criteria which do not change over time, thereby corresponding to a permanent handicap, such as low soil productivity or poor climate conditions.
As a result of the application of the new criteria, areas may no longer qualify for LFA status and farmers located in these areas may no longer be eligible for the intermediate LFA payment.
The level of compensation is a distinct issue from the delimitation of a Less-Favoured Area.
Support is granted per hectare and should compensate farmers for the additional costs incurred and income foregone due to the handicap to agricultural production in the areas concerned.
In its proposal for the next programming period, the Commission will introduce a distinction between mountain areas and other Less-Favoured Areas with regard to the maximum compensation payable.
Since mountain areas are affected by the most severe handicaps, the Commission proposes setting the maximum amount to EURÂ 250 per hectare, while the maximum amount for other categories is set at EURÂ 150 per hectare.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your very direct and clear answer.
There will probably be no winners, but there will certainly be losers.
Could you outline when people will know whether their area will receive less, or more, funding under the reclassification?
Â Â  . We are now working on the conditions for the new less-favoured areas.
We will settle upon them very soon â during the first half of March.
You are right, there will be losers, but I am quite sure there will be winners as well.
Â Â  How can the Commissioner justify bringing forward these proposed changes at a time when there has been a major review of the common agricultural policy?
In my country, Ireland, where we have just introduced full decoupling from 1 January 2005, Irish farmers feel that they face a very uncertain future as regards their income.
Furthermore, would she consider postponing decisions until people have had an opportunity to find their feet under the new system?
Â Â  . This is part of the ongoing political discussions in the Council and Parliament on the new regulation for rural development policy.
To take out the discussion on less-favoured areas and keep it for another decision would, in my view, be out of the question.
However, you will have every opportunity to make your statements during the discussion here in Parliament on the new legislation for the rural development policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much welcome the Commissionerâs honest answer to Mrs McGuinessâ question.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, continuity of regional development, including the development of mountain areas and less-favoured areas, is in your interests too, because it enables these areas to go on sharing in the general prosperity and social development of the European Union, which is why there must be no abrupt cessation of these compensatory payments in any cases where they are due to expire.
Â Â  .
One of the reasons why this discussion is on the table now is that the Court of Auditors has pointed out the difficulties of maintaining the present situation.
Things have changed over the last few decades, and those areas that were less-favoured areas 20 or 25 years ago may no longer be fulfilling the same criteria.
That is why things are going to be changed.
Â Â  . The definition of mountain areas is based exclusively on natural handicaps such as altitude and slopes or a combination of the two.
Unlike the delineation of other less-favoured areas, the delineation criteria for mountain areas have not been contested in the recent special report of the European Court of Auditors on support for less-favoured areas, which I mentioned in my previous answer.
Evaluations of rural development programmes show the relevance of support for the less-favoured areas to maintain mountain-farming populations and for the land management in mountain areas, including landscape and environmental protection.
Under these circumstances, the Commission did not propose to modify the classification criteria for this section of the less-favoured areas.
In its proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development for the next programming period, the Commission introduces a distinction between mountain areas and other less-favoured areas as regards the maximum amount of compensation.
Since mountain areas are affected by the most severe handicaps, it is proposed to increase the maximum amount for those areas from EUR 200 to EUR 250 per hectare.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your clear answer and for letting us know that the Commission is introducing this distinction for the next programming period.
Something else that would interest me is whether it would not make sense â and whether you could not examine this option â to introduce parameters for mountain areas which would define them as areas above a certain altitude and with a certain degree of steepness, in other words to lay down objective criteria that would prevent overlapping and concurrent support.
Â Â  . I understand your great interest in this very specific area because it is so important to keep rural areas populated.
I have listened to your proposal.
For the time being it is not in the recommendation and I think it would be difficult to include it.
I understand that you would regulate based on the steepness of the mountains.
I think regulation in this way would be extremely difficult and would encounter many problems in the Court of Auditors, because definition of these mountain areas would be open to interpretation.
Â Â  . The common organisation of markets in the sugar sector fixes sugar production quotas by Community region.
The authorities of the Member States allocate these quotas to their sugar-producing undertakings.
It is for each undertaking to decide and organise its production between one or more processing plants according to its own criteria.
The fact that an undertaking closes one of its factories and concentrates its production in only one processing plant â as is the case in Ireland â does not modify its quota or decrease its total production.
Irish farmers will therefore be able to continue producing the same quantities of sugar beet as before the closure.
Concentration and rationalisation of production is a common feature of industrial restructuring and, for sugar, reflects the trend over the last ten years, where the number of factories almost halved within the EU of 15.
The quota transfer across Member States was presented by the Commission's communication on the sugar reform in July 2004 to increase the competitiveness of the European sugar sector.
It would allow the more competitive undertakings to acquire the quotas of those undertakings that decide to close after the reform, and thus to adjust to the lower price in the market.
The inefficient producers would be able to sell the quotas and thereby reap some of the value of the quotas.
If nobody is interested in buying the quotas in the same Member State or other Member States, the undertaking can apply for conversion aid, which should help to cover the costs of restoring good environmental conditions for the factory site and of redeploying the labour force.
Discussions in the Council and Parliament show very strong concern on the part of a number of Member States and stakeholders with regard to the possibility of trans-national quota transfer.
In this connection, the Commission needs to underline that the competitiveness of the European sugar industry has to be increased in order to ensure a sustainable, long-term basis for sugar production within the European Union.
Transferring quotas between Member States is one way of ensuring this.
Alternative and complementary solutions are not to be ruled out and are also being analysed.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Unfortunately, since my last exchange with you, my worst fears have been realised with the closure of one of our two sugar factories in Ireland and the loss of the jobs that the factory provided.
Can I ask you for one assurance, one guarantee at least, that when your proposals finally come before us, you will not allow the sale of quotas across national borders?
It has never been allowed before, and it would certainly mean the end of the Irish sugar industry.
Secondly, in formulating these proposals, have you also looked at the use of alternative industry or energy, particularly with respect to the use of sugar beet in biofuels/bioenergy?
If not, would you give an undertaking to look at it?
Â Â  . Concerning the question of the transfer of quotas, at this stage we are discussing a new sugar reform.
It is, therefore, much too early to start this discussion in Parliament.
We will have many opportunities later on to discuss in detail the different tools in the sugar proposal.
It is obviously not possible for me to give you the guarantee that you want today.
On your other question concerning bio-ethanol, yesterday I decided to form a core group to discuss the possibilities of growing renewable energy crops in European fields.
It is an interesting area and we need to dig deeper into the substance of the matter to see what the possibilities for them are.
Thank you for your advice in this important area.
Â Â  The EUâs agricultural aid does cause great damage to the worldâs poorest countries.
Sugar is also one of the most crucial export products for many of those same poor countries.
That is why the recently implemented sugar reform we are now talking about is extremely important, even if I think it should have gone still further.
I think, in actual fact, that it is quite embarrassing that the EU, which otherwise has free competition as its motto, should go to such lengths to favour its own agriculture.
I want therefore to ask the Commission what further measures it intends to take to reduce the EUâs agricultural aid and thus make it possible for the worldâs poor countries to do something themselves about their at present very difficult situation.
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
The reason why we are now talking about sugar is that we have been making progress and undertaking reforms in many different sectors of agriculture, but sugar has been untouched for the last 40 years.
Therefore, we must reform the sugar industry.
We must do so also because we are now granting access to the EU market to the 49 poorest countries in the world through the 'Everything But Arms' Agreement.
From 2006 to 2009, these countries will have progressive access to the European market at a price higher than the world market price.
In that way they will have a special chance to escape from poverty.
This is also an element of our proposal on sugar.
Â Â  In general, the suffering of poor people in the Third World is not always eradicated by free trade â sometimes quite the opposite.
For example, Brazil has huge concerns about the proposals because the poor and landless there will suffer if sugar production expands massively, as is predicted.
I should like the Commission's view on that.
Secondly, if greater efficiency is to be achieved by freeing up the movement of the beet quota, what are your intentions for the milk quota?
Â Â  . We are now leaving the original question on sugar production in Ireland.
However, I would like to give you ...
Â Â  Commissioner, let me interrupt you.
This supplementary question is not on the same topic.
Â Â  Just to refer to the Commissioner's response to Mr Aylward's original question with regard to the transferability of sugar quotas.
The reason we are discussing this now is because the issue is part of a Commission proposal, and not because it is something that Member States were looking for.
The difficulty and danger is that once you transfer the right and entitlement to a quota, then all production stops and sugar production is amalgamated into big multinational interests, rather than into individual national interests as at present.
These ensure a solid product growth that allows competition and ensures the diversity of supply and production afterwards.
Â Â  . I will not enter into a deep technical discussion on the sugar proposal.
I will just say that I am very much aware of the different opinions on this matter.
I can assure you that I am listening to all stakeholders at this stage.
There are different opinions on how far and how fast we are moving with the new sugar proposal.
However, I am happy to say that all members of the Council, and the Members of the European Parliament, realise that something has to happen with regard to sugar.
If we sit on our hands and do nothing, we will spoil the opportunity for European sugar production to be competitive in the future, and that is not the way to go.
Â Â  First of all, I want to state that I completely agree with the honourable Member that forestry is of crucial socio-economic and environmental importance in the EU, especially in rural districts.
The Commission has just completed an analysis of the measures taken as part of the European forestry strategy over the last five years, and we shall shortly present the results of this analysis, both to the European Parliament and to the Council.
The investigation has been carried out in close cooperation with the relevant interested parties and the Member States, and statements have been collected, for example via an Internet-based forum.
In my view, the Council Resolution of 15Â December on a forestry strategy for the European Union forms a suitable basis for the forestry-related measures and initiatives in the EU.
With regard to the damage that occurred in connection with the latest storm, which also caused a lot of damage in other northern European countries too, I should like, in this House too, to express my sincere sympathy with those who were affected by this disaster.
We are ready as quickly as possible to look into what we can do to remedy the consequences.
Within EU legislation, there are various possible ways of providing aid.
At the request of a country affected by a disaster, the Community action programme for coordinated civil protection in the event of a disaster can form the basis for both facilitating and coordinating aid for other Member States.
On 1Â February, the Swedish authorities also asked for aid from other Member States in the form of electricity generators for use in the hardest hit parts of the country.
It was, in actual fact, possible to comply with the wish within a time frame of less than two days, and both Germany and the Czech Republic in actual fact sent 170 generators to Sweden.
Aid can also be provided from the EUâs Solidarity Fund, which contributes to the initial emergency measures.
Aid from the structural funds can be provided within the framework of the current programmes and, if the production potential both of agriculture and of forestry has been damaged, aid can also be provided for re-establishing and introducing preventive measures within the framework of what is possible in terms of rural district policy.
I can tell you that my department is already in contact with the Swedish authorities and is very sympathetic to the possibility of investigating whether the proposals presented by the Swedish authorities can be implemented in practice.
If the Swedish authorities wish to request aid from the Solidarity Fund, I would recommend them to approach my colleague, Commissioner HÃŒbner, who deals with this specific area.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your detailed answer.
As you said, a lot has happened since I put that question, and I just want to express my gratitude to the Commission for showing such great understanding and for having been so accommodating towards both Sweden and the Baltic countries, which have been hit hard in the way described.
I would say a big thank you for taking the action you have described.
Â Â  I look forward to receiving the report the Commissioner talked about on the development of our forestries.
In the meantime, can she give us an assurance that the single farm payments that are going to come about as a result of decoupling, and which we know will have an environmental element, will have a strong tree-planting element as well?
Will she ensure that these payments are used to encourage farmers to continue to plant trees â and a variety of trees, not just one species?
This does not solve the forestry problem, but it would increase the number of trees across the European Union and bring the environmental benefits to which she has referred.
Â Â  . I completely agree that it is very important to ensure that the number of hectares covered by forest increases.
Within the rural development policy, there are different possibilities currently under discussion on sustaining or supporting the possibility of planting new forests.
It must be said that it is ultimately up to the Member States to decide whether they want to use the different tools and the cofinancing in the rural development policy.
Â Â  As the time allocated to Commission Question Time is at an end, Questions 59 to 103 will be answered in writing(5).
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Grosch, on the report he has produced.
The driving licence directive is very complex and intricate.
Overall, I think that it is a great step forwards in terms of freedom of movement, of reducing the possibility of fraud and of attempting to improve road safety.
More than 40Â 000 people die on Europeâs roads every year, a worrying statistic which requires serious and urgent attention.
One of the most vulnerable categories of victim is motorcyclists. Italy has one third of all the two-wheeled vehicles in the whole of Europe, and 60% of the scooters.
That is why I followed the debate on age limits with concern, but fortunately it resulted in the acceptance of a certain amount of flexibility. In Italy, for instance, youngsters can ride mopeds from the age of 14, and several studies have shown that that is not the age group at greatest risk.
In our country, especially in the major cities, scooters and mopeds are extremely popular forms of transport and are valid alternatives to cars. The way to improve road safety is certainly not to take them out of circulation but to teach people how to ride safely, by introducing training and preparation courses in schools.
In general, the step-up approach is worthwhile, but the report introduces excessive regulation which does not improve the Commissionâs proposal and does not lead any closer to the goal of harmonisation.
What sense is there in granting a motorcycle licence at the age of 24 and allowing for the possibility of a car licence at just 17?
Lastly, introducing tests for access to every category does not allow users and much less the authorities to manage and monitor the system, and there is not the slightest guarantee that safety will be improved.
The issue needs to be addressed boldly, without penalising motorcyclists more than drivers of other categories just to ease our consciences.
I call on all my fellow Members to think carefully about these two points, so as to raise safety standards and achieve the goal of harmonisation by introducing sensible, feasible and manageable rules.


Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too feel strongly about the aspect of promoting road safety, particularly for motorcycles.


In this respect, I think it would be useful to harmonise four general principles, which are already included in the directive. I am referring to the principle of progressive access and the fundamental role of training; the need not to discriminate between car drivers and motorcyclists in the issuing of licences; the awareness that speed and the power/weight ratio must be regarded as one of the main causes of accidents; and the fact that the situation across Europe is highly diversified.
This diversity should, however, give rise to a strong demand for greater safety and a greater sense of responsibility on the road, but not the establishment of a four-wheeled monoculture over a two-wheeled one.
Within this framework, other colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I are tabling some amendments. On the one hand, they are designed to limit the speed of motorcycles that can be driven at the age of 18 and to recognise the differences among the various countries in the types of vehicles on their roads.

On the other, they reaffirm the principle of progressive access, rewarding driving experience and practical testing when people step up from mopeds to faster motorcycles and considering that, when they move up from one category to another, people have already acquired the skills of driving in urban traffic and behaving correctly towards other road users.
With better harmonisation of these aspects, I believe that the motorcycle issue, which has been raised by many speakers, can be reconciled into a single scheme within the framework of this proposal, on which I congratulate the rapporteur.


Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on driving licences brings more Europe into the everyday lives of our citizens. Legislation is becoming more accessible, more transparent and more efficient in sectors which are basic to our freedom of movement within a single European market.

Our rapporteur, Mr Mathieu Grosch, has come down a long road and has made a huge effort to reconcile various sore points and different practices and has, in his way, contributed to the improvement of this proposal and we thank him for that.
Indeed, a harmonised, but not necessarily homogenised system for issuing driving licences will, to begin with, help combat the fraud and confusion which can easily arise today, due to the variety of different licences which exist in the European Union.
Issuing licences in the form of a plastic card, replacing old licences within 10 years and the facility, albeit optional, to introduce a microchip facilitate controls and reduce the risk of fraud. The mutual recognition of sanctions will help this, thereby promoting an area of security and justice in the European Union.
This proposal for a directive also helps to strengthen road safety, which is the basic objective of the European policy. The right criteria for selecting examiners, their continuing training, periodic medical examinations of drivers, extending the principle of gradual access to driving licences for more powerful types of vehicles are elements which govern the protection of our life, the quality of our life and, finally, our democracy.
They are at the heart of the European social model and we should protect them.
Â Â  Mr President, I strongly support the rapporteur's approach to this issue. In fact, I wonder why we cannot consider moving more quickly to the credit card-size licence.
Considering we transferred from 15 different currencies to the single European currency in a matter of weeks, it seems to me that transferring from 110 different models of licence to a single licence must be a far easier process.
One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular.
It must be a disincentive for them, having also to pay for training and in many cases repeating their tests. This must result in a large number of young people around Europe driving without proper licensing and, therefore, presumably without proper insurance.
I know that in Ireland, the Automobile Association estimated that a fifth of the drivers on our roads have provisional licences. These are licences issued on the basis of paying a fee and getting a licence over the counter.
There is at least a 12-month waiting list to get a test, and if people then fail that test - as a high proportion do - they drive on the roads without adequate training and proper knowledge for a period of at least two years.
Whilst it is a very good idea to have common standards across Europe, we must address the question of whether Member States are ensuring that the people who get these provisional licences in particular, are capable of driving safely.
Road death statistics seem to prove that they do not.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with all due respect, environmental pollution does happen, one way or the other.
The rapporteur has pointed out that we behave in a rather schizoid manner, because whenever there are environmental disasters we are all appalled; this turns to outrage, and the media come running. But the daily â and I repeat daily â pollution scandal in European and international waters seems not to attract widespread public attention.
The figures speak for themselves.
The Commission proposal referred at the time to 390 illegal oil discharges in the Baltic in the year 2001 alone and 596 illegal discharges in the North Sea.
The environmental organisation Oceania estimates that there are three thousand illegal discharges a year in European waters.
This is three thousand too many!
Discharging pollutants must no longer be treated as a minor infringement; it is high time that it was made a criminal offence, with those who commit it being prosecuted and receiving stiff penalties.
Investigation and prosecution depend on the availability of appropriate instruments.
As has been said, the Member States do, of course, have their responsibilities, but in the longer term we shall need an efficient European coastguard.
We shall not have it today or in the immediate future, but I believe it must come in the medium term. The prosecution and sentencing of marine polluters must not be thwarted by nations jealously guarding their rights of jurisdiction.
Tomorrow, Parliament, the Council and the Commission will decide on a reasonably fair compromise, and the rapporteur can claim a great deal of the credit for its coming to pass.

I should like to congratulate her and thank her for a very, very good piece of work, which has ensured that we are able to discuss this today and complete the process tomorrow, in other words that we do not need to activate the conciliation procedure but can proceed straight to adoption.
It its framework agreement, the Council undertakes to impose severe penalties for criminal marine pollution: fines, imprisonment and prohibition of economic activity. The Commission and the Council intend to pursue the matter in the IMO.
It defies comprehension, for example, that shipowners can still insure themselves against fines for marine pollution.
Such rules need to be amended in the IMO framework. By agreeing to a feasibility study, we shall be taking an important first step towards a European coastguard.
I will also, therefore, compliment the presidency on its fruitful cooperation with us on this issue. Luxembourg does not readily spring to mind when you think of countries with long coastlines, but at least it does have a very large fleet, which also imposes responsibility on this presidency, to which my thanks are also due.
I believe all of us bear a great deal of responsibility for the natural world, including the seas and oceans. This is why tomorrowâs decisions must be very quickly implemented.
Our coasts, our seas and our marine life will thank us for it.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for his interesting remarks.
This is, as others have said, an important piece of legislation for maritime safety and for forcing ships to act responsibly.
As Mr Piecyk, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Mr Papadimoulis and others have said, most oil pollution does not come from the disasters which get the headlines, but from deliberate discharges.
It is vital that we combat these illegal acts together in a vigorous way, and this compromise is a positive step forward.

Cooperation on European issues to counter criminality or carelessness is important and I yield to no one in my determination to do all that we can to prevent pollution and protect the environment.
We will also achieve far more if we work together as a European Union rather than as individual countries.
Therefore, as Mr Blokland has said, we will await the feasibility study on the issue of a European coastguard with great interest. At present, as I understand it, the functions of national coastguards vary considerably from country to country.
Some are concerned with border protection and countering illegal immigration; others to counter pollution along the lines we have described. In some countries their responsibilities include search-and-rescue operations, which might be the responsibility of the military in others.
From the UK's point of view, its coastguard functions include search-and-rescue and its borderline of responsibility, the zone, abuts those of the United States and Canada.
Therefore the area of responsibility for UK coastguards is somewhat larger than that of some of the other countries.
I therefore look forward to this feasibility study with interest. We can reflect on this after the report has been adopted tomorrow and then move forward.




Â Â  MrÂ Attard-Montalto, strictly speaking that was not a point of order; I believe instead that your comments related to a personal accusation.
Commissioner, would you like to provide a further answer?
Â Â  . I apologise.
My aim was to give an entirely honest answer, and I have every respect for the opinions of all those present, even though I may have been a little too passionate in defending this text.
I should like to make it very clear that I have absolutely no intention of accusing Members of this House in any way, and indeed accusing anyone was the last thing I wanted to do. My point is that ships flying flags of third countries are subject to regulations when they enter a Community port; I believe that you agree on this matter, even though I may not be answering your question in full.
If you wish, Mr President, I should like to suggest to MrÂ Attard-Montalto that we hold a face-to-face meeting to clear up the matter. All I have done is to explain which legislation I believe applies to the current situation.
He may have other situations in mind, and so I would suggest that the two of us meet to discuss the issue in more detail.
Â Â  . Mr President, around the world, fish conservation is only effective when it is under national control.
I have spoken to dozens of fishermen in Devon and Cornwall who know precisely how to conserve fish stocks, but nobody ever asks for their advice.
I suggest that the current common fisheries policy, with its totally unworkable quota system designed by office-bound bureaucrats, should be scrapped immediately and replaced by a new fisheries policy designed by the fishermen themselves.
The problem for Britain has been the strict enforcement of the CFP to the nth degree, first of all by MAFF and then by Defra.
One example was their insistence that a fisherman called Ken Bagley â whom I happen to know very well â should rub his thumb on the underbellies of five tonnes of sprats to ensure that there were no immature herrings in the catch.
In the UK we say 'it takes a sprat to catch a mackerel'.
Perhaps we should be saying 'it takes a sprat to catch a herring'!
Little wonder that Britain's GDP for fishing has gone down from GBPÂ 561 million in 1964 to GBPÂ 520 million in 2003, despite inflation.
In Norway, which controls its own fisheries policy, the figures have increased from NOKÂ 7.5 billion to NOKÂ 10.1 billion over the same period.
The environmental crisis in the North Sea is man-made. It is a classic stratagem of the European Commission to exploit such a crisis in the cause of closer European integration.
This is known as a beneficial crisis. Europe's solution to something which is not working is to put even more Europe into it, thus a new fisheries agency is created, based in Vigo, Spain.
Surprise, surprise! In future, British fishing boats will be policed in our own territorial waters by patrol boats operating under the control of this new agency and sent out on the authority of the EU's inspectorate based in Madrid.
Poor old Francis Drake must be turning in his grave. Perhaps we should get ready to light the beacons!
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure we can all agree that the establishment of a Community fisheries control agency should be welcomed in principle. We hear a lot about the importance of having a level playing field for the application of rules under the common fisheries policy.
The creation of the agency in Vigo has the potential to help create more uniform, more effective control and inspection procedures and so increase compliance. It might also reduce overall expenditure on control and inspection measures.
A feasibility study published after the drafting of the regulation suggested that such potential will only be fulfilled if certain organisational and operational criteria are met.
This led the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, to propose a number of amendments clarifying the text. Many members of the Committee on Fisheries argued that the rapporteur's amendments watered down the role of the agency.
I disagreed with this and supported the draft report in committee. The draft report seemed, to me, to clarify the role and responsibility of the Member States, the Commission and the agency and to improve regional involvement.
Joint deployment plans, involving a pooling by Member States of their inspection and control resources are crucial to the success of the agency's work. The amendment retabled by the rapporteur aimed to make sure that the role of the agency as a facilitator is clear.
I have consistently supported a meaningful role for regional advisory councils in fisheries management.
For this reason I believe it would also be appropriate for RACs to be consulted during the drafting of joint deployment plans. That would help ensure compliance.
Information about the activities of the agency should be widely circulated and an annual assessment given to the European Parliament, the Commission, the Member States, the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the regional advisory councils.
I have had some differences with PSE Group colleagues in defining the role of the agency, but I can certainly join with them in welcoming its creation and looking forward to more effective compliance in our fisheries.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, most of you have probably already heard the news I am about to give you.
It is my sad duty to inform Parliament of the death of our much-loved colleague MrÂ Imbeni.
MrÂ Imbeni was a Member of this House and served as Vice-President for ten years, between 1994 and 2004.
He was a committed parliamentarian, and I had the honour of working with him in COSAC.
Throughout his parliamentary career, MrÂ Imbeni was always eager to share his values and his European ideals with fellow Members.
He threw himself into his daily work, gaining the respect of his colleagues for his approach to conciliation and for his contribution to the many working groups in which he took part.
MrÂ Imbeni was also involved in the Mediterranean Forum and in COSAC, where, as I just mentioned, I was privileged to work alongside him.
The House is proud to have had him as a Member.
MrÂ Imbeniâs work as Vice-President for a whole decade deserves particular recognition.
We remember his wealth of knowledge, his generosity and his friendly smile.
This was how he earned the respect of political friend and foe alike.
MrÂ Imbeni served as Mayor of Bologna for many years, and he made a point of remaining in touch with his electorate and the citizens.
I have sent a telegram to MrÂ Imbeniâs family, expressing condolences on behalf of the whole House.
I trust you will now join me in observing a minuteâs silence in memory of MrÂ Imbeni.
Â Â  Before turning to the agenda for today, which relates essentially to relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean region, it is my duty as President to provide the House with information on the meeting that took place yesterday in Brussels.
As you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, members of the EuropeanÂ Council met in Brussels yesterday, although this was not a Council meeting as such.
MrÂ Barroso, the President of the Commission, and I were both present at the meeting, which was held in order to discuss with MrÂ Bush some of the most important aspects of relations between the United States and the European Union, and the problems we need to face together.
Many, but not all, of the Heads of State or Government who attended were able to take the floor.
I am sure the House will appreciate that the fact that the President of the European Parliament represented the House at this meeting marks another step towards securing the political recognition Parliament deserves.
I should like to thank MrÂ Juncker and Mr Barroso once again for appreciating the role of this House and making it possible for me to attend.
As I said, not all Heads of State or Government took the floor, but when they had finished speaking, the President of the Council invited MrÂ Barroso and me to take the floor briefly, and we did so.
I spoke last, and had very little time at my disposal, as the time allowed for the meeting had already been considerably exceeded.
Nonetheless, I believe we should warmly welcome the fact that the European Parliament was also able to make its voice heard, even though this had not been planned.
In my view, this sets a precedent, further strengthening the role of the European Parliament.
In the short time available I felt bound to refer to the resolution on transatlantic relations voted through by the European Parliament last January.
I took it upon myself to convey what had been discussed and voted on in the House.
I welcomed President Bushâs visit to Europe, and urged him to see it as a turning point, marking a new era when transatlantic relations would be based on multilateralism so as to ensure improved cooperation.
In view of the time constraints, I was unable to mention all the issues I would have liked to refer to.
I chose to focus on the situation in the Middle East and the Kyoto Protocol.
As to the former, along with the Heads of State or Government who had spoken earlier, I emphasised that there was now a window of opportunity that had to be exploited.
I stated that fortunately we shared the same vision of the problem, namely guaranteeing the security of the State of Israel whilst providing for the establishment of a Palestinian State that would be geographically, politically and economically viable.
I confirmed that the European Parliament supported what President Bush had said, and that we hoped to work with him to put his ideas into practice.
With regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I emphasised the importance the European Parliament has always ascribed to that international agreement, and the need for the United States to play its part in the essential effort required to fully implement it.
I stated the need for us to continue working together, or at least, talking together, to ensure we each made our contribution to solving this global problem.
I suggested that if it proved impossible to do so by means of the Kyoto Protocol, as the United States had decided not to sign it, then we use all the tools available in the field of technological development to counter global environmental problems.
That was all I was able to convey, focusing on two issues to which the House has devoted a good deal of political energy and debate.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Before starting work on todayâs agenda it is my pleasure to welcome MrÂ SamÂ Rainsy to the House.
MrÂ Rainsy leads one of the opposition parties in the Cambodian Parliament, and is seated in the public gallery today.
It is appropriate to recall at this time and in this Chamber what I have already stated in writing to the President of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
I made it clear that respect for political pluralism is absolutely essential to the functioning of democratic institutions and that the human rights situation in Cambodia continues to give rise to concern.
MrÂ Rainsy, I should like to assure you and your colleagues of our solidarity at this difficult time.
We wish you every success in your efforts to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy in your country.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on EU relations with the Mediterranean region.
I would remind the House that the European Parliament is due to assume the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly very soon, in the middle of March.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have already had occasion to stress how important this presidency considers Mediterranean policy to be when meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
It is in fact the continuation of a process that began when the European Council decided to extend the European Unionâs common strategy for this region, a region to which a number of Member States to some extent also belong.
We have therefore demonstrated the EUâs substantial interest in and firm commitment to this region.
This extension will allow the European Unionâs relations with the Mediterranean region to be examined in the light of the European Councilâs assessment of the strategic partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East in June 2005, of the Barcelona Process in the context of its tenth anniversary in 2005 and of the development of European neighbourhood policy over the same period.
This commitment was reiterated at the recent Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting in The Hague on 29 and 30 November 2004, which confirmed the centrality of the Barcelona Process, backed up by the European neighbourhood policy for the Mediterranean.
It is a process whereby the European Union and the Mediterranean partners work together towards political, economic and social reform objectives involving the societies concerned.
Those same objectives are also taken up in the European Unionâs strategic partnership for the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.
More than ever, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is an essential and special regional framework for dialogue and cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean.
The meeting in The Hague was the second ministerial meeting following the meeting held in Naples and preceding the one to be held in Luxembourg on 30 and 31 May 2005.
In this context, preparations have already begun for the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, which will be marked in Barcelona in November 2005.
Ministers have also agreed to undertake an overall review of the process and declare 2005 the year of the Mediterranean.
So far as the European Unionâs political and security dialogue with its Mediterranean partners is concerned, the Hague ministerial meeting confirmed the progress that has been made with cooperation in counter-terrorism, regional security and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as European security and defence policy.
Partnership measures like the holding of a diplomatic seminar in Malta, cooperation in the field of civil defence and disaster management, or the Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission or EuroMeSCo network of foreign policy institutes, are making a substantial contribution to bringing the Euro-Mediterranean partners closer together.
These efforts are also aimed at the implementation of political reforms and cooperation on human rights and democratisation, and are based on civil society through commitments entered into either by way of association agreements or, where necessary, as part of European neighbourhood policy.
In this connection, the action plans agreed with a number of partners give a central place to human rights, democratisation, good governance and strengthening the rule of law.
In like vein, the creation of the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue of Cultures is a key step in the implementation of the Barcelona Processâs social, cultural and human partnership.
All members of the partnership must take advantage of its inauguration to increase the visibility of the Barcelona Process on both sides of the Mediterranean.
Mr President, I believe this is an historic moment, especially as far as the Middle East conflict is concerned.
I believe the Barcelona Process should both accompany the relaunching of the peace process and also benefit from its relaunch, and I believe Europeâs future is also the future of the Mediterranean region, the future of its development, the future of cultural exchange and the future of cooperation with those who are very close to us.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate on EU-Mediterranean relations.
The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process.
I wish to express my gratitude, especially to many individual Members who are enthusiastic supporters of Euromed relations, for your role as a driving force behind the Union's active involvement in this region.
I have had a great personal interest in this region ever since I became aware of how crucial the peace process is for the Middle East.
As my colleague has just said, there is a real moment of hope, although we know that the process is a fragile one.
I visited the region the day before Sharm el-Sheikh.
I had the chance to see the leaders who have taken really courageous steps.
I told them that we have to go on and that both sides have to consolidate this new path to peace in the Middle East, especially by seizing the opportunities of, on the one hand, the platform â the Quartet â and, on the other hand, the roadmap.
A successful disengagement in Gaza is a priority for all of us.
Two days ago, the Israeli Government took a very courageous decision when Prime Minister Sharon and his cabinet decided to do that.
We know that this is a risky process, but we must do everything possible to make this happen.
In addition to the Mediterranean partnership, the tenth anniversary of which we will celebrate this year, the European neighbourhood policy, under which we have already adopted five action plans for the southern Mediterranean countries, is also important.
The European neighbourhood policy means emphasising our common bonds through geography, history, trade, migration and culture by bringing these countries, as a ring of friends, closer to the European Union.
The neighbourhood policy does not replace the Barcelona Process, but is there to reinforce it by means of a tailor-made bilateral process.
Let me say a brief word now on Lebanon.
We are all shocked and saddened by the assassination ten days ago of former Prime Minister Hariri.
Mr Hariri was one of the main architects of the agreements that brought the long-awaited end to the civil war in Lebanon.
He was a man committed to peace and reconciliation, to the reconstruction of the war-torn country and also to the promotion of cooperation and stability in the region.
The best tribute to his relentless efforts would be to ensure that free and fair parliamentary elections, under full Lebanese sovereign control, take place in May.
It is in the interests of Lebanon and of the stability of the country that the circumstances of this criminal act, and the identities of those responsible for it, are clarified as soon as possible.
I spoke out at a very early stage in favour an international investigation, which I believe the United Nations will now carry out.
The Commission has also attached the utmost importance to a full and prompt implementation by all parties of UN Security Council ResolutionÂ 1559.
This resolution calls for free and fair elections without foreign interference, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the extension of government control to all Lebanese territories.
As we have already mentioned, 2005 will be year of EU-Mediterranean relations.
Since there are signs that the cycle of violence between the two sides can be broken, we have to do everything we can to consolidate the ceasefire and secure withdrawal from Gaza, and then move forward with the roadmap for a two-state solution.
In March, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will meet for the second time in Cairo.
I regret that I will be unable to attend.
However, three weeks ago I met the members of the political bureau of that Assembly in Brussels, where I also attended a debate.
At the end of May, Euro-Mediterranean ministers will meet in Luxembourg for the seventh Barcelona Conference.
In November, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the partnership, and the Commission is already in the process of preparing a communication to the European Parliament and the Council to mark the occasion, containing specific proposals.
I shall outline those proposals very briefly.
The first is to increase the impact of our policies by contributing to the pursuit of reform, peace and stability in the region.
The second is to bring the partnership closer to our citizens' concerns.
The Barcelona Process has, to a large extent, been an intergovernmental process.
It is high time that we asked ourselves what the partnership can do for people's concerns.
How can we tackle more successfully such issues as education, employment, gender equality, democracy, the free movement of persons, and migration rights?
These are the questions that affect the day-to-day life of our citizens, and our partnership should address them.
I would like to give you some thoughts on the priorities for the years ahead.
We should reflect on how we can best make use of the Barcelona Process to contribute to this new momentum in the Middle East peace process, as well as to safeguard peace once we have it.
We should also address political reform with our partners â Members will be aware of the G8 initiative.
I was at the Rabat forum â Members will be aware that Cairo will now be postponed to a later date.
I want to go there because I believe we can do a lot to achieve the same goals in complementary and parallel ways.
We should address the practical aspects of counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The European Union has an impressive record in democracy building, including in the new Member States.
I think we should use this experience to build democracies and support these countries' reforms: what we Europeans have to do is to try to encourage reforms, not impose them.
Education is one of the most fundamental issues for the future of the region.
Therefore, the European Union and our partners should increase spending on education, and I will do what I can with my own services to foster more education projects, at elementary level, at the level of vocational training or at higher, university and university exchange levels.
We should set a target date for eradicating illiteracy and focus on the critical issue of improving the quality of, and access to, education, especially for girls.
Together we could organise schemes for student exchanges: I think this is crucial, if we consider what Europe and the United States have done since the war and how important that has been.
We should promote the study of European integration.
In trade and economic relations, we should reconfirm the 2010 target for free trade; agree a roadmap with a timetable for free trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products; decide on a timetable for the liberalisation of services; accelerate south-south free trade â the Agadir process was very important; use the neighbourhood policy to help partners to eliminate obstacles to investment; and hold a meeting of transport ministers to extend transport corridors to the Mediterranean with the financial support of the EIB.
Finally, on the issue of migration and social integration, we should promote a joint cooperative approach to managing the movement of people.
We should also implement European neighbourhood action plans and commitments on the social integration of migrants.
The broader Middle East and North African initiative is a very interesting one.
The Commission will certainly be very much involved in it, in a complementary but parallel way, and I hope that together we can achieve important goals, in terms not only of democracy, reform and the modernisation of these countries, but also of a real common partnership.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is highly symbolic that Viktor Yushchenko, the President of Ukraine, the EU's largest neighbour on its eastern border, is about to address the House on a day when we are also debating the EU's relations with its southern neighbours in the Mediterranean region.In the North, there is Norway, with which relations are friendly; in the West, there is the Atlantic, which means that our primary focus must be on our neighbours to the east and south.
With all our neighbours, we want to pursue a policy of dialogue, partnership and, if possible, friendship.
Our parliamentary group â like the House as a whole â actively supported the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the best tribute that we can pay to our late fellow-MEP Mr Renzo Imbeni is to make this Assembly a genuinely effective and forward-looking parliamentary body.
With our support, and together with our colleague Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, it was Renzo Imbeni who created this Parliamentary Assembly.
Let us honour him by doing good work there.
We want to work towards joint solutions with our partners in the Mediterranean region, your personal commitment to which, Commissioner, I regard as very commendable.
I myself would have welcomed a Commission decision to appoint a Commissioner responsible solely for the Mediterranean region, but I have no doubt that your tremendous involvement will amount to virtually the same thing.
Our task, then, is to discuss the future of the Mediterranean region with our partners, and, to the Arab and Islamic world, we say this: we want partnership rather than a clash of civilizations, and our relations with the Arab and Islamic world are among our key policy priorities.
This includes achieving peace between Israel and Palestine.
To President Bush, who is visiting Europe from the United States, we say this: let us make a joint effort to ensure that Israel can exist within secure borders and Palestine can exist within secure borders.
After all, both countries â if I may call Palestine a country â are represented in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and we must use our opportunities there to bring peace to this region.
We urge Syria â with which we are about to conclude an Association Agreement â to renounce all activities that encourage terrorism, and to give Lebanon a genuine chance.
Its former Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, has been assassinated along with his bodyguards, and we must find out who is responsible.
We urge Syria to make its contribution to peace.
Let me make one final comment: we want partnership, we want economic contacts, we want political contacts, and we want guaranteed human rights across the Mediterranean region.
This too is a significant contribution to dialogue, partnership and peace in the Mediterranean.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that the Council has decided to make 2005 the Year of the Mediterranean.
Precisely for this reason, we hope that the Union will have a more important political role in this area.
The Mediterranean is now our priority, because that is where the greatest challenges lie regarding peace, security, the fight against terrorism, development, respect for rights, protection of the environment and positive management of immigration.
The neighbourhood policy must strengthen the spirit of Barcelona, in line with the partnership method which we could today steer in the direction of codevelopment.
Ten years on from the Barcelona Intergovernmental Conference in 1995, although the results have essentially not lived up to the expectations created by this process, we must, in any case, acknowledge the progress made with regard to mutual relations and the improved application of the MEDA programme.
We are encouraged, then, by the resumption of dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority following the presidential elections in Palestine.
At the same time, we are aware of the complexity of the whole Middle Eastern situation and we are concerned by the situation in Lebanon, following the bomb attack which caused the death of former PrimeÂ Minister RafiqÂ Hariri.
Moreover, we would urge Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and, in the same vein, we hope that Israel will pull out of the Golan Heights.
This all means that the time may have come to resolve the whole Middle Eastern conflict.
In this context, we appreciate the role played by Egypt, but at the same time we are troubled by the internal situation of that country where, precisely in the past few days, MrÂ AymanÂ Nour, a member of the Egyptian Parliament, was arrested and detained.
Lastly, we are calling for a more incisive and coherent role for the European Union in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the whole region.
The neighbourhood policy should have more appropriate instruments and institutions.
We would therefore invite the Commission and the Council to take greater account of the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, a fundamental democratic instrument which should be supported and strengthened, and which was established through the efforts of men like MrÂ RenzoÂ Imbeni.
The Assembly is taking its first steps: it is the first time that it is meeting outside Europe, in Cairo, and we hope that it can hold an extraordinary meeting, presided by you, PresidentÂ BorrellÂ Fontelles, precisely on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while I fully agree with the text of the joint resolution which will shortly be put to the vote in this House, I would like to join you, Commissioner, in stressing two points about this text: one concerning the resumption of dialogue between the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the other about the situation created in Lebanon by the assassination of Rafiq Hariri.
So far as the new prospects opened up between Israel and Palestine are concerned, I want to repeat what I have already said many times in this House.
If, as we all hope, a peace agreement is reached, the experience gained from decades of conflict resolution in such situations shows that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to do without the services of peacekeeping troops if the incidents that inevitably happen under such conditions, because local warlords are incapable of accepting peace, are not to degenerate into conflagration.
I think a European force would be more likely than any other to be accepted by both sides for such a task.
My question to the Council, Mr President-in-Office, is therefore: is it not time we prepared ourselves for that?
Turning to the situation in Lebanon, as you have all reiterated, we and the international community have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory.
Has the time not come, Commissioner, for us to call on Syria finally to heed these calls before the association agreement on which negotiations have now been concluded is signed?
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my colleagues and I are very pleased that this year, 2005, will see the renewal and relaunching of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, because that is how we have always referred to the Barcelona Process, in order to emphasise both all the hope it has raised and all the disappointments which are growing as the days go by.
My colleagues have referred to the despicable and abhorrent assassination of RafiqÂ Hariri, following which a question mark now hangs over that part of the world, just when a glimmer of light was appearing in the Middle East that we want to foster and see grow.
We need to go beyond the wishes we have been reiterating for 10 years and think about how we can really achieve some progress on the main issues regarding democracy and human rights in that part of the world, because it is those fundamental issues that underpin the fight against terrorism, the issues of peace and stability and development. As the Arab Bureau never tires of saying in its different United Nations development reports, it is on this fundamental issue of democratic foundations, of individual and collective freedoms in that part of the world that we need to work.
We have several ways forward.
The Commission also has several ways forward, which it has set out in a communication in the form of 10 extremely precise recommendations.
I believe that appropriate tools, the national action plans, the creation of the human rights subcommittees as part of this process, that is to say the new neighbourhood policy, are really needed to help us to implement those 10 recommendations, which as you said, Commissioner, go beyond the purely intergovernmental approach in that part of the world.
That is what the strength, the potential power of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also of the Euromed civil society platform is all about, because we are all aware that our ambitious aims of democracy and development in that region can only come about with the deep commitment of those societies themselves.
We will shortly be welcoming Mr Yushchenko.
We know that all our policies and all our aspirations depend first and foremost on the energy of the societies themselves to free themselves from complex situations that destroy freedom.
I believe that is what we must âŠ
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to point out three areas in which the Commissionerâs statements struck me as vague or imprecise.
The first of those areas is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
We are all aware that the cease-fire that has been declared is very important for Palestine to be able to conclude its democratic election process.
A cease-fire is not the same thing as peace, however, and Israel continues to take prisoners while it releases prisoners.
Israel continues to redesign the West Bank wall while it prepares to abandon Gaza.
The truth is that it is planning to turn Palestine into a Bantustan.
Europe has everything to gain from being clear on this matter.
You also spoke very generically, Commissioner, about the second aspect, immigration.
Historically, the Mediterranean has been a sea of communication, a bridge between people and a thoroughfare for trade and cultures.
We Europeans, however, have turned it into a modern-day moat, in which, over the past ten years, 4Â 000 men and women have drowned their hopes.
Our duty, Commissioner, is not to turn the countries of the south into the policemen of those seeking better living conditions, but to replace the current immigration policy with one that seeks to strike a balance in migratory flows in both directions.
This is the only way in which we will have the moral authority to address the issue of human rights without hypocrisy.
This is the only way in which we will be able to condemn, for example, the appalling conditions suffered by the thousands of Sudanese treated as slaves in Libya.
The Barcelona Process will either be a large-scale Euro-Mediterranean pact, whereby peace, democracy and human rights are exchanged by means of economic and social integration, or will be nothing more than a letter of intent.
Â Â  . Mr President, who would say ânoâ to being master in their own house?
Most of the Lebanese would not either, but reality is different.
Years of Syrian military presence on their own territory is smarting ever more, and the cowardly assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hariri, is now turning a remorseless spotlight onto this international grief about a lack of Lebanese sovereignty.
How could the European Union, given this situation, ever conclude an association agreement with Beirut?
And how can the Council and the Commission now present Parliament with a similar agreement with occupier Damascus, as if Resolution 1559 of the UN Security Council which demands Syria to pull out, did not mean anything to Brussels?
I drew some strength, though, from the Commissionerâs attention to observing this resolution.
In fact, that self-same Resolution 1559 stipulates the disbanding of the Lebanese Shiite terrorist organisation Hezbollah, which, armed to the teeth and trained by its patrons Syria and Iran, operates from the south of the country against Israel.
This is nevertheless time for the Council and the Commission to take action in respect of Damascus and Teheran.
Such European political decisiveness also promotes the new opportunities for the Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
The fact is that recent statements by the present Palestinian leadership leave the European Union no other choice.
Those statements are unambiguous.
Hezbollah is not interested in Palestinian negotiations with Israel and puts up no less than USD 100Â 000 for Palestinian suicide attacks.
Palestinian circles therefore, do not rule out terror from Hezbollah against its own negotiators.
I urge the Council to be resolute and finally place Hezbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations.
Only then will the Member States be credible in respect of the United States and, certainly not unimportantly, just as much in respect of the non-Member States across the entire Mediterranean.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, ten years after the Barcelona Declaration, there is still a long way to go before the objectives laid down by that Conference are achieved in the Mediterranean.
This is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have to face the facts pragmatically and without hypocrisy.
The social, economic, cultural and human partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean is proceeding on a foundation of uncertainty and contradictions.
The Barcelona Process has moved forward slowly, in particular with regard to the implementation of the MEDA programme, whose pace has quickened only in recent years.
The European Union has been incapable of playing a significant, decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The outrageous trafficking in illegal immigrants between the two sides of the Mediterranean is a continuing sign of the failure of the cooperation policy that was hoped for between the countries of departure and the countries of arrival.
We wish to remain optimistic, however, and we welcome the positive signals coming from that area.
The changed behaviour of the Libyan Government towards international terrorism, the recent breakthrough in relations between Israel and Palestine and the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly all give us reason to hope.
The European Union needs, at last, to take on a more powerful political role in order to bring about a genuine climate of cooperation, growth and peace in the area.
Otherwise, this tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Conference, this 2005 dedicated to the Mediterranean, is likely to be seen just as a year marked by our weakness.
Â Â  Mr President, I had the privilege of representing this House at the funeral of Yasser Arafat.
Later, I chaired the observer delegation to the Palestine elections.
Last year I visited Egypt, Algeria, Yemen and Syria, following the path of Arab reform.
Regrettably, the threat of terrorism remains all too real in much of the region.
While in Palestine, and in a purely private capacity, I had a meeting with representatives of Hamas on the West Bank, on the basis that they had fought the municipal elections in Palestine.
I urged them then, and I urge them again today, to take part in the parliamentary elections on 17 July.
However, before doing so, Hamas must not only renounce violence, but also hand in its weapons to the Palestine security forces.
Rightly, others have paid tribute to Mr Imbeni, my predecessor as Vice-President representing Parliament on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
MrÂ Trakatellis and I assist you, Mr President, in that work.
I believe that the Arabs deserve democracy.
President Bush rightly talks about Arab freedom.
My distant relation, T. E. Lawrence of Arabia, once wrote: 'I wrote my will across the sky in stars to earn you freedom, that seven-pillared worthy house.'
The question today is who will give the Arabs freedom, the stars and stripes or the stars of the European Union?
I believe we should work together, but I say to the Americans that this is our neighbourhood.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, allow me to follow on from MrÂ McMillan-Scottâs closing words.
The European Union must be involved in transforming the Mediterranean region into an area of peace and cooperation.
You will understand, therefore, that, although I agree with the statements made by MrÂ Schmit and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I believe they are short on ambition and political determination.
It seems to me that we are stuck in a rut.
Forward progress is being made, but the will to press for more and better progress, and for what is actually required right now is lacking.
There have been many references to an alliance of civilisations, and the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is the best possible example of such an alliance.
Unilateralism has no part to play in it.
A shared model of values and objectives is called for.
This must include democracy and full respect for human rights, security, negotiated solutions to all the conflicts in the region, on both shores of the Mediterranean, and the fight against terrorism.
It must, of course, also encompass disarmament, aid for sustainable development, respect for the environment and forward-looking management of migratory flows.
The Prime Minister of Spain made all this very clear yesterday at the meeting in Brussels, when he explained how the Union conceives the Euro-Mediterranean process.
It so happens that 2005 has been declared the Year of the Mediterranean.
This must not be an excuse for yet another calendar full of pretty pictures.
There are more than enough of those around already.
In addition, the Association Agreements have proved to be effective instruments.
A parliamentary process is under way too, in the shape of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly due to meet in Cairo in the near future.
There are other goals to be met also, such as the free exchange area that should be in place by 2010, with a new social dimension.
This is all to take place in the context of a new neighbourhood policy, with five new Action Plans and even the launch of South-South cooperation.
I believe the verdict on the Euro-Mediterranean process has to be positive.
Obviously, there are shortcomings, but we Europeans are sometimes inclined to indulge in too much self-criticism.
There are bound to be shortcomings, but we are building on everything that has been achieved over the last ten years.
A dose of ambition is now called for, and we need to make more of the successes.
A Euro-Mediterranean Summit will be held in November.
This will be an occasion for a political commemoration of the Barcelona Process through the launch of new measures.
It seems most appropriate that an Extraordinary Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is also to be held in November, bringing a political dimension to the aforementioned celebration.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Mediterranean region certainly is an area where consistent and committed action by the European Union can have a real impact.
It can lead to tangible results helping the citizens regain hope for their future whilst respecting them as what they are.
Such a future must be characterised by stability and gradual economic growth and also by full respect for human rights.
I should like to focus on two particular issues in the agenda, because I feel they are particularly important to the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
Firstly, it is absolutely crucial to engage civil society in this process, ensuring that the citizens, their organisations and associations understand that their future lies in their own hands, not in the hands of top politicians.
Secondly, trade needs to be given a real boost. It must be effectively promoted and a genuine free exchange and free trade area set up.
I refer to South-South free trade amongst themselves. Too many of their borders are still closed.
Of course, there must also be a South-North free trade area in which we are involved.
This will be achieved by setting up a genuine free trade area between the European Union and the Mediterranean area.
I believe these two issues are of vital importance.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Arab world and the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean are changing â and this change is long overdue.
Only a few years ago, this region was largely at a standstill as far as democracy-building and human rights were concerned.
We are pleased that Turkey, for example, has signalled its intention of playing a more prominent role in the dialogue with the Arab world, notably on the issue of women's rights and democratisation.
This shows that the European Union's policy of gradually bringing Turkey closer to Europe is the right one.
Furthermore, despite all the problems, the emergence of a younger generation of leaders â in Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and indeed Syria, for example â has created the opportunity for a cautious opening towards democracy.
We expressly welcome the release of political prisoners and the increased scope for political opposition.
The issue of women's rights in Morocco and the debate about the introduction of a divorce law in Jordan are just two examples that I would like to highlight.
Let me conclude with the Middle East conflict.
A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will help to ensure that hopefully, the spurious excuse that this conflict makes democracy impossible can no longer be used in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago in Barcelona, the European Union and its neighbours in the Mediterranean region launched an ambitious programme which sought to create an area of stability, peace and economic progress in the region by means of closer, mutual understanding.
We have not managed to achieve everything and must relaunch the whole process more effectively.
This year, 2005, could be our opportunity.
Above all, we wanted an area of lasting peace, and these ten years have unfortunately been more difficult than the previous ones in terms of relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, whose conflict has in some ways affected the stability of the Euro-Mediterranean area.
Today, however, tangible facts appear to show that it is possible to overcome misunderstandings and tensions and resolve the ten-year-long conflict in that area.
On the other hand, we must mention a positive accomplishment: the launch of the AnnaÂ Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria in Egypt.
We expect it to play a major part in boosting cultural exchanges between all countries in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and in the growth of a dynamic civil society which is as pluralist as possible in those countries which are still lagging behind.
The Commission could and should consider links between the Foundation and other more minor Euro-Mediterranean satellite cultural centres located throughout the area, which can equally spread the same messages of friendship, mutual understanding and peace among the peoples of the Euro-Mediterranean region, and which serve as cultural, research and training centres, including for the many immigrants in that area.
In short, we wish to obtain the necessary impetus from the ups and downs of these first ten years in order to look ahead with renewed confidence.
Â Â  â Sometimes the measures adopted by the European Union as regards the Mediterranean, were not always enough to render the Euro-Mediterranean policy a positive and concrete one.
A clear example for me is the illegal/irregular immigration tragedy that exists in an alarming way in the Mediterranean.
I believe that the European Union could have treated this phenomenon with more energy and urgency.
This is not a situation that pertains to this region alone and therefore the 'burden-sharing' principle, not the 'burden-shifting' principle, should be adopted.
This is an international issue and it requires an international solution, possibly joint initiatives between the United Nations and the European Union.
While I appreciate that recently there was more commitment from the Council and the Commission, I hope that the necessary funds will be available so that these intentions can be translated into effective results.
Without any doubt, the Barcelona process was fundamental so that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is given the due importance.
However, it may be the case that, as happened with the Lisbon agenda, the time is ripe for this process to be reviewed so that, in the first place, we gauge how successful we were in achieving our aims successfully, as in the case of the creation of a free industrial trade area in the Mediterranean.
In my opinion, we should revive this process, if need be.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I have several comments would like to make, having had the opportunity to visit the Middle East with the Commissioner just before the Sharm el Sheikh summit.
As regards the Middle East programme as a whole, we know that stable development â through better economic and social conditions and through democracy-building â is very important.
However, we also know that this will only work in the long term if the Middle East is able to solve its own problems, because they are the cause of, or an alibi for, many others.
That is why the present situation in the Middle East is immensely important, especially since I believe there is a real chance, for the first time, of reaching an agreement.
I say this on the basis of my visit there, when I met with leading representatives of the Palestinians and Israel and each ascribed positive motives to the other.
That is the crucial difference compared with the previous situation, and it is the key basis on which to build a successful process.
We must ensure that the Middle East Quartet now meets together in the region at last.
It should not just rely on the written roadmap; it should visit the region as a joint body.
We must ensure that we support the framework conditions that will facilitate an agreement between the leaders of the two sides.
This includes bringing clear influence to bear on Iran and Syria in order to stop Hezbollah from wrecking the peace process from outside.
We must support President Abbas so that the Palestinian people can see that peace benefits everyone.
That is why assistance must be provided very swiftly.
I do realise, Commissioner, that this House has always taken a very critical line on this issue.
What is needed now, though, is swift action.
This does not mean that something should be done through some programme or other at some point in time; it means making it clear, preferably before the parliamentary elections in summer, that it is worth taking the moderates' side.
In this way, the cycle of violence can be broken, which is essential if the Israeli leaders are to secure the necessary support from their own people by being able to say to them that the peace process means no more terrorism.
Prompt action is therefore required.
Â Â  Mr President, the assassination ofÂ RafiqÂ Hariri in Lebanon has reawakened the argument surrounding the EU-Syria association agreement and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, just when the Bush and Chirac governments are making peace with each other around the idea of a free and sovereign Lebanon.
The European Parliamentâs position on the sovereign right of nations to self-determination has always been very clear.
It has consistently rejected any form of overt or covert occupation, be it in Palestine, Iraq or other countries of the world.
For a great variety of reasons, however, most often political and historical ones, action has rarely been taken against foreign forces.
Today, the death of Mr Hariri, whose unknown assassins are still on the loose, again raises this question and many others.
Should we or should we not ask the Syrians to refrain from all interference in Lebanese affairs?
My answer is yes.
Should they at last put an end to the state of emergency in which their country has been for over 30 years?
Yes.
Should they thoroughly democratise their society and release activists from prison?
My answer is clear, it is yes.
Should they withdraw their troops from Lebanon?
Yes, and they have started to do so.
Should we, as General Morillon suggests, make signing the Syria-EU cooperation agreement dependent on these conditions, and in particular the immediate withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon?
That is my question to the Council.
The question is crucial.
Mr Haririâs death has both everything and nothing to do with the answer.
This assassination must certainly be fully investigated and there must be an international inquiry.
Having said that, I really want to ask the Council whether it is appropriate to sign an agreement that has been awaited for so long, since it is the last of the MEDA agreements and has been deferred so many times.
Once it is signed, whether we like it or not, this agreement will inevitably be in the spotlight, and we, the European Union, will be forced to justify our idea of European foreign policy and its democratic basis to public opinion.
That is no idle question, it is a question that I ask myself and that we are all asking ourselves.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what prospects has the Barcelona Process opened up, 10 years on?
During that time, Europe has been greatly preoccupied with its own organisation and enlargement.
It has not always given its southern flank the attention it deserved.
At the same time, the Israel-Palestine conflict has blocked the overall development dynamic by capturing all the attention in the region.
Today there is an urgent need to get the process moving again.
Tools are in place: association agreements, a neighbourhood policy and in particular the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which is a great democratic step forward in this process.
There is also the establishment of the Anna Lindh Foundation to encourage dialogue between cultures and civilisations.
Furthermore, there is the idea, which is already well advanced, of setting up a Euro-Mediterranean development bank to promote employment, health and education in the countries of the South.
Other civil society organisations are being formed.
All these projects are making progress, but two things are essential if they are to be effective.
The first is to get the wind of political reform blowing, and the nations of the South are ready to back it.
The second is to establish a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.
The present circumstances are favourable but very fragile.
Europe needs to be more committed.
All these projects are converging towards greater peace, security and shared prosperity, but much too slowly.
Europe has understood that there is no war of civilisations, but that an alliance of civilisations is necessary, because after dismantling a wall in the East, Europe now has to build a bridge to the South.
Â Â  â Mr President, if in the past Braudel, the important French historian, highlighted in his work the political and economic importance of the Mediterranean to Europe, international and regional developments over recent years are making the Mediterranean an area of strategic importance to the future of the European Union.
It is true that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, as shaped in Barcelona in 1995, has become embroiled in the Arab-Israeli conflict and has not brought about the expected results.
Today, the European Union should, alongside the implementation of the roadmap for Palestine, take the initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, to design a roadmap for peace between Israel and Syria.
We now need a holistic approach to peace, democracy, security and stability in the Middle East.
Syria, like Israel, should respect the decisions of the UN Security Council on Lebanon and withdraw its troops.
At the same time, we need to re-evaluate the Barcelona Process within the new framework of the European neighbourhood strategy we have designed, in order to avoid overlapping policies and initiatives.
May I close by saying that the European Commission and the Council are being called on to follow up the initiative of the former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, who in 2002 created the initiative for dialogue between the peoples and the cultures of the Euro-Mediterranean area, and the relevant proposals which the Committee of Wise Men took at that time.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think it is very important that we are holding this debate today in the European Parliament.
Without doubt, a great deal can be said about the past, the present and the future of Euro-Mediterranean policy.
I wish to comment on two or three points.
The first point concerns Euro-Mediterranean policy and the situation in the Middle East.
It is a fact that a new wind is blowing at the moment in the Middle East and that is a positive thing; however, history has shown that we always need to approach the peace process with restrained optimism and, in all events, with the will to contribute as the European Union not just economically but also politically.
The second point concerns the countries surrounding Israel and Palestine; the new situation in Lebanon following Hariri's murder, relations with Syria, which require attention and, without doubt, the role of Egypt, which has always played a stabilising role.
I think that we need to look very carefully at our relations with Syria in the future.
Here too there are numerous proposals and numerous alternative solutions.
My third comment concerns Iraq.
It is a fact that, at the moment, we are on the path of reconstruction.
We had the results of the elections, which give a full map of what is happening in this country and, of course, we need to approach our relations with Iraq one step at a time, with the first important element of our assistance being in shaping the new constitution.
As for relations with Iran, and we know about the current debate, I am one of those who would say to you, be careful with the nuclear power, because I am against nuclear power, against nuclear weapons but, at the same time, I would tell you that the approach needs to be an approach with diplomatic means, not with troops and wars.
Wars do not resolve problems, they exacerbate them.
Finally, having thanked the Commissioner for the efforts she has made for Euro-Mediterranean policy, can we please all agree that the European Union needs to be present in the Mediterranean, especially in the Middle East, politically as well as economically?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Barcelona Process is about to celebrate its tenth birthday and peace in the Middle East has never seemed closer.
The time is ripe to remember objectives that are just as topical as ever: the establishment of a common area of peace, stability, and security and of an area of shared prosperity and the bringing together of nations and cultures.
As Mr Javier Solana stressed in June 2004, this partnership is strategic for Europe, always assuming that Europe gives itself the resources to match its ambitions.
First of all, the Barcelona Process must be the first pillar of the European neighbourhood policy, in as much as that policy proposes going much further than mere cooperation, extending to a degree of political and economic integration.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will have to provide the democratic framework for that; it needs to be further strengthened.
The European presidency of the EMPA must enable a balanced partnership to be consolidated.
We should be talking about codevelopment based on common values: democracy, good governance, the status of women, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue.
Finally, these objectives presuppose that Europe makes its Mediterranean policy a budget priority.
Â Â  Mr President, three years ago we were wondering what to do with Iraq.
Some countries joined the coalition, some did not.
The price we all paid was enormous.
Let us support democracy using our European soft means.
Let us support democracy in Palestine by guiding Hamas towards participation in fair elections.
Let us disarm it in our soft way.
How should we do this?
Not via non-transparent budgetary support.
We should fund ambitious and specific projects that directly counter Hamas' demagogic propaganda.
Let us directly finance 200 doctors in the West Bank and let us equip and maintain 100 primary schools in the same area with our full support, clearly acting under the European flag.
This would be a 'soft' way to disarm Hamas.
There is another Soviet style authoritarian regime in our Mediterranean neighbourhood.
We do not need to send troops, and we do not need to sign an association agreement with that regime.
Let us stick with Resolution 1559.
Let us call for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Lebanon.
Let us call for the free and fair elections in Lebanon that Arab street, Beirut, is calling for today.
But let us also separate Syria from Hizbollah, its terrorist companion, with no artificial distinctions between military and social links.
We should put Hizbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations immediately.
Â Â  â This year, 2005, is the Year of the Mediterranean.
The year began with positive signs, in terms of both the democratic process and the peace talks.
In Amman, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assemblyâs Committee on Economic, Financial, Social and Educational Issues attempted to reinforce these signs and give them short- and medium-term objectives aimed at protecting the citizens and development.
Violence has reared its head, though, and Haririâs death has demonstrated the urgent need for the EU to strengthen its role as an active partner.
In Parliament, as in Amman, we all consider peace to be a desirable and necessary factor in prosperity.
In the Middle East, EURÂ 60Â billion is spent every year on arms and cutting this amount by half will release absolutely crucial funds to support development throughout the region.
Accordingly, in this Year of the Mediterranean, and in years to come, the EU must have a clearly defined, practical role.
Economic and regional integration into more globalised markets, such as the EU, must be guaranteed, and the 720Â million inhabitants of the Euro-Med area therefore represent a more significant market than China, a fact that should be taken into account by businesses looking to make investments.
Education and training are key elements in creating an industrial workforce.
The Commission should therefore seek to support measures that encompass the countries of the MEDA Programme and thus open up new horizons.
In order to develop employment, the EU must contribute towards the creation of jobs in industry and support and promote microcredit institutions.
Development and joint initiatives are absolutely crucial, in areas such as water, energy, transport, infrastructures and tourism, to enable social progress and economic and regional integration.
These proposals are crucial if this whole drawn-out story is to have a happy ending and if these people are to dream once again of a prosperous future, and this Year of the Mediterranean is setting a perfect example.
We therefore hope that the EU can be the driving force behind the whole of this process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Mediterranean is a priority area for the European Union.
The countries concerned are neighbours to many Member States, and there are a whole series of historical, political, economic, cultural and human links between us.
We need do no more than think of the considerable number of citizens of those countries resident amongst us.
Of course, the situation of the countries on the southern shore varies.
Most of them are facing great challenges, however.
By way of example I could mention the need to make progress on democracy and respect for human rights, social and economic modernisation, administrative reform and the improvement of public services, especially education. This is because young people make up a large proportion of the large populations of these countries.
I am glad CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldner emphasised education.
Combating terrorism and the mafias involved in illegal immigration more effectively is a further challenge facing the region, as is the fight against corruption.
The European Union and the Member States must encourage its neighbours on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to rise successfully to these challenges.
Dialogue, aid and genuine cooperation at different levels will all help.
For instance, greater political and economic liberalisation and improved education will ensure greater stability in those countries.
Progress of this kind will also help to defeat extremism and fanaticism, because the latter tend to flourish wherever there is poverty and ignorance.
It is important to be aware that the prosperity and stability of those countries is inextricably linked to the prosperity and stability of our own.
We have a shared future.
We cannot afford to neglect each other, and we must cooperate closely.
The basic European instruments designed to allow us to achieve these objectives are the Barcelona Process, the European neighbourhood policy and the action plans.
I am delighted that the Anna Lindh foundation is soon to be launched, and that this House will shortly assume the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Ten years have passed since the start of the Barcelona Process, but we must continue to foster it, so that the citizens of the countries on the southern shore do not feel that an enlarged Europe has forgotten their problems.
Consequently, strong support must be given to the Barcelona Process.
This year, 2005, has been designated the Year of the Mediterranean, which presents a splendid opportunity to revitalise the Barcelona Process, just when the prospects for the Middle East peace process are so much better, as many previous speakers have pointed out.
Â Â  Mr President, when in the autumn of 2003, Mr Mahmoud Abbas had no choice but to step down as Prime Minister because Yasser Arafat did not give him the elbow room to work on peace, few people could imagine that one and a half years later, we would get such an historic opportunity to make peace sustainable â and historic this opportunity truly is.
If we see how Mahmoud Abbas is adopting a pragmatic position, and what Israelâs first reaction is like, but also how the people in Lebanon are claiming their right to freedom and self-determination in a historic manner, I think it is of great importance for Europe to be giving the right signals.
What are those signals?
First of all, we, along with the United States, should press for breathing new life into the roadmap, but also, as Mr Brok said a moment ago, give support to the Palestinians at this particular time, so that the people there realise, the sooner the better, that the pragmatists and moderates can really offer benefits.
Thirdly, we must also give a clear signal, clearer than before, to the ill-intentioned, by which, in particular, I am referring to Hezbollah, to which our attitude in Europe is really odd.
In the case of Hamas, we said at one time that it was, as a whole, both politically and militarily wrong.
Where Hezbollah is concerned, we are still two-faced, because in their case, we say that the military side is wrong, but we can deal with them at a political level.
There is no longer any reason to sustain that division, for that division is implausible.
There is a leader, Mr Nasrallah, who is the political and military leader, and who claims that they are an organisation.
Equally, the second man in the organisation, Sheikh Naim Qassem, says that they are an organisation, that politically and militarily speaking, they have the same objective: âPolitical activity is integrated into resistance operations, it is a inseparable part of the political activityâ.
That is what was said by Hezbollahâs Number Two, and should there be any doubt left, I should like to quote Hezbollahâs representative in the Lebanese Parliament, the one we have dealings with, who states: âHezbollah is an organisation in which all the fighters are simultaneously politicians and fighters. The manner in which some in the West seek to betray Hezbollah does not deceive usâ.
We cannot afford to be naÃ¯ve any longer, particularly at this time.
We must send the right message to the Palestinians, Israelis and the Lebanese who want freedom, by taking a firm line with the evil-minded like Hezbollah.
I know that during the last Council presidency, the Dutch Government tried to move away from this two-faced attitude and place Hezbollah as a whole on the list of terrorist organisations.
I think that the people in the Middle East deserve that signal from the EU as a whole.
I would like to ask the Commissioner, but also the Councilâs representative, whether they would like to elaborate on this.
Why are we still two-faced in our dealings with Hezbollah, and when will we at last come to fight the organisation as a whole by fire and sword, as we do Hamas?
Â Â  Mr President, the relationship with our Mediterranean partners is one of interdependence.
The Barcelona Process is based on the principle of mutual benefit.
On the one hand, Member States are primarily keen to tackle issues such as immigration, terrorism and human rights.
On the other, Mediterranean partners are eager to increase their standard of living and benefit through economic aid and trade.
The solution is, of course, to address the gap between the Union and the Mediterranean region.
Reduce the prosperity gap, and you slow migratory flows.
Address the democracy gap, and you consolidate regional stability.
The theory is simpler than the practice.
The Barcelona Process has tried to do all this, with moderate results.
We have been lacking in three areas: visibility â convincing people that we are in this together on all issues; prioritisation â trying to do everything, but ending up doing little; and implementation â through financing.
Surely, if Member States see tangible results, they will be more forthcoming in committing funds.
Our Mediterranean partners are asking for more money in order to produce these results.
Ingenuity is needed to break this 'chicken and egg' situation.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many speakers this morning have described how this year, 2005, can be a year of neighbourhood policy.
The prospects have rarely been so good.
It is the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, there are peaceful developments between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East â something that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago â and President Yushchenko is here with us today â from an eastern part of the neighbourhood where democracy and human rights are increasingly being asserted.
That is why it is important that we, in this European Parliament, make a positive contribution to this neighbourhood policy process.
In the countries themselves, too, we see that the mood is changing.
Only a few days ago, delegates from Morocco told me that when they launched a human rights dialogue with the Council within the EU-Morocco Association Council, all the other neighbours said to them: 'Have you lost your minds? How can you talk about human rights with the EU?
It will only backfire on you when the EU starts to interfere.' However, the impact is positive.
The dialogue is taking place and it means that they have an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Moroccans in the European Union as well. In other words, it is a productive dialogue, and one which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on all the other neighbours too.
I believe we are on the right track and now we must become more ambitious.
We always said that if corruption in the Palestinian Authority is addressed, if there is an end to terrorism, then we Europeans must help out with even more money if necessary.
That means that we must be prepared to support this process on our own initiative.
Mr Brok has undoubtedly voiced the opinion of the majority in this House, Commissioner.
In other words, if you take action now, you will have our backing.
The prediction that chaos would break out after Arafat's death has proved wrong.
What has broken out is peace; anti-corruption measures are now in place, and we Europeans should support this process.
Let me make a final comment on Syria, which MrÂ Eurlings has already mentioned.
Mr Solana's comments are unacceptable in this form.
We must now make more demands on Syria as well.
All our Arab neighbours are keen to support the peace process and Syria must now be judged by whether it combats Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria.
If it fails to do so, it cannot be a good partner for EU policy.
This must be made clear and, in this respect, the Commissioner has been rather more forthright in her comments than MrÂ Solana in recent weeks.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe this debate has shown first of all that Parliament is an important, not to say essential, partner in relaunching the Barcelona Process.
A number of suggestions have been made and I will try to come back to some of the points that have been raised.
First, I would like to say that the democratic project, the project of democracy for the Mediterranean, is a European idea.
With the Barcelona Process, we have effectively advocated this idea of defending democracy in this region.
In this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an important step, since we all know that democracy is also a form of apprenticeship.
Apprenticeship in parliamentary government, in parliamentary democracy, takes place first of all in this context of exchange.
As we all know, not all members of parliament are nominated or elected in the same way.
However, I believe this assembly is a step in the right direction.
You have been entrusted with an important task, one which I might almost go so far as to describe as democratic education, but also education for peace and dialogue, since this parliamentary assembly brings together those who today are enemies or perhaps were yesterday.
I believe this form of dialogue is an extremely important point.
Moreover, the presidency will have the honour of being present at your deliberations at your Cairo meeting.
Another point that has been addressed at length and is of concern to the Council is the situation in Lebanon.
Since the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, the internal situation in Lebanon has become extremely delicate.
I have noted that a number of comments, not to say demands, have been made.
I can tell you that so far as Lebanon is concerned there is perfect agreement between the European Union and the United States, and that is something which clearly emerged from yesterdayâs talks.
In the context of the crisis into which Haririâs assassination risks plunging the country, UN Resolution 1559, which initially was backed by one European country and the US, is taking on a completely new dimension.
Our attitude towards Syria is not one of weakness.
I believe we have tried to work with the Syrians.
We hoped, and continue to hope, that Syria will rejoin the train of reform and democratisation.
We also know and have to recognise, however, that the forces in support of such a development are probably still very much a minority and are very weak.
That is why we may have to move to another form of dialogue with that country, and there is, to say the least, some doubt about whether the agreement will be signed on schedule.
I would also like to say a word about Hezbollah.
I do not believe there is any ambiguity, and we all know that Hezbollah is politically active, since it has members in the Lebanese parliament as well as being involved in other activities.
However, the mere fact of putting it on the list will not solve the problem.
I therefore believe we must monitor this Hezbollah question very closely.
We also have to look at Hezbollahâs attitude to the present situation in Lebanon.
I have to say that the threats made by some leading members of Hezbollah concerning the stability of Lebanon do not inspire confidence and we shall therefore probably have to take other measures in this regard.
So far as Syria is concerned, I would simply like to say that there was at least one positive point that gave us hope when, after long negotiations and long discussions, Syria agreed to the non-proliferation clause.
That was a glimmer of hope that we could persuade Syria to adopt a more responsible attitude in keeping with the principles upheld by the European Union and the international community.
Concerning the peace process, I believe we are all agreed that it is essential if we are to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona Process and to dialogue with the Mediterranean region.
I therefore agree with MrÂ Morillon when he says that Europe must make plans in preparation for the time when peace has been reached.
I can assure him that the authorities responsible for these issues in relation to peacekeeping forces will certainly not neglect such preparation and planning.
I will end with a point that is particularly close to my heart, namely immigration, since I am also responsible for handling it during our presidency.
The European Union has no intention whatsoever of building a new wall between one shore of the Mediterranean and the other.
Reference has been made to the thousands of people who try to cross the Mediterranean and perish in the attempt.
They are not the victims of a wall between Europe and the other shore of the Mediterranean.
They are above all victims of poverty, destitution and oppression.
They are also, however, the victims of traffickers, of criminal gangs who financially exploit their despair.
I therefore believe we must work with our partners on the other side of the Mediterranean to fight against these criminal practices and activities.
These matters are all included in the Hague programme, which also brings this very issue of immigration into the new neighbourhood policy approach.
I therefore believe that our approach to immigration, especially with our Mediterranean neighbours, must form part of a much more global approach.
This week, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will hold its first debate on the Commissionâs Green Paper, which has also been presented to this House by my fellow Commissioner Mr Frattini.
It is a green paper on legal immigration.
I believe we must adopt a partnership approach and try to find solutions for ordered, controlled but legal immigration, which, once people arrive in Europe, will allow them to be integrated and participate fully in life in our society.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to assure the House that we are very determined to improve cooperation with the Mediterranean countries.
This applies to the Euro-Mediterranean platform that has been in existence for ten years, the Action Plans and of course to the Mediterranean peace process also.
It is true that we have to do everything so that this small, first step of the peace process can be consolidated, and it must be consolidated on both sides.
Mahmoud Abbas has to dismantle the terrorist structures and get rid of illegal arms and the tunnels.
The other side must make an effort too.
I gave both leaders this clear message.
The Israelis have to do everything possible as well.
First they have to release prisoners, giving the Palestinians confidence so that they do not use weapons any more.
The Israelis must also go back to the table.
They must guarantee freedom of movement for the Palestinian people and for goods.
Only when the economy starts to flourish can there be a chance for real peace in the Middle East.
As Mr Brok and Mr Laschet mentioned, we now have to do everything to support this peace process, including politically, within the Quartet.
I am very proud to be a new member of that.
The next quartet meeting will be held in London.
There we can go on supporting this process, step by step.
Yesterday we talked about it with Condoleezza Rice and President Bush.
They have now nominated a security coordinator for the area to help address future incidents.
This is important in order for the process to continue.
The Gaza disengagement will be very difficult.
It will now be a coordinated disengagement.
Sharon has already said this.
This has been one of the long-standing challenges.
Now it is a promise.
We must make financial efforts, too, and give the Palestinians everything.
I also want to pay tribute to my predecessor, because he supported the Palestinian Authority in very difficult circumstances.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
I want to do the same, but of course in a transparent way.
'Quick Start' projects can be started up on top of what we are already doing as soon as the withdrawal from Gaza begins.
We provide help in the fields of education, health and job creation, and we often work with UNRWA.
We will also start up investment projects, for instance with the sea port.
I have already announced this.
So, you can see we are not taking this process lightly.
On the contrary, we take it very seriously.
My colleague from the Council has already gone into great detail with regard to Lebanon.
For us, it is very important to show Lebanon that now, the first steps towards a democratic process must be consolidated by elections.
We are currently considering different options, including election observation and support, but negotiations in that regard are still ongoing with the Lebanese.
We hope we can make progress.
Yesterday, we talked about the broader Middle East with Condoleezza Rice.
This is an excellent opportunity to use the momentum that is there to move ahead with the peace process, our neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona Process and the new American engagement to aim for the same goals.
All this must be done in parallel.
We want to make use of what we have already done.
We have given an enormous amount of money under the MEDA Programme.
At the end of 2004, EURÂ 1002Â million was committed in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, including EURÂ 160Â million for Iraq.
With regard to Iraq, payments amounted to EUR 1Â 125Â million.
In 2004 we committed about EURÂ 700Â million and paid EURÂ 800Â million, so the payments/commitments ratio is 115%.
Improved performance goes hand in hand with the enhancement of the quality of programmes.
I appeal to you to support us when it comes to the financial perspectives and the European neighbourhood policy instrument.
That is the instrument that will really help us to act.
We gave EURÂ 320Â million to Iraq last year, particularly for health, education and basic needs.
We have just mentioned another EURÂ 200Â million that we want to give to support the population and the constitutional process.
We are ready to designate experts that could work together with the United Nations.
We want to help in the integrated mission for police training, and for training connected with justice and the rule of law in order to enhance institution-building.
We are also working to build up the ministries of trade and energy.
I am ready to join my colleagues from the Council and Mr Solana in a Troika and go to the region to support the Iraqis as soon as a new government is in place.
Yesterday, a new international coordination conference involving the Americans was announced.
That is an excellent idea for creating a stable and prosperous Iraq in the future.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions from six political groups to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights (Geneva, 14 March to 22 April 2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union played an active part at the sixtieth session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
As in earlier years, it launched the largest number of initiatives: three initiatives on particular topics and ten initiatives on the human rights situation in various countries.
The sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights comes in a context that is different in a number of respects.
At EU level, the recent appointment of a personal representative of the Secretary-General and High Representative for Human Rights underlines the importance the EU attaches to strengthening its human rights policy.
In the context of the United Nations, the publication of the High-Level Panelâs report âA more secure world: Our shared responsibilityâ triggered a wide-ranging debate on the reform of the UN and of the Commission on Human Rights in particular.
While the views expressed on the recommendations relating to the Commission on Human Rights differ, everyone is agreed in stressing the need to give it more teeth and, in general, to strengthen the human rights dimension in the United Nations.
In this new context, the momentum created by the debate on the Commission on Human Rights, together with the hope to which the recent developments in the Middle East have given rise, gives us reason to believe that the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights may make a significant contribution to progress in human rights.
The European Union in fact believes that the Commission on Human Rights is the main United Nations forum for promoting and safeguarding human rights in the world, and it intends to continue to play an active part and to cooperate with other regional groups there.
Important as the EUâs activities within the Commission on Human Rights may be, this is nevertheless not the only means at its disposal for promoting human rights.
Joint positions on human rights, cooperation with other organisations, such as the Council of Europe or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the human rights dialogues with China and Iran are also ways of promoting human rights.
Talks are still going on about the initiatives to be taken by the European Union at the Commission on Human Rights this year.
Some decisions have already been taken.
The EU will be presenting thematic resolutions on religious intolerance, the death penalty and the rights of the child.
These are three essential subjects.
In the face of manifestations of intolerance towards believers of any religion whatsoever, the EU intends to reaffirm its determination to combat every kind of intolerance.
On the matter of the death penalty, the EU believes that its abolition will contribute to strengthening human dignity and is working for its universal abolition.
It considers the Commission on Human Rights to be an appropriate framework for promoting this objective.
The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is an important aspect of European Union human rights policy.
The European Union has decided to present resolutions on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea and the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
Talks on other initiatives to be presented by the EU will continue in the forthcoming meetings of the Working Group on Human Rights, which will be held prior to the session of the Commission on Human Rights.
At its March meeting, the Council will formally define the EUâs priorities for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights.
Apart from its own initiatives, the EU intends to cooperate with any third countries that may launch initiatives for the promotion of human rights, especially in the fight against terrorism or in the context of transnational corporations.
As in the past, it will seek to encourage the spirit of dialogue that is essential for seeking joint solutions to common problems.
The European Union hopes it can count on the support of Parliament, whose resolution is far more ambitious than our programme for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights.
The Union shares the concerns expressed by Parliament and I can assure you that the issues you have raised will be taken into account in our discussions and in our decisions.
However, as I said earlier, we have other tools besides action in the Commission on Human Rights alone and we try to find the most appropriate and most effective tool for each situation.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the input which Parliament is making into the process of EU deliberations prior to the 61st session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) in Geneva.
It is important that the EU prepares its strategy well and Parliament's resolution and debate serve to stimulate those efforts.
We are all aware that the EU faces a range of challenges, not least the growing hostility of many UNCHR Member States to the very concept of country resolutions, a development thrown into sharp relief by the rejection of the EU's draft resolutions on Chechnya and Zimbabwe at last year's UNCHR.
It is my view that such resolutions are a vital aspect of the UNCHR's work, in serving to draw attention to human rights violations and in establishing special rapporteurs who are mandated to investigate and report on such violations.
It might be expected that, at the very least, the 53 States serving as members of the UNCHR would have seen fit to issue standing invitations to the rapporteurs whose mandates they have helped to create: in fact, only 19 States nominated as UNCHR members in 2005 have done so, eight of which the current EU members.
Even where States have issued a standing invitation, special rapporteurs are frequently faced with obstruction and inconvenience in the execution of their mandates.
This is a concern which deserves greater attention in the framework of the European Union's political dialogue with third countries and in our relations with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other organisations.
The European Union is reflecting on the country and thematic initiatives which it will bring at the 61st UNCHR and the European Commission is playing a full role in that process.
I would underline that the EU is responsible for the lion's share of country resolutions and it is not realistic to expect it to expand that list indefinitely.
We must concentrate our energies on rallying support for our initiatives amongst like-minded countries and the wider membership of the UNCHR in an effort to avert further defeats.
We are also considering what we can do beyond country initiatives.
The key issue here is thematic engagement.
I am thinking, for example, of a campaign against the death penalty or religious intolerance, or the issue of child rights.
I would emphasise, however, that the likelihood of defeat does not, in itself, constitute an overriding reason to refrain from running a resolution: as human rights defenders constantly attest, the very act of tabling a draft resolution sends a clear signal to the government and people of the country concerned.
It is also important that we encourage others to take responsibility for running resolutions on key issues of concern â the lead taken by Switzerland as regards the resolution on Nepal last year is a good example.
Parliament's resolution also makes the point that the fact that the EU engages in a human rights dialogue should not preclude support for a UNCHR resolution on a particular country: the co-sponsorship by all 25 EU Member States of Canada's resolution on Iran at last year's UN General Assembly Third Committee demonstrates that this principle is not neglected in practice.
As the EU reaches out to third countries for support for our initiatives, we should also keep firmly in mind the wider context of our relations with many of the UNCHR Member States.
I note, for example, that the human rights clause contained in the Cotonou Agreement is not solely concerned with the domestic human rights policies pursued by third countries but extends also to respect for human rights in the context of their international policies.
We must also send out a clear message as to our continuing commitment to supporting the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her office as a critical part of the UN human rights machinery.
Funding is one part of that and I am pleased to report that a range of projects with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights are in the pipeline this year.
I shall conclude by underlining the Commission's intention to extend every assistance to the Luxembourg Presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the UNCHR.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the annual sessions of the Commission on Human Rights are always a major event for the international and universal promotion of human rights.
This cause is fundamental to us, yet we have to be mindful of the publicâs consternation at the presence on the Commission on Human Rights of countries that are known as the biggest violators of human rights and that are in fact among the worst dictatorships in the world, such as Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Zimbabwe and China, along with others that have serious human rights problems, such as the Russian Federation, and we all know that this does not apply solely to Chechnya.
In light of our European tradition in promoting human rights, we must set out a very clear strategy if we are to work in this context.
In our opinion, this strategy must be based on three key strands, the first of which is the fight against dictatorships.
Human rights culture is rooted in the fight against authoritarianism, totalitarianism and dictatorships, and there must be no let-up in this fight.
Unfortunately, over half of the worldâs population still does not have the chance to have a Parliament such as this one, and does not enjoy freedom of social or political organisation, and this continues to be a major priority, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Pact on Civil and Political Rights.
Secondly, I wish to draw attention to two new, modern-day threats to human rights.
One is terrorism, global terrorism, which we are pleased to see is now addressed from this perspective in Parliamentâs resolution.
Terrorism is often only addressed from the other side.
The fight against terrorism must not violate human rights â we agree on this â but we must also bear in mind that terrorism, by definition and being a very present threat, is one of the biggest causes of fear, one of the biggest causes of insecurity and, in itself, an extremely violent attack on human rights.
Lastly, there is a new reality that threatens human rights and that is international crime.
The dark side of globalisation â the exploitation of children, child labour, the trafficking of women, organ trafficking, the trafficking of human beings â must also be treated as a new threat to human rights.
I feel that it is on these axes that we must focus our attention.
We will support the resolution adopted in the Commission, provided some amendments are approved that have split the democratic vote.
We reserve the right to a final vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, human rights are an area of particular concern to the European Parliament.
The intense debate and the amendments tabled concerning the report voted on this week are evidence of the hard work put in by the political groups to achieve a broad consensus.
Consequently, the European Union will be able to play a leading role in the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Unionâs policy on human rights is the main added value of its foreign policy.
The PSE Group believes that, whilst respecting multilateralism, the Unionâs foreign policy is characterised by measures to ensure the recognition of human rights and their promotion and support.
Europe is charged with rooting out suffering in the world.
As preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights get under way, I should like to ask the Commission and the Council to ensure that the European Parliamentâs delegation is fully involved in the work and negotiations in Geneva.
I must emphasise to the Commission and Council representatives present here today that Parliament is a legitimate and credible body and deserves to be treated as such.
Our presence in Geneva must not be purely symbolic.
I trust suitable methods of coordination will be set up, to allow us to cooperate in a satisfactory manner.
This leads me to call on the Council and the Commission to take full account of the specific content of the recommendations contained in this report.
In particular, I should like to draw attention to Parliamentâs hope that the Union will adopt a balanced, consistent and demanding stance at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
The approach needs to be discarded.
Parliamentâs report goes beyond recommendations addressed solely to countries in the developing world, and focuses on human rights themselves.
Consequently, the report argues for abuses and violations of human rights to be denounced wherever they take place, be that in Uzbekistan or in Guantanamo.
As I conclude, I should like to call on the House to support the introduction of reproductive health rights into this report.
I am addressing the more conservative Members in particular.
Reproductive health rights are crucial when it comes to combating AIDS and guaranteeing other human rights.
We are in favour of combating not only religious discrimination but also discrimination for reasons of gender or sexual orientation.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is an extremely important opportunity for the countries of the world to meet and discuss human rights.
Many states and many people around the world, including dissidents and the oppressed, follow this exercise with very great interest.
This phenomenon is extremely important to the European Parliament, and so we very much welcome this cooperation between the Commission, the Council and ourselves.
Of course, the formal aspects of the meeting need to be revised.
This could perhaps be done in conjunction with the UN overhaul in September.
For example, it is completely absurd that a rogue State such as Libya has chaired the session on human rights.
This does not lend any credibility to our work.
The meetings also need to be better structured, exactly as my fellow MEP, MrÂ Ribeiro e Castro said.
Despite the good intentions in Geneva, there is of course a great deal of horse trading, with the really big rogue states, such as Iran and China, often being let off the hook, whereas it is easier to agree on North Korea, for example; which is also a rogue State, of course.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds this regrettable and would very much like to see resolutions on those very countries â Iran and China â because they are the worst offenders when it comes to the infringement of human rights.
We are also very anxious about the situation in Darfur and regret that the abuses and genocide there are not being put before the International Criminal Tribunal.
