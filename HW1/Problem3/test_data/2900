When the report had virtually been completed, we were informed that the accounts could contain irregularities; the informant was concerned that there could be irregularities in the reimbursements of travel expenses and daily allowances and potentially some instances of fraud.
In view of this suspicion, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control asked for the discharge of the accounts to be postponed in order to carry out a detailed audit and to be able to establish a full picture regarding the suspected irregularities.
The audit was eventually carried out by the Court of Auditors, who looked at the general budget of the Committee of the Regions and at the financial and administrative management of that budget.
The results of the audit did not identify any serious irregularities.
At the same time, OLAF produced a report regarding the possibility of fraud in the Committee of the Regions and did not find any evidence of fraud for personal gain or any intentional fraud on the part of Committee of the Regions staff.
A few internal administrative deficiencies were identified, but were of little real significance, particularly given that between 2001, the period in question, and our meeting, the Committee of the Regions had amended its own internal rules and introduced a number of changes specifically designed to prevent the kind of irregularities that could have occurred in the past, and also promised to change the internal administration and provide training for staff to prevent any irregularities occurring.
We have to acknowledge â and I personally have to state â that the Committee of the Regions has made an effort to clarify its internal organisation so as to improve accounting and it has produced regulations to prevent problems or duplications when reimbursing travel expenses and daily allowances for members of the committee.
The fraud that was actually identified was of very little significance: a small amount, most of which has been cleared up, and the problem of the tiny sum still requiring clarification is currently being resolved in collaboration with a former Committee member.
We therefore saw a rapid response on the part of the Committee of the Regions at all times, and a willingness to work with us, with Parliament, to improve compliance with the rules, and to achieve greater transparency and to allow us to feel that this problem was being addressed.
In view of this, I recommend that Parliament approves the report I am presenting today on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and approves the discharge for the Committee of the Regions accounts together with the recommendations we have included in the report.
Following advice from Parliamentâs Legal Service, we have deleted from the report all specific references to the OLAF report.
It seemed inappropriate to refer to a report which, by its very nature, is confidential.
These quotes were therefore taken out immediately and we will not even be voting on whether they should be omitted â instead they will not be considered admissible, which does not alter the report significantly.
As regards the amendments that have been submitted, I can tell you that I support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6, but oppose all the others.
I hope you will study this report carefully.
It is the fruit of the labour and cooperation of most of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
At all times we sought to improve accounting in the Committee of the Regions â both in our own interest as Members of Parliament and in the interest of the committee itself, given its importance as one of the European institutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my warm thanks to Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, who mastered her difficult task as rapporteur with great diligence and thoroughness.
The Committee of the Regions is the newest EU institution, and it is also a small one.
In terms of its composition, it is extremely heterogeneous, at least as regards the political status and rank of its members in their home states.
Could this be why we had so many difficulties with the 2001 discharge?
Shortcomings and even irregularities were drawn to the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control as it was about to vote last spring on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001.
The rapporteur, MrsÂ AvilÃ©s Perea, put on the brakes and recommended the postponement of the discharge and an audit of the practices being undertaken in the COR, preferably by the European Court of Auditors â a recommendation which the plenary took up.
In the meantime, the rapporteur and the committee have carried out detailed work and are now proposing that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions for 2001.
Yet this does not mean that the dubious incidents in the COR are forgiven and forgotten.
They are likely to come to light again in the context of the 2002 discharge, especially as the Court of Auditors proposes to undertake a more detailed audit, something it felt unable to do in 2001.
Mrs AvilÃ©s Pereaâs report takes account of a number of recommendations by OLAF and makes clear demands of the COR.
There are no indications of personal enrichment or the loss of financial resources.
The incorrect calculation of travel allowances has now been regulated through recoveries, although in future, the maintenance of presence lists and the calculation of membersâ allowances must be carried out scrupulously and be verifiable.
Payment procedures must be in line with the financial regulations.
There must be respect for the institutional role of the Internal Auditor.
The President of the Committee of the Regions has announced the implementation of an action plan to improve administration and management, and this includes rules on dealing with whistleblowers.
Whether or not there are to be disciplinary proceedings is something for the COR itself to decide.
Overall, the Committee on Budgetary Control is very concerned about the extent to which an amateurish improvisatory approach has prevailed in the administration to date.
We will monitor the improvements which have been called for, and which have been pledged, benevolently but with close attention so that the 2001 discharge is right and proper, thus encouraging the COR to keep to the rules in future.
Â Â  Mr President, in March 2003 when the Committee on Budgetary Control was about to vote on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001, I received a telephone call from the internal auditor of the Committee of the Regions, MrÂ Robert McCoy, as did several of my colleagues.
MrÂ McCoy had alarming news for us: the information provided to Parliament by the Committee of the Regions in the course of the discharge procedure was incorrect.
The next day, the Budgetary Control Committee decided that the vote should be postponed to give Mr McCoy a chance to present his views.
He did so, and issued what he called a cry for help.
He said that his views had been misrepresented by the Secretary-General and the Finance Director of the Committee of the Regions, and that, despite a series of reforms, the COR still flouted basic financial rules, in particular in relation to tendering procedures and Membersâ expenses.
As a result of Mr McCoyâs intervention, the Budgetary Control Committee, and subsequently plenary, decided to postpone discharge for the COR and called on that institution to commission â and I quote â 'a detailed, full and independent audit, to be carried out by an external and recognised institution â preferably by the European Court of Auditors â on the Committee's overall budget implementation, as well as the financial and administrative management; considers that the audit should examine, inter alia, the areas listed above and attest to the sound financial management of the institution'.
At the same time I decided to refer the case to OLAF.
The results of these investigations were shocking.
In the case of the Court of Auditors it was shocking because we received a one-page document consisting of 300 words which basically gave the COR a clean bill of health.
This was not what we had asked for.
The OLAF report painted a quite different picture.
It had found an endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation.
It uncovered evidence of tampering with tendering procedures by COR officials and false expenses claims by members â including former presidents â of the COR.
It went on to say that the efforts of the administration had been focused on discouraging or destabilising the messenger of the bad news, in this case the financial controller, rather than to change things for the benefit of the COR.
Mr McCoy was therefore right when he came to see us and he deserves an unreserved apology for the treatment he has been subjected to, and applause for his courage in coming forward.
The COR has now begun to improve things: the Secretary-General has been removed from his post for different reasons â although the bungled process of his appointment was also likely to be a result of the administrative chaos at the COR; the President of the COR has announced a preliminary enquiry into the opening of disciplinary proceedings; a reform process has been set in motion involving all COR staff who wish to be involved and a former Member of the Court of Auditors is to advise the COR on the adequacy of the reforms.
For these reasons the COR and its President deserve the benefit of the doubt.
That is why my Group will be voting to grant discharge tomorrow, but will do so with very little enthusiasm.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the previous speaker, MrÂ vanÂ Hulten, has given an excellent explanation of the background to the refusal to grant the Committee of the Regions discharge in April, and I think that MrsÂ AvilÃ©sÂ Perea also does that in her resolution; she has done a very good job.
As a result of the refusal to grant discharge, two bodies carried out investigations: the European Court of Auditors and OLAF.
I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by the investigation by the Court of Auditors.
An investigation that can be expressed in a couple of sentences is not what I would call âthoroughâ; it was rather too superficial an investigation for my taste.
I have greater respect for the report by OLAF, which has examined the matter in greater detail.
There have been a great many abuses; the great hope is that these will now disappear.
In this regard, I agree with the previous speakers who said that the role of the Financial Controller is essential.
It was a bad omen that, when the Financial Controller brought the abuses to light, one of the first things that the Administration of the Committee of the Regions did was to dismiss a member of his staff.
I am very pleased, therefore, that this Parliament has adopted an amendment to the 2004Â budget by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to give that Financial Controller, right now, two extra members of staff for the coming financial year.
We consider the role of the Financial Controller essential in all the European institutions.
It cannot be emphasised enough that this person must act completely independently â independently of the hierarchy â in order to express his or her opinion.
We shall be supporting the critical tone of MrsÂ AvilÃ©sÂ Pereaâs resolution, because we think that she has done a good job.
However, my group will not be voting in favour of granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions.
We think that we are justified in this course of action in a year in which so much has been amiss.
Â Â  MrÂ President, just like the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, we consider the rapporteur to have done an excellent job in his report.
It is a very critical report that indicates the sensitive areas when it comes to procurement and to cheating in connection with the reimbursement of travel expenses.
We draw the same conclusion as the ELDR Group: no discharge should be granted.
The criticism is too serious.
Just as with the Eurostat story, we have been made aware of these problems through what is known as a whistle blower If the Committee of the Regionsâ financial controller had not contacted us, we should never have discovered how bad things were.
We should just be grateful that there are EU employees willing to take the risks involved in pointing out what is wrong.
These assertions are also well corroborated in OLAFâs report.
If we were to grant discharge, we should also be doing so to the Committee of the Regionsâ Secretary General.
That is something we think cannot be done.
It is the Secretary General against whom OLAF believes that a disciplinary procedure should be instituted, so it would be out of place.
We shall vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions.
We think there is too much that has not been cleared up and that a still stronger desire should be shown to devise better procedures for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Budgetary Control on its determination to shed every possible light on the management of the Committee of the Regions.
We have gone a long way since February 2003.
The first plan was to grant it discharge for satisfactory management, but the reports from the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed the need for the report.
None of this would have been possible without the high professional and moral qualities â yes, you have to be able to stand up to pressure! â of Mr McCoy, the financial controller, who today deserves all the European Parliamentâs gratitude.
The amendments which I have tabled are in line with the report and are based on proven facts.
In that, their adoption is essentially a technicality and I hope that a large number of Members will be able to support them.
On the other hand, it seems to me premature to grant discharge.
The Casaca report is a cruel reminder to those who saw fit to grant discharge to the Commission last April that it cannot be granted by giving the benefit of the doubt.
We should not vote for discharge if there is no enthusiasm for it and not blow only the fuses.
The Parliament, which has to check that the budget has been properly executed, must be certain of the progress made, of the measures taken, of any sanctions imposed, and not be content with promises or statements of intent.
And as the Commission is attentively following our debates, I will take advantage of the fact to point out that this comment applies to everyone.
It is not addressed to the Committee on the Regions alone.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is permissible, in the context of MrsÂ AvilÃ©s Pereaâs report, to pay tribute to oneâs own committee for once.
I believe that we were very prompt in our response as soon as justified doubts arose â to which previous speakers have already made reference â about the way in which the Committee of the Regions managed public funds.
I think it is important to make this point for once in this House.
We have a Committee on Budgetary Control, and it is sensitive and flexible enough to exercise its responsibility within a matter of hours.
I do not believe that any problems were caused by the decision to postpone discharge for the Committee of the Regions as a result of the concerns addressed to us.
Indeed, I believe it showed that occasionally, there are small institutions within the European Union â so-called small institutions, although our taxpayers would probably take a different view â which might have a budget of EUR 30 million, where the members turn up once every few months and perhaps deliver an important speech before a plenary, and where otherwise, there is a great temptation to indulge in petty empire-building within the European Community.
I am most grateful to the President and his staff at the Committee of the Regions for having drawn the right conclusions from our comments, but I think it will be a lesson for us in other cases as well.
I endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, and will gladly vote for Mrs AvilÃ©s Pereaâs report.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr BÃ¶sch.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0004/2004) by Mr Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the action taken by the Commission on the observations contained in the resolution accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2001 financial year (COM(2003) 651 â C5-0536/2003 â 2003/2200(DEC)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, thanks to the dedicated hard work of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that of various individuals in the European institutions, it has finally been possible to put a stop to serious wrongdoing in the European statistics body, Eurostat.
The audit carried out by the Commissionâs internal audit service, and by Eurostatâs audit department, deserves our praise and was crucial in obtaining this result.
The action plan presented by the committee, aimed at concentrating on the most important statistics, at reducing the amount of work outsourced by the institute and at making statistical data available to the public, addresses our main concerns.
It also ensures that the motivation for such work is not purely commercial and increases transparency and responsibility.
We shall, however, carefully monitor how this plan is executed and how all the work carried out is revised and audited.
Community institutions will be increasingly concerned with analysing and auditing the effectiveness and the simplification of procedures, the quality of work, and the relevance and value of the matters concerned.
In any event, it is now obvious that the current process of reform of the Commission has not sufficiently clarified the relative responsibilities of the Directors-General and the Commissioners and has given no guarantees of respect for the golden rule of democracy: that accountability and ultimate responsibility rest with political office-holders.
Concerns have surfaced regarding the manner in which we have proceeded unchecked towards outsourcing a wide variety of EU administrative functions and in which more complexity has been introduced, due to the implementation of more bureaucratic rules, which are a long way from fulfilling the aims of public spending efficiency.
These concerns are not, however, confined to Eurostat.
It is clear that in most contracts awarded by Eurostat to third parties, other Commission departments or even interinstitutional bodies were also involved.
There is particular consternation that, unlike Eurostat, nothing appears to have changed in the departments that monitor external help and that are responsible for authorising spending in some of the most contentious areas.
The accounting system must be modernised and assurances must be given that the system is indeed capable of addressing the most glaring problems in managing and monitoring external contracts and Community money administered by third parties.
A further area in which progress appears to have been either very slow or non-existent is that of the common agricultural policy.
The framework drawn up by the excellent special reports by the Court of Auditors regarding export refunds is a cause for concern.
It is unacceptable that, on key points, the 2003 report does no more than repeat what was said in 1990 because absolutely nothing has changed in 13 years.
It is unacceptable that the Commission has not yet implemented its policy of moving irresponsible employees in the area of export refunds, when this is an area in which urgent action is required.
It is unacceptable that export refunds for sugar continue to be awarded to countries from which we import sugar that is duty-free.
The Community budget demands transparency, yet the Commission still refuses to make public the list of payments made to commercial undertakings, particularly in this area of export refunds and surplus disposal mechanisms.
In a recent opinion poll, food product adulteration came top of the list of concerns among European citizens, both in the Europe of the 15 and the Europe of the 25.
The Commission, however, continues to neglect its duties in this area.
Community money finances extensive operations to count olive trees and evaluate their productive capacity, an activity that is neither worthwhile nor effective, while it neglects the fight against the adulteration of olive oil.
The budget imposes heavy fines on farmers who produce more than their quota of milk, yet the Commission refuses to intervene when large European commercial undertakings sell, and receive EU subsidies for, surplus butter adulterated with lubricants and beef tallow.
To conclude, I should like to say a word about the challenges facing us.
The Commission is preparing to propose an increase in the sums earmarked for research and development, an area which, as I have said, has been synonymous with red tape and inefficiency.
If the mindset in this area does not change radically, if it does not streamline its underlying philosophy, if it persists with the unwieldy mechanisms it has used to date, the Commission will transform a good idea into bad policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Casaca for his comprehensive report.
I should say that I can only take up your final comment for the next Financial Perspective in those areas where the regulations are actually to be revised.
This report has been prepared with the greatest care and was presented to this House on behalf of the committee.
In the report, the rapporteur discusses all the key issues dealt with in the Commission's follow-up report â Eurostat in particular â and the necessary conclusions to be drawn from them.
I would also particularly like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for her great commitment as well as the rapporteur, Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, and Mr BÃ¶sch and Mr SÃ¶rensen for their constructive contributions.
It was in 2001 that the Commission embarked on the implementation of the administrative reform measures.
We have now successfully progressed a considerable distance along the reform road.
However, along this road, we frequently encounter obstacles that require adjustments and improvements.
In two weeksâ time, the Commission will present the next progress report on the reforms.
In it, we will also provide detailed explanations of the measures announced by President Prodi last November.
At the same time â that is, in two weeksâ time â we will also present proposals for the revision of the OLAF Regulation, which we have discussed here in the context of the BÃ¶sch report.
In the coming week, the Commission will also adopt the progress report on the modernisation of the accounting system and improvements in the early-warning system.
Last week, the Commission adopted a Eurostat action plan as the follow-up to the restructuring agreed last year; the rapporteur has mentioned the various measures arising in this context.
The Commission has learned the lessons of experience, especially from the Eurostat affair.
The grave irregularities occurred before this Commissionâs term in office.
The Prodi Commission has been criticised for failing to respond to this situation more swiftly, but, once it was fully informed â in July 2003 â about the seriousness of the situation, the Commission did take action, and we intend to implement President Prodi's Eurostat action plan.
This applies especially to measures ensuring that in future, the Commission is informed more quickly about problems requiring political action.
The annual activity reports and the Directors-Generalâs statements form the cornerstones of a new and transparent system of internal control.
For the third year of the activity reports, we have already agreed various further improvements concerning, for example, the timeframe as well as the more precise presentation of reasons and facts giving rise to concerns.
We have agreed uniform norms for internal control and in future, the Central Financial Service of the Directorate-General for Budgets will provide information twice a year of the work undertaken by their internal-audit staff on the implementation of these norms.
The progress report which I have mentioned, and about which my fellow-Commissioner Mr Kinnock has already informed the Committee on Budgetary Control, reaffirms that all Commissioners must reassure themselves that the systems of internal control adopted and administered by the Director-General operate satisfactorily.
It also states that the Commissioners must reassure themselves that audits are accompanied by appropriate follow-up measures.
If this is not the case, the Commissioner must issue instructions so that improvements can be made.
New financial regulations have also been in force for the last thirteen months, and these substantially reduce the risk of fraud, especially the new rules on the allocation of subsidies and allowances and the strict rules excluding conflicts of interest.
As regards accounting, the new financial regulations have restructured the system.
They charge the Commissionâs accounting officer with the task of validating the systems used to produce accounting data.
However, it is not his task to carry out central and random checks, and nor does he have any staff available for this purpose.
The authorising officers are responsible for this, and the Directors-General are responsible for ensuring that the control systems are established in line with the financial regulations and the sectoral rules.
Under Article 60 of the new financial regulations, authorising officers bear full responsibility for financial procedures.
The Prodi Commission has thus implemented the recommendation set out in the second report by the independent experts, which was approved by this House.
Important lessons which the Commission has learned from the Eurostat affair concern the exchange of information and inter-service cooperation, for example, between the internal audit service, the internal audit capabilities, and the horizontal directorates-general, for it must be ensured that information about irregularities penetrates as far as political level and results in the adoption of immediate measures.
This Parliamentâs Committee on Budgetary Control has rightly placed the greatest emphasis on this aspect throughout the entire debate.
The Eurostat affair made last year a very difficult time, and I think that applies to the Commission as much as to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The President of the Commission made a very detailed statement on all aspects here in this House on two separate occasions, and then joint work was undertaken to develop the necessary conclusions and changes.
Let me assure you that the Commission, which launched and implemented the administrative reform with great commitment, will be consistent in implementing the necessary additions to that reform.
Â Â  â Mr President, my first words clearly have to be congratulations to Mr Casaca for his report.
Not only because of the document itself, but also for the preparatory work that went into it: finding a consensus, harmonising, exercising caution, and bringing all of this together in a report which, first and foremost, is complex.
Complex because it is a follow-up report, in the strict sense of the term, while at the same time the subject matter is new and deals with something that shook us and which is now shaking public opinion.
I would like to highlight a few elements of this follow-up aspect, such as the eagerness to implement fully the internal control standards, to complete an audit of the Commissionâs treasury system, to introduce the payment of interest accrued in the case of Community advance payments, to address the question of recovery payments and also subjects which were already common currency in the Committee on Budgetary Control: the reform of the accounting system, for example, or the common agricultural policy â which is mentioned specifically by the rapporteur â and, above all, in relation to export refunds and the prevention of fraud in the sector.
Nonetheless, as I said, this report marks a first: it is the first time the question of Eurostat has been dealt with in a report.
We have been surprised by some of the questions which have come up in relation to this subject.
Let me go through them.
Firstly, the fact that the rules on exchanges of information, which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term, have not been implemented.
Secondly, it is surprising that there is no register of the owners of all the companies that have been awarded contracts and that apparently it would be virtually impossible to establish who is behind the companies participating in calls for tender issued by the Commission.
So now, at this late stage, we still have our doubts about the scale of the problem and who is responsible.
What is more, when we tried to contact certain sources, we encountered the incredibly valuable contribution of the auditors and the whistle-blowers, on the one hand, who filled the gaps in our knowledge about what had happened, and at the same time, we found a glaring lack of information from OLAF, which is what has led â as was stated in this House barely a month ago â to the call for regulatory reform.
In particular, reform to prevent OLAF becoming a pretext for holding discussions about any given topic behind closed doors and reducing transparency.
As regards the measures which have been adopted, I think they are constructive and useful.
For example, the decision to establish a mechanism for information flows between the auditors in each Directorate General and the internal Audit Service, the desire to establish and give structure to each Commissionerâs responsibilities, to protect whistle-blowers from potential reprisals and a review of the early warning system â also known as the blacklist â to prevent companies that have behaved fraudulently or inefficiently in relation to the Commission from receiving further contracts and subsidies.
In short, Mr President, this is an open report which also offers a link to the report on the approval of the financial management for 2002, which will provide an opportunity to evaluate some of the measures proposed in this report.
It will also be the time when we will be able to plug certain gaps in our knowledge, which we hope will be filled in by OLAF.
Â Â  â Mr President, since it is already after 10 p.m., I will get straight to the point without any preliminaries.
We Social Democrats have repeatedly said, over these past months, that the priority for us â over and above the mediaâs one-day wonders such as calls for resignations â is the issue of how to bring about structural changes in the Commission and in relations between the Commission and OLAF.
In my view, this position remains fundamental to our policies.
Of course we can discuss the Commissionersâ individual political responsibility â I have no objection to that â but in light of all that we have learned from the Eurostat affair, we have to recognise first and foremost that we must put the Commissioners in a position to exercise this political responsibility in the first place.
After all, what we encountered in this particular instance were hair-raising conditions as regards responsibilities, structures and information processes.
One thing I am pleased about, although I do not endorse it politically: I am pleased to see that it establishes clarity.
Admittedly, there is the amendment proposed by the Liberals â I can assure Mr Mulder that I would be happy to talk about this â which, as it were, flies the flag for political responsibility.
At the same time, however, I welcome the clarity with which the Liberals propose a deletion, namely of the very paragraph in the Casaca report which calls for the directorates-general to answer to the Commissioners at long last.
That is a clear alternative.
Structural changes are needed so that we do not face the problem, every five years, of which Commissioner we call upon to resign, while the apparatus is allowed to carry on blithely as before.
That is not the alternative that we Social Democrats want to see, to put it bluntly.
That does not mean that all that glitters in the Commission is gold, however.
Frankly, the opposite has generally been true.
The things we have witnessed there: we have been presented, to great fanfare, with a proposal which now finally states in writing that the officials must inform the Commissioners about any landmines that might be lying around.
Well, that is wonderful, I must say.
I was under the impression that this was already standard administrative practice.
If we have to put this in writing from the outset, what does that say about conditions in place?
That is one thing that has absolutely astounded me â although perhaps I should not have been too surprised.
I think we really have to say that there must be an end to the Commission always coming up with too little too late.
We are fed up with it; Mr Bayona de Perogordo has already mentioned the 2002 discharge.
By then, if you do not mind, you have to come up with the goods.
As I have said before, if you fail to do so, we can look forward to some entertaining days together between now and the end of your term in office!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I agree with MrÂ Kuhne, and in view of the late hour I, too, shall get straight to the point.
In contrast to the Committee of the Regions â the previous item on the agenda â we did grant the Commission discharge in April of last year.
At that time, too, I was the spokesman for my group and was able to put our arguments forward.
One of the arguments was that the Commission was on the right track to reform.
We still believe that to be the case.
Scarcely had the ink dried on that resolution when the Eurostat affair erupted.
That was no small matter.
Eurostat is not just any old branch of the Commission.
It produces extremely important statistics on the Stability and Growth Pact, on the contributions of the Member States, and, if things are not going well there, how reliable are the statistics themselves?
Thus, it was not for nothing that many people became very worked up over these revelations.
We think that, on the whole, the Commission has shown vigour in righting the wrongs at Eurostat.
A number of problem areas remain, however, and, indeed, several people have already alluded to these.
First of all, how are we to deal with the role of OLAF?
I always thought it strange to be told by the Secretary-General that OLAF had asked that we should keep things secret and not pass them on.
I do not know many officials who are required to keep things of this nature secret for their political superiors; in not one administration does such a thing happen.
Officials should keep their political superiors fully informed, and I think that that is clearly the lesson to be learnt from this affair.
What is essential as far as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned is political accountability.
The fact that a Commissioner does not know somethingÂ cannot mean that he or she is not politically accountable.
We have sought to raise this point in an amendment to the resolution, on which, indeed, we shall be voting tomorrow, and we also think that, when the hearings of the new Commissioners are held shortly â although it will depend on the new Parliament â we will have to question them on this point.
After all, as far as we are concerned, this affair has shown PresidentÂ Prodiâs words at the start of his term about the individual accountability of Commissioners to be not entirely satisfactory.
We hope that this will be raised at the new hearings, as I have said, because we must be able to declare to the European political elite, in particular, that someone in Europe is accountable for something.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today, we know a lot more about what happened in Eurostat than we did when the decision was taken to grant discharge for 2001.
It is very possible that the decision would have been otherwise if we had known what we know today.
There is no doubt that what took place that year were serious offences against the Financial Regulation: secret accounts, embezzlement and obvious conflicts of interest.
MrÂ Casacaâs report is not bad.
It is critical, but what is missing is a conclusion.
We think it fair that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat should have taken the political consequences and resigned.
In many ways, this scandal resembles those that caused the Santer Commission to resign.
A systematic and organised misuse of EU funds has taken place, and there has been a failure to intervene in time.
MrÂ SolbesÂ Mira says that he was not informed until April 2003, but we all know that there had been many warning signs before that date in auditorsâ reports and in the press, as well as warnings by Parliament.
When MrÂ Prodi began his term of office, he was very clear about political responsibility. The Commissioners were responsible for what happened within their Directorates-General.
That proud watchword, issued at the beginning of the term of office, proved to have little substance when it came to the Eurostat affair.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on behalf of my group, I express my satisfaction with the work carried out by the Committee on Budgetary Control and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate.
I must, however, emphasise that the picture that emerges from reading the report is altogether worrying.
What emerges is the image of a European Commission shrouded in secrecy and a lack of transparency, which does not communicate with the other institutions; a stratified Commission with a bureaucratic complexity of functions, delegations and offices which is in fact manifested by a failure to shoulder administrative and political responsibility, both on the part of Director-Generals and the Commissioners.
An example of this, as other Members have mentioned, would be the Eurostat affair for which no one has to date completely assumed responsibility.
On the contrary, we have, on several occasions in recent months, seen attempts by the Commission to swiftly close the case, to settle it as if it were nothing, as if Parliamentâs calls for clarity were in fact a real nuisance and as if the Commission were indeed a class of untouchables above everyone, MEPs and citizens included.
It is also surprising that President Prodi, so diligent in ensuring that rules are strictly complied withÂ âÂ I am thinking, for example, about the recourse to the Court of Justice on the Ecofin decisions on the Stability and Growth PactÂ âÂ dealt so lightly with such an abominable scandal such as the one involving Eurostat.
I will conclude, MrÂ President, by saying that, over and above the naÃ¯ve and vague declarations of principle by the CommissionÂ âÂ declarations that we have again heard this eveningâÂ we are waiting for a strong signal, a rigorous reform that will really change the system.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, last year, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities opposed granting discharge to the Commission in respect of its budgetary management in 2001.
The facts have now confirmed beyond any doubt that this was justified.
Just weeks after the vote on discharge, information that the Commission had withheld on the Eurostat affair came to light.
The combination of a seriously flawed accounting system, an excessively slow process of administrative reform and insufficiently independent internal audits was the last straw.
Like PresidentÂ Prodi, Commissioners SolbesÂ Mira and Schreyer have demonstrated in both word and deed that they have not learnt sufficient lessons from the enforced resignation of their predecessors five years ago.
Time and time again, the Commission seeks to talk Parliament round with fine words and promises and with hefty reports, with no visible results as regards its own internal reform.
It was not until the second half of 2003, when it could procrastinate no longer, that the Commission finally began to act.
We can only conclude that this Commission cannot keep abreast of the facts in its budgetary management, and is not meeting its political responsibility.
Finally, I should like to mention that we in this House owe a great deal to the brave Commission whistle-blowers Paul van Buitenen and Marta Andreasen.
They have the right to see their names fully cleared.
We have not forgotten that there are many dedicated, upright officials working for the Commission.
It is unfortunate, though, that they are being thwarted by an internal hierarchy that seeks to serve its own interests rather than those of Europeâs citizens.
The rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, never before, in my seventeen years of membership of the Committee on Budgetary Control, has a follow-up report on a discharge which has already been granted left so many fundamental questions unanswered.
They relate to openness, to the provision of prompt and comprehensive information from the Commission to Parliament and within the Commission itself, and to the assumption of responsibility by the Commissioners for abuses that have arisen.
It seems that the shadow of the past is catching up with us.
The rapporteur, Mr Casaca, has worked hard to produce this painstaking report.
I would like to thank him in particular, as well as the committee as a whole for its outstanding work.
The main issue in this report is to investigate and address the improper practices in and around the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), such as slush funds, cronyism, violations of the financial regulations, lax treatment of the mobility rules, and various other things.
If the Commission had taken seriously Parliamentâs warnings about Eurostat in its reports of February and March and investigated what was going on, and had informed Parliament accordingly, the discharge would have been postponed from April to October.
This would not have been serious, but would have given the Commission enough time to adopt the measures that it is now trying to rush through with astonishing speed.
Yet again, the bottom line is that what we have is an information shortfall.
What, too, about political responsibility?
So far, not one Commissioner has admitted any responsibility.
Admittedly, some errors have been acknowledged, but a clear admission has yet to come.
That is regrettable, in my view.
Claiming ignorance is no defence against responsibility.
We are therefore pushing for this supposed ignorance to be removed by ensuring that the Commissioners finally close the yawning information gap between the officials, even to the highest ranks, and the Commissioners themselves.
As early as 1999, the Commission equipped itself with rules on this issue.
It is apparent that they still only exist on paper, unless what Commissioner Schreyer has just told us becomes reality.
I would be delighted if that were to occur.
OLAF, too, cannot serve as an excuse for the Commissionâs inaction.
The duty to exercise proper and thorough supervision lies, after all, with the Commission.
Are the internal audit reports produced by the directorates-general being disregarded and the valuable audits carried out by the internal audit service being ignored by the Commissioners?
What also concerns us deeply is the way in which the whistleblowers have been treated.
They have drawn attention to numerous abuses.
The current rules do not guarantee them protection.
Faced with all this harsh criticism, why has the committee not proposed the dismissal of the entire Commission or individual Commissioners?
This is my response: it is of no benefit to Europe if the irregularities continue at Eurostat.
They must be cleared up â and that means now, by this Commission.
We want to support the action plan and cooperate so that there is no repetition of these incidents in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we see what the Commission is offering by way of lessons learned from the Eurostat affair, cynicism would seem to be the only appropriate response.
On this issue, Commissioner, you are disavowing your own President.
As early as September last year, and again on 18 November, President Prodi announced to this House that he would submit an action plan before the yearâs end.
In December, we were fobbed off until January, and now it is the end of January and we are still waiting for the proposals which have been announced and which are primarily intended to achieve a rapid improvement in the OLAF Regulation.
Yet the Commission knows perfectly well that this is a race against time, and I can tell the Commissioner that time is precisely what we do not have.
It is not possible to have two readings on 10 February.
How do you see this working?
Action is needed.
This House has tabled appropriate proposals for your attention.
I have the impression that it is the same old story in the Commission: Who is Commissioner, under which Director-General?
I say this in all clarity.
Yet the differences of opinion could be addressed relatively quickly.
We need clear priorities for OLAF.
It was your institution that said that OLAF had failed in the Eurostat affair.
I say that in all clarity as well. We need priorities.
We need a priority as regards protecting the subjects of the investigations, and I think we also need some amendments to the financial regulations.
The responsibility of the authorising Directors-General is a case in point.
It is right that the Directors-General should bear full responsibility for what happens in their directorate-general, but it is also true, especially in light of the Eurostat experience, that control is better than trust.
You have not upheld this principle so far, and I think it is high time you did.
I would remind you of that, Commissioner.
Ultimately, that will be the key benchmark against which your work is measured at the end of this Prodi Commissionâs term in office.
Â Â  â Mr President, we now come to the follow-up report on the 2001 discharges which contains many interesting points and which constitutes an excellent piece of work on the part of the rapporteur, Mr Casaca.
It seems, however, that most of those present are concerned about one subject in particular: the fraud uncovered in Eurostat just when we were finalising the discharge of the budget management for 2001, and therefore just when Mr Casacaâs report was being drafted.
Unfortunately we did not pay much attention at the time, and it was only in the summer, July to be precise, that the Commission really registered the gravity of the matter in hand and began to react.
Fortunately the Commission did begin to react and to set in motion a series of internal reforms which were completely necessary and which seek to do away with a culture and approach which are outdated, inappropriate and have generated a great many problems.
For example, we need to reduce external involvement, since this leads to even less control, and in turn to even lower reliability in terms of how contracts are concluded and in terms of the final outcome anticipated when they were put up for tender.
Another problem which has become apparent in the Eurostat case is the very poor internal information system within the Commission.
Information exchanged between different levels â namely between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners â is limited, and totally absent in some cases, although this Commission did establish a code of conduct in 1999, which it has not implemented.
I presented a report which the rapporteur has incorporated more or less in its entirety, with a view to improving internal information flows within the Commission because, in my view, if internal information channels had worked properly, many of the problems could have been avoided and we would not have ended up in the current situation.
I also believe the internal reform of the Commission needs to be reviewed.
At the outset there was a great deal of enthusiasm for the reform, fully supported by Parliament, but it has proved a slow, difficult and sometimes inefficient process.
This is why, Mr President, we have to conclude that the Eurostat revelations show that we need to seek a solution to this problem and also to other internal problems in the Commission, with a view to everything working better, which will benefit all of us.
Â Â  Mr President, I was asked earlier on today by one of my colleagues for a rebuttal of the allegations of fraud in the European Union, and so I started off with a great surge of energy, mentioning that 80% of the EUâs budget is spent within the Member States, and most fraud occurs within the Structural Funds and agriculture.
So I started off well, but then I suddenly had to slow up because I thought about the kinds of cases that have been in the papers recently â the Eurostat case obviously springs to mind.
The problem there is that there a scandal going on and it is difficult to rebut it.
The Commission sat on the report, the General Audit Service did not open the box and look at the report and we have to ask why Mr Solbes did not keep a closer eye on his department.
I can rebut it by saying that the procedures for stopping this kind of thing were already in place, but the departments were overworked and there was no time for the system to work through.
It was during the early days of the reform process.
It is important, however, that we do not continue to allow the Directors-General to take all the responsibility.
We have to see political responsibility by individual commissions.
They have to shoulder this.
It may be worth people taking note of the outcome of the Hutton report today: we have seen the BBC found guilty of incompetence.
It is interesting that it is not the Director-General of the BBC who has gone, but the Chairman of the BBC.
It is the political head â not the administrative head.
We should bear that in mind and think about what that means in this context.
The accounting system has also, of course, come in for criticism and I could explain at this point that there are only two countries in the whole of the European Union that have implemented the kind of accrual accounting system that we want to see.
This Parliament and the Court of Auditors, however, asked the Commission to get on with it.
Of course, we must also look internally at the kinds of problems we have here in Parliament.
We are just about to enter an electoral campaign and many of us are enthusiastic about the whole European Union ideal, but we have to sell it in the face of a really difficult press, so you must help us to do more to counteract these allegations of fraud.
Â Â  Mr President, after Parliament gave discharge to the 2001 Community budget in April last year, we must now evaluate the measures adopted by the Commission, as a follow-up to the recommendations contained in the framework resolution that gave this discharge.
It is firstly important to emphasise the excellent work that Mr Casaca has done as rapporteur, which deserves praise, as it will certainly leave a positive mark on the current legislative period.
It also underlines the fact that Parliament is far from being a spent political force.
Among the many areas that he could have examined, the rapporteur wisely chose to concentrate on the accounting system, the operations and monitoring of Eurostat and the implementation of the common agricultural policy.
As regards the accounting system and the implementation of the CAP, the situation has developed in a far from satisfactory manner.
The Commission must therefore speed up the introduction of measures to standardise and streamline the accounting system and must pay special attention to monitoring financial flows relating to refunds, exports and management of stock.
As for Eurostat, given that most serious wrongdoings were committed prior to 1999, it is worrying that, in all probability, contraventions of financial regulations have continued beyond 1999.
It falls to the Commission to learn the appropriate lessons from this, which do not end at financial irregularities, but in fact take on political dimensions that undermine the very workings of the institutions.
While the report does not call for any kind of witch-hunt, which would be most unwelcome at the current stage of the European process, it does make it quite clear that Eurostat might not be the only case and, worse, might not be the most serious case detected in the Commissionâs activities.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that we must not lose sight of the essence of the political message sent out by proving irregularities and that the rapporteurâs prudent, sensible and workable recommendations must be duly adopted, complied with and enforced.
Â Â  Commissioner Schreyer has taken good note of all of the speeches, contributions and suggestions, and she will of course report what has been said in our debate to the College of Commissioners.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B5-0003/2004) to the Commission, on the White Paper on European Space Policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcomed the timeliness and the quality of the action plan presented to us for implementing the European space policy.
This policy was re-launched when the United States reworked its strategy and when the ESA and NASA reported exceptional successes that excited the world.
Space policy is crucial for international cooperation in research, for the Lisbon strategy and for guaranteeing Europeâs independent access to space.
The plan that we are discussing is of a horizontal nature in that it concerns many Community policies, from agriculture to communications.
After the Galileo project we are awaiting the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security project.
I share the desire to pool investment resources to achieve objectives that no country can achieve on its own, and I agree with the intention to take a more determined approach towards coordinating research, technological innovation and industrial policy.
There are two issues, however, that I urge the Commissioner to take note of.
The first concerns the repercussions, for the European programme, of the new strategy established by the most important space power in the world, with which we have strong ties in terms of collaboration.
The second concerns the discrepancies between Europeâs ambitions and the resources needed to implement the most important part of the space programme, and this seems to be the issue that the White Paper has left open.
The complex issues influencing this programme do indeed concern the constituent process as regards the competences for space and common defence, but also the political decisions, both national and Community, that are called for to make the European economy more competitive.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Bodrato on the quality of his report and I would like to include Commissioner Busquin in those congratulations since, in the course of this legislature, which is drawing to a close, he has been absolutely crucial in the European Union becoming a space power.
I do not believe the intergovernmental level is enough today and, in a world where competition in space matters is growing, we must underpin the development of space and the European Unionâs space autonomy with a strong political power, which is embodied by the European Union.
I believe that is the essence of what has happened during this legislature.
Personally, I am glad about it.
Another thing that has happened is that we have launched an ambitious programme, the Galileo programme, in which a number of countries in the world are interested, China in particular.
I would like to raise a number of points about the White Paper and Mr Bodratoâs resolution.
The first point is about the budget.
I believe it is absolutely essential for us to be very ambitious about space and in particular that our ambitions about space should be part of an industrial policy.
An independent space programme is not simply a matter of sending devices into Europeâs space, it is also about mastering the basic technologies and their civilian applications, of which there are a great number.
The second point is about the link between the military and civilian.
I think we should tie in our thinking, that of Commissioner Busquin and the DG for Research, with what is happening in the common foreign and security policy, because it is well known that the Americans and all the existing space powers, including the Russians and the Chinese, have devoted a large part of their space developments to military applications.
The third point concerns enlargement.
I think a number of the countries that are going to be joining Europe are not necessarily going to feel interested in Ariane or in space developments whose spin-offs today benefit mainly France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, but not necessarily Lithuania, Cyprus or Malta.
It is therefore very important that we send those countries a message.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to the effect that we should bring astronauts from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the corps of European astronauts and that we should plan a manned flight with one such astronaut very soon in order to involve them in the conquest of space and its magic and so that they will support it.
My final point is about US strategy.
I do not know whether it is an opportunist strategy on Mr Bushâs part in the run-up to the election campaign.
At any rate I am glad that Europe is in on it, but it must not for all that neglect the establishment of Soyuz in Kourou or neglect its independence in space matters.
That is what I wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  Mr President, we have before us a new definition of priorities and objectives.
The White Paper talks clearly about a demand-driven space policy, while both the White Paper and the previous texts and official statements clearly indicate that the aim is to use space for military objectives.
Some say that anyway space systems have a dual purpose: both civil and military.
I would merely comment that the decision on one use or the other is a political decision.
The fact that, for example, weapons exist which are capable of destroying the whole world does not mean that we will allow them to be used.
Others say that space cannot be developed without state funding, and they are right about that, but they add that the only way to obtain such funding within the framework of competition is to develop the military side.
I would ask them to tone down their worship of the free market and competition policy and I would counter-propose public funding for space research and exploration.
I would also warn about the anger of the grass-roots movement if an attempt is made to use space to serve defence and security policy, a clearly aggressive policy which aims to turn the European Union into a second global policeman at the side of the United States of America.
The new approach may serve business interests, which will profit both via market mechanisms and from state funding for military applications.
But it does not serve anyone else.
On the contrary, the entrance of the European Union into the military use of space is a serious escalation in the arms race, which is extremely dangerous to world peace.
It really is a pity that man's most advanced achievements will be used against him.
But that is an unavoidable characteristic of the capitalist system.
We have no choice but to categorically oppose the policy to commercialise and militarise space.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the peoples of united Europe are waiting for a grand design.
Our fellow citizens often experience Europe only through the distorting mirror of standards, rules and constraints, and we must make space exploration one of the top ambitions of European integration, an ambition that would bring our fellow citizens both pride and definite benefits in their everyday lives, like the Galileo project.
Pursuing a grand design requires resources, however.
And today there is not sufficient political will to give European space policy the credits it needs.
The Commission has tried, as the White Paper shows.
An extra 4.6% increase in space expenditure every year is good, but it is a minimum.
The Unionâs Heads of State must understand that when President Bush is ordering flights to Mars and China is successfully launching its first manned spacecraft, Europe can no longer allow itself to lag behind.
The time has come to change gear and give a real boost to space expenditure.
To do that, we must look to the states, through the ESA and the large national agencies, which, like the DLR in Germany or the CNES in France, have irreplaceable experience.
But we should also go beyond the intergovernmental level.
The draft Constitution for Europe provides for the beginnings of a Community space policy.
I am pleased about that, provided that in return for these new prerogatives the Union becomes a new source of funding for space.
We cannot demand new competences without assuming the cost.
And we must at the same time continue to seek external funding.
The cooperation with India and China through the Galileo project is an example to be followed and built upon as the opportunities arise, with the Russian Federation, for example, like France has just done with the plan to establish a Soyuz launch pad in Kourou.
I will finish by saying that if we really do not want Europe to be excluded from the conquest of space, funding cannot remain public.
We must lift the taboos and say clearly, as the resolution invites us to do, that the funding of space policy must be opened up to private industry.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the various matters raised by this oral question bear witness to the growing interest Parliament is showing in the establishment of a European space policy commensurate with the Unionâs ambitions.
I want to pay tribute to Parliament for its unwavering support on these matters and I want to say that it was thanks to this encouragement that the Commission launched a wide-ranging debate in Europe on the future of the space sector, a debate in which some Members of Parliament were directly involved.
Following that debate, the Commission adopted a White Paper, some of the important actions from which are raised in your question.
In order to develop space technology, the Commission proposes increasing public expenditure in the field, once a master plan has been drawn up setting out all the missing technologies, the players concerned and a timetable of measures.
The sixth framework programme is already able to contribute to this field, in particular through the priority given to âaeronautics and spaceâ and to information society technologies.
The Commission will be looking into how to continue this form of development in the next framework programme.
So far as access to space is concerned, the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Space Agency, supports the implementation of a series of measures, including most importantly the improvement of the launching service offered from the Guiana space centre.
This action has already been adopted as a project under the Quickstart growth initiative and was presented and adopted at the last European Council.
Definition work on the financial arrangements has begun in liaison with the European Investment Bank.
Multilateral talks have begun with the other space powers, which should result in the proposal of a regulatory framework that will be acceptable at international level.
Finally, the Commission is looking into direct involvement in the maintenance of the basic terrestrial infrastructures for the future European space programme.
So far as Galileo is concerned, the potential role of the private sector should be that of final operator following a selection procedure conducted by the Galileo joint undertaking.
The Commission will also be entering into bilateral negotiations with India.
And a framework agreement has just been signed between the European Community and China.
Within the next few days, that is on 3 February, the Commission should be adopting a communication based on a detailed report drawn up with the European Space Agency and the Member States drawing the lessons from the initial phase and setting out an action plan for the âGlobal Monitoring for Environment and Securityâ (GMS) initiative.
For the launch of the subsequent deployment phase, the Commission proposes that a formal coordination structure, possibly drawing on the experience with Galileo, be progressively put in place.
The Envisat satellite is universally admired for its environmental monitoring ability and is a marvellous example of earth observation, in the field of which we are in the vanguard of development.
Until this structure is put in place for GMS there will be a more lightweight interim solution, as provided in the framework agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency.
In this connection, I would like to point out the importance of Parliamentâs opinion for concluding this agreement between the European Community and the ESA.
The Commission is also drawing up a policy on access to space and launchers, for which the installation of the Soyuz launcher at the Guiana space centre is a specific example of the strategic cooperation that can be established between Russia and Europe.
The final decision on this programme is expected to be taken at the European Space Agencyâs Council meeting on 4Â February.
In the White Paper, the Commission suggests that the Union should be able to be involved in keeping launch installations operational and in funding work and research with a view to defining a future space transport system.
Finally, in the White Paper, the Commission suggests continuing the activities connected with the international space station, because by so doing the Europeans will improve their experience in the field of prolonged stays in space.
In this connection, I was pleased to hear MrÂ Savaryâs suggestion, which of course concerned Europe as a whole, that astronauts from the future accession states should be involved.
The international station may also be considered an essential intermediate stage before going on to explore the solar system.
You mentioned President Bushâs statement.
It requires in-depth analysis.
It does of course have consequences that affect us given the investment agreed by the European side, in particular to keep the international station accessible to European astronauts.
We should not therefore sell the whole process without receiving assurances that that process, to which we are very committed, will continue.
You also know â and this gives food for thought â that the European satellite that is observing Mars has obtained remarkable results, since you have seen the photographs which show that there might be ice on the moon.
This was achieved using European technology, even though, sadly, Beagle has not managed similar success.
But the spectral analysis of Mars is a leading European technology of which we can be proud.
Finally, building on that, there is also the idea of seeing how we envisage manned flights, so that we are not left out of the race towards those objectives either.
In cooperation with the ESA, the Commission will in 2004 be setting up a group of wise men that should enable the European Union to define its position on manned space flight.
These, in a few words, are the most important aspects.
I am truly pleased to conclude by telling you that the Commission is including space and space research in its thinking on the future financial perspectives that are at the heart of the Commissionâs debate and which Parliament will, on 10 February I think, be the first to know.
We will be giving the first broad outlines of the financial perspectives.
And when it comes to financial perspectives, it is clear that research and innovation programmes must have their funding increased, among other things to sustain a space policy that will be crucial for Europeâs technological progress and its place in the world.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Busquin.
To wind up the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Article 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B5-0004/2004) to the Commission on the Communication on 'The future of the textiles and clothing sector in the enlarged European Union'.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the Commission for the communication on the future of the textile and clothing industry, which has been published at a time when the sector is very worried about the final elimination of the import quota system on 1 January 2005 in view of the competitive pressure from developing countries â countries which also have a large export capacity â which could lead to the closure of many companies and consequently to job losses.
China is a particular worry, since in addition to its competitiveness â the result of low business costs â it has a very aggressive trade policy, and shows little respect for the rules governing international trade.
Recent studies indicate job losses in the European Union in the order of 40-60% by 2010 depending on the sector.
If we add to this the fact that the European textile and clothing industry is concentrated in certain regions, with a predominantly female labour force, you will realise the gravity of the situation, and the urgent need for decisive action on the part of public administrations at all levels if the sector is to be successful in meeting the challenges it now faces.
Obviously, the primary responsibility lies with the business directors who are responsible for defining strategies and making the investments needed in these new circumstances, but it is equally true that public authorities have an obligation to ensure that operating conditions are conducive to development.
Clearly the industryâs future will include a reassessment of the sectorâs comparative advantages: the quality of goods, design, the fashion factor, and, above all, the sectorâs capacity for innovation and for developing new hi-tech products, especially intelligent fabrics and industrial fabrics.
There will also be a phase of considering the opportunities for moving into the international market.
This is why the measures proposed in the Commissionâs communication are so welcome, because they address this very issue.
For this reason, I am also very pleased that Commissioner Busquin is with us today, given the importance of research and development if the sector is to emerge victorious in the future.
The problem is when and how to implement the measures detailed in the communication.
It is all very well to analyse the sectorâs problems and to determine how best to resolve them, but funding also needs to be set aside for the measures, which include creating a specific regional assistance programme for the sector which does not qualify as state aid and for providing training for workers to help them adapt to the changing labour market.
This also needs to be combined with an action plan and with the adoption of a firm timetable so that activities can get under way before the end of 2004 and above all, before it is too late.
We also need a firm commitment from the Commission that it will not reduce the trade policy measures it is proposing to put a stop to unfair competition, and to high duties, peak tariffs and non-tariff barriers which make market access so difficult.
Commissioner, the future of the sector and the continued existence of thousands of jobs are in your hands.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for joining us for this debate on the problems in the textile and clothing industry.
There is no doubt that this debate is taking place, among other reasons, because of the Commissionâs communication on the textile industry in the context of an enlarged Europe, for which I want to thank the Commission.
The communication proposes a whole range of measures to assist the sector in its efforts to define a strategy in view of the new market challenges and, in particular, in view of the end of import quotas from 1 January 2005.
Some recent and imminent events, such as China joining the WTO and the elimination of quotas and duties for certain products, are forcing the industry to take steps to resolve problems rapidly.
In my opinion, some of the measures proposed in the communication are urgently needed.
Firstly, it is important to have both Community and national policies that encourage SMEs to invest directly in research and development activities, and in innovation, as an essential means of incorporating new production processes, of encouraging creativity and fashion, and as a result, increasing the sectorâs ability to compete on the global market.
I have to say that such matters merit consideration.
A short while ago, Commissioner Busquin talked to me about these initiatives â initiatives such as creating support offices for SMEs to help them obtain intellectual property rights protection for brand names, designs and patents.
Secondly, I would say that we need to obtain agreements within the WTO whereby certain countries which are our rivals or which have zero duty access to our markets, or at least very low levels of duty, are required to reduce their current high duty levels as an essential part of trade liberalisation.
Finally, it is very important that the Commission implement the proposed measures on protecting intellectual property rights.
Third countries must respect these rights, and it is also essential that we monitor compliance with the APIC agreements, if we are to combat piracy and counterfeiting.
I do hope that the rapid approval of the Directive on enforcing intellectual property rights, and the revision of the customs regulation, will become key instruments in protecting this industrial property which is so important for so many sectors, including textiles.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by thanking Commissioner Busquin for coming here today.
I should also like to express my appreciation for the high quality of the Commission Communication on the future of the textile industry in an enlarged Europe.
We are still very concerned, however, and many questions remain unanswered.
I shall now highlight some, as raised by Mrs Ferrer.
How will the Commission translate proposals into specific actions?
What timetable does it envisage and what budget does it intend to use for implementing these measures?
Commissioner Lamyâs optimistic words, regarding the textiles and clothing industry, come to mind at this point.
He classified it as a sector with a future in the European Union and of major importance for the European agenda for trade.
Commissioner Lamy recently said that âby 2005 import quotas will have been abolished, but our commitment to the industry will not waverâ.
We have to address current and future challenges, while resolutely guaranteeing jobs in the sector.
It is essential to promote companiesâ competitiveness through innovation, flexible production practices and by providing the current workforce in the industry with vocational training and further education.
I should like to highlight some of the points in the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer:
- firstly: the vital role of structural funds.
I endorse the request to establish, within the financial framework of the structural funds, a specific regional initiative for the sector in order to address the difficulties that will arise in 2005 and to adapt the workers to the new demands of the employment market;
- secondly: creating a textiles and clothing monitoring centre.
This will make it possible to analyse the development of trade between China and the EU and to ensure compliance with the rules in force in both regions.
Assuming that the Commission agrees, when could such a monitoring centre be created?
- thirdly: bilateral trade agreements.
All of the EUâs bilateral trade agreements must incorporate the principle of corporate social responsibility, compliance with the fundamental rights laid down by the International Labour Organisation and sustainable development.
Â Â  Mr President, these are indeed challenging times for the European Unionâs textile and clothing industry.
In that context, I am delighted to welcome the Commissionâs communication on this matter.
The region I represent, the East Midlands, has the largest cluster of clothing companies in the United Kingdom and has the second largest clothing and textile industry in Europe.
Many of my constituents working in this industry have been made redundant time after time and they see manufacturing moving to the low-wage economies of developing countries.
It is understandable that to these workers, who are still in such vulnerable positions, protectionist measures seem an attractive proposition.
However, in the long term this is not the way to deal with the problems facing the industry today.
In todayâs global economy the EU is never going to be able to compete on price alone and nor should it.
The EU should maximise the advantages of well-trained workers who are motivated, skilled and experienced.
We have succeeded in this industry in the past and we can continue to do so in the future.
There are different, innovative ways to face the challenges of increasing global competition.
For some businesses EU funding has proved to be an important tool in boosting competitiveness.
The East Midlands Textile Association runs numerous projects â funded through the European Regional Development Fund â which assist companies: projects such as MAS, which helps small businesses in the region to branch out into new markets, or the Business ICT Bureau, which provides an expert source of ICT help specific to the needs of the textile sector.
These are good examples of how funding is being used to help establish networks between local organisations working in the same area.
While funding programmes are beneficial, they are also short-term in nature.
I know that work is being done to ensure that maximum long-term economic benefit will be gained by harnessing the East Midlands textile cluster.
For other businesses the answer may be to look towards technical textiles, ranging from specialist heat- and chemical-resistant materials to flight socks designed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
I should like to raise a note of caution here.
For some companies the correct response to the challenges is to look to the high-tech field, but it is not an option available to everyone.
It would be easy to say that companies are resistant to change.
If you look at small organisations with just a few employees and tight profit margins it is much more difficult for those companies to make the significant investment in research that will come more easily to the bigger players.
My final point is that the head office of the trade union, KFAT, is in Leicester, my home town.
That union has informed the debate about the future of the textile industry.
I, like the industry, the trade unions and those who work in it, look forward to the implementation of the Commissionâs proposals.
Â Â  Mr President, it is well known that the textiles and clothing industry still has a considerable presence in the enlarged EU, employing around 2.7 million people, mainly women, even after shedding some 850Â 000 jobs and losing many thousands of businesses between 1990 and 2001.
Consequently, the threatened total abolition of import quotas next 1Â January may seriously hamper development and exacerbate unemployment, especially in areas with the highest concentration of textiles and clothing companies, such as the North and Beiras regions of Portugal.
There is currently a serious problem of multinationals relocating; in my home town of Vila Nova de Gaia, for example, there is a German company, Brax Portugal, threatening to close down within days and to lay off 450 workers, mainly women.
This is a serious problem that is repeated more or less throughout Portugal.
It must be borne in mind that the textiles and clothing industry is of major strategic importance to the EU with great prospects for the future, and that it can make a major contribution towards promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion.
It may also, however, cause serious unemployment and hamper development unless we adopt appropriate measures to ensure that such problems do not arise in the future.
Hence the proposals that we have tabled, promoting the interests of the production sector, given that a cohesive whole depends on all parts of the chain.
The aim is to ensure the survival both of mid-range products and of those with a high added value, and to guarantee job prospects.
It is therefore essential that the Commission present a concrete, cohesive and clearly defined action plan, in terms of instruments, financial resources and timetable.
Particular attention should be paid in such an action plan to encouraging innovation and using new technology in the sector, to strengthening interaction between the various sectors of the industry, to carrying out an extensive programme of vocational training, to modernising and strengthening support for small and medium-sized enterprises and to protecting the environment.
A Community programme must also be established, with suitable support mechanisms, especially for those less-favoured regions that depend on the sector.
A sectoral approach must also be adopted for the textiles and clothing sector, specifically within the framework of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, next year will see radical change in the textile sector, when quotas are abolished after over 30Â years.
The import tariffs in the European Union now rank among the lowest in the world.
That requires comparable market liberalisation on the part of other countries that have large textile sectors and markets.
The rapporteur and CommissionerÂ Lamy are rightly committed to this.
Secondly, following the abolition of quantitative restrictions, there will be the temptation to adopt alternative ways of restricting imports for protectionist reasons: anti-dumping measures and safeguard clauses, for example.
How does the Commissioner intend to prevent this?
Non-tariff barriers, such as unnecessary bureaucratic import procedures, also need to be reduced.
My third point concerns labelling and certification.
As the rapporteur acknowledges, these are essential for the protection of core labour and environmental standards.
What specific steps does the CommissionerÂ envisage to give more substance to these, particularly with regard to the means of production?
By way of conclusion, I should like to make an observation about the trading position of developing countries, which requires not merely access to the European market; the European Union must also stop dumping cotton, which interferes with the market in raw materials.
Providing EURÂ 900Â million perÂ annum in export subsidies to European cotton farmers is not conducive to a better price on the world market.
The result is that the world price for a bale of cotton has fallen by half sinceÂ 1990.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to welcome these initiatives, in both the oral question and the legislative resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and to say that we will support them, along with certain other initiatives tabled by fellow Members on the issue.
Ours is a vote in favour of placing greater emphasis on free, equal and fair trade, and on respect for the principle of reciprocity in international trade relations, which, as is well documented, is not currently respected, particularly in the textiles and clothing sector.
We also believe that it is essential to pay greater attention to the case of China, treating it with objectivity and realism.
A mere monitoring centre will not be sufficient.
Clear measures must be implemented to combat Chinaâs hegemony in terms of the international trade in textiles and clothing.
China already accounts for almost 25% of world textile production, an alarming figure, particularly for genuine developing countries such as Bangladesh or Vietnam, which may also be crushed by the Chinese steamroller in this sector.
We feel that, in view of its considerable muscle in this industry, China can no longer be considered a developing country.
Otherwise we run the risk of killing the textiles and clothing industry everywhere else in the world.
Finally, still on the question of access to markets, we feel that it would have been useful if the resolution had mentioned â it is too late at this juncture â the need to implement a series of practical actions in the area of trade, to be developed by business, with the aim of penetrating new markets.
It would be essential to establish support mechanisms to take part in trade fairs, to open sales outlets and distribution platforms, and to carry out prospecting missions of target markets, etc. These are measures that we have submitted to the Commission for consideration.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the industrial revolution in England in the latter part of the eighteenth century started in the textile industry.
This sector has a pioneering history, an active present and a future full of challenges and uncertainties.
The European textiles industry is today threatened by competition from countries where prices for goods are extremely low and where there are no environmental concerns or constraints.
Exploitation of labour, particularly of child labour, reminds us of the wretched conditions that marked our own industrial revolution.
Yet the textiles industry continues to survive, modernise and renew itself.
It is the point where industry, craft and art converge, and it plays a major role in peopleâs lifestyles.
The neo-liberal dogmas that had previously held back the EU, fearful of a de-industrialised Europe, from adopting an industrial policy, are now obsolete.
European decision-makers can now see what is happening and can take a stand in defence of the textile and clothing industry.
The Commission communication is therefore most welcome, albeit over-long.
We also support the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer, containing the essential elements of a European policy for the sector.
Since trade policy falls within the exclusive competence of the EU, it is of vital importance that the Commission does not turn the textiles and clothing sector into a bargaining chip to win concessions in other areas deemed more appealing.
To do so would be pitifully short-sighted and ethically reprehensible.
On the other hand, the negotiators of the Doha Agenda for development must fight for conditions of access to markets of third countries that are equitable, requiring in particular that they comply with the principle of reciprocity and open up new markets.
Portugal, as we all know, is a country in which jobs and economic and social cohesion depend a great deal on the textiles and clothing sector.
It is therefore highly sensitive to the downturns and slumps of this industry.
Some highly industrialised regions of Portugal are even experiencing economic crisis, as we speak.
The Commission must therefore back up its words with action.
Â Â  Mr President, it is quite opportune that I am the last speaker, as I want to add a note of optimism to the debate, which until now has been rather gloomy.
I appreciate that these are challenging times for the textile industry.
I appreciate too that we are running into a new era where import controls will be different and a new sector will be joining our textile industry.
But, to inject a note of optimism, just as I said in the debate in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one has only to look at the jackets and suits we are all wearing and ask where they were made.
I will tell you where they were made: in Europe.
This jacket that I am wearing was made by Crombie, a local textile firm in my town in England; it is a good, English suit.
I do not know where the cloth came from, but it was the skills of British workers and those of the textile industry in Europe that took a low-quality commodity product and transformed it into a high-quality, high-value product â that is the future for the textile industry.
Different parts of the textile industry will find different routes, some more technical than others, some craft-related; some will go in other directions.
That is the future for our industry.
This should be the message going out to the industry from the Commission White Paper.
We must be sure that when the Commission acts, our textile and clothing sector â much of it being made up of small companies â is able to invest in new technology and production techniques.
It must be able to find ways to add value to the basic products that we may be importing from elsewhere.
We must also â and this is a point which has not been previously mentioned â protect our industry from counterfeiting.
This has become increasingly vital.
Counterfeiting is a very serious issue for high-value, quality products, and is an issue we must address.
I see no reference to this at all in the White Paper.
Finally, if we get it right for the textile industry, we can learn some very important lessons for other industrial sectors.
We should also be looking at leather goods and footwear, and using textiles as an industrial sector flagship that can lead the way in this new century, with European workers able to earn a living from producing high-value, quality products.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares your concerns about this question and is taking the necessary steps to deal with them.
In view of these major challenges that face us in the textiles and clothing sector and which will remain for some years to come, in particular, as you have stressed, the effect of abolishing import quotas on 1 January 2005, the Commission has re-examined its policies and instruments in order to identify measures or lines of action that might make the textiles and clothing sector more competitive.
These are reflected in the communication to which you have drawn attention, the one on the future of the textiles and clothing sector adopted by the Commission on 29 October 2003 and welcomed at a Council meeting on competitiveness on 27 November 2003.
As you know, the Unionâs strategy for international trade and for Doha is to seek reciprocity for textiles and clothing.
Together, these policies and measures seek to give the industry and those working in the sector a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will make it easy to plan strategies and investments in the medium and long term.
The Commission welcomes the support for these initiatives and ideas contained in the resolution on the future of the textiles sector that Parliament will shortly be adopting.
The Commission will look closely at the new ideas mentioned in the text of the resolution.
Some of the recommendations contained in the communication could be followed by concrete proposals within a relatively short space of time.
For the rest, some of the communicationâs ideas and suggestions require further investigation before being translated into action.
In order to assist the Commission in these investigations and in following up these matters, it will be putting in place a high level group whose task will be to formulate recommendations for improving the conditions of competitiveness.
The purpose of this high level group will be to contribute to the process of implementing industrial and commercial policies in the textiles and clothing sector of the enlarged Union.
The group will be involved in the Commission servicesâ regular monitoring of the sectorâs economic development.
It will provide reports and recommendations to the Commission and other players taking decisions on the proposed initiative in order to help the sector adjust to the various challenges facing it.
Those reports will have to include recommendations on the key issues affecting competition in the sector.
The high level group will be made up of commissioners, ministers, heads of undertakings and directors general or presidents of federations involved in the textiles and clothing sector.
It will look after innovation, research and development.
I was pleased that you stressed the role of research and development in this respect.
In fact, I recently had the opportunity to visit a textile undertaking which has made considerable efforts in research and innovation and has become competitive on the Chinese market as a result, although it was in a difficult position a few years ago.
With a much more effective patent on dyeing and more mechanisms for managing productivity, it has become competitive in a very precise niche.
The services also tell us that exports to China increase when there are these new industrial capacities.
It is therefore clear that there is a future when we develop this research and innovation in a field where we have know-how.
Another topic is the question of intellectual property.
MrÂ Berenguer Fuster is quite right when he says that this question must clearly form the basis of our thinking on the international level because these new processes can all be fragile if we do not protect them with solid patents.
Research and development is certainly an important factor.
We are also considering setting up a technology platform on the textiles sector, with the main players.
The other subjects are education and training, and regional policy.
You stressed the problem of the Structural Funds in this connection, Mrs Bastos.
In proposing the new mechanisms for the Structural Funds, my colleague Mr Barnier says very clearly that they will have to make an even greater contribution than in the past to the process of growth, the âLisbonâ process.
In sectors like textiles, the next Structural Funds will attach greater priority and importance to research, innovation and training, if that is what the regions want, of course.
International cooperation, labelling and other commerce-related subjects may all have an effect on the impact.
This high level group will start work in February 2004, that is virtually tomorrow, looking in particular at the objectives and the expected results, and will be followed by at least two plenary sessions before July 2004.
The Commission will present its first report on the groupâs work to the Council in July 2004.
I think proper account is being taken of the problem.
The European institutions and the Member States will be kept informed of the groupâs work and of the implementation of its conclusions.
The Commission is aware of the need to move quickly, since it wants to implement all of it before the end of 2004.
By the end of February the Commission will draw up a list of the various trade proposals, measures and actions resulting from the communication, giving a timetable for their implementation.
This will be shared with Parliament and the Member States.
You also mentioned, Mrs Bastos, the question of the budget to be used for the implementation of the measures proposed in the Commission communication.
Our intention is to use existing Community programmes and investments to implement the specific measures adopted, since we have to move quickly.
Each specific measure will be implemented by the appropriate Commission services responsible for the field in question, using its own budget.
I can tell you that the field of research and calls for proposals under the framework programme offer potential for interesting projects and I think that also applies in other sectors.
I believe I have demonstrated how interested the Commission and Parliament are in this strategic sector for our economy.
Â Â  Thank you very much Commissioner Busquin.
To wind up the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Article 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.(2)
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0480/2003) by Mr Laschet, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and the United Nations (2003/2049(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what do the European Union and the United Nations have in common?
Why has Parliament produced a report on the subject?
Is there nothing more pressing?
Does a parliament really have to look at every single subject, even at those that are not particularly high on the agenda?
That was what people said in 2002, when it was first suggested that Parliament should produce a report on the relationship between the European Union and the United Nations.
We had hardly had any political debates about the relationship between the two institutions â there were seven lines in reports of European Council meetings when at some point in the text there was a passing reference to the United Nations; and the only active institution was the Commission which, in the quiet, calm, effective manner familiar to all of us, paid 60% of the budget for development programmes for humanitarian aid.
Of course, there were no major political implications or demands involved: it was very effective, but not related to any political message.
Then came the Iraq crisis, during which the US President described the UN as irrelevant.
That was when Parliament began to say that this was perhaps an interesting subject after all, that we wanted to make relations between the European Union and the United Nations more political in nature, and that we wanted to produce a report in order to ask the other institutions to consider introducing more politics in our relations with the United Nations.
Today, nearly one year after Parliament made that decision, we can now say that the United Nations is not irrelevant.
Even the most powerful country in the world has realised that the legitimacy of the United Nations is needed in order to rebuild a state, to establish democracy and to create a nation.
Here in Europe, the Commission issued a very significant communication in September â a political communication first and foremost â which defined relations between the European institutions, and also their future, in terms of a European Constitution.
The Council is also much more active nowadays in seeking agreement with the United Nations, and I believe that todayâs visit to this House by the Secretary-General of the United Nations marks the start of greater political cooperation.
What, then, are the main subjects we need to discuss?
One should be todayâs message: the fact that the European Parliament is speaking out in favour of multilateralism.
Not because, as Robert Kagan once claimed, the European Union favours multilateralism only because it is incapable of acting unilaterally.
No, that is not the reason.
Our reason is that the European Union is multilateral in structure and in nature.
The horrific wars in the twentieth century taught us that multilateral cooperation is the right way to build a peaceful and just future, and the lesson we have learnt in the European Union holds true for the United Nations too â that is why we favour a multilateral approach.
This is the message that Parliament should send out today, and if we do so, if we want to play our part in the world, then we have to start by doing our homework.
The Heads of State and Government did not do that in December, because the tasks included creating a legal status for the European Union to put an end to the situation whereby the Commission can go over the Communityâs head because it is a member of the FAO, with a seat and vote, and whereby in political matters, we have no legal personality in Nairobi, Geneva or Vienna and so cannot act.
The European Union needs a legal personality.
We also need a European Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will have to bring together our policies with those of the Council and the Commission and represent us all internationally.
That means we need a European Union representative at the UN offices, not a Commission office, a Council office and an office for the Presidency.
No, we need a representative for foreign affairs, and that is what Parliament is proposing.
We should also continue discussions after Kofi Annanâs visit.
We need the Commission to produce an annual report that will get Parliament discussing the political priorities in order to establish how to proceed, what we have achieved and what we have not achieved.
We need clarity in the budget, so that we know which institutions, agencies, and funds receive money from us, and which do not.
I think, too, that Jean Monnetâs comment â that Europe should help make a better world â ties in very well with Kofi Annanâs message at the last General Assembly, where he said that the United Nations makes the world a better place.
That we are combining the two today is ideal, and means that today is very significant both for Europe and for the United Nations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss relations between the European Union and the United Nations, and I want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report.
Nobody who knows the honourable Member will be surprised that it is really an outstanding and sensible piece of work.
I would also like to stress at the outset that the Commission is obviously ready to enter into a more regular dialogue with the Parliament on relations between us and the United Nations.
It is important for both the Commission and the Parliament to have such an exchange of views on such an important subject.
It is only when Parliament, Council and Commission â and indeed the Member States â work well together that the European Union collectively can deliver the support that is needed for the UN system.
As the honourable Member said, the timing of the report is extremely appropriate.
The Iraq crisis has, in many ways, served as a wake-up call for us all on the essential role of the UN in questions of peace and security.
The Union is an important partner of the UN and we should stand by our commitment to effective multilateralism.
The full support of the House for this endeavour is important and I welcome it, especially on the day that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan will address the Parliament.
The full Commission had the great privilege and pleasure of spending two-and-a-half hours talking to him yesterday.
The Commission set out its views on the subject in a communication of 10 September 2003, entitled 'The Choice of Multilateralism'.
The purpose of the communication was threefold.
First and foremost, it was to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and the UN.
Second, it was to demonstrate the manner in which we implement this commitment in our daily work.
The paper provides an impressive inventory of the extensive cooperation between the EU and the UN that is already taking place, and of our support for UN activities on a wide number of issues, ranging from conflict prevention to development aid and from crisis management to poverty reduction.
Whilst the issues of peace and security that are dealt with by the Security Council attract most of the media attention, it would be a mistake to focus our attention and support only on those questions.
Third, we identify a large number of practical actions to improve our internal coordination on UN questions in the UN bodies themselves, in Brussels and also in the Member States, with the overall aim of enhancing our influence in the UN, and in an attempt to assist it more effectively.
In response to this communication, the Council recently agreed on a set of comprehensive conclusions on EU-UN relations that provides a good platform for our future work.
This debate takes place at a time when the Union is looking for an enhanced role on the international stage.
Witness to this are not only the proposals of the Convention to streamline the CFSP and the EUâs external action more generally â and here I note in particular the proposal to let the proposed foreign minister speak on behalf of the Union in the Security Council whenever there is a common EU position â but also the European security strategy with its leading theme of effective multilateralism.
The European Union should be ready to stand up for its belief in the importance of the United Nations.
I think that Parliamentâs report represents an additional strong signal of support from the European Union at this challenging moment for the UN.
After the Iraq crisis many in the international community have made great efforts to find our way back towards collective action, including renewed UN engagement in Iraq.
Of course, it is not enough to keep referring to multilateralism over and over again as though it was some mantra.
We need to think seriously and creatively about the kinds of results we want to obtain from multilateral organisations and instruments.
How can we improve their effectiveness in dealing with the threats and challenges that the world is facing?
These include poverty reduction, weapons of mass destruction, failed states, international crime, terrorism, climate change.
And how best can we contribute to that endeavour?
All these goals are addressed by the Parliamentâs report and there is a broad meeting of minds with the Commissionâs own communication on the subject.
It is clear that our common starting point is the belief that the UN system is the key to safeguarding international security in the largest sense of that term.
Whether we are looking at the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in checking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or whether we are looking at global targets for poverty reduction and sustainable development, I hardly need to underline the importance of the so-called soft issues for the wider security agenda.
Development and security are inextricably linked and mutually dependent.
It is in this perspective that we should support the work of the high-level panel on UN reform established by the Secretary-General last year.
The European Union should provide an input to this process and I welcome the intention of the Council presidency to work on the submission of an EU contribution.
The Commission will participate actively in this exercise.
Finally, as regards the European Unionâs own internal coordination and operations of the UN, I am pleased to see that the Commissionâs analysis and recommendations are very much in line with those that are presented in the honourable Memberâs admirable report.
As for the creation and subsequent implementation of multilateral instruments, the Commission shares the reportâs opinion that the European Union should play a leading role and assist third countries in fulfilling their obligations, as we have done, for example, in relation to counter-terrorism.
Parliament could in this context use its cooperation with third countries to address these kinds of issues and in that way help to build bridges between North and South.
Let me conclude by commending the report to the House and by underlining as well the Commissionâs determination to work closely with the Parliament, with the Council and with the UN to implement the recommendations that are contained in it.
Â Â  â Mr President, by honouring Kofi Annan and receiving this report on cooperation between the European Union and United Nations, the European Parliament has, today, clearly declared its support for multilateralism in international relations and indicated that we see cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations as an essential part of conflict resolution.
We want to strengthen the European Union and also the United Nations, both of which have been weakened by the debate over whether and how to intervene in Iraq.
Since the European Union is preparing to create its own Minister for Foreign Affairs, it should ensure that the role has plenty of substance to it.
The road to a common foreign and security policy will also undoubtedly lead to greater cooperation between the EU and the UN.
We are currently a global player, providing over half of all contributions to the United Nations and over 60% of total international development aid, but we should move on to become a global player capable of taking a leading role in this critical phase of the United Nationsâ development and helping to shape the UN of the future.
Strengthening cooperation between the EU and the UN should and can have a positive effect in developing multilateralism.
It can and should also affect all activities undertaken by the two organisations: the fight against terrorism, conflict prevention, human rights, crisis management, environmental protection and weapons of mass destruction.
This would clearly demonstrate the reality of cooperation, and in practical terms, would lead to the implementation of the EUâs Millennium Objectives, which were established in 2000.
If we are to do this, the EU must have more influence within the United Nations.
UN-specific elements can be included at all levels of the European Union, and it seems appropriate for the European Parliament to be included in the process.
Precisely because the idea of the EU speaking with one voice in the United Nations Security Council still seems somewhat idealistic, multilateral instruments and commitments should be used to boost the EUâs role and profile within the United Nations.
Perhaps one way to move ahead would be to produce a concrete proposal on compliance with the treaty on weapons of mass destruction and the UN Security Councilâs role in ensuring it.
Â Â  Mr President, addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said, and I quote: âThe last twelve months have been very painful for those of us who believe in collective answers to our common problems and challengesâ.
It was a time when many voices in the political world, in the media and a large proportion of public opinion believed that the United Nations was failing in some way.
Subsequent developments, in Iraq in particular, have demonstrated that things are never simple, and the current situation can be described by means of the lyrics of a Spanish song which say âneither with you nor without you is there any relief for my painâ.
There is no such relief either the United Nations â which demonstrated, not in Iraq, but in relation to previous terrible crises, in Rwanda for example, its powerlessness to prevent tragic outcomes â or the United Nations, as demonstrated at the moment by this ridiculous impasse of an intervention which has no political solution in a country such as Iraq.
Our group's position on the Laschet report has been one of broad agreement, with the emphasis on certain fundamental aspects.
The first is a strong commitment to principles and values.
In response to the idiotic criticism of those people who believe this to be idealism, we could reply that values are interests.
In our societies and in the whole world, the application of principles and values is our principal interest.
While, moreover, we are talking about lesser interests, we can state that the material contribution of the European Union and its countries is so great and so disproportionate to its political weight within the UN system that the European Union is obliged to commit itself to making progress towards a modification of the current state of affairs.
There are two ways of doing this: one is the establishment of a common and strong European Union foreign and defence policy; the other is to make progress towards a European Union presence on the Security Council in a positive way and on the basis of speeding up the current constitution-building process, which ensures that the voice of its peoples, by means of their representatives, are respected by governments and that we establish as soon as possible a European Constitution which allows us to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name.
Â Â  â Mr President, the new world order both requires a stronger United Nations and, at the same time, hinders its coming into being.
More than ever, major world problems require a global approach, which entails effective decision-making and implementation.
The UN should undergo a thorough overhaul in order to reflect the new relationships and to carry out the many tasks in an adequate manner.
Everyone here is agreed on this, yet nothing is being done because everyone has a different opinion on how it should be.
It is hypocritical to embrace the UN millennium declaration if we are subsequently not prepared to act on it and stick our necks out for it.
UN reforms are not only technical, but often involve a redistribution of power, and that is where things are going continually wrong.
For example, the reform of the Security Council has been the subject of squabbles for more than ten years, with no results so far.
The United States is by far the most powerful player on the world stage and has little need of multilateralism, which it regards as a restriction of its power.
Other countries, including France and the United Kingdom, refuse to relinquish the privileges they have inherited from the old world order.
Potential permanent members do not grant each other favoured positions.
Permanent seats for continents only work if the regional powers can agree on a rotation mechanism.
The proposed double veto system is better than what we have at the moment, but offers no real solution, especially not if the number of permanent seats is being increased still further.
Instead of this, it would be preferable to use a European model of differential vote weighting, and hence to abolish the veto system.
I do not believe that the European Union's political coordination in the UN is as bad as Mr Laschet suggests in his excellent report. Generally, there is most definitely EU consensus in the General Assembly.
Despite this, Europe appears hopelessly divided in major crises, such as over Iraq.
In my opinion, this is mainly attributable to the increased rivalry between France, the United Kingdom and Germany.
A legal entity, or even an EU minister, will be unable to create common foreign policy as long as the big European states continue to fight for EU leadership.
The Laschet report contains many interesting recommendations for building up relations between the European Union and the UN.
Some are very valuable, but there are perhaps too many for the short term.
We have to be careful not to create another UN-EU bureaucracy.
In my opinion, the main role of our Parliament is in the area of monitoring and not so much in the diplomatic arena.
The enlarged European Union can, and must, make a substantial contribution to the desperately needed reforms of the United Nations.
Political necessity is beyond dispute; what is still lacking is the political courage to give shape to the new world order within the UN in a decisive manner.
Â Â  Mr President, for a pluralist assembly such as ours today is a great day, both because of the very well-produced report by MrÂ Laschet in which all types of suggestion have been accepted, and because of the presence of the Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan, in order to receive the Sakharov Prize, which represents a strengthening of International Law as the only way to resolve conflicts internationally.
Our group does not have an homogeneous opinion on the report by Mr Laschet â although I recognise that the contributions made have been accepted â since our positions range from favourable to sceptical, as befits a pluralist group.
Nevertheless, I would like to point out that we attach great importance to this report, as well as to the contributions made by the Commission to improving the international panorama, and we are clearly in favour of multilateralism â as I have said previously â although we believe that the situation puts excessive emphasis on anti-terrorist aspects and does not give sufficient emphasis to better international cooperation aimed at eliminating the causes of inequality and injustice, such as the democratic control by the UN of agencies such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank which, at the end of the day, are the bodies which can create greater justice in the world.
That is why, in view of the need to improve relations between the European Union and the UN, which is key to creating a panorama in which there is respect for human rights and international legislation, we believe we should have gone a little further in terms of improving the conditions for greater justice in the world.
That is why our position on Mr Laschetâs report is going to be divided into several different positions.
Â Â  â Mr President, the paradox of the UN is that whilst universal human rights are its essential strength, its Charter is firmly built on the sovereignty of states.
The weakness of the European Union lies in the fact that it has been incapable of integrating the sovereignties of its Member States in a way that would have led to consistent respect for human rights and a foreign and security policy which is genuinely based on global multilateralism.
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union has often proved very unsatisfactory in this regard.
Of course there are exceptions, as exemplified by the support for the UN International Criminal Court.
The 2001 action programme against torture, on the other hand, has been very much a case of empty rhetoric.
The EU in this way is still a creation of the Cold War, merely searching for its identity and role in the world.
In the absence of a strategy, tactics become the strategy, and action is taken on an basis.
It is partly for that reason that the EU has less muscle in the UN than its importance and contribution might warrant.
The Commissionâs UN communication from the autumn and the recently published document âThe Enlarging EU at the UNâ, as well as the report now before us contain a lot of useful information and many interesting proposals.
It is not enough, however.
Our historic duty is now to take responsibility for creating a more sustainable world order which would cover everything from a cooperation-based security model to the prevention of climate change.
Cooperation within the UN and its many special bodies is vitally important.
I might mention, for example, the social norms in respect of human rights and the environment for multinational and other companies adopted by the UNâs Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and similar minimum guarantees for loans for development projects drawn up by the World Bankâs International Financial Cooperation.
Unless we can correct the worst distortions of globalisation our Community of values too will prove to be nothing more than a faÃ§ade.
We will all then be the losers.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is really too much!
On the very day on which we are discussing this report and when we will be receiving Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General and Sakharov Prize-winner in 2003, Parliament has received depressing news from the Jurassic Park of dictatorships: we are being prevented from receiving Oswaldo PayÃ¡, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2002.
This authoritarian ban by Fidel Castroâs communist regime in Cuba, which brings to mind the worst excesses of the Nazis and the Stalinists in the twentieth century, draws attention to an important part of this report, which states that, as regards the United Nations and its reform, the European Union and others must succeed in placing human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms at the top of the world agenda, with all the consequences suggested in paragraph 19.
Oswaldo PayÃ¡âs situation is a scandal, as is the hostile gesture the Cuban regime has directed at this Parliament.
It would be even more scandalous if nothing were said publicly about these scandals.
We are sure that, through Kofi Annan, Parliament will send a powerful message to Cuba and that, in the form of a permanent open invitation to Oswaldo PayÃ¡, we will continue to express our active solidarity with the winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002 and with all Cuban democrats.
I wish lastly to express my appreciation of some of the rapporteurâs amendments, namely Amendment NoÂ 8, which draws attention to the importance of the Convention on human cloning and to the Costa Rican initiative, which we must support.
Â Â  â Mr President, this report by Mr Laschet aims to propel humanity in the direction of world government of some kind.
Only in this way does it appear possible to create peace, welfare and justice with the UN as central, vital and decisive pivot.
Multilateralism is being embraced as the new political gospel.
Is this pipe dream not based on a huge overestimation of the human race?
After all, people like you and I are prone to evil of all kinds.
True peace and justice do not ensue from people.
They can only be obtained by a true belief in God, by an unconditional surrender to His will, and, by His grace, obeying His healing Commandments enshrined in the Bible, God's Word.
Jesus Christ underwent the punishment that brings us true peace.
It is because that point is all too readily forgotten that I should like to start by bringing it to your attention.
In keeping with his eminent introduction, the rapporteur considers cooperation between the European Union and the UN a cornerstone of EU foreign policy.
In the institutionally reformed UN of the future, he more or less already assumes that the EU would be a future legal entity.
The EU's future Foreign Affairs Minister will, on the basis of the future European Constitution, need to fulfil the future mandate on behalf of the EU.
In addition, the Security Council will need to be extended to include permanent members, one for each continent, except for Australia, which is odd.
Why is this enormous continent being excluded?
For fear of double vetoes, no doubt?
Instead of Great Britain and France, it is the EU that is to represent Europe.
To describe the situation in this manner is extremely premature, to say the least.
The EU has no constitution, is not a legal entity in the UN and there is no mandated European Foreign Affairs Minister.
Moreover, the recent past has acutely demonstrated that both in the IGC and in the Security Council, European unity seems to be further away than ever.
That is why it will not work, and so I would urge Members to support Amendments Nos 1 and 10 and, in doing so, to come back down to earth.
I would like to finish off by making two remarks.
First of all, only once â in paragraph 17, second indent in brackets â is there any reference to NATO, which has been proven to be the most effective transatlantic organisation for security.
You know as well as I do that when the chips are down, we prefer to see our guarantee of security in the hands of a reliable and determined NATO and will never hand it over to an ever-doubting, often indecisive and divided, UN Security Council.
NATO is a better cornerstone for the EU's foreign and security policy than the UN.
Finally, multilateralism is good but never unconditional.
Too often have we seen it used as a cloak under which national states look only after their own interests.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it can be assumed that the Laschet report was driven by good intentions: to reinforce the role of the United Nations and increase Europeâs influence in it.
It has to be recognised, however, that the proposed method runs counter to these two objectives.
Articles 10 and 12, the core of the resolution, propose to expand the Security Council and to weaken the current veto system by replacing it with a requirement for a double veto, when the subject is the fundamental issue of threats to peace, chapter 7.
This challenges the two fundamental rules governing the effectiveness of the system: the limited number of members and the veto incentive available to each permanent member.
As regards Europeâs influence, it is difficult to see how halving the number of permanent members in the Security Council could strengthen it.
This, however, is what is implied by the proposal to make the European Union a permanent member, âas soon as its legal personality is recognisedâ.
This seat, of which there could only ever be one, would be occupied by the infamous European Minister for Foreign Affairs who would, incidentally, no longer have, on his own, the right of veto.
Complicating and weakening the current system seem, therefore, to be the dual characteristics of the proposal put to us.
It is the Community method applied to the United Nations.
We cannot, therefore, support it.
We will instead vote in favour of Amendment NoÂ 1, a common sense amendment proposed by our British friends.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, for his report.
I believe that it is no exaggeration whatsoever to state that, today, history is blending with the present, and that in this historic present which we are living in, the European Union and United Nations are two principal actors.
Commissioner Patten told us clearly that the European Union is seeking to confirm its presence on the international stage and become a factor for stability, moderation and normalisation within a world order under shared leadership.
The United Nations must, moreover, operate better and become more efficient in order to adapt to the new circumstances.
From the founding spirit of the San Francisco Charter to the twenty-first century, from 60 nations to 190, from colonial regimes to independence and from the fall of the system of blocs to todayâs globalised world.
Today, following the lessons of 11 September, it is clear that notions of security, defence policy, trade, conflict prevention, crisis management, humanitarian aid, culture and even civilisation are notions which are mixed up with each other and that it must accepted in the common conscience that, in view of the dangers and threats which affect us all equally, our response must also be equal amongst all of us.
This response, the European Union's response, must not, however, be a fragmented, contradictory or ineffective response: it must be a unified response.
Therefore, Mr President, moving beyond the Parliamentary dimension of relations between the European Union and the United Nations â which is necessary and correct â it is important that we act in an agreed manner, in a complementary manner, and that the European Union demonstrate clearly that its strength lies in its unity and its weakness in its fragmentation.
We are therefore moving towards spheres of shared sovereignty between the Member States, otherwise we will be forced to concede them to other powers which are fully aware of the advantages of unity and size.
Moreover, either we stop voting in the United Nations differently 60 times out of every 100, or we will have to abandon once and for all the European Union's aspirations to be on the path to shared world leadership.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that I agree with the indignation expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro at the enforced absence from this Parliament of Sakharov Prize winner, Oswaldo PayÃ¡.
Â Â  â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to be honest, it is quite bizarre that at the very time when we are seeing ever more globalisation with global politics and economics becoming more interdependent â think of the number of multinationals around â and unfortunately, also as criminal organisations begin to operate and cooperate internationally, the United Nations is proving weak in certain areas and at this very time is often pushed to one side.
I believe that many in this House share my groupâs feeling â and my own â that the United Nations is the one global political institution that needs to be strengthened, that represents the rule of international law, and should not be pushed aside, as it was over Iraq.
All this is reflected both in the spirit and the letter of Mr Laschetâs report.
Nevertheless, an honest and objective observer has to acknowledge that the United Nations has proved weak on a number of occasions.
There has been a whole series of wrongdoing, genocide and crimes against humanity where the United Nations has been ineffective.
Some people see this as a justification for pushing the United Nations to one side â and often these are the very people who have used their veto to prevent the United Nations from taking rapid action, as in the case of the situation in the Middle East.
I believe, however, that the United Nations needs to be strengthened, to become more efficient, and to be given the opportunity to intervene promptly.
Let me make it clear that I believe this includes the possibility of taking preventative action where necessary, because if anyone is able and suited to act as the worldâs policeman, then it is undoubtedly the United Nations.
I am very pleased that Mr Laschet has taken up one of my ideas, which was drafted in conjunction with my group, namely that we need to create a regulatory framework that allows the United Nations to intervene promptly in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It should not be left to the discretion of individual countries, states or governments to identify such cases and then intervene.
It should be international institutions that identify impending danger.
In that way, the United Nations ought to be able to intervene promptly and, if necessary, to take preventative action.
The United Nations would not need its own army for this.
Reference has been made to NATO, and, although I do not want to overestimate its capacities, NATO could become involved if the United Nations gave the green light, taking action to uphold law and order and seeking to prevent crimes against humanity.
Reforming the Security Council along these lines is certainly essential.
The changes would need to include a seat for the European Union, but at the same time we must ensure that we do not end up multiplying vetoes and blocking tactics.
Let me say once more: we have had enough of this world where individuals, individual governments and individual states think they can police the world.
If there is one role the United Nations was made for, it is the role of upholding law and order throughout the world, and doing so with the full support of the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU must have a common foreign policy and common Foreign Minister and be a legal person.
The issue is whether this is at all necessary.
Looking at the statistics, it emerges that the Member States are in agreement.
In the UN, there is consensus on well over 90% of matters, so I wonder if the issue right now is not so much a shortage of new institutions but, rather, our feeling unable to use the power we do in actual fact have.
Perhaps it is also necessary to consider how we use the UN.
For one thing, we expect things from the UN and anticipate its being able to carry out tasks successfully.
Are we too, however, in a position to comply with our obligations, namely to support the UN system when required: as when, for example, the weapons inspectorate told us that there was probably no imminent threat from Iraq in the form of weapons of mass destruction; or when Hans Blix told us that there was probably no threat and that, if these weapons of mass destruction were in fact there, he was certain that he and his colleagues would be in a position to find them.
If, on that occasion, we had paid attention to the UN system, we should perhaps have avoided a situation in which the international terrorism expert, Gareth Evans, in Davos was obliged to say that the terrorist threat is greater now than it was before the war against Iraq.
Perhaps the weaknesses and problems of the UN also have to do, then, with our inability to rely upon the systemâs in actual fact being able to undertake anything sensible.
I should like to recommend that we be very sincere in our support of the UN and that we also be more active in the battle to reform it.
We need to reform the Security Council.
We need to have a system that operates as an alternative to anarchy so that we can safeguard international law through, for example, the UN.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today we are awarding the Sakharov prize to MrÂ Kofi Annan as a sign of our total support of the UN.
This rare occasion also gives me the opportunity to draw attention to neglected issues or lost causes.
One of these lost causes is respect for international law, in defence of which MrÂ Annan has, despite the American bulldozer, brought all his personal qualities and the full dignity of his position to bear.
The war took place, admittedly, but, from the outset, it was tainted with illegitimacy and discredited by its motives.
The subsequent, after-the-event revelations as to the bogus and false nature of the charges against Iraq must give solace to those who more readily denounce the environmental dangers to our planet than arms stocks conspicuous by their apparent absence.
Another voice that has been continually hushed and drowned out is that of indigenous peoples who, although being the last survivors of ancient civilisations attach fundamental importance to environmental values and have a better understanding than ourselves of interdependency.
In this world of ours that has become materialistic and superficial, people who have nothing left to defend but their fundamental rights are virtuous and authentic out of all proportion.Let us refute this marginalisation of indigenous peoplesâ rights and let us make the Union and the UN promise to maintain the working group on indigenous peoples in the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are glad that this report comes precisely at a time when Kofi Annan is due to speak to us in a few hours.
I believe that, in the report we have before us, it is important to stress the significance, and the role, that we want to see accorded to the United Nations. So that the exit from Iraq does not turn into a nightmare of the kind we have sometimes seen in the past, everyone is now calling upon the UN to intervene in Iraq by launching an initiative and by playing an active role there of the kind that, for months, has been blocked by two countries which, to some extent, had a lot to fear from a UN role and which thought that this was in danger of being less effective that it should be.
We are particularly pleased that the report mentions an important initiative that could be headed by the EU.
I am referring to the idea of democratic countries in the UN being able to assemble and meet within the organisation to draw up joint measures to promote democracy. That is an initiative in connection with which the European Union could play an important role within the United Nations, whose difficulties and inertia we took note of when, last year, someone from a country like Libya, which is certainly not at the forefront of human rights, was elected as head of the Human Rights Commission.
This initiative is, in any case, what the Italian radical Members are advocating.
They are urging Commissioner Patten and the Member States to make it possible for there to be a specific and symbolic initial meeting of the Community of Democracies before the next Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all let me congratulate my good friend Mr Laschet on his brave attempt to reform the structures of the UN, which were shown to be sadly lacking during the recent Gulf War.
The report also looks at the role that the EU should play within the UN.
Clearly, the UN was designed for the Cold War period in which permanent membership status and veto rights were necessary for the nuclear powers to ensure global security.
Not enough has changed yet in the world to justify changing that.
The responsibility of security often conflicts with the additional mandate of the UN to protect human rights, as many of the UN Member States are undemocratic dictatorships â resulting in the perverse decision to appoint Libya as Chair of its Human Rights Committee.
Furthermore, in the past, the UN was powerless to stop the brutal invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan as a result of the Soviet veto.
China is still not a democracy or a respecter of human rights, making security the main responsibility of the UN and it has a vital role to play in the world.
I believe there is a case to be made for India and Japan to be given permanent membership status as a result of their size and democratic status.
Similarly, Nigeria or Brazil could be candidates.
Unfortunately, this report conflicts with a number of stated positions of my party, the British Conservatives, as it attempts to dilute UK veto powers with a double veto and suggests an EU seat on the Security Council, which would undermine British and French membership.
We are also opposed to an EU foreign minister and to a legal personality for the EU, and therefore, no matter how well intentioned the report is, I cannot support it as it stands.
With my party, however, I will of course be monitoring closely any attempt to reform the UN.
We welcome very warmly today the presence in the Chamber of Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this debate on the excellent report by MrÂ Laschet and the conferral of the Sakharov prize on the United Nations Secretary-General shows the European Parliamentâs ever clearer desire to reaffirm the unique and irreplaceable role of the UN in international relations, in line with the Millennium Declaration and the Commission Communication.
Furthermore, the resolution that we are going to vote on in a short while also shows in a clear and detailed manner the direction that relations between the Union and the UN should take.
A very large number of proposals, which I support, have been tabled, both as regards reinforcing the role of the European Union within a stronger United Nations through, for example, a seat on the Security Council, and as regards reinforcing cooperation between the Union institutions and the United Nations system.
These are ambitious proposals for reform, since the European Union would eventually see itself as having the roles of secular arm of the UN or of the UNâs elder daughter, in the same way that a country that I know well was once spoken of as the Churchâs elder daughter.
It is even envisaged, in Article 17, that the European Union must play a pioneering role in defining UN policy.
Excellent!
In the background to these encouraging and dynamic projects, however, some issues remain, which are worrying while they remain unresolved, in particular the issue of the position and role of the UNâs most important member, the United States.
What can the UN/European Union alliance do faced with the USâs unilateralism, its opposition to the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol and its desire to use, on its own and quite freely, its military force, as soon as it considers its security threatened?
The UN and the European Union must, together, continue to make a huge effort to ensure that the UN really can exercise this credible multilateral international authority that the whole world really needs.
Â Â  â Mr President, this report definitely belongs in the list of top-quality Parliamentary topics.
If only there were not such a great gulf between theory and practice, between the words and reality, we could vote to approve it.
The report refers to a European Constitution that does not yet exist, and unfortunately the draft Constitution text is more focused on increased defence activities and greater ability to intervene in situations around the world than on disarmament and civil conflict resolution.
The report takes up the cause of multilateralism and strengthening the role of the UN, which is right and good.
It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action.
As the war on Iraq has shown, no lie is too risky for use in justifying a preventative war.
Those who support the war are called yes-men; those who do not are called obstructive.
This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States.
The United Statesâ high-handed decision to override the UN has proven a miscalculation for which the national economy is having to pay, as we are now seeing.
With its calls for reform, the EU is the only constant in an ever-changing world.
The EU would be well-advised to develop its relationship with the UN rather than to strengthen its ties with NATO.
The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation, but should be even more specific.
Instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations, money should be spent on education, healthcare, economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty.
If we are to weed out violence and terrorism, we need as much money as possible and more effort.
Â Â  Mr President, in 1945 the Charter of the United Nations stood for equal rights for all nations, large and small, as the best guarantee to maintain international peace and security.
Its first Article proclaimed the principle of self-determination of peoples.
20 years later, in 1966, the first Article of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political rights reaffirmed that all peoples have the right to self-determination.
Unfortunately, the draft Constitutional Treaty of the European Union contains no recognition whatsoever of the right to self-determination for the peoples of the stateless nations of Europe.
I should like to remind you that under Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, in the event of a conflict between the obligations of countries as members of the United Nations and their obligations under any other international agreement, the Charter shall prevail.
Let me finish by quoting you an enlightening statement given by Mr Annan as he presented his Millennium report in April 2000: 'the best way to prevent conflict is to promote political arrangements in which all groups are fairly represented'.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mr Laschet, the rapporteur, for his excellent report, which should receive the support of the vast majority of people in plenary today.
Many speakers have emphasised how important it is that the global community should take joint action, failing which many problems will remain insuperable.
I would like to remind you of the importance of environmental pollution and the fight to eradicate poverty in particular.
These are subjects that can only be tackled together, and Amendment No 7, which has been submitted by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, stresses the importance of the water supply.
I would, however, like to mention one subject that has not, so far, been discussed in very great detail, and one to which I urge Commissioner Patten to give his particular attention.
This subject is a common approach to human rights in the field of modern medicine and biotechnology.
A few months ago, Parliament approved a very good report produced by Robert Evans of the Socialist Group, on combating illegal trade in human organs.
Yet when we look at developing countries and newly industrialising countries, there is a great deal to be done in this area, and I think this is another task on which the EU and the UN must cooperate.
What is more, Parliament has often underlined its opposition to human cloning and its desire that the UN should intervene in this area too.
We are following the debate in the UN Committees with great interest â and let me emphasise once again, Commissioner Patten, that the European Parliament supports the Costa Rican initiative, which also has the backing of over 60 other members of the UN.
This is expressly stated once again in Amendment No 8.
While Kofi Annan is with us, I think we should reiterate the importance of this new task for the UN, for new developments demand new responses.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the latest Eurobarometer survey confirms that European citizens massively support an integrated foreign and defence policy.
Seventy-three per cent of those questioned in the 15 Member States of the Union come down in favour of a European Union foreign policy independent of that of the United States.
Sixty-four per cent of those questioned believe that the European Union should have its own seat in the UN Security Council.
In light of this encouraging result, one of the main issues for the European political parties in the next electoral campaign must be to argue in favour of multilateralism, reform of the United Nations and a visible European presence in the Security Council.
MrÂ Laschetâs report is quite right to remind us that respect for the system of the United Nations is the best way to bring about security and peace in the world.
The United Nationsâ authority was seriously flouted, in spring 2003, by the unilateral decision by the US and Britain to launch a pre-emptive war on the basis, as we now know, of false pretexts.
The European Union was divided and the US Government was happy to see them battling it out amongst themselves.
There is currently no provision in the Treaty to force the Member States of the European Union to adopt a common position before entering into debate and seeking the decisive votes in the Security Council.
This is a flaw in and, I would even say, a disgraceful aspect of, the current institutional system, a system that the Conventionâs draft constitution hardly remedies.
On the other hand, the proposal for a draft resolution to give the EU a permanent seat on the Security Council would naturally put things back on an even keel.
This seat would not overshadow those seats held by the two European permanent members and their sacrosanct right of veto, but it would force the governments of Member States to try to see the main points and to compromise.
This would be a small step towards a coherent foreign and security policy.
I stress that it would be but a small step whilst the absurd system of unanimity persists that allows a single country to block the expression of European political will.
Â Â  We need to give strength and value to the UN and give strength and value to the European Union, strength that should derive from the ability to be a point of reference in terms of political, moral, ethical, economic and social practice.
The UN and the European Union emerged from the ashes of the devastation of the Second World War.
At the time, it was said ânever againâ, and so rejecting war and eradicating poverty should be the cornerstones of the European Union and the UN.
Commissioner Patten is right that what we need is not just peace, but peace combined with justice.
I am sorry to say, however, that peace and justice are not such key issues.
The European Constitution talks about promoting peace but it does not accept that rejecting war and negotiating solutions to conflicts are fundamental.
In recent years, the UN has been devalued, partly at least by the military policy of a fundamentalist president of a country that still practices the death penalty in many of its states and that rejects international organisations, not least the International Criminal Court.
War has become legitimate again; militarism is permeating hearts and minds.
I do not underestimate the important commitment made by MrÂ Laschet and all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Together with the message sent out by awarding the Sakharov prize to Kofi Annan, it is a clear message designed to restore value to the European Union and the United Nations and to once again give them a role.
It is, however, essential that security for everyone, the reduction of poverty and the promotion of justice and peace are genuine practices and not just empty promises.
The UN and the European Union, together with other countries, must re-establish trust and, above all, respect for international law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must thank my colleague MrÂ Laschet for this report, which is far-reaching and envisages great opportunities, but we must also devise a way to move from the current situation towards realising these opportunities.
First of all, I must say that I had a great experience of collaboration with the United Nations when I was working with its Vice-Secretary General on a report that I was completing, within the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, on protecting childrenâs rights.
I feel that the proposal made by MrÂ Laschet represents the first phase of a reform that the UN must, however, face up to.
Having left behind the rationale of Yalta and power blocs, we must make the case for increasing multilateralism.
We must make new nations responsible at world level, without removing time-honoured instruments through which world peace has been promoted; and the right of veto is one such time-honoured instrument.
The Security Council must, in any case, be enlarged, and we then need to consider new permanent members, without the right of veto.
These could include the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Japan, India, Italy and South Africa.
Furthermore, we also need to expand the number of members elected to the Security Council and then reform the Agencies to make them more operational on the ground.
We need to speed up the promotion of human rights and the affirmation of the principles of democracy.
We need to assume that the United Nations intends to protect people, since it invokes the concept of the nation and not that of the state, and the concept of the nation presupposes the protection of the person.
This process of protecting people needs to start as a matter of urgency because terrorism is hot on our heels: today it is in the guise of Al-Qaedaand Bin Laden, tomorrow it could have a different name.
Of course, a reformed NATO could be the international police force that the UN might need.
Division and exclusion certainly give rise to war; union and the philosophical concept of union instead promote important goals of peace.
Â Â  Mr President, let me begin with three personal recollections.
I was privileged to address the UN working group in Geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world.
I was privileged also to represent Parliament in East Timor, where I witnessed at first hand Sergio Vieira de Melloâs successful efforts in rebuilding a whole country â a talent so tragically lost to us.
This is why I attend meetings of United Nations associations in my East of England constituency, where the role and ideals of the UN are cherished at a very local level.
The United Nations inspires me and all of us here in Europe.
It is why Europe rightly champions UN policies: the 0.7% target in the Millennium Goals within EU development policy, and Europe providing over half of all support to the UN High Commission for Refugees, which stands up for fundamental rights as a bulwark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent.
This is why we back UN reform that will secure greater efficiency and also inject new vision.
Other policies championed by the EU are the UN convention on disability, the move beyond the Global Compact towards a binding treaty on corporate accountability and the idea of an economic security council to oversee the Bretton Woods institutions.
Finally, I am concerned that some of the proposals for changes in the veto system, the composition of the Security Council, or suggestions for an EU mandate prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and may not carry support in all of our countries.
Despite these concerns, where we have differences in Europe, most notably recently over Iraq, these concern how best to uphold the authority of the UN.
That authority is once again reaffirmed in Mr Laschetâs report and in our vote here this morning.
Â Â  MrÂ President, following the Second World War, there were high hopes that a worldwide organisation would give the world lasting peace and provide people with freedom and democracy.
These hopes were, however, dashed by the fact that the great powers often used their vetoes to block the UNâs work.
All too many member countries completely ignored the principles of the state governed by law.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of most of the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe, the UNâs prospects of achieving its aims have clearly improved.
In spite of this, the UN has not been especially successful in getting its member countries to comply with the human freedoms and rights laid down in its Charter.
In this area, the UN has been too passive.
I believe that the UNâs inability to get its member countries to observe the principles concerning freedoms and rights and the state governed by law has undermined civic commitment to UN matters.
There were many of us who were very surprised to note that even a representative of a dictatorship can be the Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
In such circumstances, it is only natural that civic commitment is instead channelled through, for example, organisations such as Amnesty International.
The UN now needs greater civic commitment, which would strengthen it as a worldwide organisation.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my proposal that it must be possible for countries that seriously and systematically violate human freedoms and rights to lose their voting rights in the UN Commission on Human Rights.
This proposal must be seen as a step in this direction, that is to say an attempt to increase peopleâs confidence in the UN in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, today is an excellent time to be debating the very good report by MrÂ Laschet on the relations between the European Union and the UN as, at the same time, we are receiving Kofi Annan, not just as a person, but as an institution, as a symbol of an irreplaceable need for the UN.
The report we are debating is in essence a single proposal on relations between the European Union and the UN, but it is a strategic proposal for the UN itself at the dawn of the twenty-first century.
The UN, despite generally expressing the need for a peaceful world at its inception, reflecting the balances at the end of the Second World War, is in need of some adjustment.
Today circumstances are different and must be expressed.
However, until they are expressed effectively, the UN is irreplaceable.
Many consider that the UN is the refuge of small countries which have no other way of expressing their opinions.
However, the Iraqi crisis and its impasses show that the superpowers have equal need of it.
Attempts at new international balances such as the enlarged G8 or the messianic crusading perception of the various superpowers of their role lead nowhere.
Proposing a strategy for the UN and the European Union, however, we note that we ourselves have serious gaps which we need to plug.
We recently experienced the lack of agreement in the UN Security Council.
The enlarged European Union, with the 25 members, will have the possibility to be expressed by many more members of the Security Council, in that it will have the possibility to be expressed by three different geographical areas of the UN.
This possibility, in conjunction with the presence, which I hope will come about, of a minister of foreign affairs at the UN, will provide many more possibilities.
If the new distribution does in fact result in the European Union's gaining a place on the Security Council, without other countries losing their place, this will allow it, from that position, to support policies for peace, cooperation, security, democracy and all the claims of mankind, which are objectives which we must attain.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome Mr Laschetâs report, comprehensive and ambitious though it is.
It comes at a sensitive time for both the European Union and the United Nations.
I want to refer in particular to the UN Development Programme.
The report made in 2002 on the subject of Arab human development was described by magazine as the most important publication of the year, and more than a million people downloaded it from the UNDP website.
It had particular relevance for the EU since it was the impetus for the recent Commission communication â for which I am currently rapporteur â on reinvigorating human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners.
Last yearâs UNDP Arab human development report stated that â subject to fieldwork surveys â the appetite for democracy in the Arab world was, at 60%, the highest of any region in the world.
Compare that, for example, with Eastern Europe, where the figure was 30%.
