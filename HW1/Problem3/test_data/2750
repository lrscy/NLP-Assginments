I do not want to smash the project.
I know there are heated discussions in the Council, and many nations have withdrawn their support for now, or are a bit uncertain.
That is not my agenda.
I just want to make sure the private sector comes to the party early enough to make sure there is more confidence in the scheme as a whole.
Mr President, I too thank the rapporteur, the President of the Commission and all those who have contributed to the achievement of an agreement that I see as being positive and satisfactory on two key subjects that have concerned us: the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets and the impact of enlargement on cross-border regions.
These two problems do not just affect two nations but have Europe-wide repercussions.
I therefore ask the Commission once again to provide a better definition of the concept of cross-border area and region.
For us socialists, a cross-border region, which should be included in the pilot project and other measures, is one which forms a border by land or by sea.
I do, however, regret certain cuts, in the case of the Balkans for example, but I am also pleased with the success achieved in MEDA recovery.
In this regard, I hope the Commission will give priority to the regional dimension of the partnership provided for within this programme.
I must also express my satisfaction with e-learning, Socrates, Leonardo, Europol, Eurojust and the Global Help Fund.
Thanks also to Mr Turchi for his report.
The projects approved at Essen must be speeded up; the individual States must be involved more, but the space for the great networks linking North and South must also be increased.
Only if North and South can be brought closer together will we have a more cohesive European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just deal very briefly with some of the comments we have heard.
Mr Colom i Naval suggested that the agreed amounts which are laid down in the multiannual programme should be index-linked.
The Commission cannot endorse this view, because these appropriations must be adopted as absolute amounts.
If we then have a different inflation rate, that naturally creates more leeway in Category III, which such a situation will quite obviously require, and of which Parliament will rightly avail itself.
Many comments related to the implementation of the budget.
May I simply remind the House that a new instrument has been in place this year through which Parliament has been able to take part in the monitoring process, namely the weekly implementation figures issued by the Commission.
This is the only Parliament that is kept so well abreast of the day-to-day expenditure situation.
The Parliaments of the Member States do not have such an instrument.
This is a genuine innovation, and we should certainly maintain it.
For you, of course, it is a very important source of information, enabling you to observe how implementation is proceeding.
I believe that what we have set down in the resolution is another important step towards close cooperation as part of a sound implementation process.
The third point that was raised in many of your contributions concerns the flexibility of the budget as a whole.
How rigid is this system that the Financial Perspective gives us?
It is undoubtedly noteworthy that this year, for the first time, the Council consented almost immediately to the use of flexibility instruments, of the flexibility reserve, in the budget.
This really shows how important it is to have a balancing instrument, a fine-tuning instrument.
But of course we must also ask the question whether that in itself is sufficient.
We are in the third year of the Financial Perspective.
Much of what we have to do here together, it must be said, raises budgeting almost to the level of an art form.
This is the third year that we have launched the budget together.
I do believe we can be content once again with the result, which certainly stands up to scrutiny.
On behalf of the Commission, I should like to repeat my sincere thanks to everyone who has been involved in this process.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 10 a.m. on Thursday.
Determination of Member States' payments to VAT-based own resource
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0431/2001) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Common Position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 as concerns the use of ESA 95 in the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource (8793/1/2001 - C5-0385/2001 - 2000/0241(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1996 a Council Regulation introduced a new revised European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 1995.
This revised system superseded the old ESA 1979.
Its use was made compulsory for all Member States.
It applies to all acts of the Community - all except one.
For budgetary purposes and for the determination of the Communities' own resources, the old system is to stay in place for as long as the Council Decision of 1994 on the system of the Communities' own resources remains in force.
Back in 1994 it was assumed that there would be a new decision on the Communities' own resources in 1999.
As we know, it actually took until the end of September 2000 before the Council plucked up the necessary courage.
At the same time, however, the Council tried to railroad us here in Parliament into a quick decision.
A grim picture was painted of the scenario that would ensue if Parliament did not adopt the Council Decision without amendment and, later, if we insisted on a second reading.
A delay, we were told, would be intolerable, the Communities' own resources from VAT could not be collected properly, the Member States would incur high costs, because statistics would have to be collected for both accounting systems, and so on and so forth.
Sheer balderdash!
Since the year 2000 all the statistical offices have in any case been compiling their respective accounts on the basis of the 1995 system.
The ESA 1979 data are not even available any more - a fact, incidentally, which the Council has now formally acknowledged in item 2 of its common position.
So if we approve the common position at the present time, we shall merely be legalising a fait accompli.
In other words, we had all the time in the world, and we wanted to take this opportunity to issue another urgent reminder of the importance of the revenue side in the compilation of the budget, to re-emphasise that revenue is the key to our prospects of funding our European policies.
In its common position, the Council has only adopted the first of our amendments, the one in which we stated that the change from ESA 79 to the ESA 95 system for the determination of the Communities' own VAT-based resources would have no impact on the level of these resources, neither in terms of the balance between Member States nor of the overall volume of the Communities' own resources.
The Council has rejected our Amendments Nos 2 and 3, in which we sought to guarantee better annual information for the budgetary authority on the state of play with regard to the Communities' own resources in the form of a Commission working paper and to establish a trialogue with the Council and the Commission in this domain.
Yes, the Commission has subsequently written to us, indicating its willingness to provide us with such a working paper every year, for which we are grateful.
No, the Council does not wish to engage in talks with us.
There is no provision for such a trialogue in the interinstitutional agreement, it says.
Huh! So much for the constant preaching about transparency!
Then there are those who say that the discussions about our own resources have no place in legislation on statistics.
Admittedly, we cannot invoke Treaty articles, the Financial Regulation or interinstitutional agreements.
Admittedly, statistical legislation is not the most attractive vehicle, it is not the ideal means of getting our demands through.
We do not have a formal legal base, but we have a right, the right of equality for both branches of the budgetary authority in all matters relating to the common budget.
If the participants in the Laeken Summit, the post-Laeken convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference speak of democracy, they must also speak of the democratic right of Parliament to exercise full powers of co-decision on the European budget, and they must not only speak but also take action.
If, by the end of these meetings, Parliament has obtained its rightful budgetary powers - co-decision on all expenditure and revenue - that will be a satisfactory outcome.
Anything less, and the word 'democracy' in the mouths of Council members will not be worth the cost of the electricity that feeds their microphones!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to achieve the objectives set in the Treaty on European Union and, more specifically, on Economic and Monetary Union, the Community requires high-quality statistical instruments, which provide all the institutions, governments and economic and social operators with a collection of harmonised and reliable statistics on which to base their decisions.
In this respect, it is necessary to modify the Regulation in order to make it possible to use ESA 95.
We believe that the new ESA 95 significantly improves on the previous version, which dates from 1979.
Progress has been made on the harmonisation of methodology and the accuracy and precision of the concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules which must be applied in order to achieve a quantitative description of the economies of the Member States.
It is clear that, by implementing the change to the new system, the Member States have made additional improvements to the quality of the national accounts as a result of a complete review of their sources and methods used in producing accounts.
Of all the various uses of the national accounting data of the ESA in the budgeting procedure, such as setting budgetary limits, calculating gross national product, setting the fourth resource etc., the only thing that is affected by the modification is the determination of Member States' payments to VAT-based own resource.
In this regard, we agree with the draftsperson of the opinion that to use this new system would make no difference in terms of the level of Member States' payments, since they have already begun to adopt the ESA 95 in producing their national accounts.
To attempt to calculate them again would be expensive and risky and furthermore would not be useful, since all the experts agree that, for rebalancing the levels of taxation, the use of ESA 79 or ESA 95 would not have an effect on the result.
Finally, we congratulate the rapporteur on having obtained a commitment from the Commission to present an annual report to the European Parliament on the state of the collection of own resources, the forecasts in this field for the next budgetary year and certain frequent problems relating to the system.
This will contribute to greater transparency and will allow the European Parliament to be duly informed on the implementation of the modifications necessary for the harmonisation of the new system.
In relation to everything else, we fully agree with the rapporteur' s views.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission firstly wishes to thank Parliament, and in particular Mrs Haug, for your understanding and the common approval of the Council.
As Mr Garriga has stressed, the Regulation is going to allow the Member States to use the best and most recent data from national accounts for the calculation of VAT-based own resources.
As Mr Garriga also pointed out, the Regulation in no way affects budgetary revenue or the balance between Member States in the field of own resources.
The debate at first reading allowed us to better understand and restate the need to improve information to Parliament relating to budgetary revenue.
As a result of this debate, I would like to confirm on behalf of the Commission that, at the beginning of every year, we will present Parliament with a working document on the state of the collection of own resources, the forecasts for those resources for the following budgetary year and any other specific problem relating to the own resource system.
I therefore confirm what has been said by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, and also Mr Garriga, in this respect.
I believe that in this way we are going to establish fruitful cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on this initiative and on the work she has done with a view to the adoption of this Regulation, which is highly technical, but no less important for that.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Green paper on the criminal protection of the Community's financial interests: A European prosecutor
The next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on the criminal protection of the Community's financial interests: A European prosecutor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission attaches high priority to the fight against fraudulent misuse of the financial resources of the European Union.
The Commission is well aware of the fact that the European Parliament is our staunchest ally in this cause.
Today the college of Commissioners has unanimously approved the Green Book I presented on the use of criminal law to protect the financial interests of the Community and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor.
By adopting this Green Paper just before the European Council meeting in Laeken, the Commission has sent out a strong political signal.
We have already made some headway in the fight against fraud.
This applies especially to our cooperation with the Member States.
The Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is doing sterling work in this domain.
The Commission has also been doing a great deal in the field of prevention; for example, OLAF will examine all future legislative proposals to ascertain whether they are fully fraud-resistant.
On the other hand, there are still many serious shortcomings to be rectified in the body of criminal law with which the European Union seeks to combat fraud.
We need a consistent approach to criminal prosecution throughout Europe.
The prosecution of cross-border frauds involving funds from the Community budget all too frequently grinds to a halt at the borders between different legal systems, of which there are not only 15 but 17 in the European Union, a number that will increase still further with enlargement.
What is lacking is an effective instrument with which administrative scrutiny by OLAF and national investigations can be made to culminate in criminal prosecution rather than running into the brick walls that divide our legal systems.
For this reason, back in September 2000, the Commission tabled a proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice that a European Public Prosecutor be established to protect the financial interests of the Communities through the system of criminal law.
The introduction of a European fiscal prosecutor would be unprecedented in qualitative terms, and a truly innovative step in the judicial fight against fraud.
The Heads of State and Government, sadly, did not pursue this proposal at the time.
The issue, however, is far too important to be left on the shelf to gather dust.
For this reason, I immediately decided to draw up a Green Paper which would spell out the details of the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor as well as indicating how this Public Prosecutor could operate in practice.
The best possible use should therefore be made of the time between now and the next reform of the Treaties to respond to the questions and scepticism from the Member States, which have been asking us repeatedly about the precise form that such a system would take.
The EC Treaty would merely deal with the appointment, the dismissal and the responsibilities of the European Public Prosecutor and the main elements of his or her job specification.
All other details, such as the status and working methods of the Public Prosecutor, would be laid down in secondary legislation.
These are precisely the questions that are now addressed in the Green Paper.
How and on whose initiative does the Public Prosecutor act?
What are his or her powers?
Who supervises the actions of the Public Prosecutor?
How does he or she cooperate with the national prosecuting agencies?
What is the Prosecutor' s legal status, and how is the Office of the European Public Prosecutor to be organised?
On these questions, the Green Paper advances various options for discussion.
The Commission, however, also clearly expresses its preferences, which, taken together, form a coherent system.
What is the general approach that the Commission is proposing?
Which principles underlie the Green Paper?
The general approach proposed by the Commission is that the European Union should legislate only where such legislation is absolutely necessary and should rely as far as possible on the national laws and legal systems to regulate other matters.
Our proposals are therefore fully consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
The European Public Prosecutor would considerably enhance the effectiveness of criminal law as an instrument in the fight against fraud without turning the national judicial systems upside down.
What does that mean in detail?
The originality of the proposal lies in the fact that the European Public Prosecutor would be a central authority responsible for conducting and co-ordinating criminal investigations and prosecutions at the European level, whereas the Office of the European Public Prosecutor itself would not be centralised, and the principle of mutual recognition would be paramount when it came to taking specific measures.
A common investigation and prosecution area would thus be created in Europe for the protection of the Communities' financial interests.
Once investigations were completed, the European Public Prosecutor would prefer charges before the proper national court in the relevant Member State.
The proceedings themselves, including the delivery of a judgment, would then be governed by national law.
The Commission proposes a decentralised structure for the Office of the European Public Prosecutor.
In the Member States, the European Public Prosecutor would be assisted by 'delegated national prosecutors' whose responsibilities would have a European dimension.
As for proceedings, the European Public Prosecutor should be able to draw on the broad range of national investigation instruments.
European prosecutors should therefore be able to enlist the help of the national and regional prosecuting authorities, such as the criminal investigation departments of the national police forces.
The application of the principle of mutual recognition should also ensure that these investigative measures are automatically admissible throughout the territory of the Community.
The same applies to the recognition of evidence and to judicial scrutiny of the actions of the European Public Prosecutor.
For example, if an application made in a Member State for a search or telephone-surveillance warrant is granted by a national court under the applicable national law, the warrant would be valid throughout the territory of the Community.
This approach respects the national legal system.
At the same time, the principle of mutual recognition would ensure that the common investigation area became a reality.
As far as judicial scrutiny of the European Public Prosecutor' s actions is concerned, the Commission also takes the view that national legal channels are adequate for this purpose and sees no compelling need for a European criminal court.
Moreover, the Commission does not believe that the definition of the crimes for which the European Public Prosecutor could prefer charges implies the need to create an autonomous European penal code.
What we do propose is the minimum essential degree of harmonisation, which should certainly go beyond the level that is set in the proposed directive for the protection of the Community' s financial interests and should therefore cover a wider catalogue of crimes than is covered by the 1995 Convention.
We want to incorporate all offences that damage the financial interests of the Community, such as fraudulent practices in connection with tendering procedures or breaches of official secrecy to the detriment of Community interests.
We also consider uniform rules necessary for sentencing and prescription limits.
The Green Paper, then, is structured in strict accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality while guaranteeing that a European Public Prosecutor will be able to operate efficiently and effectively.
It is my view that we have struck a good balance which might even win over some sceptics.
The concept of a European Public Prosecutor fits neatly into the vision of a common European legal area.
I compiled the Green Paper in close cooperation with Commissioner Vitorino.
The various departments of OLAF were also in constant touch with their counterparts in the Directorate-General headed by Mr Vitorino during the drafting process.
The new and long-awaited breakthroughs that have been made in judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters represent a sound basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor.
One of these is the European arrest warrant, which we hope the European Council will approve in Laeken.
Another is Eurojust.
The Eurojust initiative is not in competition with the European Public Prosecutor either. The two, in fact, would complement each other very well.
I expect the Green Paper to herald the start of a broad and objective discussion about the creation of a European Public Prosecutor with all interested parties, including, of course, practitioners, judges and prosecutors in the Member States.
I would ask the European Parliament, as the driving force behind this idea, to play an active part in this discussion and to foster the debate in the Member States.
We need the widest possible feedback on our proposal.
Once we have analysed the results of the consultation process, our aim is to be able to contribute something at the end of 2002 or the beginning of 2003 to the convention responsible for preparing the next intergovernmental conference.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that the European Public Prosecutor is enshrined in the Treaties when they are next revised.
We must be prepared for a long haul.
I am, however, optimistic, because this goal can be achieved together, with the support of the European Parliament.
Mr President, what I have to say is addressed particularly to Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner.
A fortnight ago, you described me as a champion of the European State Financial Prosecutor.
I take that as a title of honour and might perhaps apply the term to you yourself, as we have now of course achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the nineties - a Green Paper and consequent Treaty amendment.
I believe, though, that the timetable has to be tightened up a bit, as what you have said indicates that such a State Prosecutor will be in place only in 2006 or 2007.
So, we are on your side, but, as we want to speed the process up, I would like to ask you to find the time to enable us to achieve the objective, and, with all the subsidiarity, please see to it that the process is not ponderous, slow or inefficient.
That is important; it will enable us to really move ahead with setting up the State Prosecutor.
The citizens out there demand it, and we are doing something for Europe if we make it clear that it is Europe's money that we are protecting.
Mr President, I would like to pick out a few points.
Firstly, it is a fact that you, Mrs Theato, were the originator of this idea and have been pursuing it for a long time.
I believe that we are now at a stage when, as the Nice Summit showed, it really is important to be precise.
The question at issue was what exactly this meant, which is often taken as an excuse to say that the whole idea will have to wait.
The timetable looks more or less like this: the consultation will run until June 2002.
While a new treaty amendment is launched for the next Intergovernmental Conference, proposals for secondary legislation - that is, on functioning and on such issues as the admissibility of evidence - will be drafted at the same time. The time available will be used for both purposes, so that we can as soon as possible not only give form to the idea, but also make the institution a practical reality.
Firstly I would like to say that the previous speaker, my illustrious committee chairman, was being slightly disingenuous because there is no real demand for a European public prosecutor.
Only two weeks ago in Parliament we saw huge tranches of her own report being deleted because they contained references to such a body.
There will be some dissension among the various political parties in this House but many people are concerned about what this is actually leading to.
I do not think you were being completely fair with us, Commissioner, when you said it will only go so far and no further.
Will it lead to corpus juris?
If you say no to this question, how can you reconcile that with the answer that Mrs Delmas-Marty gave our committee a month ago?
Mrs Delmas-Marty is the former head of the supervisory body of OLAF and she has written many books on this particular subject.
She said yes - a European public prosecutor will almost certainly lead to corpus juris, a common body of law throughout the Community.
What would be the core competences of the European public prosecutor?
What powers would he or she have?
What are the Community's financial interests?
Surely you are not ignoring political signals sent by both the Council - many countries are against this - and Parliament, which, as I said at the beginning, two weeks ago rejected many things to do with the European public prosecutor?
Mr Heaton-Harris, the debate a fortnight ago was about the directive on the protection of Community financial interests, a directive in which the offences of fraud, corruption and money-laundering were defined, and, moreover, in terms already agreed on in 1995 by all Member States, the United Kingdom included.
That agreement, though, is not yet in force, and the Commission therefore proposed to include it in a directive.
Like the Commission, Parliament was of the opinion that the directive was not the right place for a definition of a Public Prosecutor, both of them being convinced that the creation of a European Public Prosecutor could not be accomplished by a directive, but would need an amendment to the Treaties.
It was for that reason that Parliament struck out a Member's proposal that it should be dealt with in the directive, but doing so was not a vote against the European Public Prosecutor.
This, I think, is something we must stick to.
You are right to ask now what the duties of the European Public Prosecutor might be.
One is that he will take over the direction and coordination of law enforcement and also direct investigations, which would themselves be conducted according to national law.
The European Public Prosecutor would then be entitled, having assembled incriminatory and exculpatory evidence, to bring charges on the basis of that evidence, and this would also be done in accordance with national law and in a national court, so there is no question of creating some huge new apparatus or a new European penal code - we all know how much scepticism there still is about that.
Many of these cases are listed in our Green Paper.
There was, for example, the regulation that, where evidence was gathered in one Member State and then, crime knowing no frontiers, was used in a cross-frontier case before another court, it could be objected to on the grounds that it had been gathered in accordance with administrative law.
That is something we do not recognise.
It often happens that there is a mass of evidence of fraud being committed against the European budget, but the evidence is, as it were - legally rather than bureaucratically - defined out of existence, because of the sort of differences that there are.
I do not believe that is in the public interest, and it is certainly not in the interests of Parliament.
I would ask you, Mr Heaton-Harris, to examine this proposal with an unprejudiced mind. We have said that we are committed to applying the subsidiarity principle, but we do of course want there to be real protection in criminal law for Community interests.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to dissociate myself from the remarks made by Mr Chris Heaton-Harris and I believe that the Commissioner has very effectively outlined the framework within which the amendments to the Theato report were rejected in this Parliament.
This is indeed a correct account.
I should like to echo the words of Mrs Theato and call for speed.
Commissioner, you have now announced a timeframe for setting up the post of European Public Prosecutor that is indeed a very slow process.
You will be submitting a proposal after the Green Paper consultation in the course of 2002 or at the end of 2002 or beginning of 2003, this will be followed by a Treaty amendment in 2004, and entry into force is likely in 2006-2007. You will have to admit that this is all a long way off.
I should like to note that at the time, the Committee of Independent Experts made a few suggestions in reaction to the dismissal of the Santer Commission in order to work faster and to move away from multi-stage plans.
I should like to ask you whether you have adopted elements of these proposals by the experts in the Green Paper and whether you are willing to consider them, thus enabling us to make a start on the establishment of the function of European Public Prosecutor at this stage.
Mr President, the Commission had indeed submitted a proposal to amend the Treaty to the Nice Intergovernmental Conference, and if that proposal had been successful, it could be said that the legal basis would have been created as soon as the Treaty of Nice was ratified.
The Council decided otherwise, and this proposal was not even put on the table for the negotiations.
Now we must in fact wait for the next IGC to carry out an amendment of the Treaty that will make the creation of the European Public Prosecutor possible, but, as I was saying, we will be making good use of this time and not just waiting; we will be using the time for consultation to find out the best possible model, and will then be discussing functioning, organisation, status, evidence gained from questioning, periods of limitation, in short, all the things that of course have to be cleared up.
I work on the assumption that we will be having very intensive and practical debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the issues that have been raised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to address the timetable issue, and do so from the same angle as did the previous speaker.
I do not think, Commissioner, that you can in fact afford to wait until 2006. You cannot do so in view of the revelation of two billion euros' worth of fraud and irregularities, and in view of the challenges, some of them financial, with which eastward enlargement is going to face both you and us.
I do think that speed really is of the essence here, and, indeed, you must not wait.
You know that as well as we do, you know our report and you know about the proposals that have been made, which have stated that you are well able to tackle an initial, introductory stage without amending the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Both the Council of Experts, which made proposals in 1999 towards reform of the Commission, and also the latest annual report of the committee overseeing OLAF have mapped out these two stages for you.
In view of this pressure, which really is needed, I ask you: why do you still hesitate?
Why are you again putting it off, until 2006?
Why are you so hesitant, why do you not take the plunge, as we urged, most recently in the BÃ¶sch report?
Mr President, Mrs Stauner, it is not within the Commission's competence to appoint a Public Prosecutor, who can then carry out law enforcement in the Member States and bring charges in them.
That is not the case; rather, the European Union is founded on the Member States' agreement to cede competences to the European level.
The Member States have not as yet ceded the competence to establish a European Public Prosecutor.
The foundation for such a law enforcement competence must first be laid at the European level, in other words, a Treaty amendment is needed to do it, and an effective instrument needs to be created, one that can actually deal with cross-frontier crime in all the Member States efficiently, not only carrying out investigations, but also bringing charges that result in prosecution and, finally, punishment.
It is that procedure that we must apply.
You may well now say that you wish the European Union were different, but I must tell you that the Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and what we propose must therefore take due account of the competences.
This proposal really does, in my view, promise much for the future, and I hope that we can use it to convince even the sceptics.
Mr President, I just wanted to ask a few questions.
I am sorry I was not here at the beginning.
First of all, do you not think that Mr Heaton-Harris is giving a green light to fraudsters?
In the past five years only two people have been prosecuted for fraud against the EU.
If he does not come up with any alternatives, it is effectively giving the green light.
I wonder if you could comment on that.
Secondly, how do you convince those Member States which are resistant to the concept of European Public Prosecutor, for example my own country which, in my opinion, is misguided on this point?
Thirdly, how will the European Public Prosecutor be appointed?
And, fourthly, do you not agree that it is important not to proceed too quickly and do you accept also that this proposal is not enough?
In other words, Eurojust will simply not work.
Mrs Schreyer, I am going to ask you also to be very brief.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, we are dealing here with a relationship of complementarity similar to that with Eurojust, which I have described.
The European Public Prosecutor proposed here has to do with the protection of Community interests in the financial sphere, whereas Eurojust deals with other types of serious crime.
Of course there has to be a link here, for data exchange among other things, but always from the data protection angle.
We must look at it in a complementary way.
Secondly, the Public Prosecutor's appointment would involve various procedures.
On the one hand, a procedure must be devised for the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor, who would, as it were, represent all public prosecutors.
The national European Public Prosecutors or the Delegates want a decentralised structure and would then be appointed under the relevant law of the Member State.
I do not believe that Mr Heaton-Harris wants to protect fraudsters; rather, this is about what steps have to be taken for protection to be efficient.
I will say again that we have a Community Budget, we have Community finances and we have a common internal market, and to that degree we no longer have borders in the legal sphere, but we do still have seventeen different legal systems, as the United Kingdom has three different legal systems.
These, then, are real obstacles, which leads to the possibility of real defects in law enforcement, defects that we should overcome.
Thank you, Mr President.
What the Commissioner is saying all sounds encouraging.
I should like to pose a very brief question: how does she view cooperation between the proposed Prosecutor and OLAF?
Mr Mulder, there are of course various possibilities for that as well.
One is that OLAF would continue in its present function of carrying out investigations under administrative law, in which case provision would of course have to be made for OLAF to present its results to the same Public Prosecutor, who would make use of the intelligence thus gathered.
Another possibility would be for OLAF to itself take over enquiries rather than being limited to an examining role.
We consciously refrained from giving that a prominent position in the current debate, but then it would have been said afterwards that we wanted to give OLAF a specific role.
This is, as it were, an issue that has to be worked out once we have the 'big picture' .
I can only reiterate that we are not now dealing with competing conceptions, but with a White Paper in the drafting of which OLAF played a part.
OLAF is always facing the difficulty of its having gathered evidence or intelligence and then having to wait to see whether a national state prosecutor's office will accept this material and work with it.
If we had a European Financial Public Prosecutor, it would be a really positive step forward for OLAF's work.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
You must not enter into a dialogue.
You must be aware of the Rules of Procedure and apply them.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0536/2001).
Part I
Question No 39 by (H-0878/01):
Subject: Securing the external borders of an Enlarged Union Slovenia has some 370 border crossings with its neighbour Croatia.
However its government currently only has enough money to man around 90 of them.
Thus, some 270 border crossings are currently wide open.
In view of terrorism, organised crime and illegal migration, what plans has the Commission got to ensure a secure border for the Union in the Enlarged Union?
Mr President, one of the future external borders of the European Union is expected to run along the border between Slovenia and Croatia.
There are 36 crossing points along this border where it is legally possible to cross.
The figures quoted by the honourable Member refer to places where crossing the border between Croatia and Slovenia is physically possible but legally prohibited - for instance, footpaths, roads and bridges.
I agree with the honourable Member that it is the reality on the ground - literally speaking - that deserves attention.
The Commission recalls that Slovenia must achieve a high level of external border control upon accession.
The Commission is paying close attention to Slovenia's progress in the framework of the negotiations under the Justice and Home Affairs chapter, as well as in the pre-accession process.
Slovenia is required to demonstrate its capability systematically to check all persons crossing external borders and to ensure effective border surveillance between authorised border crossing points.
In this regard, Slovenia has prepared a detailed action plan for the implementation of the Schengen acquis, as requested by the European Union.
In its action plan, Slovenia has shown that it is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and equipment are allocated to the border with Croatia.
In addition, Slovenia is taking measures to ensure greater coordination between its authorities involved in border controls.
The Commission wishes also to underline that Slovenia is already engaged in intensive bilateral cooperation for control of the common border with Croatia.
This should be further expanded by the conclusion of the agreement on simplified border checks on road and rail traffic and an agreement on cross-border police cooperation.
The latter agreement will also encompass joint border patrols for the surveillance of the green border, that is between the authorised border crossing points.
In addition to the very substantial financial assistance granted to Slovenia for upgrading its border controls - this is financial assistance within the framework of the pre-accession process - the Commission is encouraging and directly supporting the bilateral cooperation between Slovenia and Croatia.
This is funded under our assistance programme to Croatia for integrated border management, which will also cover border crossings with Slovenia.
Slovenia and Croatia have recently reached agreement on the demarcation of the common border.
While, in the past, the lack of demarcation did not affect in practice the quality of the border controls and of the surveillance of the green and blue border, this agreement, once ratified, is additional proof of the good cooperation between the two countries.
Thank you Commissioner for a very full answer.
Everybody is aware that this is very difficult.
My point is one that was raised with me by a minister in Ljubljana.
All the crossings, whether they are legal or illegal, will be used by terrorists, smugglers, immigrants, criminals and so on.
Therefore it is a very serious problem.
The minister also said to me: we cannot pay; we do not have the money to man all these crossings!
So Slovenia has got a real problem.
There are nine other applicant countries - if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the borders - so we have ten applicant countries, all with problems like this, without enough money to meet the cost.
Is there any possibility that the Commission might propose that the Union takes on a responsibility for guarding our eastern borders?
I would not necessarily agree that the ocean is easier to control.
I mean it is as easy getting to Malta and Cyprus in the dark from the sea as crossing a hill in the mountains.
We know that there is a real problem.
We have organised and funded capacity-building support to provide very strong assistance in this effort and this is what we have to do right now.
It is quite important, as part of the whole negotiation process and accepting the acquis and responsibilities, that we clarify that this is a responsibility for the applicant country.
There are numerous problems.
The issue of controlling the periphery of the European Union will remain with us as a real challenge for quite some time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Slovakia Joint Parliamentary Committee recently toured our border with Slovakia.
Near Kosicec there is a forty-kilometre long border strip consisting of green fields. We were told that this is very difficult to monitor and that, at present, a very substantial influx of Afghan refugees can be observed there, perhaps not all of whom are entering Europe motivated by peaceful intentions.
I would therefore like to ask if it is possible for the Commission to introduce satellite surveillance here, for example, or automated systems, making it possible on the one hand to gather statistical material and, on the other, to pick up more of these refugees and so be better protected in future?
What programmes are in fact available to these states?
Mr President, it is difficult to add anything substantially new to what I already expressed.
But the mention of satellite monitoring prompts me to say that it is quite well understood in Parliament that the Commission is serious about Galileo and considers it to be an important programme.
This is just one other application.
Not having it would be a problem for the future of Europe and for our ambitions.
I could not agree more with your remarks, but please talk to your national governments about that issue.
Question No 40 by , which has been taken over by Carlos Carnero GonzÃ¡lez (H-0881/01):
Subject: Revitalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean policy On 24 October 2001 President Prodi, addressing the EP plenary in Strasbourg in the debate on the Ghent European Council of 19 October 2001, said: 'The time has come to make new moves in the Mediterranean area. (...)
We must now take full advantage of all the opportunities open to us to ensure real progress.
The Euro-Mediterranean region must aim at genuine economic integration and at setting up institutional mechanisms for taking common decisions'.
Which of the existing mechanisms does the Commission intend to reinforce in order to improve the effectiveness of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership?
What new instruments or mechanisms will the Commission propose to generate real prospects of economic and social integration with the Mediterranean countries in the short and medium term?
What institutional mechanisms need to be put in place for the purposes of 'taking common decisions'?
In re-invigorating the Barcelona process we are strengthening the existing institutions of the Euro-Med partnership and moving ahead in a number of key areas.
Concerning the association agreements, 2001 started with the good news of Egypt' s decision to initial the association agreement and negotiations are ongoing with Algeria, Lebanon and Syria.
My second point concerns the association agreement signatories developing free trade between each other.
We are encouraging each association agreement signatory to agree on free trade arrangements with the others so as to facilitate economic cooperation and inward investment.
The Commission is working with the countries which have already started this process to see where technical advice can best be provided to help partners reach agreement.
In parallel we are working on the rules of origin to see how the partners can be brought into the pan-European system.
In order to lay the basis for a Euro-Med internal market so as to fully exploit the future free trade area, we are assisting our partners to bring their regulatory frameworks closer to ours.
During 2001 the Commission has further developed a concept of the Euro-Med internal market, provided information about its implications and opportunities, and we have paid particular attention to internal market issues in MEDA programming.
Cooperation is being strengthened across a range of sectors.
The regional economic dialogue is being reinforced with future discussions focusing on growth and employment.
MEDA is being used to examine certain infrastructure needs from a regional or subregional perspective and, where appropriate, to draw up strategies for interconnection and for linkage with the trans-European networks to ensure that priority projects are funded and implemented.
Together with our partners we are developing a new regional MEDA programme on justice and home affairs and are engaged in discussions on these issues bilaterally in relation to the provisions of the association agreements and in MEDA programming.
Concerning new instruments and mechanisms, in recognition that cooperation between Europe and Mediterranean countries cannot be solely political or economic, the Commission is looking at ways to initiate a new broad-based cultural dialogue in the Mediterranean region.
In this regard, in addition to the programmes which are currently being implemented to support cooperation in cultural heritage, audiovisual activities and youth exchanges, the Commission is examining the feasibility of extending the TEMPUS programme for higher education to the Mediterranean region.
With regard to new structures for dialogue, the Commission will bring forward proposals to adapt the working methods of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, in particular to provide for more frequent political dialogue on regional and international issues.
The Commission will launch a policy dialogue with the Mediterranean partners on employment policy, sharing EU experience on ways of combating unemployment and of creating new jobs.
It will work to improve the available information and statistics as part of ongoing efforts to channel legal migration and to combat illegal migration.
Finally, the Commission will consider ways to stimulate investment and joint development projects in the Mediterranean, for example by studying the need for, and feasibility of, a new bank or other financing mechanism, building on the European Investment Bank.
Let me add some information concerning the performance this year of the activities in the MEDA programme.
For this year, there are commitments under MEDA of about EUR 740 million in the budget which are expected to be fully implemented.
The same is true of other budget lines benefiting the Mediterranean partners.
As far as payments are concerned, they are expected to represent over 56% of commitments this year to reach nearly half a billion euro, in fact the best ever result achieved in the region.
This year is also the first year of the implementation of the revised MEDA regulation which puts in place mechanisms for more coherent programming of the aid, better coordination both with partners and with the other major donors, and more streamlined approval procedures inside the EU.
Consultations have already taken place with the partners and with the other donors on the country and regional strategy papers covering 2002 to 2006 and on the more detailed national and regional indicative programmes for 2002 to 2004.
All these documents should be approved by the end of the year.
I am reporting these details because I do not want to miss this opportunity to inform Parliament about the MEDA Programme which has been quite problematic in the past.
We are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the Commissioner for his friendly and extensive reply and also apologise on behalf of Mr Obiols who, contrary to what he would have liked, has not been able to get to the House on time today.
I believe that the Commissioner has given us a variety of reasons to think that the European Commission is taking the same approach as Parliament.
We must prevent one of the greatest successes of European Union external policy, the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean process, from entering a period of stagnation.
This process must not be limited to Euro-Mediterranean summits or ministerial meetings, such as the one which is going to take place next April under the Spanish Presidency in Valencia.
It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms which lower the level in a vertical sense and also broaden it in a horizontal sense.
I suggest that, with regard to what the Commissioner has already said, we add, the possibility of relations between civil society, trade unions, women' s organisations, young people, as he has also already mentioned, and, of course, the cultural field.
I would like to hear the Commission' s views in this regard.
I do not have anything further to say on the matter.
Question No 41 by (H-0917/01):
Subject: African children sold into slavery in Europe The BBC recently raised the issue of the increasing trade in child trafficking from Africa to Europe.
There are thought to be around 10 000 West African children living with strangers in the UK alone, and the trade appears to extend across the European Union.
Parents are persuaded that a new and better life awaits their offspring in Europe and send them off to live with distant family and friends in order to receive an education.
In reality, children are put to work as domestic slaves, some are beaten and abused - they rarely set foot in a classroom.
The BBC highlighted the apparent ease of bribing West African officials to buy genuine papers to enable children to be taken to Europe.
Can the Commission indicate whether it is aware of the level of this trade and whether it has statistics from the Member States to quantify the problem?
Has it considered whether coordinating action can be taken at Community level to bring an end to this appalling practice and confirm that the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption, aimed at discouraging the bribing of public officials in third world countries, has been ratified by the Commission and by all the Member States.
The Commission confirms that it is aware of the phenomenon of child trafficking.
As regards the situation in the European Union, a study has been finalised with support from the Stop programme.
The title of the report is 'Trafficking in unaccompanied minors for sexual exploitation in the European Union'.
It was carried out by the International Organisation for Migration and is available on the IOM's website.
The report includes figures from Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
The Commission is also shortly expecting a report from Defence for Children International in the Netherlands.
They have carried out a study on the extent to which children are trafficked for sexual purposes into the European Union, how they get here, what happens to them next and what can be done to help them.
Furthermore, for 2002 the Stop II programme will support a follow-up and extension of the IOM report through a seminar on trafficking in unaccompanied minors in EU Member States.
Additional research on the situation in France, Greece and Spain will form part of the preparations of this seminar.
As regards action against trafficking in human beings, the Commission has been developing a comprehensive policy to fight and prevent such trafficking in human beings over the past few years.
The most recent example is the agreement reached on 28 September 2001 on the Commission's proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings.
The framework decision essentially concerns approximation of criminal laws and penalties to improve and facilitate law enforcement and judicial cooperation.
The Commission confirms that the political dialogue under the Cotonou Agreement and EU support for good governance in ACP countries have given real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice, as well as the corruption elements that may be linked to it.
Moreover, as poverty and lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for children being trafficked, the poverty-reduction approach of our development cooperation is a meaningful basis for attacking the problem.
It gives a priority to equitable growth and better access to education.
The Commission is also implementing actions and coordination with UNICEF and a large number of NGOs in several African countries where this problem is most acute.
In June 2000, in Cotonou, in Benin I had the strange experience of visiting two projects we were funding from the Commission.
One project was helping abandoned children, the other helping abducted children.
In the same city we had two groups of beneficiaries: one project was for street children or orphans or simply abandoned children, and the other was for children who had been freed by the project from being enslaved.
It was very strange to experience.
We went from one project to another and were told about two different ways in which children find themselves in very serious situations.
We are pleased with our cooperation with NGOs in many countries in trying to do something meaningful here.
Finally, it is not envisaged that the Community as such will ratify the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption which is mentioned in the question, as its Member States are ratifying this convention.
At present all Member States, except Ireland, have ratified the convention and it is expected that Ireland will ratify it very shortly.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for that extremely comprehensive answer and also for mentioning his own personal experience of the problem.
I am pleased at the range of measures that he has outlined.
If I could perhaps ask a couple of supplementary points: in his list of countries involved in the various studies on the Stop Programme, he did not actually mention the United Kingdom.
Perhaps he could confirm whether my own Member State is involved or whether it will be brought in in the future.
If not, maybe this is something that I, along with others, can do something about.
Secondly, in terms of the work outlined and personal experience, particularly in relation to the issue of providing information to the parents of children - to some extent setting aside the issues I raised in my question, as it is clear from the BBC report that parents of children are being completely misled by people wishing to exploit their offspring - are there perhaps grounds for involving the EU in some sort of campaign to overcome this problem of misinforming parents, to try and tackle the issue at source.
Mr President, I do not have any information on the involvement of the UK in these investigations and studies.
It is clear that the real value of these studies is their ability to throw light on the whole issue and to raise awareness.
Knowledge, as such, is a strong weapon.
As regards the specific issue of child soldiers, where we have set in place a personal initiative on my behalf, there is a scheme under way with Unicef to try to establish a real information system that could produce reports, using a comprehensive standard base in order to establish meaningful and credible statistics.
At present, we only have the figures that have been flying around for the past five or six years.
So this scheme aims also to exert pressure and keep everybody better informed.
However, the core of this problem is not only poverty, it is also greed.
It is a moral issue.
Highlighting the problem of greed could be part of stronger work in this field.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I must inform you that Mr Lamy has not yet arrived, so Mrs Diamantopoulou will answer questions first.
Second part Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
Question No 44 by , which has been taken over by Mihail Papayannakis(H-0866/01):
Subject: Fatal accident at Perama - implementation of health and safety directives On 20 October 2001, five people died as a result of a fire which broke out while they were working on board a tanker. It is thought likely that the tank in which they were working had not been properly cleaned.
Similar fatal industrial accidents occur frequently in ship-repair yards in Greece while tankers are undergoing maintenance.
The Greek judicial authorities responded to the last accident by initiating criminal proceedings, inter alia for infringement of Presidential Decree 70/90 concerning the health and safety of workers engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair work.
Ten years have passed since the Presidential Decree passed into law and, in the meantime, a number of Community directives on the protection of workers in such conditions have also been issued. Will the Commission say whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the health and safety of workers applicable to working conditions on board tankers, whether they have been incorporated into Greek national law, and whether Presidential Decree 70/90 now covers the obligations deriving from Community legislation?
Mr President, Mr Alavanos's question refers to the fatal accident in Perama, which was a most tragic incident and I should like to express the Commission's condolences to the families of the workers who were killed.
The reply to Mr Alavanos's question as to whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the safety of workers on board tankers, which should have been incorporated into Greek law, is that there are no new measures and no new legislative framework which should have been transposed and that framework directive 89/391, which covers both shipbuilding and the ship repair industry, was transposed into Greek law so as to cover working conditions in such cases.
This specific accident is being investigated by the Greek authorities and the European Union is waiting for the final results of the investigation into the causes so that measures can be taken, in collaboration with the Greek government, in order to prevent this sort of accident from happening again.
Finally, the health and safety strategy is on the European Commission's list of priorities.
There is a huge number of deaths every year at European level.
The new health and safety strategy is due to be announced in 2002, and the report on the application of European health and safety legislation at national level is being drafted as we speak, by which I mean that we are drafting a European report to evaluate the extent to which each country applied the health and safety specifications applicable to each sector last year.
Commissioner, following on from your last sentence, may I ask if the report which you mentioned will contain details of how Directive 89/391 has been applied?
I ask because this is not the first time accidents have happened.
In Perama in particular they have become par for the course.
I should also like to ask the following supplementary question: having studied the texts, not that I have any highly specialised legal knowledge in these matters, I found other directives which, to judge from their titles, appear to relate to the matter under discussion here.
Directives 89/656 and 99/92 concern explosive atmospheres and work in such atmospheres, which is what caused the accident in Perama.
Surely these directives have a bearing on the matter?
And, in any case, and I only ask because you said that you are waiting for news from Greece, and rightly so, does the Commission not periodically examine the prevailing situation on its own initiative, at least in highly sensitive areas which already have a history, such as Perama?
As the European Parliament knows, the Commission has received specific charges relating to the application of the national provisions transposing the directives which you referred to into Greek law.
I have to say that it is extremely difficult for the Commission to intervene on its own and control and monitor the application of directives in all the Member States.
However, where specific charges and reports are filed, it is obviously obliged both to investigate them and to act accordingly, from nagging at governments through to bringing charges before the courts against the Member State in question if it finds that legislation is not being applied.
There have been charges relating to the application of national legislation, there has been an exchange of correspondence which started in the summer, in August to be precise, between the Greek government and the European Commission, staff from my directorate have visited Greece and examined the institutional framework and its application and we have requested additional information further to a letter sent by the Greek government on 9 November. We believe that the information sent is being processed at the moment and other information has also been requested, so that we can make a full evaluation of the level of application of legislation in the case of the specific directives to which you referred.
Mr President, I actually have a further question.
It is very important that regulations governing health and safety at work are applied in the field of shipping, especially where oil tankers are concerned.
It is also of crucial importance to comply with environmental legislation.
Since the Erika disaster, we have had several projects in Europe that have aimed to improve environmental legislation with regard to oil tankers.
Yesterday an oil spillage was discovered close to a nature conservation area in the archipelago off Turku, in Finland, probably due to some breach of environmental legislation - or at least the reason for it has not yet become apparent.
I would therefore like the Commissioner to comment on what measures can also be taken with regard to environmental legislation so that culprits may be identified, and on whether it is possible that the Commission might also take action regarding the kinds of oil-related accidents that occurred last year in Gotland, on the French coast (with regard to the Erika disaster), and now in Turku in Finland.
Thank you for your question, which of course refers to other policies.
Environmental policy, especially after EUREKA, has been a driving force at the European Commission which, as you know, has submitted a framework of measures and proposals to the Council as regards both the actual ships and their various structural specifications and the measures which coastal countries need to take.
However, as far as the specific issue of the health and safety of workers on tankers is concerned, I have to say, first, that European legislation which applies to building sites also applies here and, secondly, that there is a specific directive on fishing vessels, which are a separate class of ship, and a directive on the provision of medical care on board ships.
That is all the legislation which relates specifically to the health and safety of workers on ships.
Question No 45 by (H-0873/01):
Subject: Collection of statistical data on Greece According to the Commission's answer to my question H-0704/01 on the gathering of statistics on unemployment in Greece, the bulk of the reforms of the employment agencies are expected to be complete by the end of 2003, while the implementation of supplementary measures will continue through to the end of 2005.
Since the Commissioner responsible stated in her answer to my question H-0675/00 in September 2000 that the responsible Greek authorities had given a commitment to speed up the restructuring of public services, the employment agencies and the statistical services, and given that the restructuring is due to be completed by the end of 2001, can the Commission say what the reasons are for the delay and who is responsible for it?
Mr President, the Greek authorities have undertaken to reform the national employment agencies, the so-called OAED, and to set up a modern, integrated statistics system which can cope with the problem of people entering and leaving employment.
This undertaking is contained in the agreement on the community support framework for 2000-2006 or, more precisely, in the operational programme on employment and vocational training, and has been reiterated by the Commission in its recommendations for the last three years.
The Greek Ministry of Labour has tabled a business plan for reforming the employment agencies.
It is basically a plan which meets the need for preventive, individualised employment policies.
It has also tabled a reforming law, which was published on 19 October 2001.
The Greek authorities have informed us that the bulk of the reforms will be complete by the end of 2003, while the implementation of supplementary measures will continue until the end of 2005.
One very important aspect of the reform of these agencies is the improvements which will be made to how statistics are collected and to the modus operandi of the employment agencies, which are the counterpart of the statistical office.
Commissioner, we appear to be condemned, you and I, to discussing the same question every three or six months.
It is like chestnut trees in Paris, to borrow an expression from journalism.
My question is this: you originally told me - I have all the information here and I do not suppose that you will question it - that it would be all done and dusted in 2001.
That is what you told me in September 2000, a year ago.
Obviously, you do not lie.
Obviously, you were given that information and this assurance.
Now you tell me that you have been informed, but not assured I hope, that it will be all done and dusted in 2003, with a few extras 'tacked on' in 2005.
What I should like to ask is who is to blame, Commissioner?
Are you in a position to point a finger at who is to blame for this situation?
Because this is no way to conduct a policy to combat employment and the periodic employment statistics published by Eurostat are making a laughing stock of my country because the column headed Greece is always blank.
This is no longer acceptable.
Sir, I do not think it is up to me to say who is to blame but I shall repeat the Commission's recommendations to the Greek authorities that the policies on employment, which are subject to the agreed framework of the employment strategy, that is, prevention and an individualised approach, be applied as quickly as possible.
The reform of the national employment agencies in Greece is a difficult and complex matter.
There were procedures which the Greek government had to follow in terms both of social dialogue and parliamentary deadlines.
I only hope that a start will be made on putting these reforms into practice as quickly as possible.
As always, Commissioner Diamantopoulou is highly alert; indeed, she is one of the most alert, able and sharp-minded of the Commission' s representatives.
Employment statistics are certainly extremely important in combating unemployment.
Does the Commissioner know, for example, that in Italy, in order to get a pension, many women are forced to sign on at the job centre as if they were looking for a job, thus altering the unemployment figures?
The jobless in Italy therefore always seem far more numerous precisely because there is a law that forces women to join the list of those seeking work even if this work is not what they want or desire.
Since this is an inflated and unfair statistic, does the Commissioner not think that there should be an attempt to seek clear and transparent statistics?
Without doubt, statistical offices need to function objectively and correctly, correct statistical methods need to be used and the results of these statistical surveys need to be reliable if the strategy on employment is to be implemented properly.
The European Commission has repeatedly made recommendations to numerous countries, wherever statistical offices have failed to harmonise with common European standards and there are problems with the statistics which they supply, and a new method is due to be introduced in 2003, in collaboration with the EU Statistical Office so as to ensure maximum harmonisation between statistical methodologies relating specifically to the question of employment and unemployment.
I hope that preparations by the Member States, which have already started so that we can commission this new system in 2003, will be of help both to the European Union as a whole and to each individual country.
Question No 46 by (H-0912/01):
Subject: Health and safety at the workplace As part of the Social Policy Agenda, the Commission has undertaken to publish a statement on a Community strategy for health and safety at the workplace in the course of 2002.
Since comparable statistics are needed in order to carry out such an undertaking, how does the Commission intend to address the lack of data and problems of comparability between national data?
According to EUROSTAT research, the average percentage of accidents which are reported in the EU is 89%, while the corresponding figures for Ireland and Greece are 38% and 39%, respectively, which is very alarming.
What measures does the Commission intend to propose to ensure that accidents at the workplace are reported?
May I say that I fully share Mrs Kratsa's concerns about the availability of comparable statistics at European level on both accidents at work and occupational diseases.
As I said earlier, the European Commission has put the strategy on health and safety on its list of priorities and harmonised statistics from the EU Statistical Office will be the basis for the proper development of this strategy.
The Commission has published two harmonised statistical methodologies since 1990.
The first is the ESAW, the European Statistics on Accidents at Work, with 1993 as the reference year.
The second is the EODS, the European Statistics on Occupational Diseases, with 2001 as the reference year.
Provision was made for a special unit for work-related health problems in the 1999 survey on employees.
As far as accidents at work since 1993 are concerned, the Commission has annual statistics available for nine economic sectors.
These statistics come from various national sources and include statistics from Greece and, once they have been received from the Member States, they are adjusted by the Statistical Office in order to estimate the total number of accidents and ensure that they are comparable at European level.
As regards your comment on statistics supplied by Greece in comparison with other countries, the statistics provided by Greece are supplied by IKA, the Social Security Fund, and only refer to a proportion of accidents because only accidents which result in more than three days off work are reported.
According to IKA estimates, 39% of accidents are reported, which compares with Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, although we must bear in mind that 45% of Greeks who are self-employed are insured with IKA.
However, we know that, in 1999 in Greece, 43.4% were employers, self-employed or employees of family businesses, while the corresponding European average, according to Eurostat, was 16.2%.
As part of the new Community strategy on safety, the Commission intends to recommend measures to improve the reporting of accidents at work and occupational diseases which, we believe, will help promote this strategy in all the Member States.
However, I must stress that the efficient implementation of national provisions transposing Community directives, especially those relating to the employer's duty to report accidents sustained by employees at work is a matter for national governments.
It is very hard for the European Commission to monitor the situation at national and regional level, let alone at enterprise level.
So it is important for each country to set up national mechanisms to monitor health and safety issues.
Thank you, Commissioner, for all the information which you have given me.
I understand perfectly that, in order to achieve the objectives which you set in the Social Agenda, you need the national governments and the social partners as your allies.
But how do you intend to change the climate?
Will the Community strategy which you propose force the Member States to supply detailed records, will you monitor progress, will you use tools other than the standard tools?
There are countries, such as Greece which you mentioned, which need to adapt to a number of new circumstances and a new policy, new obligations, in order to highlight and inform the social partners of the quality and economic benefits of monitoring and applying Community policy in the field of health and safety in the workplace.
Mr President, the new strategy on health and safety will be announced at the beginning of 2002 and there will also be a consultation procedure with Parliament and with the Economic and Social Committee and the social partners.
The Commission is already preparing a report under framework directive 89/391, evaluating the application of heath and safety in the Member States. This report is based on the reports submitted by national governments but also takes account of the independent expert's report.
We are in the initial stages of drafting this report as I speak.
However, I must tell you that there are new ideas as regards the application of the new strategy on health and safety and, to reply to your concern as to whether further steps will be taken, thought is being given to applying the open cooperation method to the field of health and safety, which means common objectives, common national action plans, recommendations and cooperation between Member States.
This is one of the proposals which the Commission intends to submit for the new approach.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Question No 42 by (H-0895/01):
Subject: Commission contact with the TABD The Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) was set up in 1995 on the joint initiative of the Commission (led by Commissioners Brittan and Bangemann) and the US Department of Commerce.
Is it true that the Commission and the TABD maintain permanent contact and exchange information and proposals with each other?
Has the Commission contributed to the financing of any of the TABD's annual conferences?
This question concerns the Transatlantic Business Dialogue that forms part of a series of dialogues established in 1995 at the Madrid Summit.
The objectives of this dialogue, as of others too, and I will come back to this, are in a sense to build bridges across the Atlantic by bringing together a number of private, non-governmental players on the one hand and political decision-makers in the Union and the US Administration on the other.
This system of dialogues that was established at the time certainly includes the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, but also includes a Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a Transatlantic Labour Dialogue and a Transatlantic Environment Dialogue; the business aspect being one of the pillars of this dialogue, which includes three others.
The purpose of this range of dialogues is to draw up public recommendations addressed to the Commission and to the US government, which, on a rotational basis, present their recommendations to the political leaders at the EU-US summits.
The Commission for its part attaches the same importance to all these dialogues, and we emphasise this because it has produced valuable results in terms of a number of developments, and certainly in terms of creating more balanced and solid transatlantic relations. Participation in these various dialogues is open.
It is open to the parties concerned, in the various areas, and the results are obviously largely a question of how much the various participants invest in them.
The Commission is involved at different levels in the events that are organised in the context of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, including an annual conference between the CEOs of the various companies, which could be said to form the annual highpoint of this dialogue.
The recommendations are published and available to the public, both on the website of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and on the Commission sites, since our reactions to these recommendations are also in the public domain. In fact, some Members of this Parliament closely monitor the bilateral US-EU bilateral business relations and are invited to take part in the annual conference of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue on a regular basis.
When the first dialogue was arranged in Seville, the two sides shared the costs of this event.
In 1998, at another EU-US summit, both sides undertook to support all the dialogues and in fact that same year the European Parliament created a specific budget heading to support them.
In response to your specific question about financing, since 1998 the Commission has contributed to the financing of the business dialogue, as, incidentally, it has contributed to financing the other dialogues in the form of annual contributions.
In the case of the business dialogue, part of the Commission' s contribution was designed to cover the costs of organising the annual conferences, although most of the costs of these events are now covered by the business sponsorship system. That in fact explains why the Commission gives markedly less financial support to the business dialogue than it does to supporting the consumer dialogue, the labour dialogue and the environment dialogue.
I want to thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive answer.
I have two follow-up questions.
My first is as follows. The major companies in TABD are making a number of practical demands, or expressing their wishes, in connection with legislation they want to see within the EU.
I wonder whether the Commission is reporting back on this to TABD, that is to say upon how these demands are being met and, if so, whether such reporting back is in the public domain.
Secondly, I wonder if TABD representatives participated when political summits were held between the EU and the United States, that is to say, meetings at the highest political level.
Have these major companies and their representatives access to such summits?
As far as the first point is concerned, I would like to say that, like the dialogues on consumers, the environment or employment, the transatlantic dialogue on trade is intended to produce desires, recommendations and points of view that can help to provide a basis for our own work.
This contribution is, therefore, far from being exclusive.
Since we are engaging with a number of people from the business world, with trade unions, with non-governmental organisations, we have a whole range of bodies that are contributing to trade policy, part of which is the dialogue on trade.
This dialogue is important because the European and American business world is putting a considerable effort into this, which is commensurate with the importance of our trade relations with America.
This framework provides the opportunity for desires and wishes to be expressed, and recommendations and comments to be presented. We discuss these, as we do with a number of representatives in the area of trade.
With regard to participation at the summit, as I said earlier, those taking part in these dialogues on business, consumers, the environment and employment are, in turn, urged to come and present their recommendations to the leaders of the two sides, in other words to the American president on the one hand, and to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission on the other.
This is being done in conjunction with the summit' s official meetings, which, as expected, bring us together with the responsible political authorities. This is being done in conjunction with these events.
Question No 43 by (H-0935/01):
Subject: WTO conference in Doha NGOs had very little opportunity to put their case at this year's WTO Ministerial in Doha.
Does the Commission consider that the opportunities NGOs were offered to represent their interests at Doha were nevertheless adequate?
If not, how can it be ensured that NGOs and civil society are able to put their case in an appropriate manner at WTO conferences in the future?
Does the Commission conclude from this that no more WTO conferences should be held in cities such as Doha?
Mr Martin' s question broadly relates to the problems that non-governmental organisations experienced in gaining access to the Doha Conference in Qatar.
First of all, I shall give you some background information. Any member country of the World Trade Organisation can stand as candidate to organise the ministerial conference.
It turned out that Qatar offered to host the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and that it was the only candidate.
If we cast our minds back, so that we have a clear understanding, this decision was due to be taken several months after the Seattle conference, which may explain why there were not as many candidates as some might have wished.
Doha was, therefore, the only candidate city and it is relatively small in size.
Nevertheless, I think that the authorities made a considerable effort - this was something that all those taking part in the ministerial conference mentioned - to be in a position to offer the delegates appropriate accommodation and provide the necessary logistical support.
It is true that several delegations had to restrict the number of their participants due to the limited number of hotel rooms.
That is true.
However, I do not think that it is a catastrophe to slightly restrict the number of participants at such conferences.
In any case, I am sure that this saved the taxpayer some money and as for the delegation from the European Union, we were pleased with the way the conference was organised.
Furthermore, 20 Members of the European Parliament were in the EU delegation and I believe that they said they were satisfied with the way everything was organised.
It is also true that logistical matters were not helped by the events of 11 September and that many security measures were added to the checks that are normally applied at such conferences.
That is true, and it did not make anyone' s life any easier.
I would like to reiterate that, as I also said to Parliament some time ago, we asked the Qatar authorities for access for the non-governmental organisations and were granted it.
This is what happened, even if the security restrictions caused some difficulties for everyone.
The last point that I would like to stress is that, again for security reasons, a large number of potential participants, whether governmental delegations, parliamentary delegations or non-governmental organisations, decided on their own initiative not to come to Doha.
In my view, NGOs were offered genuine opportunities to put their case at Doha.
The organisations that were present were able to contact their national delegations, were able to influence the outcome of the conference and we at Commission level widely encouraged transparency towards the non-governmental organisations.
For instance, documents were discussed quickly, meetings were held openly, and everything that favours transparency has been, in my view, significantly improved over the last two years by the WTO secretariats, has been supported, encouraged, and even initiated by the European Union.
Furthermore, the Director-General of the WTO arranged a number of meetings, in accordance with the commitment that he had made at the conference held in Geneva in July.
I willingly take on board the idea of a code of conduct, which could regulate relations between the WTO and the non-governmental organisations.
To come back to our own delegation, I said that it was made up of a number of MEPs, a number of colleagues of Franz Fischler and myself, more than fifteen representatives of civil society, who valiantly made the journey to Doha and who all achieved the goals they had set themselves.
We worked together with them at Doha.
If any one of them wishes to give their opinion, I have no objection to them doing so.
I myself had many intensive discussions with these representatives during the conference, and also with the representatives of other organisations from European civil society, who were not, strictly speaking, part of our delegation.
To sum up, if I compare Doha to Seattle, I think that we had better participation, greater transparency, a more lively reflection, and that the organisations present had a genuine opportunity to put their case.
This certainly had an effect on the outcome of the Doha Conference.
I spoke to you this morning on that subject.
Overall I think that progress has been made in the way that civil society is managing to make its voice heard as regards multilateral trade policy.
This happened between the Seattle and Doha Conferences, this happened at Doha and I am certain that this will happen more often after Doha.
Mr President, I do not want to rephrase my question, but to put a supplementary one.
Commissioner, if everything was the way you describe it and Doha really was better than Seattle, how, then, do you explain the numerous complaints by NGOs that they were disadvantaged in the run-up to the event, that they could not get visas issued to them and that they were deterred from active involvement by bureaucratic obstacles being put in their way or by being told that there were too few hotel beds?
Secondly, you have just described the narrow field of vision experienced by the European delegation, and how our delegation was composed.
That was not, however, what my question was about; I was asking, rather, about the extent to which civil society could consider itself represented there, my point being that the situation was quite different from that in a country in which there is the freedom to demonstrate and the corresponding possibility of self-expression.
If though, you do not see things that way, I would very much like you to confirm that a second time.
Mr Martin, as far as the accommodation facilities are concerned, these were inevitably determined by the number of hotel rooms available in Qatar. If my memory serves me well, there were approximately 4 500 rooms and, again if I remember correctly, about 700 of these had been reserved for the non-governmental organisations, meaning of course those NGOs that were present in that capacity, apart from those NGOs who were part of the delegations.
However, in the context of the European Union, and I suppose that it is essentially the EU that is of interest to you - it is, in any case, of primary interest to me - we are very lucky to participate in such conferences with 15 Member States, which themselves bring a number of NGOs along with their own delegations.
Therefore, from the European standpoint, many NGOs were present and I heard no complaints about this issue, either before or during any of the many meetings that I had with these organisations.
As far as what happens next, I will be taking part in a status meeting next week which will enable me to come to an opinion.
Once again, if you wish to hear first-hand information, those who were there will be able to give you the details.
I think that the NGOs were able to take the initiative in Doha.
Either I myself or my colleagues on my behalf spent time each day explaining to them (as I did for Parliament' s delegations and, of course, for the Council of Ministers) where we were coming from, what stage we had reached and where we were heading, so that they could follow the work and influence it. As you know, when you meet a delegation of this type which is able explain a few crucial points, this is what counts in such circumstances.
I therefore feel that, from this perspective, things were much better at Doha than at Seattle.
I would reiterate what I said earlier, with Doha being the only candidate city, competition and the law of the market concerning the appeal of the conference location did not really play a part.
This is an issue that we can only take note of; since Doha was the only candidate city, I cannot see what other choice we had.
I reiterate that we ourselves specified the condition that access be offered on an equal basis for all the delegations.
Commissioner, would I be mistaken in suggesting that perhaps the admirable arrangements at Doha had something to do with the relative success of that meeting compared with previous WTO meetings?
Perhaps we are finding a way of having a more civilised relationship with the NGOs than was evident in Seattle and Genoa?
Are you happy that we now have a more rational and civilised arrangement to deal with the representations of NGOs for the future?
Mr Purvis, I can see what you are driving at and I am not sure that I can go as far as you want to take me in this direction.
One of the reasons why Doha was better than Seattle - and, in my view, this is the main reason - was because everyone (the governments, the WTO, the NGOs) gave much thought as to why Seattle failed.
Everyone learnt a great deal from this failure after the event, if I may say so, and took lessons from it in preparation for Doha.
The reason why Doha was a success was, in the main, related to preparation. The reason why Seattle was a failure was, in the main, related to preparation.
The preparations for Seattle were poor, the preparations for Doha were good, and that is what counts for around 80% of the success.
That basically leaves 20%. In Doha, things were well managed and the number of parties, in other words, the number of people who felt involved in the negotiations, who felt able to influence them, was considerable.
I always thought that what happened in the streets of Seattle only had a very small bearing on what was obviously a failure.
Similarly, I believe that what did not take place in the streets of Doha only had a very small bearing on the success of Doha.
Mr President, Commissioner, let me first congratulate you on your success in the Doha negotiations.
I believe that the European delegation, to which I belonged, did very well to bring the negotiations to their conclusion.
We stand a good chance of completing this round successfully.
Our hosts in Doha also looked after us extremely well, something which I think was a fundamental requirement.
What Mr Hans-Peter Martin is referring to, though, is the dialogue with the NGOs, a point I would like to probe further with reference to the Parliamentary Assembly.
I do not believe it is feasible for this discussion to be carried on every couple of years and at the same location.
Do you not think too that it would make more sense for parliamentarians from the various countries to be able to get together over a period of time and jointly to work through this subject, which is so crucial for the future, in a professional and detailed way?
Mr RÃŒbig, I am very much in favour of the suggestion to organise, structure and make more permanent the consultation between the governments and the WTO, to set up an organisation and parliamentary structure which could be derived from the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
You know, as I do, that we have worked on this area, and this House was a primary contributor. We have not managed to set up anything with any shape or form for the time being, for reasons that mainly relate, on the one hand, to the great reluctance of a number of developing countries, and on the other hand, to the fact that the members of the American Congress have not, as yet, shown any particular enthusiasm for the idea.
These two barriers are still standing in our way, but I believe that we must not give up, and, in any case, if Parliament continues to move in the direction it has chosen, namely to attempt to set up this inter-parliamentary structure, you will have the support of the Commission in striving to overcome the obstacles that I have just mentioned, which are still standing in the way but which, in my view, must not deter us.
Thank you very much, Mr Lamy.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 47 by (H-0880/01):
Subject: Animal transport The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has recently adopted a report (A5-0347/2001) by Albert Jan Maat MEP, which calls on the Commission to present proposals incorporating a maximum limit of eight hours or 500 km on the transport of animals to slaughter or for further fattening and an end to the payment of export refunds in respect of the export of live EU cattle to third countries for slaughter.
Does the Commission intend to present proposals incorporating the above two resolutions of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development?
Mr President, as rightly pointed out by Parliament's report, one of the key issues concerning animal transport relates to travelling time limits, and I thank Parliament for its contribution.
Travelling times, as with other parameters such as temperatures or densities, are essential elements to achieve a good level of protection for the animals during transport.
As a matter of policy, the Commission considers it to be of the utmost importance to draft legislative proposals on the basis of sound scientific advice.
The Commission has therefore requested an opinion from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on different welfare aspects of animal transport and, in particular, travelling time limits.
This opinion is expected early in 2002.
The Commission will present further proposals on animal transport in the light of this opinion.
As regards the granting of export refunds for slaughtered cattle, the Commission shares the views of the Council, as expressed in its resolution of 19 June 2001 on welfare.
The first objective is to correct the deficiencies observed with the implementation of existing legislation.
There should be more controls and severe sanctions if the existing legislation on welfare during transport is not correctly implemented, be it on transport inside the Community or on exports to countries outside the EU.
Commissioner Fischler is also committed to strengthening the existing rules in this respect.
Community legislation in the field of export refunds unambiguously links the payment of aid to the respect of all the conditions related to animal welfare.
The Community must achieve a well-balanced solution to the different aspects of this question.
For example, it is wrong to assume that if we abolish the refund for live cattle, third countries will import carcases rather than live animals.
I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission.
Animal transport in particular deserves much attention and action in the near future.
In 1993, the Commission admitted that the laws on animal transport were being systematically flouted.
In 1999, we had further evidence of particular problems in Spain, Italy and Greece.
There is no reason to believe that implementation enforcement has improved at all since 1993 or 1999.
Animals frequently still find themselves crammed into overcrowded trucks, given neither food nor water, often for journeys flouting the current limits and travelling for up to 30 or 40 hours.
The combination of high temperatures, poor ventilation, overcrowding and lack of water can be lethal.
Many animals suffer extreme discomfort during transport and arrive dead or dying at their destination.
The European Parliament has repeatedly voted in favour of an eight-hour limit on transport.
It had the overwhelming support of a majority in plenary.
It had the support of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I am pleased to hear that a proposal will follow the opinion of the Scientific Committee, but what is the Commission going to do to ensure the proposal is enforced properly and to ensure the current laws are enforced properly?
What specific actions is Commissioner Byrne going to take to improve enforcement both of current laws and the laws that we hope to see implementing an eight-hour limit and an end to export subsidies?
Mr President, as I have already indicated, this report is due to be presented to the Commission early in the new year and when that report is available it will be closely examined by my services and myself to determine an appropriate response with regard to time limits and distances.
In the meantime, the control of this issue lies in the hands of Member States and it should remain there with the supervision of the Food and Veterinary Office.
That is one of the jobs that is undertaken by the FVO in its inspection reports.
The Commission also takes this issue seriously, not only in continuing its discussions with the Member States in circumstances where there is a recognised failure to comply with the legislation so as to ensure upgrading of standards, but also, where there has been a persistent failure to comply with the legislation, in instituting proceedings against individual Member States.
There are a number of such proceedings being considered at the moment.
You will also be aware of Regulation (EC), No 615/98 which requires and empowers the Commission to withdraw export refunds in circumstances where the animal welfare legislation has not been complied with.
I refer you to the detailed answer given on 19 February 2001 to the question asked by Mrs Maes on the issue of the withdrawal of export refunds and, in particular, to the annex attached to that answer which clearly sets out the number of withdrawals of export refunds in respect of the Member States involved and the values involved.
I assure you that this issue is taken seriously by the Commission and all the measures I have identified have been taken.
We are keeping a close eye on this issue to ensure that animal welfare standards are kept up.
I wonder when the treatment and transport of animals will be seen as part of the public health and food safety chain.
We have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people' s health, but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed.
If these matters are not handled in the right way, there is a significant increase in the risk of diseases. These are mainly cured with antibiotics, but large quantities of tranquillisers are also used.
One consequence of antibiotics being misused as a result of poor animal husbandry is that what, during the last 60 years, have been simple infections are now - and, above all, will be in the future - significantly more serious when antibiotics are no longer available to us.
The connection between animal health and the treatment of animals and human health is well documented.
There is a close association between the two and definitely a connection in the sense that you make reference to - antibiotics.
The Commission has brought forward legislation in that regard and I refer you to the conference that took place only a couple of weeks ago under the auspices of the Belgian presidency on this particular issue.
I refer you to what I said on that occasion and also to what Minister Magda Aelvoet said in relation to that particularly important issue.
I also make reference to the zoonosis directive which has gone through the Commission and is now before Parliament.
Mrs Paulsen is your rapporteur for that particular piece of legislation and I identify that legislation as also being important in addressing the question of animal health as an influencing factor on human health.
Just one final point on this question, in relation to the transport of animals over long distances.
One of the issues that has to be weighed in the balance and borne in mind is the location and quality of abattoirs and meat plants: they need to be up to the high standards necessary to comply with the legislation passed here in this House and by the Council of Ministers.
The investment needed to achieve these standards means that there are now fewer abattoirs than there used to be and this is necessary in order to comply with the legislation for the protection of human health.
But ultimately it also affects the question of animal transport and the transport of live animals over a longer distance.
That, however, is another issue that has to be borne in mind in determining the protection of human health in respect of animals, animal health and animal welfare.
I am going to ask all Members to be very concise in their questions, and the Commissioner in his answers, naturally, because we are running late and we want to finish the programme of questions.
Mrs McKenna has the floor for a supplementary question.
I am worried that maybe this scientific report is a way of trying to avoid reducing the time and the distance to what Parliament wanted.
There was consensus between the Environment Committee and the Agriculture Committee on the reduction of the overall journey time and distance.
It is very important that the Commission takes this on board.
I am sorry to say I do not find your answer quite sufficient in relation to the export refunds.
You talk about respecting all conditions of animal welfare and say you need a well-balanced solution.
European taxpayers do not want their money going to fund something that causes distress and harm to animals.
We need to stop the export refunds granted in relation to third countries for slaughter, irrespective of whether conditions are being complied with or not.
It is wrong that our money is being used in this way.
This is the message that came out clearly from Parliament.
I would like a commitment from the Commission that it is going to abolish export refunds to third countries for slaughter.
The scientific report you refer to will be made available for your consideration and will be considered by the Commission before bringing forward any further policies.
On the question of stopping export refunds, I have already indicated that is not Commission policy.
It is also not the policy of the Council of Ministers and it does not reflect their views.
Therefore I cannot give the commitment you seek.
We are going to change the order because Mr Lund needs to leave the Chamber urgently.
Question No 49 by (H-0908/01):
Subject: Unacceptable limit values for heavy metals in fish The Danish newspaper Politiken reported on 15 November 2001 that the EU was to raise limit values to allow more heavy metal in fish despite a recommendation from an EU committee of experts that stricter standards should be introduced.
Mercury, lead and cadmium, which are found in shellfish for which there is high demand, can, for example, weaken the nervous system and cause other very serious diseases in humans.
There are absolutely no grounds for raising these limit values.
Will the Commission therefore say why these limit values are to be raised, on which studies any increase may be based, and which studies are opposed to any increase?
I would also point out in this connection that the population of Denmark has long been encouraged to eat more fish as it promotes the general level of public health.
Unfortunately, these endeavours will now be to no avail if, at the same time, the EU intends to raise the limit values for noxious heavy metals in fish.
The Scientific Committee on Food made assessments on lead and cadmium in the diet and advised upon safe intake levels.
It concluded that dietary intake levels were well below the safety thresholds.
When EU legislation on contaminants is established, if the intake levels are below safety thresholds, the principle known as ALARA must be followed.
This involves setting maximum levels as low as reasonably achievable.
This is an internationally applied approach.
In this specific case, the Commission adopted limits for lead and cadmium to come into force in April 2002.
Concerns were expressed at the time by the Member States in the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs that the new provisions were not achievable for certain fishery products.
It was agreed, therefore, urgently to review the relevant provisions.
From recent data, it became clear that these limits would impose requirements beyond the scope of what is reasonably achievable, without benefit to public health.
Therefore, the maximum levels in certain fishery products were reviewed and slight increases for certain limited species are now being proposed to take account of this reality.
To set unachievable limits is not defensible.
Given the overall intake levels, the revised maximum levels do not increase the risk to public health.
Thank you very much for your answer. We are concerned here with ordinary, edible fish and shellfish, of which we normally recommend people in Europe to eat plenty.
I therefore find it worrying that there is now a desire to increase the limit values.
I must ask a couple of supplementary questions.
Is it correct that the Committee of Independent Experts has in actual fact recommended a reduction in the limit values?
Is it correct that the United States has stricter limit values in these areas than we have in Europe?
Finally, I want to ask who has asked for these limit values to be increased.
Is it the fishing industry and, if so, in which countries does the fishing industry want permission for higher limit values for the heavy metals at issue here: lead, cadmium and mercury?
In respect of mercury the general maximum level is 0.5 mg/kg for fishery products.
That remains unchanged as previously set under veterinary legislation, in particular Commission Decision 93/351.
The only proposed change is that two additional species have been added to the list of fish species for the maximum level of 1 mg/kg.
These are the grenadier fish and the emperor fish which are minor contributors to diet, but data showed the lower level was unachievable.
You then asked me about shellfish.
The proposals will not increase the safety level of eating shellfish for either children or adults.
The only proposed change for limits in shellfish as bivalve molluscs is for lead.
A slight increase from 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg is proposed, because data shows that the lower level for lead is not reasonably achievable.
Exposure to lead in the diet is well within safe limits.
Otherwise, there is no change for provisions on cadmium or mercury.
Question No 48 by (H-0889/01):
Subject: 'Smiling face' food quality label On 1 October 2001 the Danish food inspectorate began to have its reports put up in the 40 000 or so establishments in that country producing or selling food and drink to the public. The idea is that within a year all of them will be prominently displaying at least one report, clearly expressing the outcome of the official inspection in a label taking the form of one of four different facial expressions.
A broad smile for example will mean that no adverse comments were made after the most recent inspection, while a really cross face will show that the establishment was fined, reported to the police or had its permit withdrawn.
It would be hard to find a better way of conveying clear consumer information.
Is the Commission aware of this new Danish system?
If so, is it prepared to recommend other Member States to follow suit?
If not, does it not feel that the system deserves closer study as a possible basis for future rules on the matter?
I agree with the honourable Member that it is important to raise consumer awareness.
The Commission is favourable to any initiative protecting the consumer.
However, the Commission considers that the task of developing food quality and information to consumers on the results of official controls, surveillance and other monitoring activities in the food sector should be left to Member States.
Member States are responsible for carrying out the official control of foodstuffs at all stages of production and distribution.
It is for them to decide how best to inform the consumer about these activities.
This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
While the Commission is not aware of this particular initiative by the Danish authorities, it can encourage such steps or the voluntary implementation of such initiatives by other Member States, but it is unlikely to make a similar proposal at Community level.
I stress that these points are made in relation to the outlets that you particularly refer to in your question.
Question No 50 by (H-0942/01):
Subject: State of slaughterhouses in Greece According to the data available, the Greek slaughterhouse infrastructure is extremely inadequate.
Specifically, of the 350 operational slaughterhouses, 50 to 60 fulfil the requirements of Directive 91/497/EEC to a certain extent, and have formal approval, while the rest belong to municipal authorities and communes and are of ancient construction, with inadequate and obsolete equipment and no facilities for the hygienic disposal of liquid or solid waste or highly toxic substances.
Additionally, cleaning and disinfection programmes are not implemented in these slaughterhouses and the slaughterhouse workers do not observe the rules on personal hygiene.
Is the Commission satisfied with the current situation in Greek slaughterhouses, and what steps does it intend to take to ensure that Greece complies fully with Community law?
Slaughterhouses in Greece are approved by the competent authorities under Council Directive 64/433 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat as amended by Directive 95/23.
47 slaughterhouses are recorded as being approved for placing meat on the Community market.
The meat from the remaining operational slaughterhouses that is judged fit for human consumption can be marketed on the national territory.
The last inspection mission on fresh meat carried out in Greece by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office was in September 2000 in relation to porcine meat.
This mission identified serious wide-ranging deficiencies in the operation of official controls and production standards in this sector.
As the honourable Member is aware from the reply to his earlier question at the November session, there have been follow-up contacts with the Greek authorities during 2001 in an attempt to resolve the problems found.
To date the action taken has not been satisfactory and the Commission remains very concerned about the situation.
Further high level meetings with the Greek authorities are planned for early 2002 in an attempt to resolve the remaining shortcomings in food safety and veterinary control standards.
With regard to waste water treatment, Council Directive 91/271 concerning urban waste water treatment foresees rules for slaughterhouses.
Waste water above a particular volume must meet conditions established in prior regulations and or specific authorisations by the competent authority since 31 December 2000.
Where slaughterhouses discharge directly into the public sewer, the general rules of the directive are valid.
Detailed information on the situation of industrial discharges in Greece is under assessment.
Commissioner, you said that 47 slaughterhouses meet certain Community requirements, while others can operate freely in Greece.
The point is that we have 350 slaughterhouses, leaving a large number of slaughterhouses which obviously do not meet Community requirements.
Is that correct?
I should just like to clarify this.
The second question I wish to ask you is if you have any news on spongiform encephalopathy.
The Commission has conducted an investigation in Greece.
What is going on?
By which I mean as regards BSE.
Then there is the serious question of the central meat market in Athens, where the Commission has ordered an investigation.
Given that you are in contact with the Greek authorities, I should be obliged if you could tell me if you have any news on this matter.
As I indicated in my earlier reply, the Commission remains very concerned about the situation in relation to slaughterhouses.
With regard to BSE and other controls, I refer you to the FVO reports on this issue.
On 22 May, I confirmed that I met the Greek minister in the margins of the Agriculture Council where there was a discussion in relation to the weaknesses identified in successive reports of the FVO.
Once again, on 8 June, I wrote to the Greek minister asking for a follow-up to his initial reply of 27 April.
This has led to further interaction between the minister, the relevant authorities in Greece and my own services.
The message to the Greek authorities is consistent: much greater effort and resources must be invested in correcting the deficiencies consistently found in the missions of the FVO.
The conclusions of the FVO reports are available for perusal on the website.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 51 to 83 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
WTO meeting in Qatar (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Qatar.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say how grateful and obliged we are to the Commission and the Council for the excellent preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Qatar.
Commissioner Lamy, you and your colleagues achieved something extraordinary in starting from an extremely difficult situation just before Doha and nonetheless, by the end of the meeting, getting all the subjects wanted by the European Union into the programme for the round beginning in 2002, this despite the usual, and largely unjustified, attacks by India and the Cairns Group countries on the European Union.
Essential elements of our pre-conference resolution were included.
Two weeks later, in Accra, I saw for myself the pride of Ghana's government representatives in pointing out that Africa had played an independent role this time, and this could, among other things, be attributed to good preparatory work by the European Union and in particular by Commissioner Lamy.
The developing countries, particularly Africa, are now and for the future fully involved in negotiations, and this was also one of our main demands.
The political declaration on TRIPS represents a respectable result for the African mediators, something that you have already mentioned this morning, Commissioner Lamy.
The demands of the developing countries and of the Africans - ranging from the need for comprehensive technical aid to the Cotonou Agreement's exceptions up to 2008 - have very largely been met.
The core European demands will, though, also be included in the new round of negotiations.
I do not need to go into the details again.
What is important is that we in the European Union can input our conceptions of a socially and environmentally responsible market economy into the system of free and fair world trade and that they can also, slowly, prevail.
I also believe, though, that there is still more that we can do to make the WTO more democratic.
Mr Lamy, you too have referred to the need for us to achieve the creation of a parliamentary assembly.
We in this Parliament should retain our leadership role and also ask the Commission to continue its financial support for us, so that we can especially involve the representatives of the African parliaments.
Let me return to a point made in this morning's debate.
One of our colleagues, Mrs Lucas, pointed out that the outcome was poor, indeed unacceptable.
I thought, here comes a European justification of European interests, but she only referred to India and certain NGOs, which...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the World Trade Organisation has a future.
It is true that in the coming years the 144 Member States will resume negotiations on the further liberalisation of world trade, but more than ever before, the rich man' s club has learnt that survival of the fittest no longer applies.
Indeed, the developing countries have made huge progress and have made their mark during the negotiations.
However, the European Union also has reason to be satisfied.
Thanks to the commitment and perseverance of the European negotiators, both our Commissioners who are present today, an agreement has ultimately been reached on a broad-based negotiation round.
For example, in the new round, there will be scope for negotiations about public spending, competition, investments, and the link between international environmental agreements and the WHO rules.
These trade discussions are held at a significant time, because after the acts of terrorism in the United States, they send out the message that the Member States are prepared to join forces at international level and that terrorists cannot undermine international trade.
Furthermore, it is important to continue the liberal trade policy because it can give the failing world economy a shot in the arm.
Finally, I should like to point out that the WTO' s challenge is to continue to develop the multi-lateral trade system in such a way as to ensure that globalisation yields the best possible benefits for as many people and countries as possible.
We must continue to strive as we have for over fifty years.
Madam President, in a report to the 133 Committee on the WTO meeting in Qatar, the Commission asserts that 'active participation by European civil society strengthened the hand of the EU negotiator' .
This creates the impression that popular movements should be just as deliriously happy as Mr Lamy about the result from Qatar.
That is an unusually impudent lie.
The truth is that the environmental and solidarity organisations are criticising the EU' s action in Doha and characterising the final agreement as a defeat for the poor peoples of the world.
The International Forum on Globalisation observes, for example, that the results from Qatar signify 'the ultimate triumph for the world trade body whose very mission is to exclude civil society from shaping economic systems' .
Prior to the Laeken Summit, ATTAC Belgium wrote that, partly because of its support for the WTO, the EU est essentiellement dÃ©terminÃ©e par les intÃ©rÃªts des institutions financiÃšres et des grandes entreprises.
The truth is that both the European popular movements and representatives of the developing countries are very embittered about the EU negotiators' way of using the language of force to twist the arms of the poor countries' representatives.
It is bad enough that the Commission should represent a Eurocentric, self-regarding and neo-liberal trade policy, but is it not rather crude, Mr Lamy, untruthfully to try to make Europe' s popular movements jointly responsible for the shameful abuse of power of which the EU was guilty in Doha?
Madam President, we view with concern the decisions of the meeting of the World Trade Organisation.
Its repercussions in the short and medium term may prove disastrous for the peoples of many countries, particularly the less developed countries, but also some in the European Union, namely Portugal.
For my country, the opening up in the agricultural and textile areas, including the bilateral agreements being negotiated by the European Union, such as that with Pakistan, without taking Portuguese requirements into account, is particularly worrying.
For the economic and multinational groups, the most important factor was achieved: the opening of negotiations for greater liberalisation of world trade, postponed in Seattle and openly called into question this year by world organisations, namely those which were present at the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre and at Genoa.
The triumphant declarations of UNICE (European employers' organisation) show this clearly when they state that the principal issue was settled, even if not all its demands were fully satisfied.
The final resolution of the WTO itself, referring to liberalisation in particularly sensitive areas such as textiles, important aspects of agriculture, services and others, including the area of intellectual property, leaves little doubt, although its consolidation in practice could yet be influenced by any disputes that may develop.
Even a few small positive advances in the field of intellectual property, after the pressure which countries like Brazil and South Africa brought to bear in order to obtain generic drugs to combat AIDS and malaria, show that it is important to step up the fight against capitalist globalisation in its various aspects, whether political, economic, social or environmental.
The European Union trade associations have already condemned the opening of negotiations within the WTO framework without at least having secured real progress in upholding compliance with the ILO agreements and minimum standards of defence of workers' rights, given that there can be no sustained development without social and environmental development.
The liberalisation of international trade favours the rich countries and multinationals, deepens the gulf between developed and less developed countries, as is clearly shown by studies conducted under the aegis of the UN, intensifies the exploitation of communities and workers by multinationals which dominate international trade and which are only interested in making maximum profit, even if it is at the expense of child labour, food safety, the environment, family farming and multifunctional farming.
Hence the importance of mobilising support for the fight for an alternative of sustained development which places priority on reducing poverty and social expansion, which promotes a review of the CAP, which is more coherent, which provides more mutual support and which is less isolated from the countries of the South.
Thank you, Madam President.
The Qatar trade round was to become a round for the benefit of the developing countries.
This objective has been partly achieved.
Partly, because Europe, like other rich countries, refuses to cut down on market-distorting aid.
Europe' s euphoria about Qatar can therefore be put down more to the expected trade liberalisation for its own benefit.
It has to be said that Qatar has given the umpteenth green light for the reform of our agricultural policy.
The challenge is to guarantee farmers a reasonable income without distorting the world market price.
Direct income support, and a widening of the agricultural packages of tasks and rewards are positive steps towards that goal.
Even after Qatar, the impression remains that not all Member States are adopting that line.
Another matter of major importance for developing countries was the clarification of the agreement on intellectual property.
There may be the political explanation that patent law should not obstruct the production of life-saving medicines in emergency situations, this explanation is not entirely satisfactory.
Indeed, it must be possible for countries which do not boast an industry which produces these cheaper medicines to import them freely.
The legal problems which emerge in this connection deserve a resolute approach.
To avoid misuse, inspection to establish whether there is indeed an emergency situation is crucial.
Finally, I would underline that in the fight for the environment and social standards, not distortion of competition, but market access for poor countries and their well-being should be the EU' s most important driving forces.
Madam President, Commissioner, at Doha, the fourth WTO ministerial conference had to set an agenda and a programme.
It did this, so from that point of view it was a success.
Yet for whom was it a success?
It was, no doubt, Commissioner, a success for you, since you proved that you enjoy excellent health and the ability to work through the night.
Talking of health issues, Doha was a real success as far as medicines are concerned, but it is chiefly due to Osama bin Laden that the poor people of the world owe their entitlement to access to medicines.
In other words, if the USA had not been afraid of anthrax and had not, therefore, had to challenge Bayer' s intellectual property rights, they would not have given in.
Apart from that, what did we get out of Doha?
The answer is, two things, a few clichÃ©s and a reprieve.
The clichÃ©s are piling up.
First of all there are those clichÃ©s about world trade leading to growth, stability, and of course peace.
We had already signed a trade agreement in Marrakesh, and everyone knows that that agreement brought about peace in Gaza and in Palestine, and even peace in Afghanistan.
The second great clichÃ© is that Europe would have held out, but was abandoned by Japan.
The least developed countries, despite having been given everything except arms, also abandoned it.
Korea has maybe stayed with it.
The European Union is showing cracks.
The French farmers are on their own again, apart from some support from Ireland.
However, Europe did obtain a victory on the environment and social affairs.
On the environment, the United States, which is not a party to the Kyoto agreement, did not associate itself with us, and on social affairs, all the European trade unions have expressed their highly negative opinions about Doha.
In addition, Europe obtained a reprieve.
First of all there was the agricultural reprieve.
Until the end of the negotiating round, and therefore until 2005, our farmers will have internal aid and restitutions.
After that, we agreed that these will be abolished.
However, the French representatives Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin called for a stay of execution so that they can get through the presidential elections without any trouble.
They obtained that stay of execution for the CAP, which was facing the death penalty, so well, in fact, that when Poland accedes to Europe, Polish farmers will be deceived because they will be joining the Europe of the CAP when in fact, from 2005 onwards, there will no longer be one.
We also obtained a reprieve for foreign investments.
The IMA was thrown out of the OECD window only to return through the WTO door.
We also obtained a reprieve on pensions.
The insurance companies will not immediately be able to appropriate this large market for themselves.
After Doha, therefore, we are left with the following situation: the European agricultural model has been broken up, the European cultural exception has been forgotten, and the long-term European social model is at risk.
What will remain of Europe?
It will be merely a vast free-trade area, and everyone knows that, according to Adam Smith, free trade equals national poverty.
Madam President, the self-appointed opponents of globalisation were in the headlines only for a short time.
They thought they had exiled the WTO to the desert.
Doha's very remoteness brought about a compromise anyway, one that was signed by all 142 members.
What a contrast with Seattle in 1999, when debates on content were overshadowed by clashes on the street.
I was there when militant demonstrators paralysed our conference and, in professional fashion, immediately supplied photos of the performance they put on.
Doha again saw highly polarised debates between the seven hundred accredited NGOs and the national delegations, but it achieved important results.
Three years are to be spent working on a new world trade round in order to facilitate further liberalisation of the global economy.
The EU had its way in agricultural issues.
One aspiration is that subsidies should come to an end, but this is not a precondition of the forthcoming negotiations.
It is unfortunate that investments and environmental issues could not yet be put on the negotiations' agenda; they will be on it in two years' time at the earliest.
We all have to give way somewhere - the USA on hormonally treated meat, the labelling of genetically modified produce and the opening up of the textiles market. The EU, too, must dismantle barriers, above all, Commissioner, as regards protection of farming.
We must strike a balance between the opening of markets and their regulation.
On the one hand, import restrictions are to be dismantled; on the other, the import of low-quality cheap produce is to be prevented, for, firstly, they are a danger to the consumer, and, secondly, pirated copies and infringed patent rights cost businesses billions.
We are opposed to total liberalisation.
Social security and public services need to be tested, but state monopolies should not be dismantled while private ones are built up.
Changes to the agenda are just as important.
Let us then call for sustainable protection of the environment, social standards and the punishment of human rights violations.
Madam President, congratulations on being seated there today.
Thank you to the two Commissioners who are present and thank you also to the whole of the Commission's team.
I would also like to thank the Council.
I believe it was only by working together that we managed to achieve real success here.
I include in this, by the way, our colleague Mr Westendorp, who headed our delegation and, unfortunately, is not here this evening, but I believe he deserves as much gratitude as everyone else.
There are just a few points that I want to address.
First, I believe that many Members have yet again forgotten a number of things, above all those whom I always describe as permanently engaging in mantra politics by repeating the same thing over and over again.
I believe that they are forgetting that Doha opened a way ahead for negotiations and laid down a strategy for them.
We should give more consideration to how we can work together with the Commission and the Council in future, for it is only now that the actual negotiations are happening.
The subjects for discussion must be defined, and it is by no means certain that apparent successes we have achieved on many points will prove to be lasting successes over the years, and so I would like to ask the Commissioners in particular how they actually envisage cooperation with Parliament.
I would like this cooperation to be substantially more precise and detailed, giving a much more accurate view of the state of negotiations you will be engaged in on the various subject areas, and also signalling where there are difficulties or problems, not only giving definite information on many points, but actually facilitating political monitoring as well.
Let me make another point.
I believe it will be much more important than in the past to join up policies on trade and foreign affairs.
I would particularly like to mention in this context two regions - the European Union and the United States.
I believe that the European Union and the United States bear to an incredible degree responsibility for the future definition of trade policy, which is much more than can be summed up in the traditional trade themes we were familiar with in the past, incorporating as it does so many new ones.
Development of traditional trade policy and its connection with new subject matter will be the difficult task to be faced in the future.
You - above all Commissioners Lamy and Fischer - managed to bring that off elegantly in Doha, but, as I said at the outset, the real work is only getting under way now.
I believe we must attach much more emphasis to putting foreign policy regarding countries such as, for example, India, Singapore or China, but also regarding many of the Latin American countries, on a much firmer footing, using a stronger foreign policy to achieve greater understanding for what we actually want to achieve in the sphere of trade policy.
There is still the prevalent feeling in certain countries and states that we are actually using our trade policy to engage in indirect protectionism.
We should take care that this sentiment does not arise in the first place, and that, if it does, it can be rooted out.
The Singaporean Ambassador has again drawn my attention to his country's long-standing desire to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU.
I believe that bilateral free trade agreements bring with them the possibility of opening doors of that sort, and also have the potential to achieve greater multilateral rapprochement by means of bilateral negotiations.
Commissioners, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what you think about that.
Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The Doha Conference has spawned a sense of enthusiasm that I can only ascribe to the fact that expectations were so low, for I have to say that we remain very critical.
Inequality of power is simply too pronounced in the world, which leaves its mark on conferences of this kind.
While the developing countries wanted to see the earlier agreements through to a conclusion, Europe wanted to continue to build at multilateral level. There was therefore a certain level of ambiguity which has facilitated some progress.
We are, of course, delighted with the fact that in connection with medicines, unmistakable progress has been made, because there is now at least an agreement about the intellectual property rights.
However, we are hugely vexed by the fact that Europe continues to insist on high import levies on agricultural and textile products, while an agreement on a gradual cutback had, in fact, been reached.
The first results should be evident as soon as 2005, and upon further research, it now emerges that too little has happened in this field.
At the moment, agricultural support as a whole is hardly any lower than at the end of the eighties.
As at previous WTO conferences, the liberalisation of the economy was also mentioned at Doha.
Although the issue of intellectual property rights may have been a positive illustration of this, surely this was only a tiny ray of hope.
Ideally, we would like see that we side with the weak, for whoever observes this world at war is bound to see that this is all about inequality of power.
Madam President, all this triumphant talk masks the latest instalment in a policy to ensure that global trade serves the interests of the multinationals.
Further liberalisation is still the main objective, that is, opening up the markets in poor countries to the industrialised products of the developed countries which, at the same time, will import agricultural produce to compete with our own, together with raw materials at derisory prices.
In the agricultural sector, the main aim is to wipe out subsidies, which would strike a tremendous blow to production in countries such as Greece where, I should point out, farmers have taken to the roads yet again in order to demand a fair price for their labour.
When it comes to foreign investment, competition, public procurement and commercial arrangements, the 'because I say so' approach has been used to impose imperialist choices, despite the almost universal opposition of non-governmental organisations and the less developed countries.
The meeting in Qatar confirmed the WTO as the main tool of capitalist globalisation.
Any interest evinced in the problems of less developed countries and the environment is lip service and, as such, mere hypocrisy.
It does, of course, show that the mass demonstrations have had an impact and that the WTO is trying to hijack the anti-globalisation movement by appearing to be sensitive to its concerns.
But it took good care to shield the meeting from troublesome protestors and we would not be surprised if the next meeting were held in Antarctica.
The only way open to the grass-roots movement is to resist and counterattack both the WTO and the European Union and the governments advocating and applying anti-grass roots policies.
Madam President, I also consider the results of the ministerial conference in Doha to be positive and I would therefore like to join other Members in congratulating Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler and the Council on their unquestionable contribution to this success.
It is true that the final declaration does not say everything it should say and, I would say, that sometimes it says more than it should say, but any negotiation means reaching compromises and compromise requires concessions.
The thing we must really value about Doha is the bringing together of the diverging, and sometimes contradictory, interests of the Member countries of the WTO and an agreement has been reached to launch a new round, set an agenda, a timetable and a working programme, and, secondly, that the development dimension has been fully integrated into all negotiations and that the least-developed countries and the developing countries have spoken out strongly and their voice has been heard and their concerns taken into account.
The WTO train, as you said quite rightly, Commissioner Lamy, is back on the rails and has already left the station.
I would add that furthermore the means have been provided so that its destination may be a sustainable growth which also benefits the poorest countries.
However, in order for that train to reach its destination, the necessary means must be adopted, the texts must be interpreted correctly, since they are full of structural ambiguities, and guarantee reciprocity in the opening up of the markets and full respect for the rules which govern multilateral trade.
In order to help to overcome the barrier of poverty once and for all, we must adopt the necessary measures to facilitate access, above all by the least-developed countries, because these countries may suffer as a result of the multilateral commercial system, due to the advantages we offer to the developing countries.
Mr President, before Doha, many of us were clearly aware that the issue of access to medicine was going to be the benchmark that developing countries would use to test our seriousness about whether we wanted to launch a development round.
What we have seen is a declaration on access to medicines and public health.
Even the title is important because it is not just about access to medicines, it is about support for public health.
It is groundbreaking and, as someone said this morning, it has within it a commitment to the whole question of flexibility of the agreement on TRIPS.
As the Commissioner is well aware, the United States and Switzerland, in particular, argued that the reference to public health was too broad.
They wanted it to be limited to certain infectious diseases.
But I have to say, Commissioner - and you will agree - that what happened represented a real victory for developing countries because they were skilled in negotiation, and that position by the US and Switzerland, in particular, was finally rejected.
It is important that we pay tribute to developing countries and to the negotiating skills that they displayed.
The belief traditionally fostered by the pharmaceutical companies has been that patents are sacrosanct.
After Doha that has changed.
If drug companies price medicines beyond the reach of people who need them, governments can override patents without the fear of retribution.
Despite the progress at Doha, as far as patent rules are concerned, the story is far from over.
I have two specific questions, Commissioner.
Does the Commission agree that the immediate challenge is to ensure that the WTO lifts the restrictions on the export of cheap equivalents of patented drugs to countries which have decided to override a patent but do not have the necessary manufacturing capacity?
That issue was not resolved at Doha and has been referred to the TRIPS Council.
Secondly, how does the Commission intend to ensure that countries without production capacity or insufficient production capacity can make full use of the compulsory licensing provisions?
This must, in my view, be accompanied by a reduction in the length of drug patents in poor countries.
TRIPS currently dictates a patent term of 20 years world-wide.
At the review of the rules scheduled for 2002, the WTO should at least agree to extend the deadline for TRIPS compliance for all developing countries and base it on development progress rather than on arbitrary dates.
I wonder if the Commissioner agrees with me on this?
Finally, on the question of developing countries, I would like to pay tribute, in particular, to ACP countries, in which we have a particular interest and partnership in the European Union.
The 77 ACP countries succeeded in obtaining a waiver.
They put out a brilliant declaration before Doha.
I have had several meetings with them since then.
They are well pleased with the results.
Doha should have been the development cycle.
Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha?
I do not share other Members' optimism on this point.
For instance, the agreement on access to medicines, which appeared to be a victory, is really a decoy to lure the media and the developing countries.
Presented as a vital stake at this conference and as a major concession to the developing countries, the clarification of the TRIPS agreement and the interpretation of it - which has always been our interpretation - are admittedly a political victory, but that victory changes nothing from the legal point of view. It is of no value before the body that settles disputes within the WTO, and, as Mrs Kinnock has pointed out, the question remains unresolved for those countries which have no production capacity.
For the time being, nothing allows them to use compulsory licensing in order to arrange for the medicines they need to be manufactured by third parties, and this point was emphasised at the recent conference in Ouagadougou.
In the same way, the derogation and the WTO' s reciprocity rule, which were granted at the last minute to signatory states of the Cotonou agreement for a period of eight years, appeared to be a positive achievement.
In reality, however, that authorisation, which the ACP states had been waiting for for months, seems more like blackmail as far as they are concerned.
They were obliged to sign the final Doha declaration or risk having their request refused.
The gains were therefore minimal, and were used by the countries of the West, which are united in their desire to launch a new round, as a means of buying what they wanted.
In reality, what happened at Doha was more like a cynical play at the theatre. We are becoming increasingly committed to unbridled liberalisation and, as we shall continue to insist, a fundamental reform of the WTO really is essential.
Madam President, Mr Lamy, Mr Fischler, I should like to say, first of all, that I am delighted by the success of the Doha ministerial conference, not only from the point of view of its results, but also from a material point of view.
It took place in excellent conditions, despite all the fears that we may have had.
Holding this event in Qatar was in itself a response to the war against terrorism that we entered into following the tragic events of 11 September.
Like other Members who took part in that conference, I appreciated the constant transparency that prevailed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament during the negotiations.
That transparency was also the order of the day among the NGOs present at Doha, who are to be congratulated on the efforts that they have made in this direction since the previous conference in Seattle.
We all hoped that this conference would lead to a substantial agreement that would pave the way for growth to be stimulated, thereby contributing towards economic development at a time when the international community is going through a very difficult situation.
This ministerial conference certainly enabled considerable progress to be made on various fronts, including the inclusion of China and Taiwan.
Another positive result, as has already been mentioned, was in connection with medicines.
As for the rest, the Commission took a tough stance in the negotiations, and the efforts that it made during the final night and on the morning of 14 November enabled the European Union to convince its partners that its positions were well-founded.
However, the work programme is still lagging behind the ambitions that we had set ourselves on certain major issues, such as the environment, the Singapore agenda and social standards.
For my part, I should like to make three comments.
During the conference, the developing countries often adopted a highly critical attitude towards the European Union.
When we were preparing for this ministerial conference, did we listen carefully enough to their concerns?
Let us show humility, let us take up our pilgrim' s staff again, let us listen to them and try to understand them, so that we can take their real concerns into consideration, and above all let us stop taking their place in defining the development policy that they need.
Secondly, the Doha ministerial declaration constitutes an undertaking to start negotiations on the priority issues of European enlargement and integration.
Finally, now that the real negotiations are about to start, I hope that the transparency that has prevailed so far will continue to do so, and that it will be strengthened still further between us.
I have just one question to ask the Commissioner. What will be the general structure of the negotiations which will be defined?
Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the European Parliament delegation attending the Doha Conference, I too would like to congratulate our Commissioners on the excellent work that they accomplished and the results that they obtained, which were undeniably very positive and which bear witness to the highly effective way in which our Commissioners handled these negotiations.
I should also, above all, like to say how pleased I was with the excellent cohesion and solidarity between our three institutions which were represented in Qatar.
Basically, and restricting my comments solely to the agricultural issues, I was interested to discover that the European Union has given itself the room to manoeuvre that is needed to reform its common agricultural policy in response to the new expectations of our society, because non-trade considerations were explicitly mentioned in the final ministerial declaration.
It seems to me that this aspect is the vital element in the outcome of Doha.
The priority for European farming today should no longer be to remain competitive in exports at any cost. It should be to satisfy social demand as regards food security and the sustainable rural development.
The Union can also take advantage of a success that it has achieved with regard to the United States, because all forms of aid to exports will be subject to negotiation in the new round.
Finally, it seems to me that the Union can congratulate itself on the fact that special and differential treatment for developing countries has been strengthened.
That should enable them to respond to their needs, including those needs relating to food security and rural development.
This prospect, in its turn, is more likely to encourage the development of farming for food production, and is therefore very important from the point of view of the world demand for food, which is expected to double in the next twenty-five years owing to the increase in the populations of the developing countries and the improvement in living conditions in the emerging countries.
In all, I believe this agreement represents a good balance between trade liberalisation and regulation, and also between trade and the development of all types of farming.
I just hope that the negotiations in the new round will fulfil the hopes that have now been raised.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is too early to say who won or lost at Doha in terms of the agricultural COM, since the only issue there was agreement on an agenda and a timetable of negotiations.
The winners for now were the developing countries, whose principal demands, including the demands of the ACP countries, were accepted in the text.
The countries of the Cairns group and the United States saw enshrined in the text the principle of ongoing agricultural reform, improved market access and the gradual elimination of export subsidies.
The European Union succeeded in ensuring that this reduction in export subsidies would not be automatic and had some of its main demands in terms of reinforcing the non-commercial elements of the agreement included in the text.
Despite the relative optimism of the Community negotiators, the agreement did not include some of our fundamental demands.
Multi-functional agriculture was not expressly referred to in the text and the strengthening of measures for the protection of geographic indicators was only defined clearly for wines.
Furthermore, one thing was made crystal clear: the elimination, even the gradual elimination, of export incentives, will create strong pressure to reduce agricultural prices internally.
It will therefore not be difficult to conclude that the next reform of the CAP, before 2006, will have to be more thorough than may have been hoped.
Not just because of the cut in the guaranteed prices it will involve, but also and especially because of the qualitative change in the instruments of support for farmers so that, even without market support, they continue to have an income safety net.
Doha was merely a starting point and much has still been left open.
But let there be no illusions.
Today, our commercial adversaries are fighting for an end to the supposedly more distorting support of international competition, but tomorrow they will want to impose an end to all types of agricultural subsidies, that is, the old story of the rings, the fingers and then the rest.
It would not be fair to end without paying special tribute to our Commissioners for the courage and firmness they showed in these negotiations.
Madam President, Commissioners, I will avoid polite flowery phrases, for you cannot talk up the outcome of Doha in such a way as to paper over the absence of any social component in world trade - at least from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
It is not only that that is regrettable; we must not overlook the minimal acceptance of environmental and food safety, and the failure to accept the demand for clarification of the precautionary principle.
