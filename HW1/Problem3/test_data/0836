In my opinion, the debate or discussion about these directives and regulations has been a good example of how together we can get to grips with a complicated issue at least enough to know where we concur and where our views differ.
Incidentally, I should like to recall that at the end of the eighties, when the Commission published its White Paper on the internal market, energy was not even mentioned, which shows that we are dealing with an extremely complicated matter here.
At the time there were many who said, hands off, that is far too complicated, we in the electricity and gas industry understand this much better, let us deal with it.
We chose another route and I believe that competition is indeed the right way forward.
I am also in favour of our establishing unrestricted competition.
Incidentally, if we did not do this, in the end the European Court of Justice would probably force us to change the way we do certain things, for example to recognise that the customer is the domestic customer and not a customer defined by us.
You see the Treaty always carries more weight than any Parliament resolution.
I should, however, also like to advocate that we not only deregulate, but also regulate.
What we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation, if I am allowed to say that.
But that is precisely what it is.
We are not only opening up the market in gas and electricity, we are also setting the conditions - the environmental and social conditions - under which this will take place, or we are leaving it up to the Member States to do so by enacting their own regulations.
I believe that these are two sides of the same coin.
This is perhaps where we differ, Mr van Velzen, in our assessment of these directives.
Neither do I regard this as complicating the process; I think it is part of it.
We need a market and we need regulated competition, but energy is also something to which the public has a right.
Security of supply must be established and the environmental conditions must be set.
This is an integral part of this directive.
The opening up of the energy markets is also a fundamental prerequisite for the functioning of the Kyoto Protocol.
Without competition and without an open market, we will not be able to have emissions trading in Europe.
This is part of the Kyoto Protocol, which, after all, almost all of us wish to ratify.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the Member States have decided to create a large market for electricity and gas.
It is a good choice, but the problem lies in a single question: 'How are we going to create this market?'
The aim of the Commission's new directive is regulated competition.
The main assessment criterion we should use is whether or not there is a balance between competition and regulation, that is, whether or not the fundamental rights to a public service, environmental quality and security of supply are taken into consideration.
The goals of many of my fellow Members in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy remain within the proposals made by the Commission.
Their sole objective is to speed up liberalisation and create a level playing field.
Others have tried to pave the way for a regulation of general interest.
Claude Turmes and Bernhard Rapkay have carried out significant work to this end.
At the end of the day, however, there is an imbalance between the choice of effective competition and the requirements of society.
This imbalance is unacceptable.
That is the raison d'Ãªtre of our strategic Amendment No 177 which aims to oblige the Member States to fulfil both their obligations regarding competition and increased, more effective obligations of general interest.
We do not agree with the attitude of the French State which opposes the opening up of its domestic market while the French public operator is buying market shares elsewhere.
However, the compromise it is asking for today, which consists of establishing freedom for non-domestic customers to choose their supplier, while being able to retain a reserved sector for domestic customers, is a good one, in particular if this means equal tariffs throughout national territory.
Those in favour of the market have not presented any economic argument to justify the obligation to open the market to small customers at all costs, even though this could result in additional inconvenience and cost rather than freedom.
Common sense would dictate that a principle of diversity be respected.
With regard to the obligation on competition, strong pressure is being exerted in countries like France or Germany, where the traditional operators are powerful and well-established.
The requirement for transparency is justified, as is the requirement to set up an independent regulatory body.
However, ownership unbundling, or the separation of transport and distribution, amongst others, threatens to destroy effective groups.
Making room for new players in the renewable energies market is justified.
Attacking the nuclear industry and the national assets of our neighbours is not.
I also find it shocking that certain advocates of competition are opposed to Community legislation in the field of market access.
The TPA negotiated actually represents the closure of the German market.
Others are demanding reciprocal market access, even though this contradicts the very notion of the large market and stirs up ill-feeling.
On the contrary, we believe that the European Union, that is to say the Commission, the Council, Parliament, organised European civil society, must take on tasks of general interest and regulation duties.
Otherwise simple competition would be dogged by increasing national conflict.
Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for their tremendous work on this very important piece of legislation.
Completion of the internal market in electricity and gas is something which will impact on each and every one of the 370 million consumers right across the European Union.
As co-legislators in this area, we have a great responsibility to get things right and to ensure that the end result is one which brings about a fair deal for all.
From an Irish perspective, I can inform colleagues that work is well under way to achieve this aim.
Formal opening of the Irish electricity market has exceeded the requirements of Directive 96/62/EC.
In fact, the Irish national authorities are already putting in place a model of market opening which has much to recommend it, separating as it does operation from ownership of the assets.
This model effectively separates ownership interests from planning decisions, which helps overall efficiency.
It may not be the model which suits every Member State, but it has clear advantages in a small state where certain economies of scale are required in order to deliver the lowest cost and the most efficient production to end-users.
In conclusion, I believe that efficient, cheap and sustainable energy production is a key element in achieving our goal.
The rapporteurs in the committee have done us proud in dealing with this complex and technical issue in a comprehensive and balanced manner and in working to a very demanding timetable in order to complete this very important dossier.
Mr President, Commissioner, the good work carried out by the rapporteurs should enable Parliament to adopt a favourable position on the laborious attempt to achieve full liberalisation of the energy market in Europe, in the interest of businesses and consumers.
In the very brief amount of time available to me, I would like to confirm our support for the more stringent measures proposed by the Commission - Article 86 of the Treaty - and push for a majority vote.
There are countries such as France, which have a genuine conflict of interests in this sector.
The French Government owns EDF so it has every reason to want to maintain the asymmetries in the market which allow EDF to go and take over market segments elsewhere, exploiting its monopoly position and the closed nature of the internal market.
That is why I feel that we must go all the way and push for a majority vote at Barcelona too.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, first may I express my regret at the delays in working on this portfolio last year because the Commission declined to accept our advice of splitting the proposals into two separate proposals for gas and electricity.
I also regret that the timetable has now been compressed from May to March because of the Council's desire to have this proposal before it at Barcelona.
I hope this will not be a case of 'legislate in haste and repent at leisure'.
We strongly support the aims of the directive and the regulation.
The present situation is a flawed and inequitable market.
French and German utilities are able to buy UK power companies, yet it is impossible to have reciprocal opportunities to buy into EDF or acquire whole companies.
The German market is almost as difficult to enter, despite so-called full competition.
This must change.
I recognise that the step-by-step approach is a realistic one: first all non-domestic consumers then domestic later, as a progressive opening, is a more orderly process.
I have to regret that one rapporteur has chosen to introduce too much detail in amendments and tried to over-elaborate some of the measures, for example, the question of the detail demanded on energy bills.
This is an unnecessary amount of detail.
Finally, I would like to commend the proposed amendments on establishing a committee of European energy regulators so as to improve cooperation and coordination in implementing the regulation on cross-border trading.
Mr President, my thanks go to the rapporteurs: you have completed an enormous task.
Although the Union was established as a single market, this market only functions in part.
Many Member States have actually become expert at protecting their markets, monopolies and cartels.
The Nordic countries have liberalised both the electricity and the telecommunications markets, and the consumer has benefited: prices are low.
The large Member States, in particular, often pay little heed to jointly agreed rules, and the insistence on unanimity with regard to decisions is a shield behind which they withdraw.
As the Commission has neither the authority nor the courage to intervene when there is malpractice, the market does not work.
The situation harms solidarity and must end.
Some, then, are for liberalisation while others are for maintaining the status quo.
It is true we might ask whether market liberalism is justified from the point of view of public service obligations.
However, we need common rules, which should also be monitored.
The same lack of solidarity has prevailed in the telecommunications sector.
Cross-border transmission tariffs and overload control are important matters.
Only actual costs should apply for access to the network, and then competition is possible and the consumer benefits.
My group is satisfied with the basic approach outlined in Mr Mombaur's report.
Nevertheless, the Commission's scope for monitoring is not made sufficiently clear, and this awkward and unfair situation is likely to continue.
We clearly highlighted this in the end in the framework legislation for the telecommunications sector, and it will benefit consumers in Europe.
The Union must therefore be reformed in such a way that Member States cannot at the same time both prevent competition and muscle in on the situation in other countries, buying up local energy companies.
Commissioner, I should like to bring three points to your attention.
Firstly, electricity and gas are two different products.
By lumping them together in one report, an artificial attempt is made to treat them in the same way, and the specific differences between these products are not sufficiently emphasised.
Secondly, it is vital for long-term contracts for gas transport to be safeguarded, given the increase in demand for gas, partly as a result of the planned closure of nuclear plants, and given that important investments, for example in piping, which are indispensable to the EU's gas supply, are necessary.
The gas supply is literally at stake here.
Thirdly, the legislation put to the vote is diametrically opposed to the wish by industry to cut down on red-tape.
Too many new obligations are being imposed.
Second reading might provide an opportunity to change this.
Mr President, underlying this report is the decision to liberalise the internal energy market through the privatisation of the public electricity and gas sectors that still exist in the European Union.
Failing to heed negative experiences of similar processes, as in the case of California, for example, the report insists on the need to open up and liberalise these strategic sectors, and to make them more competitive in order to satisfy the interests of various economic groups, even with the knowledge that they are thereby endangering fundamental aspects of a universal public service: the right to the supply of high-quality energy at a reasonable price and the commitment to develop alternative and renewable forms of energy.
Although these reports express some concern about universal access, minimum environmental rules, information and guaranteeing consumer choice and security of supply in every country, the fact is that taking the route towards the liberalisation and total opening up of the market will undermine these concerns.
Consequently, we have, of course, voted against the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as March 2000 the Lisbon Council advocated liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors.
The Commission tabled a comprehensive proposal to make this desire a reality.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy enriched this proposal by including other relevant points, stressing the need for greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy and the right of all suppliers to have unrestricted access to the network.
The Committee also beefs up the role of the independent regulatory authorities and counters possible distortions of competition with provisions on ownership unbundling.
I am in favour of these measures.
I should particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 43 to the report.
Here electricity providers are required to disclose to the final consumer the composition of the energy mix supplied in the bill and in advertising materials.
This minimum information makes an essential contribution to creating transparency and provides a basis on which consumers can exercise their necessary freedom of choice in the completed internal market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe, we have been working on the liberalisation of the energy market for some 15 years now.
And directives in this respect were adopted as early as 1994 and 1995, but there are still Member States that keep their markets sealed from new suppliers, France naturally taking the crown, despite the fact that the Sun King has been long dead and buried.
Transparent and non-discriminatory access to networks is necessary to break monopolies.
In order to achieve this, it is sometimes necessary to take measures that do not appear liberal, such as prescribing fixed rates for transmissions for all users and producers, for this is absolutely vital to grant newcomers access to the market.
I therefore hope that the Council in Barcelona will at long last take decisive action and will take liberalisation seriously, for it already agreed in Lisbon that Europe should become the world's most dynamic, competitive and knowledge-based economy.
In order for this to happen, the liberalisation of energy is vital.
Mr President, today we have to vote on speeding up the liberalisation of the energy sector.
Following in the footsteps of air transport, telecommunications, rail transport and postal services, it is now the turn of the energy sector to suffer market dictatorship in the form of total openness to competition, in 2003 for electricity and 2004 for gas.
All things considered, however, we cannot say that the opening up of public enterprise capital has been conclusive.
The anticipated increase in productivity did not take place.
For the user, the dismantling of public services has led to reduced security and quality of service and prices have risen by 30% for gas and 5% for electricity.
As far as the workers are concerned, we have seen significant job losses: 300 000 have already been lost in this sector in Europe.
The public have experienced increased inequality.
Only a handful of shareholders and investors have benefited from deregulation.
Today, however, we must promote a new energy policy; now, more than ever before, we must coordinate public services at European level.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, liberalisation must bring benefits.
I was pleased to see that the rapporteurs identified this as a key point.
In our view, it is important that the benefits are not offset by new taxes and that we create a system which guarantees a sustainable and secure energy supply, in terms of both the environment and business management.
Just as I will decide this lunchtime whether to eat a schnitzel or a salad, thus determining the energy supply for my personal energy balance, in the future I also want to take advantage of the free movement of goods to be able to decide whether to have solar power or hydroelectric power.
But perhaps it will not only be a choice between one or the other; it would be nice if I could say, in the future I want to be able to use 50% solar power and 50% hydroelectric power in my private house or in my company.
Here I attach the utmost importance to there being no cross-subsidisation.
In particular, for instance, we do not want the final disposal of nuclear waste to be cross-subsidised from other sectors.
We also want a universal service and compliance with public service and environmental obligations; this will of course be achieved through public calls for tender, so that good service is guaranteed and efficiency is central.
An external certified body should be responsible for assessing quality in the electricity sector.
In the future, you see, we also want renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy-saving measures to be focal points.
In the future, there must not be any discrimination in the network price on the basis of quantity of electricity or method of generation.
Nor should cross-subsidisation of any kind be admissible.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are going to vote on three reports by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which are crucial to the forthcoming Barcelona Summit.
They are essential to compliance with the Lisbon objectives if we really want to build the most competitive economy in the world, and they are also essential to the liberalisation of the internal market.
To sum up, they are of benefit to the consumers.
It has been a complex subject. We have had to separate two directives - the one on gas and the one on electricity - and we have had to do a lot of work very quickly.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkay and Mr Mombaur, because they have done a lot of very good work and have done so in record time.
Because of the complexity of the subject, there have been attempts to postpone the vote which is going to take place tomorrow.
As Chairman, I have done everything in my power so that we may vote on them before Barcelona.
The credibility of the European Parliament was at stake and we did not want the European Parliament to be an easy pretext for possible failure.
It is a crucial test for Barcelona and the European Parliament has been a match for the circumstances.
Of course, we agree with the Members - in particular the French - on the desire to combine liberalisation with the need to maintain an efficient public service and I believe that all our work must follow that approach.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not sufficient to privatise or liberalise unless we prevent possible dominant positions which significantly distort competition.
If public monopolies are turned into private oligopolies, we will have achieved little.
Therefore, it is essential not only to legally separate transmission from transport, but furthermore to make each one totally independent.
That is the aim of my amendment.
Mr President, the purpose of the amendments under consideration is to liberalise the market across the board, including distribution, including down to the final user.
The stated aim is to encourage business activities in a sector which until recently, because it was under state control, was closed to the private sector.
The transmission systems are, to all intents and purposes, administered by government agencies which only have to break even, while the private companies which use them will pitch their prices so that they can reap the maximum possible profit.
This is just one example of the favours being done to the private sector. In Greece, the Public Power Corporation is forced to buy electricity at a loss from private companies, just so that they can enter the market.
Liberalisation ignores social requirements, such as supplying electricity to islands and other inaccessible areas, and is causing obvious difficulties with long-term planning.
The argument that prices are falling does not stand up, given that the fully liberalised markets in Germany and the United Kingdom charge consistently higher prices than the partially liberalised Greek market.
The fact that the amendments increase the intervention of the European Commission is also a very serious matter.
To sum up, the only ones who stand to gain from the new arrangements are the large monopolies, which will penetrate the markets still further, with the help of the regulation on cross-border transactions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that mention must be made of the good work carried out in preparation for this debate, especially in view of the decisions to be taken later on by the Council and the Commission, as well as Parliament's future input.
We have witnessed the shattering of an illusion: the State, which, motivated by social ideals, should have achieved adequate regulation of basic services, has almost completely failed in its duty.
The ideals of fairness, asceticism and non-profit making have fallen, unable to contend with such a weak market: this has led to abuse, an increase in wastage, privileges, bureaucracy and inequality and, at the same time, falling profits.
As a result, we are turning back rapidly - it is to be hoped - to competition, to the market, to the prevailing interest of the consumer and also to the profit-making of private enterprise, which is no longer seen as a negative thing.
Of course, some last strongholds remain: monopolies, oligopolies, dominating positions - as the previous speaker mentioned - and also the market, which has been controlled to a great extent by cartels on many occasions and continues to be so now.
There are examples of this in Italy: we have two great structures, excessive, unjustified strongholds - ENEL and ENI - which have played a highly egotistical and, in some cases, parasitical role.
We need to take appropriate action, not least to establish a direct relationship as regards both energy supply and the management thereof, with monitoring of transfers and measures and of the effectiveness of the product sold.
I feel that this should be the subject of forthcoming European Union action.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the energy sector is not like other sectors, and that is why the discussion cannot be restricted to the question of opening up to competition and the associated timetable.
Security of supply, territorial cohesion, network and interconnection development, plant renovation and public service obligations are all essential aspects that involve long-term investment without immediate profitability but which must be guaranteed, if we are to avoid replicating the California crisis.
This sector must therefore be closely monitored and a balance maintained between market mechanisms and other imperatives and factors in market organisation.
Some Members here advocate opening up to competition.
However, when we look at the situation in the various countries, we see that the legislative framework is one thing and the reality of opening is another.
Germany, for example, is in theory 100% open, but less than 3% of its electricity is imported.
Perhaps it would be better to allow for opening to take place more slowly in order to be able to fulfil our commitments.
From this perspective, the date of 1 January 2003 put forward by the Commission for opening with regard to all non-domestic customers is unrealistic and does not even allow time for countries to adopt transposing legislation, where necessary.
That is why the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has suggested a period of 24 months after adoption of the directive.
In addition to this, along the lines of Amendment No 177 which Mr Herzog has already mentioned, we have asked that the other factors in the organisation of the sector, public service obligation, security of supply, promotion of renewable energy sources, safety of installations and environmental protection be guaranteed operational at the time of opening.
Lastly, with regard to domestic customers, households, we must take account of the fact that in some countries, equal tariffs are a key element of public services.
Whether the customer lives in the country, in an isolated valley or in a town, they are charged the same price per kW/hour.
This is considered part of equal access to public services.
That is why we propose that those Member States who so wish be allowed to retain a sector which is not open to competition so that equal tariffs remain possible and equal access to public energy services continues to be a reality in our countries.
I hope that the Council will take this into consideration.
Mr President, a French-owned company is able to sell electricity to the British Prime Minister.
I would like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a situation when an English-owned company will be able to sell electricity to the French Prime Minister.
Until that situation is reached, the idea of an internal market in energy is a political mirage.
There has been a lot of comment about the pressure under which this debate is taking place.
When the Commission's proposals first came out, it was the view of the British Government that they could be accepted as they stood.
We have managed to bring in hundreds of amendments, which says a lot for the fertile imagination of Parliament.
We make a bit of a rod for our own backs at times.
By trying to bring in issues such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and social issues we complicate the matter further, these are better left for other types of legislation.
I should like to make two points.
On independent regulation, we regard this as essential if an internal market is to develop, because it provides the predictability and stability which consumers and new entrants need; but it should be for the Member State to reflect the different structures of national markets.
On the question of third-party access to infrastructure, market entrants need to know that they can access infrastructure on the same terms as those that already exist.
And they should be approved by the national regulator, rather than be the subject of one-sided negotiations between a monopoly infrastructure operator and a potential user.
Mr President, reading the newspapers one would think that the European Council in Barcelona is going to settle every detail of this legislation.
The press suggests that Barcelona will determine whether energy liberalisation takes place at all or not, and yet I do not see Mr Blair, Mr Aznar or other prime ministers here.
This is an important point: the liberalisation of the energy sector, one of the last components of the single market yet to be subject to single-market disciplines, is a legislative process.
We must assert our fundamental role in that legislative process.
This legislation will go through to second reading well after the political pyrotechnics of Barcelona are long forgotten.
It is essential, therefore, that at first reading we establish the principles of the legislation so that at second reading we can indeed push through a proper liberalising energy package.
Mr Chichester referred earlier to the need to get the details right.
He is absolutely correct.
In that spirit I have two specific questions for the EPP-ED Group, which has been keen to promote itself as the liberal voice on this issue and yet, I fear, may be voting quite differently tomorrow.
Firstly, will the EPP-ED Group support the amendment adopted in committee to make sure that nuclear decommissioning funds cannot be used as a cross-subsidy for electricity operators?
If not, it should explain why not, because of the risk of destroying the level playing field.
Secondly, will it withdraw its own amendments, passed in committee, which insist on negotiated access?
If those amendments are retained the package will be severely undermined.
I look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow.
This has been an excellent cross-party endeavour and on behalf of the ELDR Group I wholeheartedly support the result.
Mr President, as usual, very sincerely meant congratulations to the three rapporteurs involved in this package.
Liberalisation of gas and electricity is certainly part of the Lisbon Process, but this does not mean a free-for-all in the electricity and gas markets.
Our concern must be for those we represent: customers both commercial and - the majority of us - domestic.
We want the lowest prices possible for them in line with choice, and for choice you need information, including labelling about the source of electricity.
You need reliability and no discrimination; you need help, particularly at domestic level, for energy efficiency measures; and you need strong emphasis on public service obligations.
And I would like to emphasise that research and development should be a public service obligation, because in a free market research is one of the areas that is most at risk.
We have amendments on subjects such as renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and combined heat and power.
This is relevant.
We must have joined-up thinking, and there must be references in this directive to those areas which may be covered by other directives but which must also be mentioned here.
We want joined-up thinking, and we expect confirmation from the Commission that those measures, as important as these directives, will be part of the programme in the immediate future.
We hope, therefore, for some limited success at Barcelona to take forward in a responsible way not a free-for-all, but a controlled competitive market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say that I believe that the full realisation of the internal energy market is the most important economic measure to be dealt with at the Barcelona European Council.
Therefore the vote on these reports in Parliament seems to me to be extremely timely and I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, for the efforts he has made to make this possible.
Secondly, I would like to point out our intended objectives with these reports.
As Mr Linkohr has said quite rightly, this is something which may sound rather contradictory: a regulated deregulation, a regulated liberalisation, which is largely what makes up the European liberalisation model.
This objective is based on providing the European economy with all the elements of a market, while guaranteeing our citizens a series of rights which we consider to be basic within the model of society, the balances, solidarities and cohesion we want to create.
It is therefore a question of offering freedom of choice to industrial and commercial clients on specific dates, namely 2003 and 2004, respectively, for electricity and for gas and, for domestic users, from 2005.
Consumers and producers must be able to access transport and distribution networks without discrimination and, to this end, the proposal provides for systems of transport and distribution which are separate - from a legal point of view - from the production and supply of gas and electricity.
Charges for access to the network which are set, published and approved by the competent national regulatory authority.
Each of the States of the Union will create an independent regulatory authority with a common minimum level of competences.
The proposed regulation on the conditions for access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity is intended to promote cross-border trade and overcome an unacceptable situation, as indicated by several speakers and the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, which is that there are 15 different electricity markets.
Therefore, it is a question of achieving the true objective of this proposal which, as pointed out by Mr Rapkay, is simply a European electricity and gas market.
There is another series of necessary measures created specifically in response to the requests of the Stockholm European Council.
Amongst them, the first report on the creation of the internal market in gas and electricity which clearly indicated the distortions caused by the differing degrees of openness and the differences between the structural measures adopted.
In December 2001, the Commission also published a Communication on energy infrastructures which identifies the priority proposals and intends for the Member States to achieve an electrical interconnection equivalent to the minimum between now and 2005, that is to say, 10% of the capacity of installed production.
With the aim of guaranteeing greater protection of the environment, the Commission will present two additional directives during this year and, in this respect, I would say to Mrs McNally that, before the end of the year, I hope to present a directive on behalf of the Commission intended to promote cogeneration and at the same time prevent certain fraudulent uses which we all know about and which in the end lead to greater expense and wastage of electricity.
As I have said, this directive will promote suitable cogeneration within the European Union.
Secondly, I also wish to present a framework directive on the energy efficiency of equipment and apparatus installed in all buildings, which supplements the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings.
Mr President, I believe that, together with the directive on the promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, the proposal on energy efficiency in buildings, the political commitment to guarantee the environmental aspects of our energy consumption, and the proposal on biofuels, we are making a real effort to combine the rules for the creation of the internal markets in energy and to improve their operation with the improvement in energy efficiency and the environmental aspects of energy in Europe.
With regard to the directive and the Regulation we have presented, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay on their work as rapporteurs, which has been carried out rigorously and seriously, although we cannot accept certain specific aspects of certain amendments.
However, in general we all agree with the spirit and objectives in terms of making these modifications to the current directives in force.
I am pleased that Parliament - and specifically the two rapporteurs - is taking the approach contained in the Commission proposal, particularly with regard to the dates for opening up the market, the separation of the operators of the networks and the competences of the regulatory authorities, which are crucial elements in terms of the correct operation of the system.
In general terms, the Commission is in favour of the amendments that have been tabled, the majority of which are acceptable, either totally - with some changes to their wording - or partially.
I am not only talking about the amendments which improve the situation of consumers and the amendments relating to a better definition of the public service aspects (always taking account of subsidiarity aspects, of course), but also the amendments which formalise cooperation between regulatory bodies and those relating to the competences of the regulatory authorities.
The Commission, however, has certain reservations with regard to the amendments relating to non-discriminatory access to the network, which is essential to guaranteeing fair competition in the gas and electricity sectors.
We therefore propose certain measures in this context: to legally separate the operators of the networks - an approach accepted by Parliament - and to establish access to the network on the basis of previously published charges, thereby replacing access on a negotiated basis.
I would like to thank Mr van Velzen who is going to withdraw the amendments relating to negotiated access, because I believe that is going to clarify the debate a lot and help us to reach a final agreement.
Nor can the Commission accept the amendment dividing the proposal into two different texts for electricity and gas, bearing in mind the growing interdependence between the two markets and the fact that the majority of new electricity production will be based on production which uses gas as a fuel.
The Commission believes that the amendment relating to the funds for dismantling the nuclear sector is of the greatest importance. The Commission is aware of the importance of guaranteeing availability of the funds at all times for future dismantling activities, not only for the purposes of the internal energy market, but also to ensure that those funds are specifically destined for those activities.
These funds have a specific and perfectly stipulated objective, which must be respected at all costs.
Therefore, and with a view to dealing with this issue appropriately, the Commission is committed to presenting a proposal in the coming months, before the conclusion of the negotiation of this directive and this Regulation in Parliament.
This issue is closely related to the system of guarantees and securities in the field of the use and handling of nuclear energy.
We must be extremely rigorous in terms of the availability of these funds, within the corresponding framework, and we are studying the best legal formula for producing a proposal in this regard.
With regard to the Regulation, I would like to congratulate Mr Mombaur on his wonderful work.
The Commission can support the majority of the amendments proposed, some with slight modifications.
This is the case, for example, with the amendments which propose the creation of a consultative group of national regulatory authorities, and those which propose the establishment of specific rules for the so-called national interconnectors.
Next I will mention the amendments which we find difficult to accept.
Amendment No 19, for example, which proposes that the procedure of the Regulation Committee laid down in the Regulation should only be applicable for four years and that, after this period, Parliament and the Council should once again study the issue on the basis of the Commission proposal.
I know that Parliament has considered this distinction clause in the context of the regulations on financial services and of the Lamfalussy report, but President Prodi, on 5 February, in his statement to this House, clearly said that that case could not set a precedent.
Nevertheless, I can assure you that, in accordance with the agreement of the European Parliament and the Commission on the methods for applying comitology, the Commission will put all its efforts into ensuring the greatest possible transparency in it relations with Parliament in the context of the procedure laid down in the Regulation on access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity.
Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 16, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 25 seek to remove all the references in the Regulation to the regulatory authorities of the Member States, and suggest a more neutral expression such as 'competent authority'.
I do not believe these amendments to be appropriate since the Commission's policy in this field is based on the principle that all States must designate one or several regulatory authorities, which are intended to play an essential role in the context of the implementation of the Regulation.
Furthermore, accepting these amendments could be considered to be in contradiction with the creation of a consultative body made up of national regulatory authorities proposed in a series of amendments by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and supported by the Commission.
However, the formula proposed by the Commission leaves an appropriate margin for subsidiarity so that each State can find the most suitable formula.
The amendments relating to the treatment to be given to integrated generation in national charging systems are not acceptable either.
This type of generation must be dealt with appropriately within the national charging systems, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and reflecting costs which appear in the Regulation, and, with regard to the most important case in practice, the electricity produced from renewable energy sources, and with the directive on it.
It is not therefore appropriate to exempt integrated generators from the payment of certain charges in a general way, rather than by case-by-case treatment.
There are three amendments which propose that the text of the regulation should stipulate that the harmonisation of charges for access to national networks must be limited to the charges applicable to producers and that those charges must be reduced.
However, this is an overly restrictive provision.
National charges should be harmonised on the global basis of the charging structure, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of the national networks.
We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.
We do not believe it appropriate to link the entry into force of the Regulation with that of the directive too strictly, as suggested in Amendment No 35.
The promotion of cross-border trade is necessary in any event, regardless of the adoption of proposed amendments to the directive on electricity and gas currently in force.
In conclusion, Mr President, the vote on these texts is of the greatest importance.
Thanks to the support for the main approaches and the broad convergence between Parliament and the Commission on all the measures, I hope that the negotiations in Barcelona will give us new impetus and that then, as Mr Adam indicated earlier, the negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission will give full and total support to this regulated liberalisation in the electricity and gas sector, key elements for the creation of the internal market and therefore for the competitiveness of the European economy.
Mr President, on a point of order, as one of the rapporteurs in the debate we have just had, I would like to say that the conditions in which this debate was held are ridiculous.
When I started to speak, just three Members were in the Chamber and the Commissioner had not had the time to join us because this House is unable to set a clear time for the start of the debate.
As the rapporteur I had just two-and-a-half minutes and my colleague, Mr Rapkay, also had two-and-a-half minutes, to explain a directive on the European market for electricity and gas.
Now when we listen to the Commissioner's answers there is so much noise that it is almost impossible to hear her.
Mr President, please organise the proceedings in such a way that we have dignity when we discuss this.
On the question which you raise about the organisation of debates, we have had an extensive, informal discussion in the Conference of Presidents about trying to create more space for debate.
This has to do with our voting procedures and so on. We will eventually also have the report by Mr Corbett, which will help in this regard.
It is a priority to create more space for debate, I hope in the not too distant future.
I can only say that I agree fully with the point you make about the dignity of the House.
Whenever I have been in the Chair I have tried, to the best of my ability, to insist that the House listen to speakers in a dignified fashion appropriate to Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon today.
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
Proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights; Justice and Home Affairs, for a Council regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters (15532/2001 - C5-0021/0109 (CNS))
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal as amended)
Report (A5-0034/2002) by EncarnaciÃ³n Redondo JimÃ©nez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on
the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution (COM(2001) 634 - C5-0551/2001 - 2001/0267(COD))
and
the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on the protection of the Community's forests against fire (COM(2001) 634 - C5-0552/2001 - 2001/0268(COD))
(In successive votes Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0052/2002) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents (10794/1/2001 - C5-0641/2001 - 2000/0145(COD))
(The President declared the common position approved)
Report (A5-0070/2002) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the application of international accounting standards (COM(2001) 80 - C5-0061/2001 - 2001/0044(COD))
Before the vote:
Mr President, if the House follows my recommendation - which I hope it will - this will achieve an outcome that was agreed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and can be accepted by the Commission and the Council.
The pattern of the voting list is slightly convoluted because the text is complicated and what is proposed deals with drafting points.
I have endeavoured to be open about this and I know that the Socialist Group has had concerns.
This morning I spoke with Mr Berenguer, the shadow rapporteur, who I believe can now confirm that he is content with what I am suggesting, i.e. that we should vote against the second half of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6.
If my suggestion is followed, it should lead to the adoption of this important text in a single reading.
Mr President, I would like to confirm what Lord Inglewood said: the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote against the second part of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6.
I believe that this would increase the coherence of the text.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Lord Inglewood on his excellent work.
Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment: I propose to replace the clause 'the European Data Protection Supervisor is bound by the objective of Regulation No 1049? with the clause 'the European Data Protection Supervisor is bound by Community law, including Regulation 1049?, and to replace the clause 'and by the provisions of the Treaty stating that decision-making in the Union shall be as open as possible? with 'and by the provisions of the Treaty relating to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms and stating that decision-making in the Union shall be as open as possible?.
I hope there are no objections to this.
Mr President, I propose that the vote on the legislative resolution be postponed.
This is a decision covered by an interinstitutional agreement: Parliament, Commission and Council must all agree on it.
Now, the text to be put to the vote today is different from that proposed by the Commission and, as far as I know, endorsed by the Council. I therefore call for the vote on the legislative resolution to be postponed so that we can see if the other institutions can accept our point of view or, in any case, so that we can attempt to achieve a common position.
- (DA) We have voted against the report on the grounds that we are concerned here with a regulation and not a directive.
Because of national differences and the circumstances of individual nations, there is a need for flexibility, something which could better have been brought about by means of a directive.
Mr President, yesterday morning, during a television programme broadcast from Milan called 'Telelombardia', a pensioner, Lucia, telephoned me and told me that she had been robbed on her way back from withdrawing her pension, as she does at the end of every month, and that, because of what had happened to her, she did not know how she was going to survive the month.
You may ask me what the connection is with Mrs Paciotti's report on data protection.
Well then, reflecting on this matter, I said to myself, 'We must vote for the Paciotti report on data protection because data protection is extremely important, but when will we, at last, have protection of pensioners, especially poor pensioners who, when they go to withdraw their pensions, are the victims of delinquency and violence which, for them, are extremely harmful?
I hope that Mrs Paciotti will soon concern herself with pensioner protection as well as data protection.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for an ingenious method of introducing your favourite subject.
Report FÃ€rm (A5-0068/2002)
Mr President, there is always a great deal to say about the Commission's budget, as there is about Parliament and all the other institutions' budgets.
However, I will restrict myself to saying that, although I voted for the motion, I hope that the Commission will set money aside for informing all the workers who live in the European Union and the candidate countries about their pension rights.
In actual fact, a great many citizens are unfamiliar with the rules and laws of the State and do not know how to obtain all their rights.
Furthermore, I hope that we will soon have a European television channel broadcasting the work of Parliament including what happens in this Chamber during explanations of vote such as this.
I feel it would be extremely educational and very interesting.
Judging by the guidelines contained in the FÃ€rm report, it does not look as if the 2003 budget is going to be very different to preceding budgets, which means that, once again, we will have a disputed budget for the sake of the Stability Pact.
Despite the fact that year after year, new priorities give rise to greater needs, the policy that has been pursued consists of redistributing Community funds from old priorities to new ones and vice versa.
Consequently, we are seeking to enlarge the European Union to a further 10 countries with the same amount of money and, if possible, even making some savings, which is not acceptable.
The revision of the financial perspectives is absolutely essential to safeguarding the principle of economic and social cohesion, a genuinely distributive budget and the adequate financing of development and cooperation policy.
This year, the rapporteur has given priority to enlargement, but has become bogged down in administrative issues without questioning the very limited proposals presented by the Commission for financing enlargement, without guaranteeing the transfers of appropriations to prepare for accession in 2002 and 2003, insisting instead on the priority of financing the communitarisation of the third pillar - justice and home affairs - supporting an increase in appropriations for Europol, for Eurojust and for the external borders, but ignoring fundamental social areas, specifically employment and improving living conditions.
The rapporteur is concerned with budgetary implementation, specifically of the structural funds, but presents no solution, such as a clear commitment to making payments at levels that ensure proper implementation.
He does not mention the reform of the common fisheries policy, when 2003 will be its first year of implementation - hence the proposal that we tabled - and opens the way to the co-financing of the common agricultural policy.
He is vague on the financial needs of heading 4 - external policy - when the priorities are mounting up, in areas such as the Palestinian Territories, Timor, Afghanistan, Argentina, the Balkans, the Mediterranean and humanitarian aid, without any additional resources.
The rapporteur wavers between the redistribution of appropriations and their increase without ever being clear.
Hence our position against the report.
. (NL) The European Parliament is free to discuss anything, but a real parliament has the right of initiative and the last word in the forming of coalitions, in legislation and the budget.
In the EU, a distinction is drawn between compulsory and non-compulsory expenses, and the extensive agricultural budget falls outside the parliamentary remit.
Furthermore, by means of structural funds, money that originates from rich Member States is pumped back to the self-same rich States via the bureaucracy in Brussels.
The Council always reduces the level of the budget artificially.
Money for military ventures outside the EU territory and reparations for these wars in Serbia, Kosovo and Afghanistan is taken from previously committed funds.
Members of various EP groups are right to criticise this intransparent course of affairs in which the electorate has no say.
However, it is their colleagues in the Council and the Commission who are responsible for this crazy situation and who insist that everything stays exactly the same.
The Committee on Budgets is now looking for resources to absorb the effects of the expected doubling of the number of official languages at the lowest possible cost, among other means, by using remote interpreters who are also required to translate into languages other than their mother tongues.
Bad-quality translations and overburdened staff cannot solve this problem.
According to paragraph 15 of Mr Stenmarck's report, Parliament regrets that the dispersion of Parliament's staff in three working places remains a major obstacle for improving the allocation of human resources and points out, in particular, that the need to maintain a number of posts in Luxembourg leads to unnecessary duplication in a number of services.
Furthermore Parliament hopes, says the report, that the forthcoming enlargement will provide an opportunity to improve the allocation of posts between Brussels and Luxembourg.
What is the meaning of this?
This paragraph clearly seeks to undermine the Edinburgh Agreement on the location of the seats of the individual European institutions, which stated that the seat of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament was Luxembourg.
Parliament has no business, certainly not in a paragraph hidden away in a report on the budget, to call this decision into question either directly or indirectly.
The only authority on this matter is, and remains, the European Council and, as far as I know, it is still abiding by its 1992 decision.
. (FR) Since part of paragraph 15 has been retained, I voted for the Stenmarck report on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2003.
This paragraph, inserted in committee following an amendment by a British Conservative Member, is a challenge to the integrity and impartiality of the European public service and an attack on Luxembourg, the workplace of the European Parliament.
Those who show their aversion to the process of European integration should at least respect historical fact and the law as laid down by the Treaties.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.54 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the report (A5-0053/2002) by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community airports (COM(2001) 695 - C5-0667/2001 - 2001/0282(COD)).
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors in the gallery, we now turn to a Commission proposal to further reduce noise in and around airports.
This proposal implements an agreement which was adopted at the ICAO Assembly in the autumn of last year and which applies throughout the world.
Personally, of course, I have certain reservations about it because at the ICAO Assembly the entire system was changed.
They abandoned the system of taking certain types of aircraft out of use altogether or suspending their use and moved over to a so-called 'balanced approach', whereby, instead of the aircraft being assessed, the noise situation at each individual airport is assessed and suitable restrictions are introduced.
Apart from this general reservation - and after five years these provisions will be reviewed - we as a committee believe that we should implement the international agreements reached in Montreal, along with this approach of finding a balanced solution for each airport.
This kind of noise protection, which will vary from airport to airport, at the same time makes it possible for us to repeal the hushkit regulation.
We would have got into some difficulties with the USA and other third countries on account of this hushkit regulation, because from 1 April of this year the landing rights of these aircraft would automatically have been suspended.
Thanks to the new balanced approach, which we have had since Montreal, we can do without the hushkit regulation and thus end the conflict with the USA, but here I also want to say loud and clear that the Americans should not forget to withdraw their Article 84 complaints if we withdraw our hushkit regulation.
Because of the 1 April limit, we had to process the legislation quickly, and I have to say that our efforts have been very successful.
There were some initial difficulties determining responsibility for the dossier with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but we agreed that the Environment Committee would draft an opinion.
We incorporated this in our report and held an informal trilogue procedure with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, thus avoiding any dispute between the environment and transport areas in this House.
I should like to thank the Vice-President and also the Council representatives very much for enabling the informal trilogue to reach a satisfactory conclusion.
I should like to inform the House that there are two technical amendments which I will be tabling tomorrow, because in our haste we allowed two editorial errors to slip in.
There are discrepancies between what we agreed with the Council and what the amendments actually say.
But we will make the necessary corrections.
On the substance, I should like to point out that we in Parliament have been successful on two central points.
We have succeeded in changing the definition of the city airport.
Until now airports have only been classified as city airports if there has been another alternative airport nearby.
This has meant that there have been hardly any city airports.
We have extended this definition by leaving out the alternative airport requirement.
However, we did not get too carried away, so as to avoid a conflict with the Americans, and have said, city airports are airports as defined in Annex I. This can be amended by the Member States and the Commission in the committee procedure.
This gives us the possibility of introducing more stringent rules on noise protection in particularly noisy areas and at particularly noisy airports.
However, and here I turn to my socialist friends in this room, the general call to increase the limit from -5 EPNdB to -8 EPNdB would lead to a conflict with the USA and would also cause internal difficulties, because the Member States are not at all willing to accept more stringent standards, and at the moment the airports do not want these either.
This means that we should actually stick to -5 here.
In difficult situations we can use the definition of the city airport as a way out.
That is why I urge the House not to support Amendments Nos 21 and 22 so as not to jeopardise the compromise with the Council.
Secondly - and this is also for all of the environmentally-friendly Members of this House - we have obtained the Council's agreement that we already state now, in respect of the review in five years' time, that after these five years we should seek to establish a more stringent limit than -5.
This means that we have sent out a clear signal that we want to take account of public sensitivities and public health.
But the same public wants to go on holiday; the same public wants to fly to the European Parliament.
We therefore need to reach a compromise between the interests of the people who want to fly and the interests of those who live near airports.
I believe that we have found that compromise.
I would earnestly request that tomorrow the whole House convincingly approve the measures that we negotiated with the Council with the help of the Commission's conciliation services, because then we can conclude this difficult issue - which is so important in terms of foreign policy - at first reading.
Mr President, the topic of aircraft noise often gives rise to conflicts, conflicts between the European Union and the United States and conflicts among European Parliament committees.
The solution to the conflict with the United States is very close.
Tomorrow, the plenary session can simply end the conflict by accepting the compromise that was reached with the Council.
As far as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is concerned, this will not pose a huge problem since the following four points have been resolved satisfactorily.
First of all, the scope to designate airports as city airports has been widened.
This helps combat noise pollution, since city airports are allowed to take more stringent measures.
Secondly, the research obligations from Annex II have now been formulated in such a way as not to constitute an unnecessary barrier to measures.
Thirdly, the possibility has been created to ban subsequent phases of aircraft after five years.
Fourthly, the exemption regulation for developing countries is now restricted to a ten-year period.
A total of 33 compromise amendments have been tabled, as a result of which most amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy can lapse.
However, I only tabled the first two amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy by way of supplement.
Environmental considerations, in particular, must be integrated in transport policy in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.
As rapporteur Jarzembowski remarked a moment ago, there were a few minor changes submitted, including oral additions to the amendments tabled and also the change to Amendment No 12, which have led us to achieve complete agreement.
I recommend that the plenary session tomorrow support the compromise package, so that the legislative process can be concluded in one reading.
This is important in order to solve a long, drawn-out conflict with the United States involving the Hushkits Regulation.
Finally, as far as the conflict between EP committees is concerned, I have no choice but to conclude that this report has wrongly been designated to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Fortunately, thanks to sound cooperation with Mr Jarzembowski, we have reached agreement with the Council.
We will therefore leave this conflict for what it was.
Could I, too, say to Mr Jarzembowski: all is well that ends well?
The fact that we eventually ended up singing from the same hymn sheet has given me enormous pleasure.
Mr President, noise pollution around airports is always an emotive subject for the citizens who live near them, and Mr Jarzembowski who lives in Hamburg, knows this all too well.
What can be done about this?
There are two types of measures.
One, you can develop aircraft which emit low noise levels; you can regulate daytime and night-time operating; noise levels can be measured - measurements are hard facts - and certain types of aircraft can be banned.
This is precisely what we have done: we have banned the noisy aircraft, the hushkits, and I was all for it.
However, when all these measures have been taken, something else can be done, namely insulating and zoning.
They are incredibly costly, very expensive indeed, not only to the government, for what the government spends is ultimately the expense of the citizens.
This meant, therefore, that when the ban on aircraft created problems, we had to consider new measures.
The Hushkits Regulation had to be scrapped.
The Commissioner had no other choice.
She started to negotiate with the Member States and a new idea was born, an idea which, at the moment, I am giving the benefit of the doubt.
And why the benefit of the doubt?
If we consider the effects which the new measures that were agreed in ICAO context worldwide have had, not only on the European population but also on the populations in all other cities across the world, then I believe it was a useful exercise.
I would like to thank Mr Blokland who managed to tighten a few aspects, and I am well-supported in this by the PPE-DE section of our group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Adaptations have been made and refined, and, Mr President, I have to tell you that, if I could end each issue on this note, I would continue to be on very good terms with Mr Jarzembowski.
And I wish you, Commissioner, every success.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly the rapporteur deserves our thanks for his consistent report and his committed efforts to reach compromises, the majority of which we will be supporting.
However, I have to contradict him somewhat as regards the treatment of the Environment Committee - it may have been legally correct, but from a political point of view it was not exactly optimal.
On the actual substance: a third of all European airports are currently suffering noise problems; the problems are continuing to increase and the air transport sector is continuing to grow.
We have seen aircraft movements double in the last ten years and perhaps it will take even less time for them to double again, because flying is becoming part of everyday life.
I only have to think of the low-cost airlines, enlargement towards the east and other issues; they will quickly lead this sector out of the slump that it has been experiencing because of September 11, and, in fact, the first signs of growth are already visible.
The noise problems are increasing in our cities because there is more traffic, and in the conurbations population density is also on the increase.
At the same time there is also an increased desire for a better quality of life, which means that people are less willing to tolerate additional noise pollution.
That is why it certainly makes sense for us to make every effort to secure a proposal for a directive which is as effective as possible.
It makes sense to conclude international agreements because this is of course a global industry.
The ICAO agreement on the new chapter four was secured only after laborious negotiations, but of course it does not apply straight away, and that is why it is good that we are introducing these additional possibilities for placing operational restrictions on individual airports, which will enable stricter noise emission standards to be imposed.
It is also important for us to adopt a higher profile in ICAO because more international agreements are on the horizon and we will also soon have to be prepared for further international conflicts.
That is why it is really important for us to consider what we want to stand up for.
I only have to think of the open sky agreements and the issues which will still be on the agenda in connection with subsidised aircraft from third countries.
On the other hand, it does not actually make any sense - we are not in any trouble - to curtail the parliamentary procedure, because I think that in the USA they will recognise that parliamentary procedures take time.
We see three points rather differently.
Firstly, we want it spelt out even more clearly that in five years' time, after the review, moves will be made to increase the limit values; we want this laid down now along with the eight decibels.
Secondly, the necessary operational restrictions should take effect as quickly as possible, more quickly in our view than the Commission has proposed - this is more a reflection of the result of the vote in my group than my own personal views.
Thirdly, we should perhaps reopen the discussions on the city airports after all, although the compromise which has been reached with the Council and the Commission, as it were to extend the definition so that not only the original four but all of the airports in conurbations count if they handle internal Community traffic, seems to me personally to be right, and I think that my group will also support it in the end, even if it is after some debate.
I should like to make two final points: work should continue to conclude international agreements on engines and we will be discussing noise again - specifically overall noise-handling - in the context of the slot regulation, which will be exciting.
I am sure that we will achieve workable compromises in the next round.
Once again many thanks to the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, is what we have ideal?
I do not think so.
However, in the current circumstances, this is the best we can commit to paper, in my view.
It is always easy to draft a series of standards just for the European Union, making them so strict in the process that while we may be happy with them, they may make it impossible for the average company to operate.
We had the choice.
We held a debate on whether to opt for an international, global or European solution.
Given the present circumstances, we made a sensible choice.
Moreover, it is on the strength of what we said that this strict standard was copied internationally.
If all Member States have accepted this standard within the ICAO, it seems necessary to me that we, as a Community institution, ensure that this standard becomes law in the Union.
I, for one, support this principle, and I think that the rapporteurs, both those of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have done sterling work. As I belong to both these committees, I do not feel the ambivalence which some fellow MEPs do feel.
I feel happy on both sides.
This is also because the directive offers the necessary flexibility, since a system has been provided for which allows for an individual approach tailored to each airport, so that measures can be selected within a European framework. This, at least, guarantees a certain level of equality in the treatment of people who suffer from noise pollution.
In the final analysis, this is the whole object of the exercise: to ensure that people are affected as little as possible and to reconcile - at least up to a certain degree - two aspects which are, in fact, irreconcilable.
Although the review after five years will involve a tightening up of legislation, there is, in my opinion, no need to establish a limit at this stage.
This would be very unwise, in my view, and it could, in fact, undermine the entire proposal, which would be a very bad development, for we need to move forward quickly.
Parliament must, therefore, approve this proposal, so that there is a legislative document by 1 April, upon which we can withdraw the hushkits directive.
For this we must take another look at Article 5(1), and we are in agreement on this.
This is what we are planning to do, and I should like to ask the Commissioner whether she could not ensure that a uniform, Community method of measurement be established for this kind of noise, for that is still not available.
In my view, you should draft a bill on how noise is measured, so that we can establish objectively how measurements are to be carried out, applicable to every airport uniformly.
This initiative would also benefit the joint discussion on this issue.
Mr President, I do not share the enthusiasm of the majority of our fellow Members for the result obtained with regard to this directive.
In fact, I think that, as regards the noise reduction policy which concerns in particular those living near airports, this seems to be a step backwards.
The proposal repeals the Council regulation that should have entered into force on 1 April 2002 preventing hushkit planes, old planes fitted with muffling devices, but whose overall performance was recognised as insufficient, from landing.
This regulation is replaced by a directive based on an approach to noise management which is supposedly balanced, but which, in fact, restricts the margin for manoeuvre by the Member States with regard to combating noise pollution and prolongs the life of hushkit planes.
The amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy may well improve the original text.
Nevertheless, we are still in a situation where the Member States who will not do anything to assist in combating noise pollution in the vicinity of their airports will in fact be practising a dumping policy which could increase over the next few years insofar as we are currently experiencing a significant rise in air traffic.
In addition to this, the legislation allowing specific action to be taken is relatively complex and will therefore slow down initiatives.
I would like to point out in this respect that, a few months ago, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of people living near Heathrow airport in London who were complaining of nocturnal noise, and the right to a healthy environment and the right to sleep were recognised as human rights.
I therefore believe that in keeping with this decision of the Court of Human Rights, the Commission must quickly take a new initiative, a directive that not only restricts noise in the vicinity of airports, but lays down standards on noise exposure, thus allowing for harmony within the European Union.
Mr President, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, for all his hard work.
As Mr Jarzembowski has explained, it is extremely important that this directive repeals the original hushkit regulation within the timeframe laid down.
Without doubt, having discussed the hushkit issue on and off since many of us were elected in 1999 and for many years before, it will come as a relief that this debate can reach a conclusion.
It is worth reminding some of our colleagues that, when the agreement was reached between the EU and the US at the ICAO meeting in Montreal, all Member States were represented and agreed with the proposals that were put forward.
The key to those proposals was to take the balanced approach.
If we are to have any credibility it would be ludicrous if we in this Parliament then reneged on what has been agreed.
Speaking as someone who has lived close to London Heathrow, the busiest international airport in the world, for 30 years, and acknowledging the prosperity and jobs which flow from a successful industry, I find it extremely disappointing that perhaps some Members would prefer to score party political points rather than take on board the broader picture of what is required.
What would not be acceptable would be for any airport within the EU to be in a position to arbitrarily prevent or stop legitimate carriers from operating into and out of their airport.
The decision has to be made at Member State level in order to ensure a uniform application of any rules laid down.
However, if we are to improve congestion and noise pollution for the future, I suggest that Member States and local authorities take responsibility for proper land use planning and think carefully before using the aviation industry as a scapegoat for their failures.
Finally, having read through the additional amendments, many of which have been retabled predominantly by the Committee on the Environment, I found it somewhat disappointing that those Members found it necessary to go along that path.
I hope that they will think seriously about their actions and support the rapporteur when we vote on this report tomorrow.
International agreements are the way forward and we should continue to build on the agreement which was reached in Montreal.
Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the debate so far and I was very interested in what Mr Stercks and Mr Lannoye said.
To understand properly much of what they have said, one must consider the history.
For many years, there was no sign at all of ICAO taking any action to deal with the problem of growing aircraft noise so we in this Parliament took action.
We introduced the hushkits regulation which suspended the use of aircraft not retrospectively fitted with noise suppressors - the hushkits starting in April 2002.
Then suddenly, there was action.
The Americans threatened legal action and sanctions and ICAO seemed to wake up.
ICAO proposed new and better noise standards and guidance on sensible operating restrictions around airports.
We are now asked though to rescind our regulation and to accept this new directive, which is quite clearly much watered-down, and to expect ICAO to agree on some new international standards as soon as possible.
I will probably go along with this at the vote tomorrow because I agree that something is better than nothing, but we can only expect only some small improvements, and only potential improvement at that.
I have to say that I am not convinced that there will be any real improvement at international level unless it is very slow as is the custom with ICAO.
Therefore, if the Commission does finally get around to sending us a report in five years' time, we might just get a chance to see what this muddled arrangement has produced.
I look forward to the report.
I look forward to returning to the debate and I hope Mr Jarzembowski is happy with himself because I am not sure that I am.
Who wants incredibly noisy aircraft in Europe?
Answer: the United States administration, both under Clinton and Bush.
From 1 April next, they want to send old, incredibly noisy aircraft with silencers to Europe.
Europe had already decided that these aircraft, fitted with a so-called hushkit, should be phased out after 1 April.
However, the US Government, which sells high numbers of these hushkits to airline companies in developing countries, has lobbied hard and effectively.
Instead of a general ban for the whole of Europe, the European Commission now wants each airport to document the fact that it does not want these noisy aircraft.
Of course, if you really want to, you can still stop these wretched old things.
But the result will be that an increasing number of these noisy old bangers will move to smaller airports.
From London to Manchester, from Maastricht to Bierset.
This is something I cannot endorse.
Mr President, as an aside, I should like to inform you that the Irish have just won the first race at the Cheltenham festival.
I thought you might be interested.
My views on the present hushkit legislation are on the record.
It was very questionably driven by design criteria and not performance criteria.
So I welcome this adoption of an ICAO balanced approach to air traffic noise reduction as it amounts to a fundamental system change for the European Union.
However, I have many reservations.
This Commission proposal states that noise reduction efforts are now to be assessed on the basis of individual airports, with a view to imposing operating restrictions on aircraft.
It has opted for the airport-based approach along the lines of ICAO Resolution A337.
I support a package of measures for our larger and busier airports covering aspects such as land-use planning and management, operational restrictions and a ban on the noisier Chapter 3 aircraft.
However, as others have said, the effectiveness or otherwise of this proposal as a means of reducing air traffic noise will only be known after the Commission has submitted its report on its findings in over five years' time.
I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for his hard work and the close contact he has maintained with both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission in an effort to find a way forward and - given the critical deadline of 1 April - to prevent a legislative vacuum from occurring.
It is imperative for all of us in this House, if possible, to avoid a second reading.
That said, it is extremely unsatisfactory for us, as legislators to have been asked to rush through such a technical piece of legislation.
I am not happy about the whole procedure.
I would, however, like to sound a note of caution.
Although these proposals are very necessary and overdue in the context of the hushkits regulation and the US complaint and, indeed, the recent opinion of the Advocate General, the UK Government's position points out some flaws in the Commission's approach.
So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious.
Mr President, this proposal by Mr Jarzembowski seeks to achieve two things: a uniform approach to what is a global problem, and also a solution to the conflict with the United States.
Like most Members in this House, I give this proposal my support, but it is only qualified support.
There are serious problems with the way in which it is being achieved and also with the nature of the compromise that is being achieved.
I have serious problems with a system which relies on informal negotiations between individual Members of this House, the Council and the Commission.
It restrains the role of the elected Members of this House to an undue degree.
We must find some fast-track codecision procedure which can be used in these circumstances and fully respects the role of the Members of this House.
Secondly, the people who suffer as a result of the noise levels from aircraft and the operation of airports are the people who live immediately in the vicinity, particularly those on flight paths. We will have to judge this proposal on whether or not their lives improve over the next five years.
And while we have a proposal here that the Commission will report back to us in five years' time as to whether we are achieving what we set out to achieve, I hope that the Commission will come back here each year and tell us in what direction things are moving - whether the proposals are working, whether things are getting better or indeed in some cases getting worse - so that we can introduce corrective actions, rather than waiting for five years before beginning to take alternative steps.
I realise that a number of amendments which are good amendments in their own right are going to be rejected here tomorrow, but the Commission and Council should bear in mind that they are being rejected in order to facilitate this agreement, not because we disagree with them.
Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, pollution abatement is a noble but difficult struggle, a delicate balance between economic prosperity and human welfare.
Nevertheless, health and the economy are inseparable companions in the long run.
For that reason I too am pleased with the approach proposed by the Commission.
Noise should be reduced where that is needed most.
There is no real need for noise reduction at airports located a long way from where people live, so if a straitjacket were to apply in all situations there would be a slowdown in the economy for no good reason, and it is always the poor who are the first to suffer.
I am also pleased that we were able to get the committee to approve some useful adjustments.
It has to be made clear that the directive cannot apply to small aircraft, because nothing would be gained by banning them, although I am sure the radicals would like to protect deer and wild boars too from the sound of aircraft.
Mr Jarzembowski has once again done a very professional job.
He has had to negotiate with the Council and the Commission under heavy pressure.
Not all my colleagues, however, have taken such a responsible view of the matter.
There were many amendments tabled despite the fact that we are in danger of a trade dispute with the United States of America if we do not use this directive to quash the hushkit regulation before its entry into force.
I strongly condemn the new US steel tariffs, but, in spite of that, Europe must not pick a quarrel.
We, for our own part, can set a good example of how to manage trade policy. May President Bush learn a lesson from it.
I believe we have found a good compromise, and we should proceed from that.
The best way to bring down noise levels, however, is by an international agreement on a reduction in aircraft noise.
A totally silent world is hardly possible nor even desirable.
One day, though, a jumbo jet or the new and large - by European standards - Airbus will be emitting less noise than a flock of crows.
There is no reason for us yet, however, to prescribe limits for the noise made by crows.
Mr President, I am not going to insist on identifying the precedents which have led us to today's discussion, which I hope will lead to a positive result tomorrow, because we all know what has happened following the negative attitude of a series of Member States of the ICAO and we all want to make progress in the fight against noise at airports.
We are also aware of the decision which the European Union adopted in relation to a certain type of modified aircraft which conforms to Chapter III and the circumstances which have led us to the current situation.
What I wish to do first is to warmly thank Mr Jarzembowski for the wonderful work he has done on a very delicate issue and also Mr Blokland for the series of very positive amendments - in terms of the environment - which he has contributed to this Commission proposal.
I believe that it is very important - and everybody here has said so - that today we find a solution, which, as Mr Sterckx said, and I agree with him, is not the ideal solution, but which at least represents a step forward and prevents further clashes with third countries.
We must understand that we are part of a multilateral system; that, thanks to the decision of the European Union, things have moved on within the ICAO and the situation has improved and that we now have a proposal which offers us clear opportunities to improve the situation of airports in the future.
I perfectly understand that we have many amendments and that, if we did not have international commitments which are binding of all of us, the honourable Members would probably like to support them.
I would ask you tomorrow to bring that international agreement within our reach; that we may have a proposal which supports what the 15 countries of the Union have decided, voted for and supported within the ICAO.
I would therefore like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Blokland and the two committees for their ambitious and at the same time realistic work and efforts, which show common sense and support for the decision of the 15 countries in the ICAO and therefore for the international decision.
I believe that, after removing the requirement for an alternative airport, the definition of an urban airport hugely broadens the scope and this is positive.
We could not reduce the number of movements to 30 000 since, amongst other things, it would contradict the limit laid down in the directive on environmental noise, which this very Parliament approved recently.
I believe that the definition of the competent authority has improved and allows for the appropriate margins.
I would also like to insist once again that we are not obliging any Member State to create a new body, but that the competent authority in each case will be defined and determined by the Member State in question, and it is therefore necessary that the State in question does define and determine it, and I would like to point out that we agree with Parliament that it is essential to make it clear that operative restrictions, according to the acoustic level, are based on methodologies described in the third edition of volume 1 of Annex XVI of the ICAO.
This document has been agreed at international level and we would not accept any less rigorous document.
It is also clear that, if the operative restrictions were not based on acoustic levels, but on the runway and the time, it would be difficult for us to refer to this Annex.
With regard to the obligation to carry out analysis, the amount of information has been an issue on which a careful balance has been achieved: Article 5, paragraphs 1 and 2.
On the one hand, we do not want to impose unnecessary burdens on airports or on the States of the Union, but, on the other hand, we must ensure that we have a suitable basis for decision making.
Even in the event that an airport does not propose significant operative restrictions, we believe that it will be to their benefit to make as complete an analysis as possible in order to make decisions in full knowledge of the facts.
We have studied very carefully the rhythm which the airports could impose with the withdrawal of aircraft from the fleets in question and we are convinced that this reference should be made according to movements.
I believe that a minimum of five years is a very tough requirement and we could not therefore reduce this time period even further.
With regard to the developing countries, the Commission has carried out a detailed study which has concluded that these countries have acted in a responsible way by reducing their fleets of Chapter II aircraft and we applaud this action.
We must be fair towards these operators and I believe that the compromise amendment presented is a solution we can support.
The Commission would also like to express its support for a general exemption applicable to genuinely exceptional services, for humanitarian reasons or maintenance work which cannot be carried out elsewhere for example.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that decisions are taken in a coherent way throughout the Community is a fundamental step forwards.
This means that we have the opportunity to replace the current patchwork of restrictions with prepared measures within a coherent framework of analysis, in such a way that similar solutions will be applied in European airports which have similar problems.
I believe that we have an applicable directive which conforms to our international obligations and which, furthermore, will contribute to improving the quality of life of the citizens who live close to airports.
In this respect, Mr President, I would like once again to thank the two rapporteurs and the honourable Members for their work and I am grateful for the cooperation and understanding of Parliament, which wanted to participate in this very difficult exercise of adopting legislation in record time, which allows us to prevent other types of problem in the international field.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I hope that tomorrow the vote and the support of the honourable Members will allow us once and for all to resolve this issue which we have been dealing with for far too long.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0365/2001) by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women and fundamentalism (2000/2174(INI)).
Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the fact that this House has accepted the proposal to produce a report on this issue, 'Women and fundamentalism', thereby allowing us to confront this serious problem and to hold this debate and the subsequent vote despite the difficulties involved and the current pressures.
On behalf of the hundreds of millions of human beings whose rights are denied or restricted as a result of fundamentalist pressure, I would like to thank the European Parliament.
Today the European Union must defend the universality of human rights in a globalised world in which fundamentalists represent serious threats to freedoms, human rights and peace.
This report offers useful proposals which will help to combat them.
The first of them, Mr President, is that we must not allow religious fundamentalism to become a taboo subject, since problems are not solved by ignoring them or covering them up, but by being aware of them and confronting them.
Secondly, fundamentalism cannot be combated by means of fundamentalism under another guise; the history of humanity is awash with disasters of that type.
On the contrary, fundamentalism is reduced by promoting and exercising democratic freedoms, promoting the emancipation of women, pluralism and ideological and cultural diversity, the promotion of openness and the acceptance of differences and social and economic well-being.
Mr President, one of the key elements which has proved to assist in the fight against fundamentalism is modernity, in a plural and multicultural sense.
There can be no social modernity without human modernity.
The desire to modernise a society while denying women democracy ends in failure; hence our condemnation of partial modernisation processes on the part of leaders of States which want only to modernise economic and technology aspects, while maintaining the basic principles of obsolete patriarchal societies in tact.
Women are currently the main bringers of social modernity.
However, Mr President, there is no single model for the emancipated woman.
Women's identity must be personal and individual, differing in terms of religion, tradition and culture.
Stereotypes, dress, values, lifestyles and behaviour must be a question of personal free choice.
Mr President, another of the key elements for preserving society from fundamentalism is secularisation or the separation of public affairs, which belong in the political sphere, from religious beliefs and convictions, which must be free and respected and which belong in the private individual sphere.
The space occupied by religion in a social and political whole must involve a very broad range of possibilities.
Mr President, the accusations being levelled against this report are unfair.
It distinguishes and differentiates between fundamentalism and the normal practice of religion in a clear and respectful way, despite the fact that during the eras of certain religions in the past such a distinction has not existed.
Mr President, we are facing a violation of human rights on an immense scale.
Just in the case of women and at the present time, we can identify hundreds of the millions of people whose rights and freedoms are being restricted, violated and denied them.
As a result of the time limits laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I have not been able to dwell on the death sentence by stoning imposed on Safiya Husseini, in Nigeria, nor on the Iranian women who are publicly flogged, nor those women, photographs of whose lynching I have seen, nor did I arrive in time to prevent the execution by stoning of Maryam Ayoubi last year.
Despite the fact that the Iranian authorities had replied to the Commission that it had not stoned women for three years, the UN and Amnesty International have stated that that execution took place.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like this report to be just a first step, followed by other specific parliamentary proposals, which will demonstrate, in each country and case by case, what a human life is worth in the European Union.
Mr President, as draftsman for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on her exceptional report and for having the courage to tell the truth, however painful.
We recently witnessed the collapse of the Taliban regime, which highlighted the tragic position of women in Afghanistan.
We recently witnessed the trials and tribulations of Safiya Husaini, condemned to death by stoning by an Islamic court in Nigeria for having a baby out of wedlock.
A similar verdict has been passed in Sudan.
All these cases show just how topical this report is.
They also turn the spotlight on the violation of women's fundamental freedoms and rights by fundamentalist, anti-democratic regimes centre stage in a most dramatic manner.
What happened in Afghanistan with the rise of the Taliban is one very typical example.
Women were deprived of their most basic human rights overnight.
Like every other anti-democratic regime, the Taliban based their power on subjugating women and going back to their roots.
Under these regimes, the sexual conduct, way of life and reproductive functions of women, even the way they dress, are generally controlled by religious leaders, allegedly abiding by scriptures and cultural traditions, while inhumane, violent and humiliating punishment, such as whipping and stoning, is the order of the day.
We must not forget that about 5 000 women are murdered ever year by male members of their families for reasons of honour and that the perpetrators go unpunished.
One hundred and thirty million women throughout the world have had their genitalia mutilated and that a further 2 million women a year are exposed to such practices.
However, I should like to point out here that fundamentalism does not thrive just in developing countries; it also thrives in Europe.
I think there is a serious problem in Poland.
I have here an indictment signed by 100 public figures accusing the Catholic church of unacceptable interference and attempting to control women's reproductive functions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the great merit of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's report is that it has triggered another wide-ranging debate about the influence of religious fundamentalism on the emancipation of women.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome the report, which emphasises Europe's responsibility for ensuring respect for fundamental rights and democratic principles as well as the secularity of nation states.
Throughout the world, however, women's rights are being restricted or breached on the pretext of religious or cultural traditions or the law.
This does not apply only to Islamists, but also to other religious groups.
After difficult negotiations, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing more than 30 paragraphs of specific measures, which have met with the agreement of four groups.
We deeply regret the fact that of all groups the Christian-Democratic Group was not prepared to take part in compromise negotiations.
The rapporteur was willing to do so.
The need to fight against the suppression mechanisms of the fundamentalists should, after all, be the subject of a consensus.
The Afghan Taliban provided us with an example of how they first jettisoned women's rights, then forced women to wear the burka, and finally denied them education and medical care and cut them off from any kind of paid employment.
In a joint declaration, the Women's Rights Committee in the European Parliament and the women of the Council of Europe call for an international group of female observers to be set up to see that Afghan women have their unrestricted human rights restored to them.
We condemn any kind of fundamentalism, offence or crime for reasons of so-called honour, such as stoning or genital mutilation or withholding reproductive rights, and that includes in Europe.
Within the EU, we need to influence immigration laws and asylum policy so that reasons for persecution which are gender-specific or not related to a particular state are recognised.
In my country this is the subject of a major debate and there too it is the Christian-Democratic Group which is refusing to compromise.
Afghanistan, a country where, during the Taliban's reign of terror, women were not allowed to leave their homes, were not allowed to work or receive education, is the most poignant example of a country where fundamentalists, backed by their delusions, oppressed women.
However, on a smaller scale too, there are women across the world who are being oppressed, abused or discriminated against in the name of religion.
In many Islamic countries, girls are genitally maimed, although this is not mentioned anywhere in the Koran.
In fact, the Koran prohibits this practice.
This is no longer religion, but fundamentalism.
Some fellow MEPs labour under the misapprehension that I, along with other MEPs, denounce any religious interference in politics.
This is incorrect. We welcome the fact that people are involved in European politics.
This comes about via industry, environmental organisations and the unions.
Needless to say, religions will also lobby for their interests and their ideals.
The fact that churches defend their political agendas here among MEPs is a credit to our institution.
I am therefore delighted with the Vatican's attention to this report, as documented in the authoritative Spanish newspaper, El Pais, among others.
As a first step towards an open dialogue with the Vatican, I should like to say the following in response to their criticism: we simply want women to be able to decide for themselves whether, and if so when, they want to bear children.
The report also focuses on the difficult position of women in developing countries and of lesbians.
These are real problems which would be solved far better if politicians were to join forces with churches.
Cooperation always leads to better results.
Our joint fight against capital punishment or poverty is a good case in point.
Would it not be wonderful if, on the road to yet more cooperation, we could start an open dialogue with regard to the Vatican's position on condoms?
Last year, 2.6 million people died of AIDS in Africa.
If the Vatican stops the ban on condoms, we might be able to rescue a percentage of these people.
Let us therefore enter into this open dialogue so that we can together fight fundamentalism at some stage in future, on the understanding that each take up their own responsibilities.
I should like to thank the rapporteur and the fellow MEPs with whom we have cooperated.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that everyone is agreed that fundamentalism has an extremely negative effect on the emancipation process of women.
It is a source of violation of human and women's rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the international treaties and conventions, and exercises its baleful influence not only directly, but also via religious rules, cultural characteristics, customs, political campaigns and social standards.
Women's rights are human rights, and this must form the basis of our actions.
As I see it, and as we hear, women wish to accentuate the equal qualities of, and not the differences between, people.
Let us transcend our religious differences in order to achieve a more humane world, preferably without violence.
How many wars and how much violence find their improper origins in religious intolerance, often fed by political interests rather than religious perception?
The unnecessary, pointless violence between Muslims and Hindus in India serves as a recent example of this.
It would be a major credit to this report if, thanks to the suggestions mentioned in it, an extreme danger of fundamentalism, namely the suffering of women and girls in Afghanistan, were turned into an example of how things can be changed.
Allow me to explain.
In the report, we asked the Council, the Member States and the Commission to take a joint initiative to send a special group of observers, specialised in gender equality, to Afghanistan to ensure that women's rights, as enshrined in international agreements and Treaties, are observed, and that aid and reconstruction policy takes sufficient account of the gender equality issues.
In this way, the tragedy caused by the Taliban, as well as the solution to it, can be used in the fight against other forms of fundamentalism.
This report is also praiseworthy for the fact that it expresses the wish that in the future directive on procedures for granting asylum in the Member States, account should be taken of various forms of female persecution.
Mr President, it has taken a long time to bring this report before the plenary sitting as religion and sexuality are without doubt two very sensitive issues to address, even in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Now we have come this far, I would like to thank my colleagues who have put in so much effort to draw up a number of new amendments.
I would particularly like to thank them for showing the courage to address the role of Saudi Arabia, something which we otherwise tend to keep quiet about, given that we live, it might be said, in an era characterised by neo-liberal economic fundamentalism.
There are many different sorts of fundamentalism both within and outside the borders of the European Union.
I cannot help but mention last week's scandal, one of many scandals over the years.
This time it concerned the United States.
The Catholic Church has protected those of its representatives who have sexually abused children in their congregations for a generation.
What is worst is when degenerates of this kind are also defended with the aid of the law.
In this case, I am thinking of the current cases in Nigeria, where women are sentenced to be stoned to death for having sexual relations outside marriage.
I am also thinking of the legal proceedings taken in Portugal against women who have had abortions and against those who have helped them to have these abortions, as well as of the recent referendum on the same issue in Ireland.
These are just a few examples among many which demonstrate the right assumed by men to control women and children as their personal property.
This often takes place in the name of religion and often under the protection of the law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is always revolutionary to discuss the situation of women, but a few facts need to be made clear first.
Fundamentalisms affect more than just the lives of women, they affect the lives of people in general, and for that reason they must be opposed and rejected on principle for they are at the root of a vision of society that is based on conflict.
It is precisely because of this intrinsic nature that they have such negative consequences for women, becoming a sort of ethical justification for abuse and violence.
Clearly, respect for fundamental human rights is a cultural even more than a legal heritage, which is shared by the Member States of the European Union, a common value which has to contend with practices, customs, religions and cultures with which Europe comes into contact mainly because of migration.
I would like to make it clear, however, as a Catholic, that I am absolutely convinced that Catholicism is not guilty of the forms of fundamentalism that the report appears to suggest it is.
I fully support the call for the adoption of a universal moratorium on executions and the death penalty, an effective, incisive action, a campaign against mutilation, flogging and stoning, such as we have carried out and will continue to carry out for cases such as that of the Nigerian woman, Safiya Husseini. I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues which I feel need to be addressed, calling upon the Commission and Parliament to reflect on them once again: to reflect on the right of the family, on the minimum conditions for the right of asylum, on integration, with regard to which we need to move away from a form of hypocritical rhetoric which drifts between full integration with the Member States of the European Union and respect for identities, and on the need for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather of religion from politics.
To sum up, we confirm our rejection of any form of violence, particularly violence and oppression inflicted on human beings, be they men or women.
We call upon the Commission not just to guarantee that the Community acquis on women's rights will be respected in the talks, but also to analyse all these problematic issues further, for there are at least as many unresolved issues as issues which have been resolved.
Thousands of women suffer oppression, abuse or other forms of maltreatment.
Every serious attempt to do something about this deserves our support.
After all, women are equal to men and deserve respect for their talents.
As a Christian, I have adopted this attitude based on the Bible.
However, the report on women and fundamentalism offers no solution to the problem. Quite the reverse, in fact.
The report tips towards a similar kind of intolerant fundamentalism to that which it means to fight.
Respect for the deep conviction of worshippers is nowhere to be detected.
The report arrogantly prescribes what is good and evil.
Religions are treated with a negative and biased approach.
The report's basic ideology is founded on the belief that people determine for themselves what is right and wrong.
People only have rights.
Any mutual ties of love and care, of solidarity and self-denial are treated with suspicion.
This appears to me to be unadulterated egotism, despite the veneer of human rights.
The statements about motherhood form the most disappointing part of the report.
Motherhood is, by definition, not a purely personal matter, if nothing else because children develop their own personalities.
Furthermore, the father is depicted in an appalling manner as somebody who exercises control over the reproductive capacity of women.
As a father, I feel deeply hurt by this statement.
Is the rapporteur looking to abolish men, by any chance?
I regret the work that has gone into this report by the rapporteur, but I hope that it will be rejected.
Let us look for other ways of improving the position of oppressed women.
Mr President, Mrs Poli Bortone, as a Catholic, is calling and has called quite clearly for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather, as she said, of religion from politics.
As a lay person, I make exactly the same request, which, I feel, restores dignity to those who have faith or religious beliefs and restores dignity to those with political responsibilities.
Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is precisely this: the separation of religion from political power and political decision-making.
The problem covers more than just the religions we describe as fundamentalist, it is more than just the extreme case of genital mutilation and the Sharia: it is the general, standard situation, which is common in our countries too, the fact that there needs to be a separation of Church from State, of religion from politics.
This is the heart of the matter, this is what we must have the courage to do.
It is too easy to condemn extreme cases or Afghanistan; it is more difficult to take a look at our own home, more difficult to talk about the continual interference: I refer, for example, to scientific research, to the ban on the use of supernumerary embryo cells for scientific purposes, I am thinking of the Church's positions on therapeutic cloning and the obedience shown by the political class.
Therefore, the meaning of this debate, of this report, for us and for all the women who live in Arab countries, whether extremist or not, is that the dignity of each individual and the respect for the religious beliefs of each individual will be safeguarded only if we assume our responsibility to separate religion from politics, Church from State.
There you are: this, I feel, is what we must have the courage to do, without limiting our focus, so to speak, to extreme situations.
We must take care.
If we do not make the separation absolutely clear-cut and make indulgent concessions to the claims of cultural relativism, we will not help the women of Arab or European countries who are fighting for recognition of their role in society and their integrity at all.
Mr President, in European society and especially in the European Parliament, where we fight for respect for human rights, the debate on the issue of fundamentalism and its repercussions on people's lives and on the productivity and creativity of society is of immense importance.
History teaches us - and modern times also show us - that women are the first and most vulnerable victims of fundamentalism and it is this which interests Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights.
Violations of women's human rights are a daily occurrence in numerous areas of the world, in various forms and in various sectors of public and private life.
And if we exercise a little self-criticism, we must admit that it was the destruction of cultural monuments by the Taliban and the terrorist attack on 11 September which made us aware of the situation of women in Afghanistan.
And cultural and religious customs and traditions are constantly cited in Afghanistan - as they are elsewhere - as an excuse for violating these rights.
It is true that women and how they live are always the last bastion of resistance to progress in a country or society.
So what we see is that, while numerous countries accused of violating human rights, especially women's human rights, are finding the courage to introduce economic reforms which often fly in the face of traditional or religious precepts, when it comes to women and their rights, change is resisted at every turn.
My political group and the rapporteur differ on the role which religion plays in people's lives.
We do not accept that religion and human rights are in opposite camps.
Anyway, keeping the faith cannot go hand in glove with suppression and violence.
This was the thrust of repeated amendments proposed by my political group in committee; however, the rapporteur failed to pay them any attention, which is why my political group has tabled amendments before plenary.
Rather than fight our citizens' religious convictions, our approach is to mobilise all the political means at our disposal to ensure that the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights are applied to all policies, as the European Commission did recently when it took the initiative to strengthen these policies in its foreign relations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely important that the European Parliament discusses and votes in favour of the report on women and fundamentalism.
This is a political issue of the utmost topicality, which must be addressed carefully but quite firmly.
It is our view that, in the European Union, equal rights for women and men, the right of all of us not to suffer public and domestic violence and to undertake the tasks that are within our ability, which we wish to undertake and which benefit us, is one of the greatest privileges we enjoy.
We wish to share these privileges with all the women in the world.
The violence we see throughout the world, particularly the situation of Afghan women under the Taliban regime, also exists, unfortunately, in other countries in which the dignity and will of women are trampled on for religious or ideological reasons.
We must condemn and fight effectively against the various forms of fundamentalism that exist in the world and which allow such situations to exist.
No one will be able to understand why the European Parliament is not adopting a strong position on this matter.
Many compromise amendments have now been tabled.
We must make an effort to reach agreement and we need to keep an open and tolerant mind on this matter.
We cannot adopt a fundamentalist approach to this issue of intransigence toward the enormously serious situations taking place across the world and, in some cases, for example concerning the decision on reproductive rights, even within the European Union.
The aim of this report is to secure a vote against all forms of fundamentalism.
If the European Parliament does not approve the report, it would, from a political point of view, be extremely serious; it would send the message to the world that the European Parliament cannot agree on how to fight the various forms of fundamentalism that currently exist.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are caught between a desire for clarity and the difficult nature of this subject.
I am slightly uncomfortable with this report.
I accept that it took a certain amount of courage to draw up this report, but I am not convinced that it had to be so ambiguous.
The line between religion and fundamentalism does not seem to me to be clearly drawn.
This certainly does not mean that fundamentalism is bad and religion good, but rather that we must not confuse religion with fundamentalism and vice versa.
Speaking, not as a politician, but as a researcher who has studied the history of women, I know one thing: there is not a single religion that has not created a hierarchy between the sexes.
This is a historical fact that cannot be denied.
All those of us who want to oppose fundamentalism in any shape or form must face up to this historical fact without being hypocritical about it.
In every religion, there is a hierarchy between the sexes.
Some do promote certain women's rights, but few create and promote gender equality.
That does not exist.
We just have to put up with it, as it were.
Personally, I am in favour of separating church and State, as you can tell from my speech.
My words are addressed to all followers of religion.
Fundamentalist or not, you are well aware that no religion has produced a theory on equality between men and women.
This report makes me uncomfortable as there are some things that are not right.
Recital T, for example, states that fundamentalism and feminism can be reconciled.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
It is possible to cobble together or come up with strategies for emancipation despite fundamentalism, as certain Iranian women have proved to us, but that does not make it true in all cases.
Similarly, when I read in Article 31 that religious leaders must be asked to grant women the right to control their own bodies, I must protest.
They will not do it!
They are fighting against contraception and abortion.
We know it, fundamentalism or not.
Let us think seriously and clearly about all that.
We will undoubtedly disagree, but each person's position will be clear to us all.
Mr President, we are firm supporters of the fight to uphold women's rights which are trampled upon by fundamentalists, but we feel that this report does not do the cause any favours.
When it accuses the religious organisations of barring women from leading positions in the hierarchy, it is not attacking the kind of fundamentalism which is a threat - Islamic fundamentalism - so much as the Church, which restricts priesthood to men.
The report contradicts itself when it calls upon the European Parliament - moreover in arrogant, disrespectful terms - to impose its own views on matters of dogma and ideology on the Pope and the patriarchs.
This prompts me to wonder what is happening to the European Parliament: is it the parliament of the peoples or a parliament serving the occult powers?
The report makes two mistakes.
The first is to equate Islamic fundamentalism with the principles of the Christian tradition, which have been dismissed as obsolete and reactionary, whereas the Christian and Catholic tradition is an integral part of the heritage of values and common culture of the European peoples. The second is to see Islamic fundamentalism as a degenerate sect of Islam when it is actually the current, authentic interpretation of Islam which is taught in all Islamic universities.
It may be politically correct to disregard these facts but in doing so we are preventing Europe from defending itself against the danger represented by Islamic communities, governed by the severe rules of the Sharia which takes as much notice of women's rights as it does of our right of the family and all the principles of freedom.
Mr President, I have to say that I am genuinely perplexed - and I am not saying this to take sides - by this report, not least in the light of my experience of the past two years in which, as Vice-President of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly responsible for Human Rights, much of my time was spent promoting women's rights and freedoms.
I am perplexed by many parts of the report and I want to go back to the crux of the matter, which I feel has been comprehensively defined by Mrs Bonino in her speech, and state my views clearly once again.
The problem is the separation of religion from politics.
From this point of view, if there is to be such a separation, it has to be understood that there are two ways of looking at these two radically different dimensions of life; so much so that, in actual fact, the only fundamentalism I truly fear is the fundamentalism of those sorts of idealisms which can no longer see the sense of reality in dealing with each specific subject individually by different means.
Therefore, when this report calls upon us not to recognise States in which women are excluded from government and it is referring not to a normal State but to a State such as the Vatican, for example, I realise immediately that there is something wrong, for we are being asked to trespass on Member States' prerogatives and interfere in something which does not deserve such treatment.
Similarly, if religion and politics are to be separated, the problem is the freedom of the Church, which must not be conditioned by political points of view or prerogatives.
Therefore, when I read in point K of this report that, when religious bodies carry out activities of a public nature, they are, just by doing so, as good as committing a crime against an alleged European law; that is, if, by way of example, a religious body were to run a hospital or a school, it would in some way be a threat to European law, I find this extremely disturbing.
That is why I confirm once again my support for the fight to uphold women's rights, but I must strongly reiterate my concern at the report's method and subject matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 8 March, was International Women's Day.
I hope that each one of us, men and women, took part in meetings, seminars and conferences to confirm, once and for all, that equality between men and women is vital for the democratic development of our societies.
The values of the European Union laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights include the right to human dignity, the right to the integrity of the person, freedom of thought, conscience and religion and equality between men and women.
Therefore, here, in this Assembly, let us accept our responsibilities.
It is up to us, the men and women of Europe, to apply these rights and ensure their application within the European Union and to defend and develop these values in the rest of the world.
Here, I would like to point out how important the adoption of this report would be in this battle, as we must keep on tirelessly reminding ourselves that women are the primary victims of fundamentalism.
They are victims of violence, social, economic, political and sexual discrimination, psychological and physical abuse, oppression, and are refused all the fundamental rights: equality, access to education and politics, and all in the very name of fundamentalism, which is the antithesis of human rights.
We can and must take action.
We must promote and protect democracy and human rights in our Association Agreements.
We must also ensure intercultural dialogue between the two banks of the Mediterranean by increasing monitoring for more active participation of women in the actions and programmes we support.
Lastly, we must support women seeking asylum in the European Union having suffered persecution in their own country in the name of fundamentalism.
The defence of women's rights and equality between men and women must be one of the cornerstones of our actions which requires specific attention from our Assembly.
In this Assembly, from now on, with the vote on this directive, let us give women the means and the signal to cast off their chains and let us once more assume our responsibilities.
Mr President, the discussion is very interesting but I have noticed that hardly anyone is talking about the text, probably because many of us are confused by it.
The history of this report, in the first place, shows that this initiative is untimely.
What was originally a report on women in Islam has ended up as a convoluted, ambiguous report with no real coherence.
In not wishing to attack Islam head-on, which I understand, the definition of fundamentalism has remained vague.
Yet is fundamentalism not a caricature of religion?
We are all in agreement with regard to separating the temporal from the spiritual, and, from then on, it is not really within Parliament's remit to get involved in the ambiguous area of comparative theology.
However, certain points deserve our agreement, in particular the statement that, within the territory of the Member States, customs and beliefs that are counter to human rights, and in particular women's rights, cannot be tolerated and that the family rights of the Member States take precedence over those of the countries of origin of immigrants.
In conclusion, equality between men and women is not a matter of theory.
Women must be promoted, along with their position and role in society, not simply as women, but because they are part of the same humanity, and therefore the same dignity, as men.
Mr President, fundamentalism causes many problems within societies, and women, in particular, are the victim.
This is illustrated by such things as the situation of women in Afghanistan, the stoning of women, or traditional practices such as female circumcision which, unfortunately, are still being carried out, also in Europe.
In fundamentalist societies in particular, women are often denied fundamental rights and freedoms, and often have no access to adequate assistance, health care and education.
This is why I was pleased with the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to draft an own-initiative report on the topic of 'Women and fundamentalism' and this is precisely why I am disappointed with the poor quality of the present report.
I regret that we were unable to find a compromise within Mrs Karamanou's opinion.
The Izquierdo report is right to call attention to the adverse effects of fundamentalism.
However, if the topic and the intention are good, it does not necessarily follow that the report is good.
The report goes too far where it lumps together religion, fundamentalism and human rights violation.
The report is more anti-religion than it is pro-woman.
It has adopted the wrong approach because solutions are sought in half-yearly reports, the setting up of an open university for women only, special mobility programmes for women - as if women needed this - and intervention in countries which act in accordance with their legislation but which, in the eyes of the rapporteur, nevertheless offer women inadequate protection.
The report is also inconsistent.
It is fair to call for the separation of church and state, but it goes on to prescribe requirements for the internal organisation of religious traditions.
Moreover, the report is full of careless formulations.
Our group has tabled amendments, which can improve the report to some extent.
However, even if they were all adopted, there are many instances left of over-simplification, lack of editorial clarity, duplication, obligatory repetitions of EU legislation and proposals which fall outside our remit.
In my country, representatives of human rights organisations, women's organisations, churches and women in churches have made an urgent appeal to vote against the report.
One thing is certain: women and religion, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and Parliament, along with the fight against fundamentalism, deserve a better report than this one.
Mr President, I am also perplexed by the fact that tradition and culture are always used as an argument at the expense of anything else.
Historically, culture and tradition have put women into the situation of inequality they suffer today.
The worst violations against women in the world are currently carried out on behalf of religious fundamentalism.
Religious fundamentalism is also political and, when women and girls live under it, their lives tragically offer them no possibility of escape.
In the name of the freedom of thought which the Members from the People's Party advocate, quite rightly, the Izquierdo report argues in favour of the separation of the powers of Church and State, that is, between religion and politics.
That should be the report's most significant argument.
Many women are awaiting our commitment on this issue.
We must defend the values that we, men and women, espouse in order that we may live together in freedom. In the name of that freedom of choice and decision which is denied to the majority of women in the rest of the world.
We do not agree with the exclusive determinism for women, which condemns them for the rest of their lives.
It is not true that women can participate with the same dignity as men because they are excluded from practically everything which may give them that dignity.
In the name of tradition, religion and fundamentalism, women are stoned, murdered and mutilated.
As I have said, many women await our commitment and we cannot disappoint them.
In the name of freedom of thought, we must vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo because she touches on a very important and difficult problem in her report.
To start with, as far as fundamentalism is concerned, I think that we have to analyse the concept outside the European Union.
According to the Treaty, the European Union is a union of independent states.
Religion is a purely private matter for each individual and keeping the faith is a personal decision for each individual, assuming of course that keeping the faith does not run counter to the basic principles which unite all the Member States of the European Union.
On Women's Day recently, we discussed Muslim women in Europe.
Islam is the second most important religion in the European Union today.
The European Muslim women who spoke highlighted the fact that the Koran is interpreted solely by men.
Women are never involved in interpreting the Koran.
However, any interpretation of the Koran or any other religion in the European Union cannot be respected unless the basic laws and principles of the European Union are respected first.
This means that the basic principle of equality of men and women is a principle on which any other priorities and principles must be founded.
However, outside Europe, fundamentalism really is a very important problem, as many of the speakers have described.
I think that identifying, describing and condemning the problem is very important, but Europe will be guilty by omission if it fails to take very specific measures to deal with it worldwide.
The European Commission has proposed specific measures to mainstream the gender dimension in all forms of foreign policy, in external trade, in development aid, in all the European Union's individual agreements with third countries and at summits organised between the European Union and various continents, such as the Europe/Africa, Europe/Asia and Europe/Latin America summits.
This proposal is quite specific.
First, last year, as part of mainstreaming in all individual policies, the Commission presented the action plan on development relating to women.
It contains very specific actions on how to take account of respect for women's human rights, the involvement of women in development aid and the development of each country, and how to apply this action plan, with incentives and, where necessary, with sanctions.
Similarly, we are organising an initial seminar in March for experts from the 15 Member States and delegates invited from all over the world to debate a foreign policy action plan to be complied with by the European Union and the Member States.
We are preparing a Council of Foreign Ministers in 2003 at which the main item on the agenda will be a foreign policy action plan and recommendations.
This is a very important report because it focuses the debate on what is now one of the most serious issues at global level, the crime perpetrated against women on the grounds of religion or cultural mores, a crime which affects hundreds of millions of women.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0038/2002) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (Noise) (17th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (10479/1/2001 - C5-0546/2001 - 1992/0449A(COD))
Mr President, I should like to begin with a comment on the Rules of Procedure, and I assume that the time it takes will not be deducted from my speaking time. I think we should try something new in Parliament today.
What I envisage doing is dividing my five minutes in such a way that I am allowed to talk for four minutes to introduce the debate and for one minute to conclude it, once the Commissioner has made her speech. I propose this in the light of two factors.
First of all, I understand that the Conference of Presidents had an 'away day' last week, when they decided to have more lively debates here in the House. The second factor is Rule 121, paragraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure.
I asked the Sittings Directorate, before I came here today, if what I propose was possible.
I was told flatly it was not, but I want to ask permission to do what I propose, given that there is nothing in the Rules of Procedure to prevent such a procedure.
I therefore assume that you will be sympathetic towards organising matters in this way today.
Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, of course I am not going to subtract the time you have spent on this request from your speaking time.
I thank you for having chosen a moment when I am in the chair to carry out this kind of experiment, which makes my life much more enjoyable.
I must say that I do not see any problem with your suggestion.
If you speak as rapporteur and, after the Commissioner has spoken, you ask for the floor to make some point of detail in relation to what has taken place during the debate or what the Commissioner has said, I do not see any problem in our proceeding in that way.
I would now ask you to take the floor, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, as rapporteur.
Mr President, can I do the same if there is a problem?
If the Member replies and then there is a need for me to reply, can I do the same?
Commissioner, my understanding is that, in your capacity as representative of the Commission, you can request the floor whenever you like.
Mr President, with regard once again to the Rules of Procedure, I want to say that my business following the debate is not to criticise anything the Commission has said but, rather, to comment on aspects of what my fellow MEPs here in the House have stated.
I am now, then, embarking upon my speaking time.
Noise is a major problem in European workplaces, and I believe it is important to emphasise that this directive is good for workers and that it does not affect anyone else.
As has been discussed, there are many misunderstandings as to who is affected by this directive.
We know that noise can have incredibly harmful effects.
The possible effects of noise are very well documented.
We are talking about tinnitus and permanent loss of hearing.
I believe that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do to prevent injury at work and to prevent employees being permanently excluded from the labour market.
It has therefore surprised me a great deal during the debate on this issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that, for example, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which normally attaches incredible importance to doing something for handicapped people in the EU, has not shown greater interest in efforts to prevent people from being handicapped by damage to their hearing, for that is at all events the best strategy of all.
We also know that the existing noise directive from 1996 is out of date and does not provide employees with sufficient protection.
The common position with which we are now being presented is far better, for an actual limit value is being introduced for the first time.
It is an important step that such a common minimum level should be established for the whole of the EU.
The amendments adopted by the committee improve the common position on a range of points, and I am pleased about the support which many have said they will give.
The biggest improvement can be achieved if we set great store by the preventive strategy, and I believe that that is a right and proper principle.
I turn now to the music and entertainment industry.
This is a much discussed subject in connection with which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has entered into a compromise, by which we stand, with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats.
I must not, however, disguise the fact that this is an impairment of the common position, and it is interesting that we now see a European Parliament that attaches less importance to protecting employees than the Council of Ministers does.
This is a new development, and I would ask the public to note the fact.
We support the compromise proposal because it has been important to us to avoid having the common position rejected in the European Parliament.
And, as we heard, there was a real risk of that happening.
That would have been clearly unacceptable for, then, employees would only have been protected at the 1996 level.
We have therefore accepted the compromise, and that of course also shows that we have been incredibly sympathetic to what the music and entertainment industry has told us in connection with this matter.
I would also say to my fellow MEPs in the House that we have perhaps sometimes been too sympathetic. By that, I mean in fact that some MEPs have not been critical enough of what the industry has said.
Rumours of the worst kind have circulated about this matter.
I have been accused of wanting to close down the whole of the pop industry in Great Britain and of wanting to prohibit the bagpipes in Scotland.
It is all complete and utter nonsense, of course.
Naturally, we must listen to what society around us says, but that does not mean we simply have to roll over. We have a compromise proposal I can live with.
I am in actual fact extremely satisfied with it.
It will mean that the entertainment industry will only be covered by the directive after five years and, in the intervening period, we shall call upon the Commission to carry out an investigation of how the directive will affect the music and entertainment industry.
The Commission will subsequently assess whether it is necessary to exempt the industry from the directive or to regulate it in some other way.
I believe this compromise proposal will make it clear how much exaggeration there has been in this matter and also make it clear that even people in the music industry are very seriously affected by the damage to their hearing that we are in actual fact trying to combat.
Finally, I wish to emphasise that I should like to have seen us achieve more in terms of improving workers' protection.
That has not been possible, but what is now crucial is that, tomorrow, MEPs support those proposals which in actual fact improve the common position and ensure that we attach more importance to the preventive side.
I urge all my fellow MEPs to support the proposals now tabled by the committee, together with the compromise proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, minimum health and safety standards are the core of European employee protection legislation.
The harmful negative effects of noise exposure are scientifically documented and we do not need to discuss them in detail here.
Noise-induced deafness is one of the most common occupational illnesses.
Measures to protect workers from noise thus have a high priority.
Everyone involved - workers, employers and legislators - should therefore seize every opportunity to keep noise pollution in the workplace as low as possible.
With regard to reducing the noise levels which people voluntarily submit to during their leisure time, however, there is little we can do, other than appeal to the individual to exercise common sense.
In agreeing protective measures for the workplace, however, we must also take account of the scope for their practical implementation - and especially the impact on small and medium-sized businesses.
There is little point in adopting highly complex rules at European level if they cannot or will not be complied with in practice.
In striking a balance, I believe that the amendments proposed by this House generally offer acceptable solutions.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur particularly for her willingness to compromise, which was already evident in the committee.
This defused a potential conflict over a significant change to exposure limit values and action limit values, without sacrificing the justified interests of employees.
With regard to the assessment of the noise exposure level, too, the provisions of the Council's common position on individual hearing protection should be maintained.
We also endorse Amendment No 8, which states that Member States may lay down values which are lower than the exposure limit values and the action limit values laid down in this directive where this is necessary with regard to the health and safety of workers.
This is entirely in line with the principle of minimum standards in European social policy.
We also make it clear that the employer is responsible for enforcing the wearing of hearing protectors and the provision of individual training.
As 'prevention is better than cure', a worker whose noise exposure exceeds the lower exposure action values will also be entitled to appropriate audiometric testing.
The use of a weekly noise exposure level in place of the daily noise exposure level under certain conditions is sensible, as envisaged in the Council's common position.
The aspect of this directive which triggered the most heated debate concerned the treatment of workers who are exposed to music, from classical/orchestral music to disco.
In my view, we take adequate account of this special area in the compromise proposed in Amendment 23.
I hope this is a solution which the Council can also endorse, for an immediate and unconditional inclusion of these events will hardly do justice to the general belief that music - whether in the concert hall or the night-club - is noise and should therefore be treated restrictively from the outset.
Mr President, many congratulations to the rapporteur.
She has produced a very well-balanced report.
It proposes sensible amendments which will not impose unreasonable burdens on firms, but which will improve the directive and reduce the risk of hearing loss resulting from exposure to noise at work.
That is what this proposal is all about.
Too many workers within the European Union continue to be at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work.
Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has shown herself to be reasonable and willing to listen to reasonable and reasoned argument and evidence.
She did, after all, withdraw many of her initial amendments, tabling new ones which move closer to, or back to, the common position on a number of elements including key action and exposure limit values.
But others in this House are straining to carve a new and retrograde path in the social field.
For the first time in conciliation in the social field we are seeing moves, particularly on the right and centre groupings of the House, to weaken significantly common positions established in the Social Affairs Council, and even, at times, to exclude significant sectors of activity from the legislation altogether.
We have seen this in relation to this proposal on noise and the parallel proposal on vibration.
Compromise Amendment No 23 on the music and entertainment sectors is a response to such a danger.
Do not get me wrong: it might conceivably be necessary to weaken the common position when new information or evidence previously overlooked comes to light, but in my view that has not been the case in the examples I mention.
We have instead seen something tantamount to a panic response to concentrated, manipulative lobbying and adverse media coverage fed by deliberate disinformation and misinformation.
These developments are to be deplored.
At least two factors seem to be at work.
Firstly, lobby groups have woken up to the pressure points in the codecision procedure.
They know how to apply political pressure, much of it far from evidence-based, on Parliament.
They think we are the weakest link, and the signal we are sending them is that they are absolutely correct.
Secondly, too many Members of this House delight in issuing press releases seeking to trivialise legislation that is entirely necessary, justified and proportionate.
They will not let facts get in the way of seeing their own name in print and it is not hard to see why so many ill-informed articles have appeared concerning this proposal.
They have been fed by grossly misleading or totally factually incorrect press releases and briefings from Members of this House.
I hope that we can all grow up quickly and bring a little more dignity and integrity to our role as co-legislator.
My own father finds it difficult to converse with my infant son because of industrially-induced hearing loss.
That seems to me a very good reason to promote sensible legislation like this.
Mr President, if the rapporteur's original draft report had gone through and had been accepted, it would have decimated industry across the EU.
Yes, by all means protect workers, but do not throw workers out of work!
It was essential that hearing protection should be taken into account, and I congratulate those industries and everybody else who convinced the rapporteur of the need to do so.
If this had not been the case, with the exposure limit set at 87, hammering steel at 95-100 decibels, bottling at 98 decibels, and pig-feeding at 100 decibels would have ceased to exist, as would the construction and mining industries.
Cement works and part of the engineering industry would have been decimated.
I recognise that the rapporteur has moved and I welcome that.
I welcome the fact that she has moved from daily measuring to weekly measuring in exceptional circumstances, but I would like her to move further to weekly measurements, to go back to the main body of the text as in the common position.
I am very pleased that we have got the compromise amendment on music and leisure, whatever the rapporteur says: to have five years' exemption for the music and leisure industry, for the Commission to do a report, and then to come back to this House, but to consult with both sides of industry.
I hope it goes through and I hope all MEPs will vote for it. Otherwise, we will have the ridiculous prospect of bar staff wearing ear-muffs when people go in to order a pint of beer.
I am also glad that we have a chance to debate this because if it had been rejected on a second reading in committee, we would have had no chance to debate this today in the plenary session - no chance to put forward the amendment to exclude music and leisure for five years, and Parliament's view would not have been taken into account.
So I say to those people who voted against the report in committee: if you had got your way, there is no way we would be standing here today.
Mr President, I will start by expressing my amazement at the speech by Mr Hughes, whom I usually experience as being a reasonably logical and calm person and who suddenly, as soon as there is any objection to this directive, from whatever quarter, is of the opinion that sinister forces are at work.
We are simply carrying out our task as parliamentarians and we listen to everyone, including people who are not directly involved in the process that leads to directives.
In my view, this Parliament is not indifferent to the cause of health and safety, nor to objections concerning the implementation thereof.
I am therefore delighted that we can conclude the second reading of the noise directive - forgive me for not using the correct title of the directive - this week.
According to the Dutch official dictionary, noise is defined as a harsh, unpleasant sound, including background noise, din, racket, roar and commotion.
In other words, it is a noise which any right-minded person will experience as disagreeable and which we can do without.
I am therefore astounded, even dismayed - and many a composer will be turning in their graves - that Beethoven is being likened to a drill.
According to the Council, the Commission and a number of fellow MEPs, being subjected to the noise of a hefty circular saw is actually worse than Tchaikovsky.
I do understand that this is not merely about whether the noise is irritating, but also whether it is harmful.
What I should like to point out is that different types of noise justify a differentiated approach.
I am of the opinion that the music and entertainment industry should fall outside the scope of this directive and be regulated in a separate directive.
The fundamental difference between noise and Vivaldi is as follows: in the music and entertainment industry, sound is the ultimate product, or at least an important component thereof.
Sound plays a central role in this industry.
Noise in a factory is a negative side-effect, which makes no difference to the end result of the activity - quite the reverse, in fact - if it is not there.
Music involves customers; it involves activities of great cultural value, especially for young people.
We would not prevent professional footballers from playing in excess of 45 minutes per week, would we?
That is the difference; that is what matters; we found a response to it other than levelling unjustified criticism at this side of the House, as though we have no care for musical technique.
We have, but we also care about the people concerned.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our European constitution, our Treaties, state that we are responsible for improving the workplace environment in order to protect the health of employees.
I have the impression that this has often been forgotten, especially in the context of this public debate.
The ignorance of the press - sometimes the quality press - also confirms this view.
In addition to the usual objections from industry, massive lobbying was, of course, carried out by the music industry as well - not the dark forces, but quite specifically the music industry.
This outcry raises three interesting points.
Firstly: The general public's lack of awareness that since 1986, employees in the music industry have been covered by a directive which is still in force.
All employees are covered, except for seamen.
This is now being rectified.
Secondly: It reveals the lack of monitoring in the Member States, for if better monitoring had been carried out, the groups affected - employers and employees - would not be in such a state of shock today.
Thirdly: It also shows, of course - and I say this critically - the very poor representation of employees' interests.
I would like to send the Commission a copy of a letter which I received from the Swiss Musicians Federation about a hearing in 1996, which shows very clearly, Mr Pronk, that damage to hearing is always to be taken seriously, regardless of whether someone works in the construction industry, ceramics, or a music company or orchestra.
(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)
Or even in Parliament, but fortunately, most of our colleagues are not as noisy as that!
Of course, there are rules at national level.
As a left-wing traditionalist, too, I believe that the state and the employer have a duty to protect workers from workplace hazards.
This is precisely our task, and in my view, with this directive, we have achieved this goal.
Mr President, the rapporteur has come a long way in recent weeks in terms of dumping some of her more extreme amendments.
However, I take little comfort from this.
I hope the rapporteur will not take this personally, as I know how much thought and work she has put into the report.
However, in my view, the amendments that remain are neither necessary nor helpful.
This is not just my own view.
