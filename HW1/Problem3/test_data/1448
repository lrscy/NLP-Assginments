The availability of the global repertoire should be preserved for all collective management societies through licences issued to users.
For this reason, as the report says, it is vital to prohibit any form of exclusive mandate between the major right-holders and the collective management societies for the direct collection of royalties in all Member States, given that this would lead to the rapid extinction of national societies.
The network of national societies should be preserved so that they all have access to the global repertoire and everything possible must be done to safeguard cultural diversity, in view of the indispensable contribution made by these national societies via what they do in their respective countries.
That being said, it is at least bizarre that a recommendation by the Commission has been deemed to be the right way to address the issue of CRMs, not least because, according to the Commissioner, the Commission is not yet au fait with the current state of affairs.
The Commission will hopefully welcome the call, in one of the recitals in the report, for it to draw up a proposal for a directive.
After all, it is clear that given what is at stake this proposal must be implemented as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs LÃ©vai for her report and for the hard work that she has done, but what a shame that Parliament had to grab at this report, otherwise it would have passed us by.
I want to add my voice to the choir of those who have already complained about the process, about the choice of method.
The Commission has the right to choose a recommendation, but it is a political choice and it has two effects.
First of all, in an area like this a soft law instrument may unfortunately give rise to uncertainty, to a lack of legal clarity, but more importantly it avoids this House.
It avoids democracy.
That cannot be acceptable and I think this is our biggest complaint, not so much about the content, but the way in which this has been done in an attempt avoid the legislator.
It seems to me even more startling, having participated in the last mandate of this Parliament, when we had a colleague, Mercedes Echerer, who spent months, even years, working on an own-initiative report in this area.
Parliament's interest in and commitment to this issue were well known, so to find ourselves coming back and being faced with a mere recommendation, with all its difficulties, faults and inconsistencies, is just not good enough.
I apologise for not having addressed the substance, but it is the process which concerns me most.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs LÃ©vai and Mr Mavrommatis for their excellent proposals.
This report is timely because intellectual and artistic property is now being called into question in the European Union.
On the undoubtedly legitimate grounds of the technology revolution, which is profoundly changing the way in which we access artistic creations and cultural assets, the Commission has been proposing for some months to reduce the pay of authors, composers, performers and all rightholders in general.
It fully supports the view shared by manufacturers and consumers that online distribution can be free of charge.
I condemn this deadlock, this illusion of free online services.
If creators and performers are no longer paid by copyright and related rights, one day there will no longer be any creation, any new music, or any new films.
What will we put on the network then?
We were able to stop the draft Commission recommendation, which attacked the system of compensation for private copying, but it is still on the table.
In each of our countries, we have transposed the 2001 Directive and safeguarded the status of rightholders.
The Commissioner for Competition has decided to put a stop to the territorial scope of national collective rights management societies.
The recommendation on the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for online music comes under the same dangerous concept.
It has also had a harmful impact, since the German and British societies have created one joint society to which a very important record producer has entrusted the exclusive rights to its international catalogue.
Mrs Levai is therefore right to challenge the Commission option, which relies more on an inadequate consultation process.
Her proposal, which safeguards local repertoires, does seem to us, however, to be a little too favourable to distributors and thus carries the risk of dumping, to the detriment of rightholders.
However, I hope that this report, in its current form, is adopted so that the Commission knows that, where very sensitive areas are concerned, the European Parliament refuses to see European law escape the legislator and wants all points of view to be taken into consideration without bias.
This is also what is meant by cultural diversity.
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too - just like Mrs Wallis - remember the last mandate of this Parliament, for this House has always had its problems with the rights management companies; I would refer the House back to the Echerer report, in which we demanded of the Commission a specific piece of legislation on their transparency and the regulation of them, to the Zimmerling report, in which this featured, and to the deliberations on the directive on copyright and related rights in the information society.
For those reasons alone it is perfectly right and proper that the Commission should be giving thought to how this problem should be handled, for it is not tolerable, in the long run, that there should be twenty-seven monopolies in this field and no internal market, but nor do we want these twenty-seven monopolies to be replaced by a few oligopolies, and that much became abundantly clear from the deliberations we had in committee.
I want, though, to take this opportunity to make it clear that rights management companies do not exist for their own sake alone; they are a sort of necessary evil, existing where they are needed, as mediators between those who create the product and those who use it.
Where that is not required - and such a situation is indeed conceivable - no rights management company is needed.
What I have learned, though, from many discussions and hearings - and not least from these companies lobbying activities - is that this business is much more complicated than we had originally thought.
In the course of the process, a lot of stakeholders changed their minds; the big management companies suddenly decided that they were all for liberalisation, because they worked out that the market would give them the chance to form an oligopoly, while many users suddenly changed their minds and decided against all-out liberalisation, in which they saw more drawbacks than benefits for themselves.
What is needed here, quite simply, is the very careful drafting of any proposal for legislation; it is self-evident that we have to do something about this, and that things cannot carry on the way they are, but our expectation is that the Commission should actually produce that proposal, and that we should then be able to get to grips with it with all the ways and means afforded by parliamentary debate.
That is the crucial message that this report carries, and that is also what we expect of the Commission.
My thanks go to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (FR) As far as boosting the growth of online music services within Europe is concerned, we agree with the Commission on the fact that the development of these services hinges on a change in the systems of collective management and of the granting of copyright licences at Community level.
Indeed, these improvements have become necessary as a result of the emergence of new services such as Internet radio, streaming and downloading services for which a fee must be paid.
The absence of a copyright licence in the EU has been one of the obstacles preventing new Web-based music services from reaching their full potential.
However, the European institutions must legislate with caution on collective management systems, which are highly complex.
In particular, they should keep a very close eye on the excesses of a system in which the freedom of rightholders to freely choose a management society within the EU would result in a concentration of rights and would undermine cultural diversity.
In this regard, we endorse the majority of the rapporteur's comments, together with the idea that a rights manager must be authorised to supply commercial users with a pan-European, multi-repertoire licence for the online use of musical repertoires, throughout the EU.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs LÃ©vai, and congratulating her on her work on the European Parliament resolution before us today.
Technical progress and the development of our civilisation have resulted in the emergence of a new generation of cross-border commercial copyright users. They are the suppliers of Internet music services.
This shows how the market in copyright and related rights is evolving and developing, which further confirms the need for the initiatives taken in this area.
The proper development of the European music market calls for a study to be undertaken on the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences for online music services and of the effects related to the socio-economic situation of the rightholders.
It is also important to ensure that the European market in online music services is able to develop freely without detriment to European cultural diversity.
The European Parliament resolution before us today deserves our support.
Nonetheless, it is essential for the Commission to undertake an in depth study of this problem.
The results of the study should be submitted to the European Parliament.
In addition, I should like to point out that as we engage in this debate we should also bear in mind how we might respond to future needs resulting from the nature of collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights.
Prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings (debate)
The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/49/EEC and Directives 2002/83/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2005/68/EC and 2006/48/EC as regards procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector C6-0298/2006.
Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular Mr Klinz for his excellent report on prudential assessments in the financial sector and for the amount of effort that has gone into achieving a common position between the three institutions.
We share Mr Klinz's view that this proposed directive will make the whole approach to acquisitions in the financial sector more effective.
We must clearly ensure that commercial decisions on acquisitions in the financial sector are clearly and transparently vetted by the relevant body.
Legitimate commercial decision-making must not be frustrated by overzealous bodies or by political interference.
Where both the acquirer and his target are under inspection, the bodies responsible must work together, exchange information and help each other out.
This will serve to speed up the assessments process.
It is frequently said that we should not indiscriminately open our doors to the invasion of capital from third countries or to the takeover of our institutions by big business.
I firmly believe that even though we have to protect the interests of our markets, our institutions and our consumers, we must continue to honour our commitments in international forums such as the WTO. We must also ensure that our trading partners also honour their commitments.
The current state of affairs is most encouraging.
Several institutions based in the EU have successfully penetrated third countries where they have concluded mergers and takeovers in the financial sector.
At the same time, however, we should not overlook problems in the EU, where organisations from some Member States have faced problems relating to the acquisition of firms in other Member States.
The purpose of this directive is neither to encourage nor to discourage acquisitions in the financial sector.
Our objective must not be to disturb the normal functioning of the market.
We must ensure, however, that there is a solid framework in place leading to the assessment, and then the approval or rejection, of potential acquisitions.
The key point here is that prudential assessments must not become the mere exercise of discretionary powers, as this would result in delays and obstructions and would be ineffective and uneconomic.
Also covered in the report are issues of hostile as opposed to friendly takeovers.
Hostile takeovers are part and parcel of the normal functioning of the market.
The Commission believes that the authorities should adopt a position in favour of such initiatives or against them.
Irrespective of whether an initiative is friendly or hostile, the decision rests with the shareholders.
There need to be willing sellers in any acquisition.
If, according to the directive, the prudential criteria have been met, there is no reason to query the value of agreements between willing purchasers and sellers.
To summarise: clear, fair and predictable approaches and processes are of vital importance to the proper functioning of the internal market.
I believe that with this directive we will remove the current ambiguity.
Thank you for your attention.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after a mere six months, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have come to an agreement on the revision of the directive on the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector.
It is thanks to the prompt work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and to the purposeful trilogue negotiations that it will be possible to complete this dossier before spring is out, on the assumption that ECOFIN, on 27 March, agrees to it.
That is visible evidence to the public that Europe, even with twenty-seven Member States, is capable of taking action and capable of taking important decisions quickly, even - as the Commissioner has just described - with a complex dossier such as this one.
It is for that reason that I should like, at the beginning of my speech, to briefly thank all those concerned for their good cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs Mr Purvis and Mr Muscat, the chairman of the Committee Mrs BerÃšs, and all those Members who have helped to make it a matter of probability that the directive will, tomorrow, be adopted by all of us, from whatever political grouping, in a block vote.
I would also like to highlight the constructive cooperation with the representatives of the Mediterranean states, whom we have been able to convince that their concerns about the fragmented shareholder structure that is so widespread in their countries have been taken into account.
Last of all, I extend warm thanks to the Finnish and German Presidencies of the Council and to the Commission, which have competently accompanied our project and ensured smooth cooperation.
We need this revised directive.
In the past, on more than one occasion, individual enterprises have failed to acquire shareholdings in other countries or to take over whole companies in them, simply for lack of an unambiguous legal framework that would have laid down uniform assessment criteria and hence a uniform procedure for the supervisory authorities.
That will now change.
The object of the draft directive put forward by the Commission last autumn is greater legal certainty, undoubted reliability and clearly-demarcated decision-making processes, and, since all the interested parties are agreed on these, we have therefore supported it.
All three institutions - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - believe that this is the direction in which we must go and that the highest possible degree of harmonisation is needed if people in all the Member States of the European Union are to be able to participate in the market under what really are equal conditions.
Nevertheless, there were, inevitably, differences of opinion on one point or another, particularly as regards the test period or what alternative courses of action might be available if the decision turned out to be negative, that is to say if the application for the acquisition of a shareholding or for the takeover of a whole business were to be turned down.
It did, however, eventually prove possible, through negotiations, for these problems to be resolved and for us to reach a consensus.
In future, then, cross-border mergers of credit institutions, insurance companies and investment firms will be made increasingly easier, and there are four reasons why this is the case.
Firstly, the supervisory authorities will, in future, have at most sixty days in which to rule on an increase in a holding.
That period will be able to be interrupted only once, and for a period of twenty days, for the purpose of obtaining further information when the potential acquirer is from another EU Member State, or for thirty days if from a third country.
Distinguishing in this way between companies from the EU and those from third countries takes account of the fact that the latter's supervisory and market structures are often not identical with those in the European Union, and that European authorities are therefore not always fully informed about circumstances in those countries.
It follows that the supervisory authorities must be allowed more time in which to obtain and evaluate specific information, while the companies from third states also need more time in which to prepare, translate and submit such information.
The different suspension periods make both these things possible without breaking WTO rules.
Secondly, the five test criteria are unambiguous and final, and they enable the Member States to use them to define the list of specific information that the potential acquirer must submit, which must include the mode of acquisition of the shareholding and the nature of the potential acquirer, so that less information will need to be sought in the event of straightforward and clearly understandable increases in holdings than in the case of those that are more complex and may involve more than one sector.
The intention is that, two years following the entry into force of this directive, the Commission will conduct a review to establish whether the requests for information are relatively similar across the Member States or whether a divergence is becoming apparent, and it may well be that the Commission will have to intervene and ensure that no such divergences occur.
Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, the supervisory authorities are required to cooperate closely, although it is specifically laid down that the final decision rests with the authority with jurisdiction over the targeted company, and it is this authority that must also give the reasons for any adverse decision.
It is not planned that the publication of those reasons be made mandatory, but the company whose plans for acquisition were thus turned down will be able to demand it.
It is equally possible that individual Member States will publish the reasons in accordance with their own laws.
Fourthly, the Commission wanted, for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with the directives, to have direct access to the documentation, but that we refused.
Our reason for doing so is that the directive will, in future, make for greater legal certainty and clarity.
I am firmly persuaded that this will amount to a further step closer to more cross-border consolidations and hence to an increasing integrated internal market.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Klinz for all his valiant work in getting this agreed.
Although we support the compromise with the Council, it does water down the Commission's original intent and, frankly, the Commission's original text would have been better in our view.
Mr Klinz, as I say, strove valiantly to keep as close as possible to the original intent and to improve on it.
My group would have been happy to have tightened it, with more transparency and less wriggle room for protectionists.
The Commission's original deadline of 30 days for a prudential assessment has been extended up to a possible 90 days for non-EU acquirers, but the crucial point here is that at least there will be an absolute deadline.
Thus, we can hope to avoid situations where a protectionist regulator can block a takeover by delaying tactics.
In the interests of transparency, we would have preferred disclosure of the reasons for a supervisor's decision, and this would have helped to develop a body of precedent and common practice around the EU.
Sadly, there is a continuing preference in some Member States for secrecy.
Once again, the threat of hedge funds was raised in the context of amendments tabled by my group, which were designed to avoid difficulties for investment managers.
We must get away from this knee-jerk reaction to hedge funds and private equity funds.
They are helping to improve our economy just because they are active and demanding shareholders.
I hope now that supervisors will be persuaded to work more and more closely together, exchanging information and building up relationships of trust. It is in their own interest and, more importantly, it is in the interests of the financial services industry and of the whole EU economy.
We are working towards a more open and competitive European market in financial services.
This particular result is not all that I and my group would have wished.
The fault for this lies mostly with the Council of Ministers, but we will be watching to see that it is operated in a proper spirit, rather than using every possible loophole and ambiguity to obstruct it.
We must turn lip-service to the Lisbon Agenda into action, and this is one small step in that direction.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (MT) The obvious result of this work is that we now have a clear timetable for how long regulators will take to carry out a procedure in the field of takeovers, and I believe that the remarkable result we have achieved is due to the excellent work of Mr Klinz and to the work we did together.
As with any compromise, we would obviously have all liked some things to have happened differently.
However, I feel that we have achieved a very good result.
I wholly agree with Mr Purvis that we now have a specific number of days at the end of which a decision will be taken regarding takeovers, and this is the greatest achievement that has taken place during these negotiations.
I also believe we have improved on the work of the Commission because we are giving the regulators the time needed to do their work.
It is futile to try to exert pressure in order to shorten the amount of time required to take a decision if this ultimately leads to a situation of more haste, less speed.
In this field, I believe that regulators, especially the small ones with fewest resources, must be given all the time they need in order properly to come to considered decisions on important matters such as this.
I believe that this is an extremely judicious step towards achieving a transparent and European perspective in this field.
Finally, although it is, unfortunately, technically impossible to include them in this legislation, the aspects we must take into consideration in advance include the social and corporate governance perspective in the field of takeovers.
This is not strictly related to the field of legislation, but it is an area that our citizens are asking us to consider in depth.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and support the ideas expressed by many colleagues.
However, I would also like to mention another aspect, quite often forgotten, especially by members of our Commission; namely, that we are talking about a process that is not new.
Financial groups are already operating in the European Union, and we know that for the uniform development of each country's market we have to ensure that these major groups do not crowd smaller enterprises out of the market, as these are the innovators and they are not in a position to trample the interests of consumers.
I can give you an example of my own country, where the major financial groups are so well established that they make profits of 90%, which clearly demonstrates that customers are suffering.
In other words, when making decisions about company acquisitions and takeovers and the formation of new financial groups, we must let the supervising bodies assess the structure of these groups and the extent to which these new financial groups will be amenable to innovation and will manage to respect their clients' needs.
We surely cannot overlook the fact that, while we are currently occupied with the activities of financial groups, they have still not clearly specified what would happen if one of their subsidiary firms in one country or another were not operating effectively, and, let us say, it were to go bankrupt.
We still have no reply as to who would compensate the clients.
I think this is a complex problem, one that has to do with organising better supervision.
Therefore, an essential part of the process is the supervision of mergers and capital enlargement in the financial market in such a way that it would be possible to defend the interests of small enterprises and consumers.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for today's outcome is a very positive one, in that it was achieved rapidly through the good cooperation of the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
The reason why a speedy result was necessary was that at the nation state level, there is an increase in protectionism, not only in the financial sector but also in others, for any Member State will be pleased if a company based there can invest in another country and take over businesses in it, but heaven help a company from another country that tries to do likewise; that is when they pull out all the stops and get tough, not only in the financial sector, but also in energy, as we have seen, for example, with Endesa and E.ON.
That is why action to deal with this became necessary.
I am glad that it was possible to agree on criteria and deadlines, but I have my misgivings about the role played in the debate by the supervisory bodies, who, back in the days of the 'Basel II' debate, had not done very much to clarify how they were supposed to monitor the integration of financial markets.
In saying this, I am certainly not advocating a European supervisory body, but, given the way the supervisory bodies in Europe have organised things, their primary interest is in staking out their national boundaries, and so the first move should come from us at the European level, and from the Commission, with an invitation being extended to the supervisors to engage in dialogue on the subject.
I would also like to say something about hedge funds, which Mr Purvis has already mentioned; although I agree with him wholeheartedly that these should not be demonised, I would like to see discussions - which I believe should include other parts of the world in particular - about the need for the Commission to act in this area, to conduct a one-off evaluation - of the kind that has become a permanent feature in other areas - of how hedge funds should be handled, of how the utterances from the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank on the stability of the financial markets should be understood, and to make a presentation on the subject.
Having heard what this House has had to say to the Commission, I get the impression that someone is now refusing to put in the work, and I would be delighted if someone were to pick up this ball and make progress in this area.
Commissioner Å pidla, there seem to be a lot of proposals being made in your area of responsibility, so perhaps you can fire up Commissioner McCreevy with the ambition to do likewise.
(ES) Mr President, cross-border issues and the acquisition of shares in banks, insurance and investment companies are less than in other sectors.
One barrier is the uncertainty in the procedures for prudential assessments before national supervisors, given the lack of criteria on the unity of the acquirer and the detailed regulation of the procedures.
The proposed directive deals with these problems and harmonises their treatment.
The amendments approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs make the requirements clearer, facilitate supervisory action, protect confidentiality and improve control.
Their result in general is positive and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Klinz.
One sensitive issue is that, in cases of great dilution of property with low participation, great influence can be achieved.
We have therefore defended the obligation to notify any significant participation and we support the idea of the Member States being able to set a transparency threshold of less than 10% for receiving information and determining its existence.
Mr President, like all my colleagues before me, I too would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Klinz.
All in all, we can be satisfied with the outcome of this directive. It supports a valuable aim: facilitating consolidation of the financial sector in Europe.
Without fluid financial markets, other forms of market integration will fail.
The financial world must show the way; it cannot be prevented from making decisions about investments and mergers by arbitrary restrictions, as has been the case until now.
From now on, the rules for national authorities will have to be transparent and strictly prudential in nature, and I am hopeful that they will stick to the letter of what has been agreed.
No more pseudo-prudential protectionism, please!
The decision by the competent authority on approval or rejection of the action should be as swift and as expedient as possible.
Just as has now been agreed in the directive, we are in favour of very tight deadlines for decisions.
Furthermore, actions which target investment gains first and foremost, and which do not alter ownership structures, need not arouse the kind of national fears we are seeing in the market.
Consolidation in the financial sector should, as far as possible, be about market incentives and conditions, not political considerations.
On the aggregation of holdings, let us also remain faithful to what has been agreed.
If the decisions on holdings are made by independent investment entities, there is no need to aggregate holdings inside one group of companies.
We have conglomerates in this market and we need to guarantee that independent actors can act freely.
This also concerns the hedge funds mentioned by my colleagues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Community action on the provision of cross-border health care (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Community action on the provision of cross-border health care, by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety B6-0013/2007).
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I am not sure whether I can say that we have come a long way since we first discussed this issue, but I can certainly say that we are on the right track.
You will remember that our first discussion on this issue was even before the final outcome of the Services Directive.
Parliament requested that a proposal on healthcare and health services should be brought forward and I promised that, as soon as the Services Directive was sorted out, I would do so.
That is what I did last September in bringing forward this proposal.
Many issues have been described already and I will try not to repeat them.
However, we tried to maintain, firstly, the special character of health, healthcare and health services in the European Union and to meet the challenge not only of achieving the social objectives, but also of benefiting from the internal market.
It is true that the Court set out the parameters and the rights in its judgment, but I believe that those rights should be seen not as a problem, but as an opportunity and I tend to agree with that part of the motion for a resolution.
We have the realities before us, as described by the European Court of Justice.
The point now is how to make them work for the benefit of patients, the Member States, national health systems and providers.
We can do this not only for patient mobility, but also for all other aspects of cross-border healthcare.
I agree that the ultimate target must be that a European citizen should be able to receive the best healthcare where he or she lives.
We should meet our aim of ensuring equality of health in the European Union.
However, we know that this is a long-term objective and also that, under certain circumstances, it may not be possible, feasible or even desirable, depending on the financial, as well as - most importantly - the scientific aspects.
Sometimes, we will still need to make use of the cross-border possibilities of healthcare.
As I have said, we launched the initiative in September 2006. The idea was to have a broad consultation, which ended on 31 January 2007.
In the communication we described and analysed all the problems and issues, which are complicated.
We have to follow a step-by-step approach.
We will need a package to sort out and deal with all the aspects of cross-border healthcare, but that does not mean that we have to wait until they are all resolved before we present a proposal: we can do that in phases.
We are now in the process of analysing the contributions.
We have had more than 270 from the Member States, from regional and local authorities, and from European national and regional organisations, representing patients, healthcare providers, health professionals, social security institutions, health insurance, universities, and hospitals, and even from individual citizens.
Although I do not want to prejudice the results of the in-depth analysis, it must be said that the first assessment confirms the need for Community action to address the range of issues set out in the consultation paper, for example, legal certainty and support for cooperation between health systems.
In addition, even though there are many different views on the details of specific aspects, the overall picture is clear: there seems to be potential added value for patients, professionals and health systems overall from some form of Community action on health services.
The Commission is in the process of analysing a summary of the report on all the contributions already published on our website.
A summary report of the contributions will be drafted to provide an idea of the views and ideas sent in and should be available this spring.
However, the views and the input of the European Parliament are extremely important to us and will be a determining factor.
We will ensure that any future proposals on health services under this initiative are consistent with ongoing work on services of general interest and, of course, on the ongoing modernisation of the regulations on the coordination of social security systems.
There has to be coherence and coordination among all these initiatives.
On the basis of the consultation and its outcome, the Commission plans to bring forward practical proposals later in 2007.
Our aim is to find a solution which provides real added value without creating more red tape and which respects the principle of subsidiarity.
Mr President, Commissioner, we remember all of the debates that we had in our Parliament, during the debate on the Services Directive, to exclude health services.
We felt that health was not a service like any other and that it was absolutely crucial to talk about it in a different way and, above all, not to regard health services merely as being an internal market.
Through its policies, the European Union is encouraging people to move around, and that inevitably has consequences for healthcare.
It obviously has consequences for health professionals, who have demands in relation to legal certainty, and, of course, for patients, who are anxious to receive quality care.
Hence there are a number of problems, as my colleague, Mr Bowis, has pointed out: language problems, the problem of monitoring care, the problem of the accountability of health professionals and of the quality of care.
I think it important to say that patient mobility must not under any circumstances lead to the dumping of health systems, or make health care less secure.
That is absolutely crucial.
Nor must the mobility of patients and health professionals create two categories of patient: those who can access other types of health care on the other side of the border and those who cannot.
It would therefore be interesting to further develop harmonised health indicators at European level.
The same goes for the completion of more exhaustive studies, which would enable us to better understand local needs and to do more to target those members of the public who are likely to seek treatment in another Member State, so that we can provide the most suitable legislative solution.
To do that, we need a mechanism for gathering data and for exchanging information among national authorities.
Finally, we need to keep a close eye on the current excesses with regard to self-diagnosis and self-medication via the Internet, which knows no bounds.
It is vital that we concern ourselves with patient information and have a genuine European label so that patients using the Internet can be provided with a viable form of security and information.
Commissioner, rest assured that you will have our full support and trust for the proposal that you will submit to us shortly.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, you know from our discussion in committee that this issue is extremely important for myself and for the PSE Group.
We see health services as one of the pillars of the European social model, and the underlying values of that model - universality, access to good quality care, equity and solidarity, to ensure that services are provided on the basis of need and not the ability to pay - are fundamental to us and to that model.
We feel that any initiative you take on cross-border healthcare should be built on these principles.
It should be about healthcare for all and not about market opportunity for some providers.
I think many other colleagues from different groups have already said this.
Mr Bowis talked about the legal certainty that is needed in a range of areas.
These are the questions that people write and ask me about.
They have heard about their rights, they are not sure how they can exercise them, so yes, we want a clear legal framework for patient mobility and for the movement of professionals, not just to give them rights, but so that citizens know that those healthcare professionals are properly qualified, are fit to practise and that information is shared between Member States.
Finally, Commissioner, you said that you recognised that healthcare has a special character.
The health ministers agreed a set of values and principles in June last year, and I wonder whether you will be taking that on board when you draw up your proposals later this year?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we strongly support the Commission's consultation efforts and the European Parliament resolution outlining the main priorities for public health in the future Community framework.
But we should think and plan more broadly: the final goal of future legislation should be better health for European citizens, not only when they cross the border, because by then it might be too late.

In addition to the resolution, I would like to call for your support on the following: basic standards for healthcare should be agreed in order to guarantee patients' safety and the quality of healthcare; the introduction of a common classification of health services, without interfering with Member States' competences on organisation, will create transparency for both patients and the financial institutions; and the 'one-stop shop' approach to be introduced in the Member States' health administrations will facilitate patients' choice and the right to complain.
The last issue I wish to emphasise is crucial for the full functioning of any new legislative framework on patients' rights: a common charter on patients' rights should be included in the future Community framework.
Patients should be able to exercise their rights in the European Union regardless of the ownership of medical facilities, national social security schemes, organisational management of the national health systems or whether medical treatment is provided in the home country or in another Member State.
All this is needed for a new European regulatory healthcare framework that would contribute to improving access to the best quality healthcare and to ensuring the safety and rights of all public and private patients in Europe, with particular consideration given to ethnic minorities - for example the Roma population - as well as refugees, migrants and the homeless.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Commissioner, the fact that thought is being given to cross-border patient mobility is, in itself, a good thing, but patient mobility, however, is entirely different from the mobility of commercial health services.
These terms are too often mixed up.
Discussion of patient mobility should not in any event lead to the national healthcare systems being undermined or to Member States passing the buck in an attempt to make their own health care systems reliable, whether in terms of quality or quantity.
Nor should it lead to the liberalisation of the healthcare market or force patients out of their own countries to seek care.
Patient mobility is a patient right and should certainly not become the excuse for applying the Services Directive to healthcare services.
This House has taken a clear stand against this and would be robbed of its credibility if it were now to take a different line.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I have only been allocated one minute's speaking time on the subject of cross-border healthcare, I shall be brief.
I simply wanted to point out that, although this brings real benefits to a specific group of patients who are in a position to choose treatment in different Union countries, there are also unfortunately very negative consequences for certain healthcare systems, as well as for many patients from the poorer Member States. These patients' access to health services is restricted because of doctors' migration or for financial reasons.
For the wealthy old Member States of the Union, the priority is to improve the development, competitiveness and security of their own healthcare systems, which are described as European.
The aforementioned countries take no account of the resulting costs to be borne by other far poorer countries.
One cannot fail to notice in particular that the rich are becoming richer and safer, whilst the poor are becoming ever poorer.
In addition, all this is being described in terms of sustainable development, equal rights and opportunities or as part of the principle of subsidiarity.
The latter has had a regrettable consequence for European citizens, namely that the lot of the rich and strong is improving at the expense of the poor and weak.
(SK) I regret to say that I regard the Commission's communication on healthcare services as unsatisfactory.
The Commission has failed to come up with adequate and specific proposals for coordinating healthcare provision, since such service provision falls under the purview of national authorities.
Furthermore, the communication unequivocally defends the notion that healthcare services should be regulated by the principle of free movement of goods.
In this regard I would like to emphasise that patients are not goods and healthcare professionals are not the same as other service providers.
The European Parliament subscribed to that principle some time ago, as it excluded healthcare provision from the Services Directive.
Despite the fact that cross-border health services only account for about 1% of healthcare provision, the Commission's communication focuses on patient mobility, cost refunds, etc. One should realise, however, that patients are not small-time traders and that patients do not seek healthcare abroad in order to generate savings but because such care is not available at home.
It is therefore, quite unacceptable that Article 95, which regulates the free movement of goods, should be the sole legal basis of the future directive.
The Commission should focus on other pressing problems in the European Union. For instance, on why the mortality rate due to colon cancer is 40% higher in Slovakia than in Sweden or on how the EU could contribute to improving healthcare quality, for example through the use of structural fund allocations more efficiently for healthcare purposes.
I only wish patients could join forces with health professionals to bring about change as effectively as farmers can.
Perhaps then we would see benefits going not only to farmers and cattle but also to human beings - in other words patients.
The Commission also draws our attention to recipient countries.
In this respect I would like to highlight the countries of departure.
In Eastern Europe we are beginning to see so-called white holes, or areas where there is a shortage of healthcare professionals.
(SV) Mr President, I want firstly to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for having put this excellent question to the Commission and providing the opportunity to hear the Commission's reaction to important questions put to it.
It also gives those of us in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection the chance to put forward what we think is important.
Health is an area in which the Member States have competence and in which the principle of subsidiarity applies.
That does not, however, mean that people should not be entitled to health care and medical treatment in other Member States.
We cannot maintain that we defend the patient's right to safe, high-quality care if we do not allow those who need, for one reason or another, to seek health care in another Member State actually to do so.
We must do our utmost to preserve these rights, in spite of the various problems of which all Members are so well aware - problems, yes, but also positive aspects, especially on the information side.
It is also obvious - or, in any case, it should be - that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice cannot be weakened by secondary legislation.
There is such a thing as established practice, and the Treaty gives everyone who wants to do so the right to make services available in another Member State, in full accordance, mind you, with the laws of that Member State.
As I see it, the Commission should withdraw all legislation in which the Member States and the governments try to limit existing primary law for patients or service providers.
It is important that the proposal produced by the Commission should be a step forward, rather than backward, and we have high hopes of Commissioner Kyprianou in this regard.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health services, which have been excluded from the Services Directive, constitute a crucial pillar of the European social model.
They contribute to social, territorial and economic cohesion, are a mission of general interest, and are also consistent with the Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission consultation must not be reduced to the free movement of health services, or aim at simply implementing an internal market in these services, as this would lead to a two-speed system, from which only the well-off and best informed patients would benefit.
The consultation must provide an opportunity to clearly define the role and added value of the Union, in order to guarantee a high level of health protection while respecting the national characteristics and powers of the Member States.
The mobility of patients and professionals must be guaranteed, with respect shown for the following fundamental values and principles: universality, solidarity, quality, security and durability.
It is imperative that a European legislative framework and, more specifically, a directive on health services, be adopted in order to increase the legal protection of patients, health professionals and health insurance systems and thus to restore the confidence of all Europeans in all Member States.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health knows no frontiers, or at least, one hopes that that is the case.
In exactly the same way health services should not stop at borders either, in other words, they should be of high quality and available to every citizen of the EU wherever he or she may be.
We are now at the beginning of a debate rather than the end of one, so a vigorous debate is desirable and will get us where we want to go; health is not a commodity, and the internal market is, after all, no more than the space within which these services are provided.
These services need to be subject to special rules, with questions relating to the guarantee of quality provided, patients' safety, the safety of medicines and of medical products, to redress in the event of faulty or failed procedures, and to centres of excellence being examined in depth.
The patient, who is to be protected, is the subject of particular concern, being, in cases of doubt, the weaker party, and often, indeed, the one who is at the mercy of others.
We are, as matter of principle, in favour of patient mobility and of the mobility of service providers, but reimbursement, which is a quite essential element in the cross-border trade in medical services, is subsidiary, and this has to be made plain right now, even though things are only at an early stage.
I do not, at present, see any chance of a European health insurance fund, and do not indeed think one is germane to our purpose, on the grounds that all the 27 national systems have their own problems, and, here too, where reimbursement is concerned, we are talking not about an open market, but rather about state-run and dirigiste systems.
In my own country, which has an extraordinarily complex system of payment to beneficiaries, such an opening-up would raise at once the discrimination against the country's own nationals, since the benefits paid are capped rather than open-ended.
It think it still appropriate that primary responsibility for this dossier should remain with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rather than with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate, which will be very useful and will provide guidance for us in the next steps of drafting a proposal, along with the outcome of contributions from the other stakeholders, from consultations and from the Member States.
Just to cover a few issues: first of all, we will certainly be taking into account the health objectives and social values adopted by the health ministers last June, and this will be one of the considerations in our proposal.
At the same time, we will also be looking at the important issue of patients' rights, which is part of our consultation on Community action.
It is clear that we will look at these issues; what tools will be used will, of course, be decided after proper analysis of the consultation and based on the responses provided.
I would like to confirm that what we plan to do is to take a step forward and not to reduce or undermine patients' rights as recognised by the Court, but to improve them and make them work, make them more concrete, and to make it possible to apply them equally among all European citizens.
Information is an important factor in this respect.
As we have already stated, we will take subsidiarity into account.
However, I have to remind you first of all that we do not propose harmonisation of national health assistance - this is not the intention.
But, at the same time, I have to remind you of the European Court of Justice judgment on the Watts case, which provided that there are situations where Member States, based on other Treaty provisions, will have to apply to amend and adjust their national healthcare systems.
Finally, I think there is a misunderstanding here.
First of all, there are no proposals in the communication because it is precisely a consultation document.
We did not want to pre-empt the positions of Parliament, the Member States and the stakeholders, so it is intentional that there is no proposal at this stage.
It is just a description of the problems.
Freedom of movement and patient mobility is not something which is being introduced by the European Commission - I think we discussed that in the past as well - it is something which has been recognised, whether we like it or not - and I hope we like it! - by the European Court of Justice, which has established that the internal market rules apply also to health, even if this is publicly funded.
So this is not a question of a Commission initiative introducing a new concept but how we in the Commission, together with Parliament and the Member States, can make this concept, this reality, work for the benefit of patients without being to the detriment of the national healthcare systems, their viability and their operation.
This is a big challenge for us but I think it is a big opportunity as well, and we can make it work for the benefit of citizens.
To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
One share, one vote - Proportionality between ownership and control in EU listed companies (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the oral question to the Commission on one share, one vote, by Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B6-0014/2007), and
the oral question to the Commission on the proportionality between ownership and control in EU listed companies, by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0016/2007).
author. - (FR) Mr President, thank you for allowing this debate to be organised on the 'One share, one vote' oral question.
On 26 September 2006, a joint press communiquÃ© from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI) informed us that they had won the contract to compile a study on the 'one share, one vote' principle.
This is a point which our Parliament, during a previous parliamentary term, debated at length, not least at the time of the report on takeover bids.
At the end of that long, well-argued and transparent debate, it was decided that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States would be allowed a certain amount of freedom regarding the 'one share, one vote' strategies, so as to define the way in which these strategies would work.
The importance of management and of the other players as parties to corporate governance, whether they be employees, creditors, customers or suppliers, was also greatly emphasised on that occasion.
Nevertheless, as far back as October 2005, Mr McCreevy was confirming his determination to undermine the balance that had been reached at the time of the debate on the Directive on takeover bids, even before the workings of that directive had been evaluated and, what is more, even before that directive had been completely transposed into the Member States' domestic law.
At the same time, when considering the issue of shareholders' status within companies and of seeing which shareholder strategy would be most conducive to an industrial strategy and to the development of Europe's strengths as a business location, we see day after day that it would be beneficial, at times, to open a debate on the issue of building loyalty among one branch of shareholders.
Finally, we are aware of the importance that the current Commission, under Mr Barroso, attaches to impact studies, especially when it comes to defining the right strategy to be followed.
At the time when this debate was launched, I said, 'tell me whom you propose to have carry out the impact study, and I will tell you what their conclusions will be'.
It seems to me that, in this instance, it is very likely that I will be able to predict those conclusions, insofar as those who have won the contract to carry out the study on the 'one share, one vote' principle are well known for having on many occasions advocated this very principle.
We are therefore obliged to ask some questions, and that is the subject of the debate that we are going to initiate.
Why fund a study to the tune of EUR 450 000 when we already know what its outcome will be?
What is the advantage of giving lobbies the means to fund their arguments, which are glorified by the results of a study backed by the European Commission?
I very much doubt that the joint contractors selected to carry out the study will really meet the general criteria of independence and objectivity that are required.
It is also important to point out in this regard that, at the same time, in the United States, ISS's activities are coming under more intense scrutiny from the financial markets supervisor, the SEC, and from the New York Stock Exchange, suspecting, as they do, a high risk of conflict of interest.
Like the SECSI and the New York Stock Exchange, we should be alert to the disproportionate accumulation of information and influence by some large players in the chain of intermediaries and advisors involved in the exercise of shareholders' voting rights in companies, and not react impulsively by giving added weight to those very shareholders.
Let us remember that, when our Parliament had the opportunity in July to give its verdict on the recent developments in, and prospects for, company law, it requested an objective analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence regarding the effects of the different ownership models in the Member States on economic efficiency, owner-control of businesses and the possibilities for cross-border transactions.
At the time, however, we also requested a sound analysis of corporate law as regards the wider economic and legal context in the Member States and the different models of corporate governance.
I do not have the impression that what the Commission has started by endorsing the proposal for a study by these two institutes provides us with the conditions for a debate that is equal to the challenge represented by the 'one share, one vote' issue.
I hope, Mr Kyprianou, that you will be able to convey the concerns of this House to the Commissioner responsible, Mr McCreevy, and that, once the conclusions of the study are on the table, these concerns will be firmly established in people's minds so that we can hold a responsible and effective debate on this issue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mrs BerÃšs has just said, for the subject matter of both oral questions is, in principle, quite similar.
The reason why the Takeovers Directive is the way it is is that the 'one share - one vote' principle does not exist in Europe, and that has to be spelled out plainly.
Another reason why it is the way it is is that, back when the Takeovers Directive was being hammered out, it was not possible to secure the acceptance of the 'one share, one vote' principle.
I was prepared to accept it at the time, but neither here in this House nor in the Council could the necessary majorities be found to support it.
I think that those who speak in public debate read too much into the report that the Commission has now put forward on the implementation of the Takeovers Directive, for the report, in fact, says nothing more or less than that the directive has, by and large, been properly implemented by the Member States, which have availed themselves of the option provided by it, which is precisely the intention behind the legislation.
Things will get interesting, though, only when the Commission does as the Takeovers Directive itself requires and, in 2011/2012, produces its first report on the use to which the Directive is put, for then we will have reached the point at which we will be able to arrive at conclusions as to whether what we have done with it - that is to say, setting a benchmark and leaving things to market forces - has or has not been successful, or whether it will then be necessary to consider further legislation, but that point will be reached only in 2011 or 2012, when we have the first definite report on the application of the directive; it has not been reached now.
I might add that we - by which I mean this House and the Council as legislator - laid down, by a large majority, certain things on a wide variety of issues currently under discussion, including, back then, the Takeovers Directive, insisting, for example, that the so-called 'break-through rule' - which is, of course, the decisive benchmark - should apply to all pre-bid and post-bid defences, although there would, of course, be certain exceptions to it.
We did not include those aspects that present no obstacles to takeovers, and we did this on the basis of simple accounting examples and the results of simple mathematical procedures, one of these being the so-called preference shares, which were exempted from the 'breakthrough rule' from the very outset.
Why was this so?
One reason why was that the owners of preference shares are paid more than are others; a second was that company law limits them to a maximum of 50% of capital, so that they can never, in fact, tie down more of the capital than can the actual ordinary shares, which carry with them an entitlement to vote.
It was for similar reasons that we, at that time, exempted French shares with double voting rights from the breakthrough rule, one reason for this being that these were not voting shares of a particular class, that might be said to be guaranteed in the long term, but rather intended to reward long-term investment, with these voting rights being converted, after a certain period of time, into normal voting rights; the second being that, with the breakthrough rule, the reaching of 75% - which is, as a rule, the quorum at which the breakthrough can kick in - no longer raises the issue as to whether the shares are double-vote or ordinary.
If I hold them, I always have a majority in the general meeting.
That is the reason why we made an exception for these voting rights.
We did, however, include multiple voting rights and limitations on voting rights in the breakthrough rule, since these are real obstacles to takeovers.
Here, too, one finds the peculiar situation that there is a disparity between ownership on the one hand and control - that is to say, majority by number of votes - on the other, and we took the view that the application of the breakthrough rule to these would be justified in so far as companies or Member States avail themselves of this option.
I just want to reiterate something to which Mrs BerÃšs has referred, namely that we, in the Szejna report, forcefully put forward the view that market forces should, in the first instance, be allowed free rein, so that we could see how this directive proved itself in practice, and that we would decide whether further steps were needed when the Commission, in 2011/2012, had brought out the first report.
Having now heard that the Commission is mulling over the idea of producing a recommendation on this subject, let me be quite frank in saying that I am less than enthusiastic about this, and that for two reasons, the first of which is that we, in this House, take an increasing sceptical view of recourse to this sort of 'soft law'.
Moreover, the Commission is also running the risk of this House adopting such a recommendation in the form of an own-initiative report, into which it would put something quite different to what the Commission, in its recommendation, has envisaged, and if that happens, the recommendation will be rendered worthless, for a recommendation is effective only if it can be taken as read that the legislator will be prepared, in subsequent proceedings, to support such a regulation, but if the legislator says 'no' to it, the recommendation is of no value.
The second reason is that I am not wholly clear in my own mind as to what such a recommendation would be meant to accomplish.
In Article 10 of the Takeovers Directive, we laid down comprehensive rules on transparency according to which all enterprises have to set out openly all the existing obstacles to a takeover.
Those transparency rules are stringent, and I wonder just what the recommendation is meant to achieve over and above that.
There is yet another reason for this question, and the wording of the Committee on Legal Affairs' question alludes to it.
We are of course interested to know what view the Commission takes of the development ushered in by the Advocate-General's summing up in the Volkswagen case, when he, for the first time, had to deal, not with traditional golden shares, but with restrictions on voting and other rules, and he saw these as being contrary to the Treaty in much the same way as golden shares are.
Do we actually need to legislate if the ECJ follows this ruling?
Does it not mean that all obstacles fall away of themselves?
It would be interesting to hear the Commission's view of this.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their questions.
My colleague, Mr McCreevy, regrets that he cannot be here this evening, but I can assure you that he will be informed of the results and content of the debate this evening.
It is true that a study was launched in September, and its intention is to cover the various aspects of proportionality between capital and control, how this is applied or not applied in the Member States, how it affects the deviation from the principle and how it affects institutional investors.
The study was also designed to analyse the relevant regulatory national frameworks.
The contractors were chosen in the usual simple way.
There was a public invitation to tender and the choice was simple.
The best author was chosen and the specific contractors made and presented the best offer.
However, I have to clarify two things: there will not be an impact study, so research will be carried out in a factual way on the current situation in the Member States, and no proposals or recommendations will be brought forward.
Both the contractors and the subcontractors have a strong record of original, independent, high-quality research in areas of company law and corporate governance, and their European presence constitutes a significant advantage in terms of providing comparative analysis covering different legal traditions.
The subcontractors are of high standing and specialise in corporate law and securities regulation, and the study team provided the best offer based on scientific competence, professional reputation and integrity.
As already mentioned, the study will cover multiple voting rights, non-voting preferential shares, company pyramids and other instruments which fulfil the same function of protecting controlling shareholders, and the study will include golden shares and the attribution of special rights for public authorities, as already mentioned.
In this respect, the Commission has noted at this stage the Advocate-General's opinion on the Volkswagen law.
The Advocate-General considers this to be as an unjustifiable restriction that infringes EU law.
The Commission awaits the Court's judgment.
As far as the directive on takeover bids is concerned, we know it aims at eliminating certain defences applied by companies in takeover situations.
One such defence for companies is to leverage voting rights vis-Ã -vis capital, but experience shows that, faced with potential takeovers, the vast majority of Member States are reluctant to neutralise their companies' disproportionate voting rights.
Nevertheless, it is still early days for the implementation of a directive.
The Commission does not intend to reopen a debate on the takeover directive at this stage.
Whatever the policy indications the Commission draws from the proportionality study are, they will not apply to takeover bids.
The Commission believes that these two should be considered as two separate initiatives.
To conclude, I would like to emphasise that a decision on any future steps on the issue under discussion on the proportionality issue will be taken in the light of the outcome of the study.
Whether we present a proposal, and what the content of this proposal will be, will depend on the outcome of the study and of the impact assessment that is currently being carried out in parallel.
We are therefore still at the study and first procedural phase.
We will, as always, take very seriously the position and the views of the European Parliament.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we must thank Mr Kyprianou for being with us until so late, although the discussion would probably have been much more interesting if Commissioner McCreevy had been with us, since we hold a constant dialogue with him on this kind of issue.
It is clear that this discussion has hardly begun.
Parliament and the Council adopted the directive on concentrations of capital.
We have recently adopted a directive on the rights of shareholders, and it is clear that fundamental problems are emerging with regard to the structure of companies.
The democratic principle of 'one vote, one share' is not currently functioning throughout the European Union and, as Mrs BerÃšs pointed out, we are now facing the possibility of great market manipulations by means of certain operators.
It is clear that impact studies can be useful, but impact studies are only useful if they are carried out properly.
This Parliament's concern is that wolves should be put in charge of the sheep, so to speak.
In other words, if impact studies are carried out by big companies that specialise in market manipulation, then those companies' recommendations are naturally going to move in the direction of greater market manipulation.
As Mr Lehne has pointed out, the Court of Justice's virtual decision on the Volkswagen affair is going to have an impact on the future development of European Union law, but this Parliament does not want the Commission to take the recommendation route, the so-called European Union 'soft law' route, under any circumstances.
A more appropriate route is legislation, although it may not yet be the time to legislate, bearing in mind that we have not yet had an assessment of what is happening in the field of concentrations of capital.
There is currently a kind of great revolution going on in Europe in relation to concentrations of capital, with great political involvement and great uncertainty in cross-border operations, given the co-existence, for example, of public protection systems and private systems.
This issue is of very great significance politically speaking, but it also has certain legal aspects.
I believe that it is important that we point out, firstly, that Parliament does not take a positive view of what is known as 'soft law', which requires legislative status, that Parliament welcomes impact studies, but that they must be carried out objectively and not be left in the hands of sectors that may carry them out in a way that benefits themselves, and that there may not be any need to rush into any kind of legislative measure without having studied the situation first.
I believe, however, as I said before, that we are at a time of great change throughout the European Union's system, and the consolidation of a European law in the field of concentrations and shareholders' rights requires much more study and above all much more cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
I hope that Mr Kyprianou will communicate to Mr McCreevy our interest in this issue, our concern and our desire for Parliament and the Commission to carry on discussing it as we should do.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the principle of 'one share equals one vote' is a very attractive one in what is termed 'shareholder democracy', and Commissioner McCreevy - who is responsible for these things - fears that any deviation from it might diminish transparency and curtail the shareholders' rights, but modifications do not necessarily have to be damaging in their effects, for they can bring with them more competition and innovation, while at the same time taking account of the different types of shareholders, who have differing interests and behave in different ways.
The Commission is now planning to publish, in the autumn, a recommendation on the principle of proportionality between capital and control, which will be based on the results of an extensive study.
Mr Lehne has already referred to the problematic aspects of this recommendation, and Mrs BerÃšs has - I think rightly - surmised that a survey entrusted to ISS, the European Corporate Government Institute, and Sherman [amp] Sterling might well not be as objective as the matter in hand might require, and so I appeal to the Commission to delay its practical proposals until after extensive and objective consideration of how things stand in Europe and after a critical and all-embracing assessment of our experience with the Takeovers Directive.
What is important in this is that consideration be given to the advantages and disadvantages of all systems deviating from the 'one share, one vote' norm, whether pyramid structures in Italy, preferential shares in Germany, double voting in France or the 'A' and 'B' shares found in the Nordic countries.
We have to carefully distinguish between, and balance against each other, the desire to make the shareholder's control proportionate to the shares he owns and the company's desire for contractual freedom, between stable shareholding structures on the one hand and sufficient discretion on the other, with it being guaranteed in each instance that any deviation from the 'one share - one vote' standard will be transparent, and that the shareholders are entitled to know whether or not the shares they own or acquire limit their ability to play a part in determining the business's direction and their control over the way it is managed.
(NL) According to this morning's Dutch papers, ISS, the company we are talking about, is advising its customers to thwart the plan to pay out an extra loyalty dividend to the shareholders who leave their shares in that company for three years or more at the forthcoming shareholders' meeting of DSM, a major Dutch multinational.
I think this plan by DSM is, in fact, a fantastic idea to promote responsible shareholdership.
Extra dividends could be a means to achieve this, but so could higher vote weighting, which could be another legitimate form.
This is why I have always opposed those who persistently advocate what they call shareholder democracy on the 'one share, one vote' principle.
This was broached for the first time when we discussed the Take-Over Directive.
The original intention of the thirteenth directive was certainly not to create the kingdom of corporate control by shareholders on earth, but simply to protect minority shareholders and allow for a decent buy-out.
A handful of fanatic interested parties, however, managed to make this one share, one vote idea absolute, the key advocate being ISS. Not only based on ideological motives, but also because their trade simply consists in collecting voting rights and granting proxy services to shareholders.
With all due respect for the Commission's statement, I consider it highly unusual that an inquiry should be launched within a party that is so outspokenly prejudiced and implicated.
I have just been familiarising myself with the way the inquiry was conducted; I have seen the questionnaires that are still being circulated among investment companies on the one hand and companies on the other, in which companies are simply being asked whether they use certain Control Enhancing Mechanisms (CEMs), including pyramid structures, certification, gold shares, and suchlike, while investors are approached in a totally different way, being presented with a number of leading questions that gauge their views about all these bad measures.
I can probably predict the outcome of this inquiry.
In a nutshell, I already have major reservations about the outcome of the inquiry and do not think it can be a sound basis for further conclusions and intentions, such as drafting recommendations.
We should first of all look into the reasons why companies have these CEMs and why, in this day and age, in which shareholder activism on the part of hedge funds is rife, there is a renewed need for protection against short-term investment activity.
A fundamental debate with this House will be needed before the Commission is ready to develop any measures or any further activity.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for the debate.
I will be very brief.
First of all, I would like to say to Mr Medina Ortega that I am sorry that I could not stimulate a more interesting debate, since I am not the Commissioner responsible.
However, it was very interesting for me because it reminds me of my previous life as a lawyer.
I find these issues extremely interesting.
Let me assure you first of all that I will of course brief and inform my colleague.
However, I understand that you will all have the opportunity to discuss these issues further with the Commissioner responsible because he will be attending both the ECON and JURI committees sometime in March and all these issues will be taken into account.
I would like to repeat that what the Commission does will depend on the study and the impact assessment.
With regard to the study, the choice of contractors was made on the basis of our rules and regulations, taking into account the requirement of the European Community.
Again, I would like to remind you that it is a factual study that will not put forward recommendations.
This will be done by the Commission itself.
So, I am sure that the outcome will be a balanced and proportional view, depending of course on the results of the study.
(FR) Mr President, we have listened carefully to the Commissioner's reply.
Nevertheless, the message that needs to be conveyed to Mr McCreevy is as follows: we certainly cannot tell what the Commissioner will make of the results of the study, but our concern stems from the study itself, even before the results are known, given the issues that have been outlined by the authors of this study.
I believe that this is the message that needs to be conveyed to Mr McCreevy.
Mrs BerÃšs, I am sure that Commissioner Kyprianou has understood you perfectly.

Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order under Rule 166 concerning Annex II(A) of the Rules of Procedure of this House.
I tabled an oral question to the Commission which was supposed to be answered today and I have received a formal answer from the Presidency saying that my question was not acceptable, apparently in application of Annex II(A) of the Rules of Procedure, which says that a question cannot be admissible if it has been answered in the previous three months.
But no such question has been answered in the previous three months.
Apparently this provision is being applied with regard to a reply given by the Commission to an oral question with debate.
Well, Annex II, which is quoted by the Presidency, applies to questions by MEPs regulated by Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, and the oral question with debate is regulated by Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure.
So, since Annex II is a restriction of the rights of a Member of Parliament, an extensive interpretation could not be allowed to apply Annex II to questions in Rule 108 instead of Rule 109.
So, I would ask the Presidency to reconsider and to allow the question to be tabled in application of the Rules of Procedure.
We will look into it and inform you accordingly.

Annual political strategy 2008 (debate)
The next item is a statement by the Commission on the Annual Policy Strategy for 2008.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, Honourable Members, I am indeed very pleased to present you with the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2008 and I am of course looking forward to a valuable political discussion.
Let us first take a quick look over the context for the next year.
In two weeks, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, and the Berlin Declaration will be adopted.
The year 2008 should be an opportunity to look forward.
We hope that the roadmap to be agreed by the Council in June will create the conditions for achieving a clear and constructive institutional settlement next year.
This is necessary because Europe needs reform.
It would also allow us to send a positive signal before the European elections.
Meanwhile, we will see further consolidation of the Union.
In 2008, we expect to see a number of Member States joining the Schengen area.
We also hope that additional Member States could adopt the euro as soon as they fulfil the criteria.
On the future financing of the European Union, and as agreed by Parliament and the Council, in 2008 the Commission will be working to present a review of the budget.
In a few months we will launch a broad consultation to allow citizens, stakeholders and those involved with institutions to express their views on the priorities of the EU and the resources needed to address them.
The strategic objectives defined by this Commission at the beginning of its mandate remain valid: 'prosperity, solidarity, security and a strong and open Europe in the world' still summarises the core ambitions of the Commission, and we are happy to see that both Parliament and the Council have backed us.
In the modern world, a number of highly important issues are not confined to just one or the other of the strategic objectives.
They need to be taken forward together across policy areas, and I see three of these as being particularly important for 2008 in the APS.
Firstly, energy and climate change.
The very positive results of the European Council last week with clear, binding decisions were built on the proposals presented by the Commission in January which brought fresh ideas and policy directions in Europe.
Now we must deliver.
Whilst we hope to have practical proposals on energy on the table in the third quarter of this year, much work will be needed in 2008.
The key elements of the energy package must be put in place.
A well-functioning internal market, a vibrant, renewable sector, energy efficiency and solidarity and interconnection will all be taken forward.
We will also push for strong commitments by the EU and global stakeholders to reduce CO2 emissions beyond 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol expires.
Secondly, the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs remains the main instrument for promoting a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive Europe.
We are making good progress in partnership with the Member States.
Next year we will reflect on how to press ahead with further reforms.
Following on from the single market review and the social reality check which will be presented this year, the Commission will launch a series of initiatives to make sure that the single market continues to deliver on its economic promises and that it allows citizens to reap the benefits.
Thirdly, migration in its various facets is a key challenge for the European Union.
Properly managed labour migration can make a positive contribution to our economies and to our societies and we will present two draft directives in this field.
We also plan to propose further measures to achieve a common European asylum system by 2010.
We will also need further action on preventing illegal migration, combating the ruthless business of human trafficking and protecting our common external borders.
Let me now come back to the strategic objectives and give you a few examples of other key initiatives.
As concerns prosperity beyond the continuing consolidation of the internal market, 'greening' the transport sector will be a key theme, with action on urban transport, legislation on nitrogen oxide emissions from aviation and on emissions from ships.
The Commission will also take preparatory action to ensure the European Institute for Technology is operational as from 2009.
In the field of solidarity, the Commission will present a health check of the common agricultural policy, which will pave the way for the future CAP.
Based on social stocktaking and the mid-term review of the implementation of the social agenda, the Commission will propose initiatives to promote solidarity and access of citizens to rights and opportunities as well as action to tackle discrimination outside the labour market.
We also intend to propose a new EU action plan on drugs and initiatives to tackle child poverty and protect children using the internet.
To promote security and freedom, we plan to propose new measures for managing our external borders and to set up a European surveillance system to help Member States to deal with growing flows of illegal immigrants.
To support the fight against organised crime and terrorism, we expect to see a centralised data base of fingerprints becoming operational and the Commission will also launch a policy to tackle violent radicalisation.
Ensuring internal and external coherence and fighting for a Europe with a strong voice in the world will be another key area for action.
We are ready to play a strong role following a status settlement for Kosovo and we will continue the accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey.
We will pursue negotiations on new agreements with Russia and Ukraine and develop our ties with key partners.
As regards trade policy, alongside continued efforts to deliver the Doha Development Round, action will centre on the Global Europe external competitiveness agenda.
The Commission will also work closely with Member States and partner countries to make sure that the European consensus on development makes good progress and strengthens our partnership with the African Union.
I would like to say a few words on better regulation, which, as you know, informs all the Commission's work.
I am convinced that the Commission and Parliament have a mutual interest in cooperating even more closely than today in this area.
Cooperation means agreeing on common priorities and on strategic choices.
The Commission's strategic review on better regulation of November 2006 set out our political priorities in detail, taking into account the views expressed by the European Parliament in its April 2006 part-session, which was devoted to this issue.
If need be the Commission will be ready to come back and discuss better regulation in more detail with Parliament.
Let me also emphasise a novelty in our strategy for 2008.
Following the example of the work programme for this year, communication priorities are an integral part of our policy strategy, focusing our messages on a limited number of issues that are of key concern to people, and communicating these clearly reflects and contributes to our overall communication strategy.
Finally, I would like to underline the criteria that we applied for ensuring an allocation of staff which matches our policies.
Additional resources will be used exclusively to cover needs due to enlargement, whereas all other needs will have to be served through internal redeployment within the Commission.
The presentation of the annual policy strategy marks the beginning of a process leading to the adoption of the Commission's legislative and work programme at the end of this year.
I feel strongly committed to this process, even though it could still be improved.
Together we should make the dialogue between the committees and the Commissioners more political.
In the resolution adopted last year, Parliament expressed its intention to involve the political groups more consistently and at an early stage of the procedure.
I hope that this will be the case.
A political, frank and constructive dialogue between our two institutions on where Europe should put its political weight and where it should invest its resources in the next year is of major importance, so let us work together for the benefit of Europe.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is nice that you were able to come after all, Commissioner.
We are glad you are here.
We have no cause to be over critical, since the presence of Members is in inverse proportion to the importance of this project.
This debate makes sense if, when formulating the final legislative programme in the autumn, the Commission listens to what Parliament has to say.
A number of my fellow Members will be commenting on the details.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats) is in principle prepared not only to give the Commission's work its political backing in Parliament, but also to go along with the objectives it defined at the beginning of its mandate: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom.
I am pleased to confirm that, starting from these objectives, you are also developing the correct political measures for the areas on which we now have to work: growth, employment, climate change, energy, the knowledge-based society, consolidation of enlargement.
We can argue about the details.
I have one criticism of what you say, Commissioner.
You announce a common European asylum system for 2010.
Forgive my saying so, but the Treaties open the way for minimum standards in these fields, but not for a harmonised European asylum system.
Please check very carefully where you are leaving the level of the Treaty here.
That is a sore point for me.
This legislative programme is interesting not for what it contains but for what it does not contain.
You say in the introduction that these measures meet the citizens' expectations of where Europe should act.
You paint a picture of a Union that is able to respond to the challenges of globalisation.
Over all, you draw a comparatively rosy picture of this European Union, especially so far as the citizens' expectations are concerned.
If that is the case, then why did the citizens of France and the Netherlands say such a clear No to Europe?
The Treaty itself hardly gave them any reason to, hardly any of them read it.
There is a deep unease about the European Union, and if you investigate that unease, you find there is a reason for it - not the only reason, but a reason nevertheless - and that is European bureaucracy.
It gives many people the feeling they are having their minds made up for them and having policies forced upon them, being exposed to decisions where nobody understands why they have to be taken in Europe and not in the Member States.
This feeling of being treated like children provokes rejection, leads to falling turnouts in elections and, if the process continues, it will boost political forces that are really against Europe, and that ought to worry us.
We in Parliament, too, must ask ourselves how long we can claim to be the European nations' legitimate representatives if the election turnout is always less than 50%.
One of the sources of unease is European legislation.
That is why this is the right time to talk about it.
You speak yourself, Commissioner, of an ambitious drive towards better regulation.
How true and how worthy of support!
You have our full political support in that.
So far, however, you have only mentioned the target: a 25% reduction.
You do not say how that target will be achieved.
Better regulation is more than anything something which is meticulous about respecting the limits of subsidiarity and respecting the competence of the Member States rather than craftily pushing those limits back.
The European Commission has in its hands a key to regaining the public's confidence.
We also need a new culture of subsidiarity.
Every piece of draft legislation should take care not to regulate every detail, but to weigh up carefully where the Member States' regulative competence begins.
Point the way, Commissioner!
Less central lawmaking will be Europe's gain.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, our group believes the Commission has done a number of good deeds.
We nevertheless hope that in its remaining time in office the Commission, together with the European Parliament, will be an even stronger driving force for the European Union's development.
We will fully support it when the Council hesitates and procrastinates and does not really want to take Europe forward.
I would like to begin with a positive example, energy policy, and in this connection of course climate policy, a subject that is very close to your heart.
It was absolutely right to insist that there must be binding targets, especially for renewable energies.
It was equally correct to look for a pragmatic solution in the matter of competitiveness.
So far as nuclear technology is concerned, it was absolutely right to accept that there are different approaches.
There is one thing I would like from the Commission here, however, something that may perhaps reconcile the different approaches, namely a high standard of safety and also corresponding obligations on nuclear power plants and the countries that use nuclear technology to provide information.
I would like the Commission to come forward with proposals on this.
In energy foreign policy, too, it is important to press on further, on the one hand saying we want to diversify and on the other supporting diversification.
It is also extremely important to nominate the Commission coordinators who will ensure that we forge a variety of links for energy supplies.
If the Polish Government believes it needs to develop an energy policy together with Ukraine and some countries of the southern Caucasus, then I hope the Commission will get on with developing an all-European energy policy.
Secondly, also on energy foreign policy: I know that the Commission is making preparations for cooperation with the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions.
There, too, it is important that the Commission is not hampered by the Council in its proposals - for cooperation in energy, for migration policy and especially not for visa policy.
I was very sorry that the Commission did not object when the Member States originally went so far as to tighten visa policy for our neighbours by demanding higher fees.
I hope it will be successful in negotiating a sensible visa policy with all our neighbours, especially of course the Balkans.
Finally, I would like to come to the matter that lies close to our hearts: social competence.
Mr Nassauer is not wrong in saying why many people in Europe are sceptical about the European Union, the Commission and even the European Parliament.
It is also because the social dimension is underexposed in the Commission's work.
You admit it yourself: in the most recent documents you have published, whether about the internal market for the citizens or social reality stocktaking in Europe, you write quite clearly why this scepticism and this detachment have come about, saying that there is no point in the internal market unless the ecological and social consequences are seen and these aspects are also strengthened.
But when I look at the actual proposals, they contain too little of this social component.
When I look at two studies recently published in Europe, one about women's pay on the labour market and the other about poverty, then it is a sign of our inadequacy that we have poverty again in Europe and that the differences between men's and women's pay are still so great.
The social task has not therefore been completed, and so if we are for the internal market, the social component must also be included.
If the left and the right have recently had election results that in fact stem from social ills and the feeling that the social aspect is being overlooked, that we are again pursuing a narrow-minded national economic policy and we believe that is the way to deal with globalisation, it is also because we have not sent the citizens enough signals saying 'yes to the internal market' and 'yes to social Europe'.
That is very important for us and we would like the Commission to do more here.
Mr President, Commissioner, when discussing your paper, our group took the view that the Commission has found the right course and is pursuing that course with great confidence, sticking to the areas of policy that it defined at the start of its work, and that it is taking them forward in a way that gives the impression that it is acting with conviction.
That comes out in the very first sentence of your work programme, where you say that the policy areas in which the Commission is to be active will meet with broad agreement.
We welcome that.
We welcome this self-confidence and we also welcome the fact that the Commission has found a clear course.
We still want stronger leadership, however.
And to stay with the image of a course, we would like you to sail more strongly with the wind, so that you will go faster.
That was early praise, so to speak, but in essence we are saying that this is a good programme; in our opinion, however, it is not enough for the situation in which Europe now finds itself.
What we are missing above all is a clear word about Europe's future.
In the 24 page working paper you devote all of three lines to Europe's future, but the question of where we are heading, what our common 'progress' should look like, is not answered, and this strategy for a work programme does not even attempt an answer.
That we are all working together for Europe is not taken for granted as much as this paper suggests.
As Mr Nassauer has already said, it is unfortunately not accepted by the public as much as we would like.
That is why it is important that the Commission sets the direction here.
We want the Commission to spearhead the movement, demanding clear instructions as to where the European future is actually to go.
Your strategy is to supply results.
We think that is good.
Results are fine for showing the areas in which we are in fact visibly active.
Only again and again we have the problem that national politicians, mostly from governments, take the credit for successes, while Europe has to take the blame for failures or unpleasant consequences.
The Council's good results are the most recent example.
In Germany, at least, these good results are being credited to Mrs Merkel and the groundwork done by the Commission and European Parliament is not noticed at all.
To that extent, the strategy of delivering results is a very ambivalent strategy.
Moreover, for all the welcome initiatives you present there are some that make us wonder what the grounds are for your satisfaction.
You speak, for example, of a renewed consensus on enlargement.
We cannot see that.
You also want a common central database for fingerprints.
There is no consensus for that either.
It surprises us, especially in the light of the fact that, at the start of his term of office, Commission President Barroso styled himself a champion of civil rights.
Such a database is the opposite of what he announced at the start of his term of office.
My colleagues will speak further about the various areas of policy.
I would just like to mention one fundamental structural point that we have always raised in past debates.
For the sake of being closer to the citizens and of making this document easier to handle, we would like you to say precisely what are legislative initiatives, what has nothing to do with legislation, what are new initiatives and what are follow-up measures, so that we really know what concrete steps we can expect in the coming year.
Of course we would like the citizens to be involved.
The Commission is keen on communication.
We believe that is right.
The more interactive that can be, the better.
If, for greater visibility for the policy of results, we can have these debates on strategy not only in the European Parliament, but also in the national parliaments, that would be an important step towards making clear where which policy comes from in the common Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to address the question of how Europe is to find its way back to its citizens and to discuss climate and energy policy as an example.
I believe there has seldom been so much attention paid to the particular role and task of Europe as in the last few weeks, when everything has focused on the big question of climate protection policy and energy policy, that is on the biggest environmental policy issue of all.
I was very pleased with the outcome of the summit, because even though there is still a lot to negotiate in the small print the summit still achieved what the public expected after being made aware of the issues by Al Gore or the Stern report.
What the summit achieved was to give the public the impression that we are initiating a paradigm change, that we are bringing renewable energies out of a niche and that we will in future be backing energy efficiency in quite a different way than before.
The key thing now is that we should also live up to the expectations we have awakened in Europe.
If I may say so, Commissioner, I am not yet so sure that we will, because Mrs Merkel had scarcely announced this summit decision and declared the successes when it started all over again in the nation states and to some extent in the Commission, too.
Everything was called into question again.
As always, Mr Verheugen came out against the progressive trio of Commissioner Piebalgs, Commissioner Dimas and Commissioner Kroes.
And I am not so sure whether Commissioner Barrot will be able to implement the results of the summit properly, neither - I am saying this expressly here - do I have any confidence in Commission President Barroso and the energy policy revolution he proclaims.
You really are the right person, Commissioner, to try and see that, for example, the debate about the European constitution gets a better future by ensuring that the great expectations that we European politicians have awakened these last few months are not disappointed again.
The negotiations on the small print of the summit declaration are only just starting, and I can see some powerful, influential men on the European stage, including Mr Verheugen and Mr Barroso, who despite Chirac's departure in France are building a kind of old boys network standing in the way of the sustainability of these summit decisions.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, quite honestly I am not particularly convinced by the Commission communication on the Policy Strategy for 2008.
Why should that be?
For one thing, it is rather like a store catalogue and the priorities are not established clearly enough.
For another, there are many points that are highlighted as 'key actions' but they are very vague and say very little.
To mention a few examples: the initiative aimed at reconciling family and professional life, legislative initiatives to strengthen consumer protection, further initiatives to implement the EU Maritime Policy - we find one initiative after another, but in what specific way consumer protection is to be strengthened, what you intend to propose in that area, does not appear.
All too often there is nothing precise.
With regard to the social situation in the European Union, you announce - as it says here - a social reality stocktaking, and at the same time you announce visionary initiatives to promote solidarity and access of citizens to rights and opportunities.
I have to say I was quite amazed to read that here.
Do you really believe you can convince the public about the European Union and especially about Europe's possibilities, and allay people's fears for the future, when in this paper you as good as admit that you know nothing of the social reality in the European Union?
My fellow Members Mr Nassauer and Mr Swoboda have already raised this question.
I do not believe you will win the public over again like that.
Now a word on the subject of cutting red tape and better regulation, which is said to be at the heart of the Commission's daily work.
Better regulation does not start simply by presenting a much more detailed strategy; it is important and essential to assess its impact, and it will in fact be interesting to debate the results of the external evaluation of the impact assessment system.
I would like to stress, however, that better regulation must not necessarily mean deregulation or boil down to minimal regulation.
Finally, Madam Vice-President, I would like to ask what is happening about the announced withdrawals of legislative proposals.
In my report, Parliament asked that the Commission's annual legislative and work programme should show precisely which legislative proposals the Commission is thinking of withdrawing.
Could you say briefly what is planned for the way ahead until 2008?
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the climate change initiative has been raised to the very top of the agenda.
Despite serious doubts about the extent to which CO2 causes global warming, the EU is determined to lead the world in reducing emissions.
But, apart from nuclear power, sources of energy other than fossil fuels are still far from viable.
This is true of renewables in particular.
We now have a binding target of 20% for renewable energy with no proper assessment of the methods of achieving this ambitious goal or its cost.
Permit me to mention a lesson from the kindergarten school of economics.
If you raise the cost of a resource, you make goods more expensive and you reduce competitiveness.
We are told that this initiative will stimulate innovation in renewable technology and improve exports.
Instead, it will make us all poorer.
I suggest this sudden obsession with carbon emissions is a distraction, an attempt to take our minds off all those other projects that have had disappointing results, such as the Lisbon Strategy, immigration and asylum policy, reform of the common agricultural policy, the euro and several more.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, in actual fact, the way in which the Eurocracy, as a kind of enlightened despotism - always for the benefit of the people, of course - imposes its own will on the European peoples never ceases to amaze me.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission - and even though a President of the Commission may be a high official, he is, in the final analysis, only a purely politically elected official - told the Dutch people in their own country that they should now move on and accept this European Constitution, which, despite the rejection and democratic referendum in two Member States and despite the fact that quite a few other Member States do not even dare organise a referendum on this topic, is gradually being implemented anyway.
This is not entirely dissimilar from the accession negotiations with Turkey, which have no democratic basis whatsoever and which were also decided on by European institutions that are far removed from the citizens, by excessively privileged officials and Heads of Government who very deliberately refuse to ask the public its opinion even on an issue as fundamental as this one.
Today is no different.
In its policy strategy for 2008, the Commission has announced measures that should bring about a fresh immigration wave to Europe, even while its citizens are demanding the exact opposite.
They are finally asking us for effective measures to limit, or ideally put a stop altogether to, the immigration from non-European countries by adequately protecting our borders and by phasing out the semi-legal immigration channels, such as that of family reunification, which is far too lenient.
In the Commission proposal, the impression is given that this is a temporary phenomenon and that non-European temporary workers are expected to return to their countries of origin in a relatively short period of time.
This is deception.
Reality has taught us that these temporary workers do not return home, that their relatives join them sooner rather than later, and that subsequently, no measures of any kind will force these people out of the country.
As a result, the Community is once again lumbered with the consequences of this short-sightedness, the clash of cultures, the forming of ghettos, crime as a result of people being uprooted and eventually, the breakdown of a whole community.
I repeat, then, that a fresh immigration wave is absolutely pernicious.
Instead, we should start by protecting our European borders, develop a European policy for returning illegal immigrants and aliens who have become involved in criminal activity, and should demand that those non-Europeans who are on European soil legally should become thoroughly integrated.
In Brussels, Europe's capital, 40% of the residents of non-European origin, including third-generation, are currently unemployed.
So do not try to tell me that we should import even more unemployment.
Finally, I come to the essential thing, which is that the European project is once again being met with much distrust among the European citizens.
Europe will not generate renewed enthusiasm until such time as it becomes truly democratic and listens to the wishes and needs of its peoples and citizens.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many interesting aspects to this proposal; for reasons of time, however, I will focus on three points.
Firstly: energy.
The European Council has made a significant contribution in this area, and I hope that the Commission will succeed in converting these directives into practical and effective proposals.
This commitment affects us all, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the EU, which asks the Member States to make great efforts to reach the targets, should set a good example: with a single action - rationalising the Strasbourg seat - it would achieve not only a significant reduction in waste in terms of energy, paper, heating, lighting and moving thousands of people in cars, trains and aeroplanes every month, it would also send out a strong political message that would undoubtedly have a positive impact on our citizens.
Secondly: Lisbon.
The lifelong learning programmes launched this year are certainly valid instruments; however, there is a need to strengthen the measures to close the gap between education and entry into the world of work, particularly for young people and researchers who are otherwise forced to leave our borders.
It is also important to encourage mobility among young people, including with regard to informal learning, to stimulate family policies in order to meet the demographic challenge, and to improve access for small and medium-sized enterprises to credit, including through microcredit programmes, and to EU funding, particularly with regard to research and innovation.
Thirdly: multilingualism.
I hope that the Commission will honour the commitments made in its communication in November 2005 with regard to, and I quote, 'promoting multilingualism in European society, in the economy and in the Commission itself'.
It is unacceptable that documents intended for all EU citizens, such as websites and, in particular, information documents relating to European programmes, apart from notices, should be available in two or three languages only, effectively restricting access for many small communities to European Union funding.
A perfect example of this is that the documents for accessing the LINGUA programme for the promotion of multilingualism are in English, French and German.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, you have spoken beautifully, expressing plenty of enthusiasm and good intentions, but, as usual, we must get down to realities, particularly when it comes to talking about budgets.
Commissioner, the last document that Parliament had in relation to budgetary priorities was presented in December last year.
I am talking about the resolutions that accompanied the current budget, the 2007 budget.
Our question would be whether you believe that those resolutions, which we approved by an overwhelming majority in this House and which you received very warmly, have been incorporated into the annual political strategy document.
It seems to us that they have not been incorporated and that is a problem, Commissioner, because we always find ourselves in the same situation: Parliament draws up a series of guidelines that should be taken into account in the next budgetary procedure, you lay out your political priorities in this annual political strategy document, you add a budgetary component, but you do not take any notice, or at least you do not take sufficient notice, of everything Parliament asked for the year before.
That happens year after year.
We have yet to find a perfect balance between the budgetary procedures and the European Commission's legislative programme and therefore our two institutions often work in parallel, but we have not yet managed to bring our systems into line.
You are playing a game with the timetable.
You draw up political priorities but, as the rapporteur for this year's budget, Mr Virrankoski, has said, Parliament has not so far had any indication of what the European Commission's political priorities for this year will be, and that means that, when it comes to drawing up the budget, we will find yet again that this Parliament's budgetary priorities do not coincide with the political priorities laid out by the European Commission.
We find this, for example, within the framework of the financial implications.
You intend to fund these political priorities by means of certain headings that are increasing and other headings that are being reduced; you are asking us for 890 new posts in the Commission, although you hope to create most of them by means of internal readjustments; furthermore, you expect to make adjustments in the executive agencies.
Commissioner, like every year, we feel a degree of confusion and during this year's budgetary procedure we hope that we will be able to reach agreements that do not involve great budgetary tensions with the Council, nor, in particular, with you.
(HU) The foreign policy ambitions of the European Union are impressive.
Unfortunately, the amounts of money available are not in harmony with these ambitions.
What is even worse, the distribution of the limited resources does not follow or reflect our priorities.
We expect that the 2008 budget will support the process of enlargement and the successful preparation of candidate countries and potential candidate countries more effectively than did those of the past.
The accession negotiations that have already begun must be continued, and done on the basis of their own merits.
We consider it a welcome development that the document considers it a priority to find a solution for Kosovo.
The time has come to take decisive steps in creating equilibrium between the eastern and southern dimensions of our neighbourhood policy.
From this perspective, it is a good sign that the strategy contains several new initiatives with regard to the southern, eastern and Caucasian countries as well.
We recognise that this is a step forward.
It is desirable that the promotion of democracy and human rights should be the guiding principle of the European Union's policy of support, which should be implemented not only in words but also systematically in practice.
Unfortunately, this has not yet happened.
Much is said in the document about the importance of energy policy, and with this we are unreservedly in agreement.
However, we regret that the substantive and institutional requirements of the foreign policy component of energy policy are not in the document.
We must absolutely devote attention to this matter, since this is one of the major challenges of this new era.
We have little money, and so we must use what we have in an effective and visible manner that focuses on priorities.
(PL) Mr President, paper is a very tolerant medium.
You can happily write anything you like on it, but implementing what is written can be much more difficult.
Essentially, that is how I would describe the latest Commission statements.
They are noble declarations, but they sometimes create virtual reality.
For example, in the very introduction to the document on the Union's Annual Political Strategy 2008 there is mention of the initiative to create a European Institute for Technology.
A couple of pages further on, however, it is stated that the aforementioned institute will indeed be created, but only in 2009 at the earliest.
I have actually read carefully through as many as several dozen priority Commission actions for the coming year.
We need to be sensible.
If everything is prioritised, the term priority loses its meaning.
In the area of external policy, there is reference to progress made by the Western Balkans towards future membership of the Union.
In fact, the accession of those Balkan countries depends on institutional reform of the Union, which means the countries concerned have become pawns in our own disputes within the Union.
This is a further instance of the gap between the statements made and reality.
I agree with the previous speaker who stated that the issue of the South Caucasus countries and their progress towards possible future membership of the European Union should be given greater prominence in this document.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the Europe of 27, there are few political organisations that claim to work in such a transparent and structured way as the EU itself.
Yet a look at these work programmes, including the one for 2008, just leaves us with long faces.
For 2008, too, we find the habitual proclamation of better regulation, but programmes stand or fall on their implementation rather than their proclamation.
From the point of view of budgetary control, 2008 will be another disappointing year.
We note the lack of management measures and proposed approaches to implementing the promise Commissioner Kallas made in 2005 to obtain an unqualified Statement of Assurance on the EU budget from the European Court of Auditors by 2009.
I should like to remind the House of the 44% error rate for the Structural Funds that has been detected once again for the 2005 budget.
After all, the Commission President has confirmed this promise: we would have expected the Commission to remember its promise and take the necessary steps in its own field of direct management, at least.
2008 is the last year in which the Commission will be able to change anything.
Incidentally, it is the first year in which the recipients of EU subsidies have to be disclosed.
We would have logically expected to see a mention of this milestone of EU support policy, too.
Perhaps the silence means this disclosure is not taking place?
After all, up to now, there has not been a single document - even a single line - about how the Member States and the individual EU funds are to implement the publication requirement.
Nor have there been any suggestions whatsoever as to what is to be done with this information.
We need, or rather the Commission needs, to think about the way this information is to be used and the consequences of this information for the individual policy areas.
The bottom line is that, in our view, the 2008 work programme is a disappointing document in which the Commission falls far short of its own proclamations.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission for this document, which is timely, coming as it does at the start of our budget procedure.
It is consistent with our priorities, which are the Lisbon Strategy, the fight against climate change and its effects, judicial cooperation and so on, but it overlooks the importance of the social dimension and of social cohesion in the future of the Union.
Your priorities are needed to enable the Union to rise to the challenges of globalisation.
Nevertheless, I question the fact that neither the financial perspective nor the programmes as they have been codecided leave us with much room for manoeuvre.
To be more precise, with regard to competitiveness, growth and employment, if the margin is left unchanged - at EUR 70 million - if new priorities are announced regarding Frontex and Eurojust and if three new transport agencies are created, then certain policies are liable to suffer: I am thinking of the seventh FRDP, which could have difficulties in getting off the ground; I am thinking of the trans-European transport network, funding for which is absolutely crucial; I am thinking of all those social policies that are not yet sufficiently developed; and I am thinking of the CIP, which is a vital tool of the Lisbon Strategy.
We ought not to reduce the commitments of these already badly-managed policies.
It is not only European growth that is at stake here, but also our objectives regarding competitiveness, employment and solidarity.
As regards the freedom, security and justice policies, the margin of EUR 32 million is very small.
Increasing the funding for policies arising out of Frontex and Eurojust will inevitably reduce the resources originally allocated to other vital programmes, such as the integration of third-country nationals and such as a truly ambitious policy aimed at refugees, the protection of fundamental rights.
The European Commission is implying that these programmes are not yet up to speed.
Why, though, were they not implemented quicker?
With regard to agricultural issues, I join my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in expressing serious doubts about the proposal for a single CMO covering all agricultural sectors.
This could result in a lack of consideration being given to the specific characteristics of some agricultural produce.
Given that the scope of the 'health check' exercise is not yet known or detailed in the Commission proposals, I would ask you to provide some clarification on this matter.
The recent statements made by the Commissioner for Agriculture contradict what you wrote.
As for the Union's actions, we are anxious to see all of the declared priorities upheld.
We cannot accept our priorities regarding health, education and promotion being neglected in favour of energy.
Finally, I am surprised at how brief were the allusions made to the revision exercise scheduled to begin in 2008. This leads me to address the Commission directly: is the revision of the financial perspective a taboo subject?
I have already expressed my curiosity to know the estimated additional cost of the better regulation initiative.
Could you provide us with the estimates for which we have been waiting for so long?
Finally, I should like to see the spotlight put on communication this year.
It is mentioned in this text, but the Commission's actions need to be refocused on this matter.
The Europe of democracy is at a standstill, the citizens are turning their backs on it and our texts are more and more ambitious.
We are far from achieving our dreams.
Mr President, the Barroso Commission has now achieved its cruising speed, and the more assertive strategy that we have here should be fully examined and debated inside national parliaments and parties.
It is a splendid tool to both inform and stimulate a national discourse about the EU dimension, and Commissioners should be sent forth to sell it.
The strategy is sensibly reticent about saving the Constitution, but its work foreseen on reviewing the workings of economic and monetary union and on the social dimension of the single market should prepare the Commission for the IGC that we confidently expect for the second part of 2007.
So, also, the review of the financial system should be brought forward to assist the search for a solution to the constitutional crisis.
Money on the table can assist the IGC, and no reform of the expenditure side of the finances can be sensibly approached without a systematic review of the common policies.
Mr President, first of all my apologies for not being here earlier on.
I got a puncture and unfortunately there is not enough hot air in Strasbourg to keep things going!

Outside of the issues in relation to climate change which I have just mentioned, three other key areas that the Commission must face and deal with in the coming year are the issues of ensuring the delivery of the Lisbon Agenda and, in particular, investment in research and development - 3% of GDP - looking at areas of innovation and encouraging the new technologies, which will become the major employment opportunities for Europe in the future.
Secondly, there is the issue of reconnecting with our young people within Europe.
For too long, we have spoken about the wonderful wealth and resource that is our young population within Europe.
However, outside of the Erasmus programme and one or two other, smaller, educational programmes, the actual original idea of Youth for Europe action plans seems to have been forgotten and put to one side.
And, as I said, this is a huge resource, not just in economic terms but in development terms - in ensuring we can deliver a proper and wonderful future Europe to future generations.
Thirdly, the common foreign and security policy is a key element, one where Europe must be seen to deliver on the world stage, and yet there seem to be difficulties with regard to the budget and forward planning with regard to what can be done there.
Madam Commissioner, I know you have much on your plate at the moment and there are other difficulties interinstitutionally, but unless we are seen to act on behalf of our citizens and deliver to our citizens, then all of the bureaucracy is not going to help.
My final point is that we should cut red tape and make it easier for businesses to operate.
Better regulation and less regulation could be a way forward to achieving some of those goals.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think I participated in all the recent debates about the policy strategy and I have had cause to criticise it.
This morning I want to welcome the early start that you are giving us on the development of the policy strategy.
I agree with you that this is important in stepping up our political dialogue.
I think you said that you were looking for frank and productive dialogue, so I hope that you will accept my remarks in that spirit.
Commissioner, one of the major concerns I have with this document, as with the previous ones - and I hope that discussing this now may prompt you to do something about it - is that I want to see the focus and resources underlying your work devoted also to consolidating and implementing the existing legislation.
Policy strategy is not just about new initiatives.
We want you to have the maturity to tell us about what you are doing to implement the existing rules and regulations.
In my particular area of interest, the single market, you rightly talk about allowing citizens and SMEs in particular to benefit from that market.
I suggest to you that in 2008 by far the single most important thing you can do is to make sure that the Single Market for Services Directive is properly implemented in all Member States.
That would be more important than any other initiative you may want to take.
I want to see it in your strategy when the proposal comes out.
And just two other things: I am surprised that there appear to be no policy initiatives at all in the area of the knowledge society and information technology, despite the fact that there is a large and important work programme in progress.
So maybe you should look at that.
I do not think that initiatives have dried up in that area.
Finally, on the issue of better regulation raised by a number of my colleagues, it is no use whatsoever for the Commission to continue these excellent initiatives, if nobody knows about them.
Why is that not on your list of communications?
Because our citizens need to know what is going on and need to be engaged with the process if we are to assess its impact.
So please put that as one of your communication priorities.
(NL) Mr Swoboda, Mr Andersson and Mrs Guy-Quint have all argued in favour of more initiatives in the area of a social Europe.
This is what they miss in these proposals.
I should like to take this one step further and say that Europe should be more social not only within Europe, but also outside it.
It is when Europe is a world partner that it becomes obvious how much the aspect of development and the relationship with development cooperation are lacking from a number of topics in the work programme for 2008.
I would, in this respect, mention the areas of agriculture, the review of the European framework legislation for pharmaceutical companies and maritime policy.
This year's general objective in the European consensus on development is once again to reduce poverty in Africa and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but the fact is that, as regards the Millennium Development Goals for Africa, things are heading the wrong way.
Where does the Commission intend to go from here?
In the tenth European Development Fund, which is currently being prepared and which accounts for half of all the development funds, only 2% is being set aside for education and 2.5% for health care.
This is, of course, in stark contrast with what this working programme is hoping to achieve.
Secondly, today, Commissioner Mandelson and others are discussing economic partnership agreements with ministers from developing countries and the Union's ministers for development cooperation, a wide-ranging issue indeed.
In actual fact, our counterparts from developing countries have the feeling that we are prizing open their markets rather than placing their development at the heart of our policy.
Another inconsistency.
Turning to agricultural policy, I should like to give you an example from the fishing industry.
For the Seychelles, fish, and mainly swordfish, is an essential product to be brought to our markets.
We, however, reciprocate by imposing a non-tariff trade barrier in the form of the requirement of very low cadmium levels.
While we allow much higher cadmium levels in our chickens and pigs, we ban swordfish from the Seychelles with low cadmium levels.
This inconsistency in many areas of policy must be addressed in this programme for 2008.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, President Barroso always speaks of a Europe of results.
I like that phrase but I have to conclude unfortunately that, in the area of fundamental rights, the European Commission is falling short of its promises.
I remind you once again that, in 2004, Mr Barroso got the green light for his Commission only after a solemn pledge to become the champion of fundamental rights.
Unfortunately that is not reflected in this document and it is not reflected in the actions of the Commission over the last two-and-a-half years.
In this area, the Commission is timid and reluctant.
You should not only defend, but also promote fundamental rights.
There are two things in this document which strike me.
First, there is an imbalance between your proposals to fight terrorism and your proposals to defend privacy and civil liberties.
There is a distinct imbalance there.
We urgently need data protection in the third pillar and I wish the Commission would push harder for that.
Even if there is no consensus within the Council, then it is still for the Commission to show political leadership.
Do not wait for the Council!
Let the Council explain why it cannot agree on data protection in the third pillar.
You should make it very clear where you stand.
That also goes for the 'horizontal directive' that this Parliament has called for repeatedly, banning discrimination on all grounds, everywhere and not only in the workplace.
We therefore welcome the initiative to combat discrimination outside the labour market.
However, I think that, in reality, what we are talking about here is only a consultation.
Commissioner, show more courage!
Show more sincere and personal commitment to pushing anti-discrimination legislation.
Show more leadership, and do not wait for the Council.
I also have a very practical proposal, which you do not even have to include in your strategic programme.
In the context of 2007, the year of equal opportunities, I would like to ask Commissioner Barroso to do a personal chat session with European citizens on the issue of discrimination and fundamental rights.
I would like the Commissioner to say whether she will pass on this request, or proposal, to Mr Barroso and see if he is willing to comply, because that would show his personal commitment to fundamental rights.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for presenting the Annual Political Strategy 2008.
With regard to the priorities mentioned by the Commissioner, I should like to highlight our commitment to environmental protection, and in particular to combating climate change, the need for a common energy policy, the implementation of the social agenda and the issue of enlargement.
There are many challenges before us.
We need to rise to tackle them in a way that will bring about greater cohesion between Member States and increase the citizens' trust in the Union.
Last year, in the context of our relations with Russia, the Union showed that it is capable of demonstrating solidarity with its Member States.
This political trend should be fostered.
If we promote high standards of environmental protection we shall gain respect and strengthen our position on the world stage.
Following the latest enlargements and the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, it appears that we should devote more effort to cementing the Union than to further enlargement.
The accession of Croatia seems to be the only priority in that regard at present.
We must achieve something tangible for our citizens, so many of whom are still out of work and deprived of their rightful opportunities for development.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it is said regularly - in the Commissioner's speeches, for example - that Europe should concentrate on the essentials and that our aim is to bring Europe closer to its citizens.
After all, Europe - particularly the Commission, of course - is judged on the extent to which it backs up its words with action.
Take bureaucracy reduction, for example - the Commission's flagship.
Looking back over recent weeks, I note that the Commission has presented a new strategy on health at work for the next five years, with particular regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, which identifies SMEs as the scene of most incidents.
These will undoubtedly have to reckon with requirements to match in the near future.
Take consumer protection: there is now a Green Paper on this that makes the relevant stipulations.
I think it is good that the Commission is giving thought to where unnecessary bureaucracy can be eliminated.
Commissioner, the best kind of bureaucracy reduction starts with the absence of bureaucracy creation.
The Commission has simply failed in this regard in recent years, in that it has continuously presented new legislative proposals.
On the other hand - and the Commission's stubbornness in ignoring Parliament's words is astonishing - we are stipulating all the records insurance intermediaries will have to keep in future when negotiating with consumers about the relevant products.
In terms of the suggestion that we examine the issue of hedge funds without calling for regulation - the risks concerned have been regularly mentioned by Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank in this House and by the central banks around the world - there is no mention of this in the Commission's plan for 2008.
The Commissioner's colleague Mr McCreevy is not doing anything in the areas that present real risks - which smacks of neglect of duty.
We are not calling for regulation, but simply for an analysis of the status quo.
The strategy paper says nothing about this; nothing is being done in this field - which is indeed astonishing.
This is strongly reminiscent of clientele politics for the benefit of certain regions of the world.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I was pleased to hear the Commissioner expressing a desire for cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Clearly, the Strategy and the Commission's work cannot be divorced from the needs and expectations of the citizens of the European Union.
That is why I wish to refer to one of the Commission's priorities that the Commissioner emphasised strongly in her presentation, namely solidarity.
I do not wish to speak about economic solidarity, but instead about social solidarity.
I welcome the Commission's statements that take account of such solidarity.
These include the equal opportunities policy, the prevention of discrimination outside the labour market and combating all its manifestations, reconciling family and working life, and also eliminating youth unemployment.
All this is in the plan for the current year 2007, which has been designated the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
I understand that this must be taken forward.
I am especially interested, however, in the Commission's statements and actions aimed at supporting and protecting fundamental rights, with particular reference to the rights of children, including a forum on the rights of children.
I am glad the Commission wishes to protect children using the Internet and other new media, but above all else I welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to combat child poverty.
It is our duty to ensure that every child enjoys a decent standard of living.
In this connection, I should like to ask the Commissioner about the state of progress on existing projects prepared by the Commission.
There are some Parliament ones too.
In particular, I have in mind the regulation on implementation of maintenance payments, for which I am the rapporteur.
This aims to ensure that maintenance payments can be obtained swiftly and directly when those responsible are working in other Member States and have defaulted on their payments, thus condemning their children to a life of poverty because they are deprived of an appropriate standard of living.
That is why I am asking if the Commission does want to see progress on this issue, because thousands of European children are longing for this regulation.
They need our help.
(FI) Mr President, the Commission's communication on the annual political strategy contains some fairly new moves, especially in the areas of energy policy, immigration and the simplification of administration.
The Commission's communication is rather incoherent.
It is divided into four parts: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom, and Europe as a strong international player.
This structure is poorly suited to administrative structure and multi-annual financial frameworks.
The goal of activity-based budgeting and administration is to make administration transparent and clear, which is what a communication of this type fails to promote.
It is hard for the reader to follow what the Commission intends to do in the current sectors.
It is difficult to see how both human and financial resources are to be channelled.
The Commission appears to have faith in administration.
It is going to create another two separate agencies in addition to the previous ones and the European Institute of Technology besides.
In my opinion, more bureaucracy should be viewed extremely warily.
No new administrative bodies can be set up unless they are absolutely necessary.
One surprise is that the Commission is to establish two new policy programmes under Heading 4, which would relate to climate change and energy efficiency.
The costs of these next year would be in excess of EUR 20 million.
It is astounding that, just two months after the new financial perspectives began, new expenditure is being proposed for them.
In terms of budget policy, it is regrettable that the Commission intends to find the money for the new expenditure by postponing the financing of existing programmes.
Parliament should make a careful appraisal of this move, which could lead to its own priorities being undervalued.
With all this in mind, we can look forward with interest to concrete legislative and budgetary proposals by the Commission.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your clear explanation, which seemed to me to be rather short.
The truth is that 2008 is going to be a key year in terms of moving forward the debate on the new budget for the European Union, which should accompany the constitutional advances that we trust will be consolidated during this year.
We need a European budget that is a match for our ambitions and the demands of the European citizens in particular.
The current situation appears to be clear and favourable.
Ecofin has just said that we are in a solid economic situation, to the extent that the economic indicators are clear, and the extremely weak situation of the part of European GDP made up of wages and employment is therefore notable.
Mr Juncker has said this and all of the ministers have agreed.
It is therefore now time to talk about the distribution of the fruits of that growth and this is not just a concern of the governments and social partners.
It is a demand from the European citizens.
It has been clearly stated that the current situation is unsustainable and furthermore carries with it considerable risks of regression: the poverty faced by young people, women, the elderly and children; the lack of prospects, which discourages birth rates, and over-indebtedness, which is of increasing concern.
In its programme for 2008, however, the Commission offers us, as a principal social solidarity measure, the management or execution of the Solidarity Fund, which alleviates the situation of people losing their jobs following restructurings resulting from globalisation.
We believe that it is not sufficient, that we need initiatives to incentivise investment: public investment that attracts private investment.
With a view to 2008 and the next three-year stage of the Lisbon Strategy, therefore, I propose to you returning to investments. Investments in transport and energy networks, investments in environmental issues and the whole issue of the management and distribution of water, and the great European projects such as GALILEO or SESAR.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, there is much to be welcomed in the strategic approach you presented to us this morning, but I still find something lacking with regard to the cross-cutting priorities and the strategic focus of bringing issues together in a more coherent and holistic manner.
I want to refer to two areas that I know well.
One is to do with the High North and you, Vice-President, were kind enough to join us at a conference that Parliament hosted in Brussels a couple of weeks ago.
This brings together the issues of climate change and energy that you mentioned, but also maritime policy.
It also brings together both the internal and external policies of the Union and somehow we have to get these all together in the same box and give them focus.
It means the Northern Dimension. It means participation in the Arctic Council.
It also means International Polar Year - which is 2008-2009.
Is the European Union even at the table?
Can we have a more holistic approach to these issues?
My second area is that of civil justice.
If you look for civil justice in this, you find a bit of contract law dressed up as consumer law.
You find wills and succession hidden under security and justice policy, where you also find something to do with bank account attachments.
Please can we look at civil justice, which is the other side of the internal market, making it function for our companies and our citizens?
Please can we call it civil justice, and can we have a pattern of civil justice that gives access to justice so that our citizens can see what is there?
Mr President, I should like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for attending.
Today I am touching on world trade in particular, because that is my mandate.
It goes without saying that I should like to see the Commission move forward on the Doha round, and Mr Mandelson, the Commissioner responsible, is doing an excellent job in pushing that forward.
I want to see bilateral agreements used to get into multilateral agreements, because the Commission must look at multilateral rather than bilateral trading agreements, but using bilateral agreements to move towards them.
However, perhaps most importantly, I want to see a transatlantic dialogue.
That has been missing and it is something that is so important to the future of the WTO.
I believe that the US has failed to come to the table, and we must look at supporting President Bush in his fast-track system in order to bring Susan Schwab, the new negotiator, to the table so that she and Mr Mandelson can form a real partnership and discuss the way forward.
I feel strongly that the US has failed dramatically in the reform of the farm bill, while we in the European Union have been reforming and continue to reform our agricultural policy.
This is very important and I hope the Commission will stress that fact.
Finally, on your role, Vice-President of the Commission, we should not forget economic partnership agreements.
This is part of an ACP agreement.
I have been drawing up the report in Parliament and it is vitally important that we finish these by the end of this year so that the Commission can stick to its programme and Africa and the countries involved know exactly what is going on.
Let me finish on a personal note, Commissioner. This is quite important for the UK.
You have just spent EUR 1.2 million on a building in the UK.
I am very concerned, firstly, about the cost and, secondly, about the diplomatic status of the staff.
It is not a diplomatic mission, it is there to represent the Commission, and there should be no diplomatic posts.
(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, there are three points I want to emphasise, and it is very much the budget aspect in which I am interested in this report that you have presented.
The programme for better legislation is of course important, and it is not to be seen as an unambitious agenda, as some people make it out to be.
On the contrary.
Like other speakers, however, I think that the Commission could do a much better job of explaining the efforts now being made to simplify legislation, to assess the effects of new legislation and to involve the general public more effectively when we legislate.
Many still see the EU as an ever more tentacular bureaucracy.
That is an incorrect view, and I think it important to say so.
I make these remarks now, in particular, while Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is here, because it is of course you, Commissioner, who must convey this message.
My second point concerns the mid-term review of the budget, which must be prepared in 2008.
On this subject, I really do hope that the Commission will be ambitious, as there is in truth good reason to doubt the Council's desire to have a genuine and open debate on shifting the priorities around over the next few years.
The mid-term reform of agriculture is an important point of departure.
We need a debate on the kind of agriculture we want to see, on how much or how little aid it should receive and on whether it is possible to shift resources from agricultural policy to more forward-looking areas such as research and investment in transport.
My last point is very important.
It is said that new political priorities will require just under 1 500 more staff by 2008, just under 900 of whom will be new employees - some of them employed as a result of enlargement - while the remainder are to be obtained from re-prioritising.
I do not know whether I am too impressed about it being possible to move 2% of staff around.
I believe that we must set new guidelines for the EU's and, specifically, the Commission's personnel policy.
Is there sufficient adaptability to ensure that the political priorities are met, and does personnel policy provide sufficient scope for employing the right experts, for example in the agencies?
I think that we must include issues such as those too in any mid-term review.
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to discuss transport policy, the poor relation in this House.
Even though, together with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is the committee responsible for the most legislative acts, transport always comes last.
Yet transport is important.
Without transport infrastructures geared towards people's needs, there will be no growth and no employment.
It is possible to order everything over the Internet, but not have it delivered via the Internet.
Transport infrastructures geared towards people's needs are a prerequisite for growth in trade, particularly between old and new Member States, and so the Commission's approach in its strategy paper is the right one.
I should like to point out that the most important thing is not to demonise transport.
Recently, it has been postulated that, for example, no one should fly any more.
The Vice-President of the Commission knows that if she wishes to travel from northern to southern Sweden, the choice is between spending hours on a train and having to fly.
It is all right for people to fly, as the exhaust-gas pollution caused by air transport can be reduced considerably by means of sound policies.
If we succeeded in ensuring that Member States introduced sound airspace control systems at long last, we could reduce the CO2 emissions from air transport by 8-12%.
The Member States must do something about this: we should remind them to do so.
Indeed, Vice-President Barrot plans to present a White Paper on urban transport.
I am always somewhat doubtful as to whether urban transport is within our remit, but the Vice-President is absolutely right about one thing: urban transport accounts for a large proportion of pollution.
Parliament should agree guidelines with the Member States and the regions: that transport is needed for growth and employment, but that this transport should be as efficient and environmentally friendly as possible.
This will have to be discussed in greater detail.
We are following the same course, therefore, Madam Vice-President - but, without transport, there will be no growth or employment in the Community.
Mr President, I should like to start by welcoming the Commissioner and congratulating her on her choice of Christian Leffler as the new head of her Private Office.
He is a good, old friend and was a colleague of mine when I used to have a real job.
Thank you for the annual policy paper, Commissioner.
I think it is an excellent document.
I think we should basically have four priorities.
Because you are in charge of communication, I could perhaps say that there are four things that the Commission should communicate and sell.
The first one is, of course, climate change and energy.
The European Union has lacked a true project ever since the end of the Cold War.
I think that we are starting to find one, and this Commission has done an excellent job on that.
Congratulations on what you did in the European Council.
The second thing you have to sell - and here I would like you to be a little firmer, so I underline what Mr Duff said earlier - is the Constitution.
Stick firm on that, because it is your job to defend the Treaties and to defend the interests of the European Union as a whole.
Everyone knows that it is in our interests to get that Constitution through in one form or another, most certainly not in the form of a 'mini-treaty'.
Thirdly, as regards defending and selling, there is a lot of talk about protectionism nowadays in the European Union.
You need to sell the single market better.
The whole system is based on four freedoms: the free movement of goods, services, people and money.
When you combine that with a sound consumer policy, as Mrs Kuneva is doing right now, I think you can prove that the single market has been a success story.
The fourth and final element that I personally think you are doing a good job on, but in respect of which the Member States are found to be a little lacking, is enlargement.
It is, after all, the most successful policy the European Union has ever had.
I know we have to administer it.
I know we have to go a little slower.
But keep at it and keep on selling it better.
So my four priorities, which I find in your paper as well, are climate change, the Constitution, the single market and enlargement.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I think that this debate has illustrated excellently the role of a directly-elected European Parliament.
Parliamentarians should criticise the Commission, ask for more detailed proposals, point to what is missing or ask about the synergies between different policy proposals.
You have also taken the opportunity to congratulate the Commission where appropriate and to call for the introduction of an ambitious climate policy or energy policy, for example, hopefully helping us and the European institutions to work together in implementing these policies.
Listening to the debate, it seems that some of you want the Commission to do more, while others want it perhaps to do a little less.
The Commission will always work with the aim of making things better - better quality legislation, better coordination between the institutions and better implementation.
This must be the overall goal.
I would like to start by commenting on the procedure and the dialogue that we have started between Parliament and the Commission on the annual policy strategy.
I think that it is very important that we improve the quality of this regular dialogue.
I think we have already realised that the way to improve it, to make it more effective, is to make it more political.
