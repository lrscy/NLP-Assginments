But will they also question the EFSA nutrient profiles under the Health Claims Regulation, for example?
Of course not, because they fit in with their ideology.
The Council of Ministers is also at fault, however.
The national ministers responsible lack the courage to agree to authorise GMOs that have been examined and found to be safe.
It is the small man's fear of not being re-elected, neither more nor less!
We are wasting such great opportunities for the EU: GMOs can give us better food and feed with nutrition-physiological added value and efficient renewable raw materials that are carbon-neutral and therefore have no effect on the climate.
MON 863 is safe and must be approved just like the other useful plants that have been tested and found to be safe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in response to the previous speaker I would like to quote an Austrian proverb: 'blessed are those who believe, but you will still get to heaven if you do not'.
Perhaps now I can challenge Renate Sommer's world view a little.
It was not only Green Members, but the majority in this House who wanted a consumer- and environmentally friendly solution for the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified food and feed.
Even a government close to you has questioned EFSA's handling of the studies referred to today.
My question to the Commission is now: what concrete steps has the Commission taken to bring about a reform of the European Food Safety Authority?
This is not the first time we in this House have expressed doubts about its independence.
And yes, Mrs Sommer, we wanted and we want an independent Food Safety Authority.
But democratically elected Members naturally also have the right to take a critical look at its independence and work to see that it is genuinely independent.
That is very much our responsibility, because we of course also know the mood and attitude of the public towards it in all the Member States.
We agree, Mr Kyprianou, that EFSA should continue to be responsible for risk assessment and the Commission for risk management.
I am however convinced that both EFSA and the Commission need to take their responsibilities seriously.
As you know, next week we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will be dealing with the question of how the individual authorisation of genetically modified organisms should be handled in the context of comitology and the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
Such cases do not help that discussion very much.
I hope that in future concrete steps will be taken to demonstrate that the Food Safety Authority really is independent.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I was instrumental in organising a conference that took place on 12 June at the European Parliament in Brussels.
The conference dealt with dangers related to the spread of GMOs, and was attended by distinguished scientists from many countries.
Their presentations clearly indicated that there is increasing evidence of the harmful nature of GMOs.
Alleging technological progress, large biotechnology enterprises are disseminating serious threats to civilisation the world over.
With all due respect to Mrs Sommer, I am more inclined to believe scientists than Mrs Sommer's assurances on the safety of MON 863.
At present, only a little animal husbandry and agriculture in the EU involves the use of GMOs.
We still have one last chance to protect Europe against this danger.
I have some questions to pose to the Commissioner.
Does the European Commission intend to do anything about this?
Above all, does it intend to heed the wishes of citizens of entire regions of Europe, where the majority of the population wishes to protect itself against GMOs, or does the Commission intend instead to be seduced by the misleading publicity alleging technological progress?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kyprianou, I am most disappointed, because, like Mrs Scheele, I was expecting answers this evening about when we will finally have higher standards for risk assessment.
I have been asking the Commission specific questions about these safety issues for months and getting no answers; then officials tell me in private that they are not in a position to give those answers.
The French scientists' independent study is not the only one to come to the alarming conclusion that Monsanto 863 is unsafe and is an alarming threat to health and that it is irresponsible to leave it on the market any longer.
A study has also been made in Austria.
There are alarming concerns in the Member States.
We cannot just deny that and stick our heads in the sand.
I would have liked to receive answers from you today about the fact that the European Medicines Agency also sees a risk with the two antibiotic resistance genes, not only in MON 863, but also in the Amflora potato, authorisation of which has now been applied for.
Even your own EU institution is contradicting EFSA.
We really must have answers from you on this, Mr Kyprianou!
You cannot simply say that you are not going to answer.
Even the Council has called on you to comment.
I find it curious that EFSA needed three months to evaluate the SÃ©ralini study.
Incidentally, Mr SÃ©ralini will be here in Parliament on Wednesday and will then tell us clearly whether EFSA's all-clear, its whitewashing, is really justified.
We do know that the EFSA studies make repeated references to Monsanto.
They contain statistical errors.
That has been pointed out not only by the French research team but by many Member States as well.
We are looking to you for answers as to how these mistakes can be remedied in future, how we are to deal with them, what value, if any, should be put on the precautionary principle.
We need a reassessment.
I would like you to tell me, Mr Kyprianou, in no uncertain terms: will MON 863 be reassessed?
All EFSA has done is to look at the old data again.
It has not carried out a reassessment at all.
That is a very crucial question, to which we need an answer!
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, scientists in France recently discovered extensive organ damage in the liver and kidney in animals raised on Monsanto 863.
Three years before this, German studies were brought to the attention of EFSA by the German authorities that showed kidney damage in rats fed Monsanto 863.
Yet, despite this, EFSA has reaffirmed their risk assessment on this and said that it is safe for European farm animals.
Where are EFSA's studies?
Why are they just looking at the industry's tests and just going back over them?
How difficult can it be for them to try to redo the French and German studies?
The biotech industry in Europe alleges that GM farming is inevitable.
My fear is that this will just be a self-fulfilling prophesy.
Europe is capable of supplying its farmers with GM-free grain, but if we accept the inevitability, if we accept safety studies that are not really studies at all, then farmers will be forced into feeding their animals GM because otherwise there will be no other grain.
I would remind EFSA that many products, after years of so-called 'safety', have been taken off the market.
To give you one example, the polio vaccine we use today is the fourth polio vaccine, because the other three, after having been given to people for many years, were finally withdrawn because of mounting evidence of damage.
We are supposed to respect the precautionary principle in Europe, especially when we are talking about putting genetically-modified organisms into the environment, considering that, with GM, any resulting adverse effects may be irreversible.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I know that the GMO authorisations are a sensitive issue but, first of all, we have to remind ourselves that, based on European legislation adopted by Parliament and the Council, GMO products are allowed in the European Union, provided they go through the authorisation procedure I have just described.
That authorisation procedure provides for the risk assessment to be done by EFSA.
So, whether some of us agree or disagree with the concept of GMO products, we are all bound by the European legislation.
This is the rule of law so we have to follow it.
First of all, on EFSA's work, as you know, Parliament was informed and I came along myself as well.
We have taken decisions on improving the work of EFSA to make it more thorough and to take more account of the views of the Member States and all scientific developments that may take place during the authorisation procedure.
The Commission adopted an action plan which has been put in place already and is being implemented and which will also be included in the legislative framework sometime in 2008.
It is part of the Annual Policy Strategy for 2008.
There we take into account how we can improve the situation and make proposals based on the views of the Member States and on long-term effects and many other aspects.
I also have to insist that in the European Union we have the highest standards and the strictest legislation when it comes to GMO products.
That is why you know we have continuously been taken to the WTO and are not doing so well there.
But nevertheless our legislation has been accepted by the WTO because it is science-based and the decisions are based on risk assessment so, in this way, we can fulfil our international obligations by taking into account primarily and foremost the safety of European consumers and European citizens.
So it is not a question of personal preferences but an issue of applying the existing legislation.
I know Mrs Breyer referred to those questions.
There is a procedure.
We have to get information.
You will be provided with all the details on these questions.
But again the questions arising are linked to the risk and the risk is not being assessed by us.
It is assessed by EFSA.
Therefore, we have to wait for the decision of EFSA on this issue before we actually provide the replies.
On this specific product there were many evaluations and many studies.
They all caused EFSA to re-evaluate and reassess its position and it came to the same conclusions.
So it was not something taken lightly.
It was not something that was ignored. Whenever there was new science and new evidence, this was taken into account and we asked EFSA, which again is the risk assessor of the European Union, to take them into account.
It is true that EFSA's latest opinion was based on the existing study but also Professor SÃ©ralini's paper was on the same study.
It was a question of how you analyse, how you do statistical analysis of the existing data and that is why we had a special task force on statistical analysis, internally and externally, and it came to the conclusion that there were flaws in the analysis and the conclusions of Professor SÃ©ralini.
That does not always mean that he who is negative is always right.
Sometimes people who are positive as well may be accurate and correct.
Finally, as to the issue of which studies the authorisation would be based on, the decision was that we would continue with the legislation that was originally adopted; that the applicant has the responsibility of providing the data and the studies information.
In this way, they have the burden of proof which is assessed by the authorities.
The authorities can ask for any further additional studies they would like and in this way they have the responsibility of proving their case.
I will not go into the issue of the cost of eventually changing the system.
The cost will eventually be a burden on the taxpayers of the European Union and not the industry.
But the main reason is they should have the burden of proof and therefore the authority can analyse this data based on a critical analysis.
I would like to remind you that a similar situation is used in the EMEA, the medicine authority of the European Union, where again the industry provides all the clinical trials and clinical studies and the decision is taken.
So I can assure you that we take into account and we will make sure that the EFSA takes into account and assesses and evaluates any new scientific evidence that may arise and the moment a risk is identified we will not hesitate to take the appropriate measures.
As you know, we have done that and I personally have done that in the past on many occasions with unauthorised products.
The debate is closed.
PNR Agreement with the United States (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the PNR Agreement with the United States.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, as you already know, the United States and the European Union concluded talks on a long-term PNR agreement.
I want to use this occasion to thank the German Presidency and in particular Minister SchÃ€uble for his personal involvement in making this happen.
The unanimous mandate given by the Council of Ministers has been fulfilled.
The new agreement provides for a high level of data protection and important commitments on the handling of future European PNR data.
Several important interests had to be addressed.
Firstly, the fight against terrorism and serious international crime, and in parallel the right to privacy and protection of fundamental civil rights, the need for air carriers to be able to comply with diverse legal requirements at an acceptable economic cost, the wider transatlantic relationship and the true international scope of these issues.
The United States has agreed on a binding international agreement and by doing so they have understood the need for legal certainty.
The agreement is divided into three parts.
First, an agreement signed by both parties.
Second, a letter which the United States sent to the EU in which it set out assurances on the way in which it will handle European PNR data in the future.
And third, a letter from the EU to the United States acknowledging the receipt of assurances and confirming that on that basis it considers the level of protection afforded by the US Department of Homeland Security to be adequate for European PNR data.
In the past, the exchange of undertakings was not binding in character.
It was in my personal view, but also in the view of the Council, a major achievement of the new agreement.
This agreement will be valid for 7 years, thus providing for a considerable period of legal certainty.
There is not an extension of the time during which passenger data are kept from 3.5 to 15 years.
There is an increase from 3.5 to 7 years of the time during which data are kept in an active file.
The further period of 8 years that was already provided for in the previous agreements and that undertaking is not newly introduced in this new agreement.
The purpose for which data will be used remains the same.
The number of PNR data has been reduced from 34 to 19 as a result of rationalisation and merging.
Sensitive data will be filtered and made accessible only in exceptional circumstances which have been justified and will be deleted after 30 days.
Those air carriers not already pushing the data will go from a 'pull' to a 'push' system as soon it becomes technically feasible.
It is now up to air carriers to introduce new technologies as soon as possible, but both the United States and the EU agree that this system should be a 'push' system and no longer a 'pull' system.
The Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security and the United States Secretary of Homeland Security will be responsible for the review system.
Finally, the United States has accepted a review system which was likely to be agreed at the beginning of our negotiations.
Protection given under the United States Privacy Act will be extended through administrative procedures to non-US citizens, in particular with regard to redress and correction, and, therefore, EU citizens will be entitled to protection under that Act.
That was not the case under the previous agreement.
Common efforts are needed in order to protect our societies, including our human rights, from attempts by terrorists to undermine them.
The recent events in London and Glasgow have shown that terrorism will stay with us for some time.
That is why, as I have already announced, I will present a package in the autumn, which will include new measures - both legislative and operational - aimed at improving and increasing our capacity to cooperate at an international level against terrorism.
I shall also propose that the EU Member States establish a European PNR system at national level in as many Member States as possible.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Frattini and the German Presidency on the effort they have put into concluding this PNR Agreement.
It was essential to avoid a legal vacuum that would have left European airlines in a difficult position and jeopardised the protection of our citizens.
We have always supported having an international agreement at EU level instead of 27 bilateral agreements, because the Union can put forward a stronger position not only on preventing and fighting terrorism, but also on protecting fundamental rights.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was in favour of granting the Commission a mandate to reopen negotiations.
We are well aware that the negotiations were difficult and also that the European side wanted to find a mutually acceptable solution more strongly than the US side did.
I find it regrettable, however, that this agreement is composed of three parts: an agreement and two letters, the binding nature of which is not all the same.
There are several points that have changed for the better, and Mr Frattini has mentioned a number of them, but there are others that have fallen well short of our expectations.
The points I would highlight are these: first, I welcome the reduction in the number of PNR data, and I welcome the switch from a pull to a push system, as mentioned just now.
We know that 13 airlines have implemented the system already, but many others have not yet done so.
I would like to know what kind of initiatives the Commission is preparing to help and encourage airlines to switch over.
I still cannot accept what I consider to be an excessively long data storage period.
I am pleased at the inclusion of the requirement to give passengers adequate information and I welcome the appeal procedures for passengers, whereby they can review and correct data held by the US authorities, although there is still no sound legal mechanism allowing European citizens to appeal if their personal data are misused.
I am afraid that the additional measures for protecting sensitive data are inadequate, and I regret that the use of data by other US agencies has not been fully guaranteed.
A lot has been done, Commissioner, but there is still a lot left to do, and I hope that the control mechanism that you have agreed upon will allow some of the negative points that remain to be corrected.
Mr Vice-President, I honestly wish I could congratulate you today on achieving an agreement with the USA; my political group knows how hard you have worked, especially in the face of the USA's threat that, in the absence of agreement, they would unilaterally impose even worse terms on the airline companies.
Unfortunately, what we have in our hands, first of all, is not an agreement with the USA.
It is in fact an agreement with the USA and with any other countries to which the USA unilaterally decides to transfer personal data on European passengers.
Secondly, it is an agreement that contains commitments only for Europe and not for the USA.
Thirdly, even where the agreement sets certain limits, these limits are so unclear and so full of legal loopholes that in practice it will allow the USA to do pretty much as it likes.
Let me be more specific: firstly, the agreement and the attached letter from the USA state that America will be able to transfer the information we send it to any third country it likes, with hardly any obligation to even notify us.
In other words, in practice, Europe is signing the PNR agreement not only with the USA but with any other countries on earth which the USA decides, countries which cannot today receive data on European citizens directly from Europe, because we have not signed an agreement with them.
Did your negotiating mandate from the Council really include the authority to allow the uncontrolled transfer of European data by the USA where Europe cannot do so?
Secondly, while Europe has expressly declared that it is bound by the agreement, the USA has expressly declared that they are not bound by the agreement.
They are only bound by the unilateral assurances in their letter and by American laws which, if they change, will automatically bring about changes to the agreement.
Thirdly, as far as passenger information on the use of their data is concerned, there is no provision for an obligation by the governments to ensure they are informed; the airline companies are merely urged to do so.
But information for citizens is an express dictat of European laws.
Why did you not mention this?
Fourthly, if the USA infringes the agreement, the only solution open to the European Union is to abolish it completely.
How will this be done, Commissioner, when even if 26 of the 27 Member States consider that it has been infringed and one considers that it has not, the agreement cannot be abolished at European level?
Fifthly, the legal intended uses of the data cited are uncontrolled.
While at the beginning of the letter they are limited to combating terrorism and serious crime, immediately afterwards any use is allowed in any criminal proceedings or however otherwise required under US law, that is, for almost anything.
This is not an international agreement; at least not as the citizens understand the term.
I do hope it will be changed on these crucial points before it is signed.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I note that the Council Presidency is absent during this important debate, which is remarkable as it was responsible for the negotiations.
I am therefore thankful for the presence of Mr Frattini.
However, I would like to start by objecting to the implicit link that Mr Frattini makes with the failed terrorist attacks in the UK last week.
I find that distasteful: it has nothing to do with PNR.
That brings me to an important point that this House has emphasised many times and that is the need for an evaluation.
We need evidence that the use of PNR data leads to greater security and that they are not used only to catch people who commit document fraud, drug smuggling or whatever. We need evidence and not just anecdotes.
Mr Frattini says that this is a good agreement.
Well, it serves two purposes: firstly, to legalise the transfer of data by carriers and, secondly, to provide, as he has said, a high level of data protection.
Well, it fails miserably on the second objective; it is not legally binding, it explicitly states that it does not confer any rights on any person or any party.
Well, how much clearer can it get?
Then, it looks good superficially, but it is full of loopholes, open definitions and exceptions, when it comes to purpose limitation, for example, or the retention periods, which are going up to 15 years and maybe even more, and they will be applied retroactively.
I am not a lawyer, but that strikes me as distinctly funny.
The reduction from 34 to 19 data is an insult to our intelligence.
If you look at the data, it is not a reduction: the 34 are merged into 19 data fields.
I am not stupid.
We may not have any powers here but we are not stupid.
Then with pull to push: we got that promise back in 2004.
We still do not have it!
It is technically feasible, so why do we not have it?
Democratic oversight is completely lacking.
This House may not have competences any more, but the national parliaments are completely excluded.
Some of the national parliaments will get to approve the agreement, but they can only say 'yes' or 'yes', because they do not have time, they do not get all the necessary information - only very summary information - and it has just been pointed out that if one national parliament says 'no' then there is no agreement and no parliament will want to take that responsibility, so they have their backs against the wall.

With regard to the Privacy Act, it is good that it now covers European citizens.
We asked for that many times.
However, we all know that the Bush Administration uses all sorts of exceptions and exemptions to the Privacy Act, which, incidentally, affects American citizens as it does European citizens.
To conclude, concerning Mr Frattini's proposal on a European PNR scheme - which is not a real proposal because he floated it at a press conference rather than putting a real proposal before this House, I think the timing - last week - was wrong and I would like to know what the justification is for such a scheme.
We do not even know what purpose the PNR agreement with the United States serves.
We do not know how many terrorists were caught, how many attacks were prevented and how many false positives there have been.
We have insisted on an evaluation before signing a new agreement.
Finally, I would like to recommend that the PPE-DE Group support the joint motion for a resolution that we will negotiate tomorrow, read the agreement very carefully and read between the lines, because it is not as good as it looks.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this is the third agreement we are discussing in this Parliament on the transfer of passenger data to the United States, and things are not getting any better.
Commissioner Frattini, you claim that the data is only used for the fight against terrorism or against serious international crime.
As you know the agreement well, you will also be aware that Annex II stipulates, as Mr Lambrinidis said, or otherwise required by law, by US-law that is, which opens up its scope considerably, of course.
In general, I think that this is not the place either where you should make things out to be better than they really are.
This also applies to the data, as Mrs in 't Veld said a moment ago.
I have the two annexes here in front of me: an old annex to the old agreement and a new annex to the new agreement, one of which contains 19 data fields while the other contains 34.
I would very much like to hear from you presently what data, according to you, will no longer be transferred to the United States.
I want to know this very specifically because, as I see it, there is not one data field that will no longer be transferred to the United States, let alone 15.
Turning to the other item of push and pull, here too, I am tired of people acting as if major progress is being made.
On two occasions, the Americans have moved this proposal, and you have had to negotiate once again with a view to them simply delivering on their own promises.
Surely this is unacceptable in transatlantic relations.
Finally, I checked the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] website today for redress inquiries.
It states that if you think you are under suspicion and that you are on a watch list of people who are denied airline boarding, they cannot let you know what the data is that they have on you, but you will have to inform them of the reason why you think you are under suspicion.
Surely this is not the way to let people seek travel redress!
So I would have to say to you, yes, I might be a vegetarian, but this will really not tell you anything.
It is too absurd for words that people do not have access to the data on which they appear to be judged.
(NL) Mr President, following endless debates, pulling and pushing, I had hoped for an adequate explanation where effectiveness is concerned, or the supposed effectiveness of an agreement such as this one.
However, this hope soon evaporated when I read the agreement, one that was announced with so much pomp and circumstance by Mr SchÃ€uble and others, including yourself.
Not a word was breathed about this supposed effectiveness.
How many terrorists have been stopped in their tracks on the basis of the existing interim agreement?
Of course, like the Commission, I too understand the importance of having an agreement, not least on account of the position of the European aviation industry.
Legal certainty is important to everyone, but rules and regulations should not be there for rules and regulations' sake.
What struck me, above all, having read this agreement, is that a great deal is coming out of our own pocket.
It remains completely beyond me why we as a Union allow ourselves to be pushed into such an underdog position.
Both the Council and Commission could learn from the perseverance displayed by our champion Mrs in 't Veld.
All credit therefore to her and her unstinting efforts.
Finally, whilst the fight against terrorism is, of course, an important one, I cannot shake off the impression that we are at risk of losing sight of reality in this matter.
This agreement is not enough, not by a long shot.
Mr President, I am afraid that I am going to continue in a slightly sceptical line, but first of all a question to the Commissioner.
Could he please tell us what is the legal basis of this agreement from the EU side?
The only reference I can find to any legal instruments in it are to US Statutes.
I do not find any reference to legal bases from the Treaties.
I remember talk of Articles 24 and 38 earlier on.
If Article 38 is one of them, then why is the European Parliament not formally consulted?
Secondly, we hear a lot about needing this to fight terrorism.
If terrorism is such an important priority of the EU, why have we gone four months without a counter-terrorism coordinator?
Thirdly, this agreement is about collecting a huge amount of data on everyone, as a basis for profiling, data mining etc., but we have very poor implementation of targeted measures against terrorism.
The Director of Interpol has just launched what has been called in the press an 'unprecedented attack on the UK' for failing to check visitors against the Interpol database of stolen passports.
When the Commission produced a report last year on the common position of January 2005, it was distinctly unimpressed by Member States' achievements.
Only a small number of Member States had established infrastructures for authorities to search the Interpol databases - 8 of the 25 Member States did not respond to the Commission's inquiries - and very few Member States had made sure that their law enforcement authorities searched the database.
Member States are completely ignoring their obligations.
Finally, we have the EU APIS Directive of 2004, which should have been implemented last year.
Could the Commissioner tell us whether the Member States have implemented this Directive, why it is concerned only with illegal immigration and why it does not provide for visitors to be checked against terrorist watch lists?
There are plenty of measures out there which are being completely unimplemented by Member States.
Let us do that first before we have mass surveillance of the whole population.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who have spoken, even though I do not agree with most of their speeches, but you know that I always speak my mind with absolute frankness.
Ladies and gentlemen, agreements are made between two parties.
The United States has the power to accept or reject an agreement.
We had a duty, first of all, to ask the Council of Ministers for a mandate, which we were given and within which we have operated.
The agreement has been approved by the Member States - after all, they granted us the power to negotiate - so they clearly thought that having this agreement was immensely better than the possibility of not having any agreement at all after 31 July this year, which is actually in a few days' time.
Quite frankly, I should like to have heard those who criticised this agreement so harshly make at least one comment on the consequences of not having any agreement at all.
Can any of you imagine that the airlines would have negotiated bilaterally with the United States and achieved a better level of personal data protection?
I do not think anyone can even imagine that that might have happened.
The protection of European citizens' personal data would have been in serious jeopardy without the certainty of legally binding rules.
As you know, for the first time we have a binding agreement, unlike the previous one, which involved no binding commitments but just unilateral ones.
In this agreement, we have recognised the 'push' principle as a fundamental criterion, as this Parliament has demanded on several occasions.
The fact that some airlines have said that they are not yet in a position to switch over from pull to push does not depend on either the United States or Europe, but rather on the fact that some of them have so far been unable to change system on technical grounds.
Since others have been able to do so, it must depend on their technical ability and willingness, and we shall help them to make the move.
We have set the 'push' system as a criterion; if, however, an airline says it is technically unable to implement it, other proposals need to be examined.
Can we deny that airline landing rights?
I am ready to examine any proposals, but we have also set a deadline, which is the end of this year.
That seems technically feasible, since IATA (the International Air Transport Association) has told us that it is reasonable to expect all airlines to be technically capable of introducing the new system within six months.
It is purely down to technical reasons.
We have established that sensitive data will be destroyed within 30 days, a measure that had not been agreed previously, and we have established that the US Privacy Act will apply to European citizens, something that had been mentioned in many debates here in Parliament as an essential condition: European citizens will be able to complain under the same law as US citizens if the US Department of Homeland Security misuses their data.
That is something that did not exist before, and I am giving you actual facts.
Mr Lambrinidis has rightly mentioned third countries.
It is true that the data in question can be passed on to third countries but, as you know, it is laid down that there will be the same power of control over the correct use of such data.
The fact that they are passed on to a third country does not affect the power of control: the third country will use the data in accordance with the very same rules laid down in this agreement and we shall retain the same power to check whether the data have been used properly or not.
Someone asked about the possibility of terminating the agreement.
The possibility does of course exist, in the event of a substantial breach, and you are perfectly well aware of the legal basis adopted.
Article 24 of the Treaty is an intergovernmental basis and not, unfortunately, a Community basis, because the European Union Court of Justice has so ruled.
An agreement had previously been negotiated on a basis that allowed for your full participation as the European Parliament.
Unfortunately, the Court of Justice ruling established that the legal basis was incorrect and, as you know, everything stems from that ruling.
It is a fact, Mr Lambsdorff, that many Member States are not complying with European measures, which instead ought to be fully implemented.
You know perfectly well not only that I published the state of the art country by country just a few days ago, but also that I have initiated infringement procedures, and I do not think I need to wait for the outcome of those to adopt useful proposals to combat terrorism.
I do not share the opinion of those who say, 'We should do other things first and then worry about terrorism.'
Terrorism is a serious and present threat.
I think this agreement could have been better if we had been negotiating it alone but, since agreements are made between two sides, it is a compromise and, in the spirit of compromise, the Council of Ministers approved it unanimously.
In my view it was right to do so, and the German Presidency was given due recognition for all the hard work it put into this agreement.
It is a binding agreement which will certainly help to fight terrorism or, better still, to prevent it.
No member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should forget that the US Secretary of Homeland Security came to Parliament and gave you some information and, in some cases, specific facts about terror suspects who were stopped thanks to PNR data.
There were just a few cases, but they concern people who were stopped thanks to PNR data and were later involved in bomb attacks elsewhere in the world.
Despite all the impact assessments that we have conducted and may yet conduct, I believe that the agreement in question, which provides legal certainty, is infinitely better than the absence of an agreement.
I am sorry that we do not agree on this point, but I have a duty to be sincere.
Mr President, we are lacking an important piece of information.
The PPE-DE Group is basing its positive opinion partly on the fact that the amount of data now being sent to the US is reduced from 34 to 19.
I have challenged the Commission to say which of the 15 pieces of information are no longer being transferred to the US, because as far as I see it - and the rapporteur Sophia in 't Veld also mentioned this - most of the fields are merged so that the change is mainly cosmetic.
I would like to be convinced that the opposite is true.
I would like the Commission to list the 15 information fields which are now no longer being transferred to the US.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 12 July 2007.
Measuring devices containing mercury (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury (05665/1/2007 - C6-0114/2007 - (Rapporteur: MarÃ­a Sornosa MartÃ­nez).
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House all agree that it is necessary to reduce the demand for mercury in the manufacture of products and to speed up its substitution.
It would be appropriate to introduce Community level marketing restrictions on mercury-containing measuring and control equipment for consumer use, with some exemptions in the healthcare sector.
We want to prevent significant amounts of mercury entering the waste stream.
In that way, we shall contribute to guaranteeing a high level of protection of the environment and human health, whilst preserving the internal market, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty.
Mercury and its components are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife.
Initially seen as a diffuse local problem, mercury pollution is now understood to be global, chronic and serious.
As regards a potential blanket ban on the use of mercury in all devices, which is the aim of this proposal, it should be emphasised that the experts the Commission consulted have come to the conclusion that hospitals need devices with a high level of accuracy to treat life-threatening conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia and pre-eclampsia.
Mercury sphygmomanometers provide the appropriate level of accuracy and reliability to ensure patient safety.
We are therefore currently proposing that these instruments be exempted from the ban until there are complete guarantees with regard to the functioning of possible alternative instruments.
I would also once again call upon the Commission to adopt short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury currently circulating in society are collected separately and safely processed.
Otherwise, this Directive will be less effective in practice.
With regard to the production of new traditional barometers containing mercury, which has been the most controversial aspect in this Parliament, we proposed an agreement that there would be a transitional period of two years for manufacturers to enable them to adapt to the new rules.
Unfortunately, not all of the political groups have agreed to this, though I believe that we will have a sufficient majority in this House to adopt it.
With regard to the manufacturers of these barometers, I would like to say that they will have this transitional period of two years in order to stop using mercury in their industrial processes.
They will not suffer any competitive disadvantage or economic harm, since we know that they have been manufacturing this kind of barometer without using mercury for some time.
We must remind our citizens that this equipment may pose a risk to health and the environment, since it can break easily and end up being dumped, or, worse still, if it is burnt, the mercury is dispersed into the atmosphere, polluting the air, the soil and water.
Mercury thereby enters the food chain, mainly into fish, and then us human beings.
As this House is well aware, at second reading, a majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has rejected the amendments intended to make it possible to continue manufacturing new mercury barometers.
I believe that it would be irresponsible for us to accept that request and I therefore call upon all the honourable Members to vote against it, as the Council and the European Commission also propose, and I thank them for all of their efforts to avoid a possible conciliation procedure.
Finally, I would once again call upon the Commission to increase awareness within the population through the organisation of information campaigns on the health risks resulting from exposure to mercury and the environmental problems it may cause, since I fear that the citizens are not yet sufficiently well-informed about its toxicity, unfortunately.
I would like to end by thanking the Commission for its work and for the possibility of reaching an agreement at second reading.
Thanks, too, to the Council and to the political groups that have supported this proposal.
Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by offering my sincere thanks to Mrs Sornoza MartÃ­nez, the rapporteur, on her work on this proposal.
We are discussing a very important directive this evening. It is an important part of our strategy for banishing mercury from our environment for ever - a strategy that has long been backed by the European Parliament.
Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment.
The directive will therefore bring a major step forward, it will restrict the marketing of certain new measuring devices containing mercury and in that way prevent some 30 tonnes of mercury entering the environment through waste every year.
The proposed directive aims to cut the use of this hazardous material in measuring instruments to a minimum and to allow exceptions only where the risks are negligible or there are no substitutes.
Thus, the marketing of mercury-containing fever thermometers will be banned completely, for example, and the sale of all other mercury-containing measuring instruments to the general public will be prevented.
I believe it is right that there will be an exception for blood pressure meters in the health sector and for antique measuring instruments.
The proposals were drawn up on the basis of a risk assessment and detailed impact assessment that were developed for the mercury strategy.
This directive does not only safeguard human health and the environment, it will also serve to maintain the internal market, since it will introduce harmonised rules for the marketing of mercury-containing measuring devices everywhere in the Community.
The rapporteur recommends approval of the Council common position without further amendment.
The Commission agrees with this entirely, since the common position has adopted some of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading and represents a balanced compromise between the effort to ban the use of mercury to the greatest possible extent in order to safeguard human health and the environment on the one hand while ensuring the safety of patients in the health sector on the other.
I must confirm what the rapporteur has already said: the majority of experts still consider mercury-containing blood pressure meters, sphygmomanometers, essential in the treatment of certain life-threatening diseases.
We shall have to look into this matter, however.
If there are safe alternatives available for these instruments, too, then mercury should be banned here as well.
The Commission will therefore be reviewing the derogation in two years' time.
A further derogation means that antique measuring instruments, that is those that are at least 50 years old, will still be able to be sold.
The Commission is able to agree with this because antique instruments are predominantly collector's items which, because of their value, are handled very carefully and come onto the market in only very small numbers.
In the Commission's view, however, there is no justification for an unlimited derogation for the further sale of new mercury barometers to consumers.
Since there are alternatives to mercury barometers that are just as decorative and reliable, there is absolutely no need for this hazardous substance to be used in the manufacture of barometers.
An unlimited derogation for such instruments would be in stark contradiction to the stance taken by the European Parliament in relation to highly dangerous substances when adopting the new REACH legislation on chemicals.
A transitional period of two years, as now provided in the directive, is perfectly adequate to allow the few remaining manufacturers of mercury barometers to convert to alternatives.
In any case, many of those manufacturers, if not all of them, already offer alternative products.
Under no circumstances, therefore, will the Commission agree to the amendments that have been tabled seeking permanent derogations for barometers.
I urgently request your assistance in backing the common position so that the directive can now be adopted at second reading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, we have been through these arguments on a number of occasions so I shall keep my argument as brief as possible.
The only remaining issue to be resolved, as the Commissioner and Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez pointed out, is that of barometers.
I have to say that I remain deeply convinced that both the Commission and the Council, and some Members of this Parliament, have got the argument completely wrong.
There is no justification whatsoever for a ban on barometers.
They are only being singled out because there is only a relatively small number of companies which still produce them in Europe and they are an easy target as far as the Commission is concerned, to make it look as though they are actually doing something about mercury, whereas the big sources of release of mercury - from power stations, crematoria, etc. - are not being tackled because, of course, to tackle them would be very expensive for Member State governments and local authorities.
This Parliament passed an amendment to exempt barometer-makers at first reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in this Parliament.
The Council then rejected it, albeit with a two-year phase-out period.
The Environment Committee did not support the amendment this time round, I am sorry to say, but I have retabled the amendments in order to give Parliament a further opportunity to make a decision on this and, as Members are no doubt aware, a very vigorous campaign is being fought by a number of independent operators and distributors throughout Europe.
It is a completely illogical position to say that antique instruments will be exempted but new instruments will be banned.
There are probably more antique instruments being circulated and placed on the market in Europe than there are new instruments being created.
It is a very small minority specialist market and Europe brings itself into disrepute by delegitimising, by banning, by forcing out of business, a small number of very entrepreneurial and gifted craftsmen.
They can be controlled by a proper licensing and control regime which they have said that they are willing to pay for.
That would be by far the most sensible solution rather than an outright ban and to force a number of small companies out of business, thereby losing the skills and traditions that have existed in Europe for several hundred years.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am indebted to Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez, who has our warm and unqualified support.
Mercury, and particularly mercury compounds and mercury vapours, is toxic.
Mercury can accumulate in brain tissue and the nervous system, where it can wreak great havoc. This, in turn, can lead to reduced intelligence.
An intelligent policy, therefore, prohibits the use of mercury in unnecessary applications.
Given that alternatives are available, it is to be welcomed that the mercury thermometer is consigned to the past.
Barometers are the subject of much debate.
In the Netherlands, the use of mercury has been banned since 2003, but barometers were exempt until 2005 and then, pending fresh European rules, until 1 January 2006.
We are willing to extend the exemption period by another two years for traditional barometers, which are, it has to be said, delightful things.
As this brings the total delay to 1 January 2010, there is enough time to develop alternatives, which, as the Commissioner confirmed, are already available to a large extent.
Whilst I can, of course, imagine that this is hard for producers of barometers to take, if we want to banish mercury altogether, we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it.
Barometers may break or leak, so that mercury ends up in the environment anyway.
I therefore agree with the producers of barometers that the use of mercury in low-energy light bulbs is, of course, also very harmful.
It is a good idea to change over to LED lights as soon as possible, but this Directive is about mercury in measuring devices and not about low-energy light bulbs.
I would therefore once again like to express my warm support to Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez, who I believe has chosen a very good line of attack.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez on her excellent report.
This legislative report follows the mercury strategy report adopted by this House last year.
It aims at restricting the placing on the market of new measuring devices containing mercury.
Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez rightly agrees in the main with the proposal before us and reserves only some derogations in cases where there are no appropriate substitutes yet available.
My group strongly supports this proposal and considers the rapporteur's amendments useful and appropriate.
Overall, the proposal meets with widespread agreement across Parliament, apart from the single, well-known issue of the barometer controversy.
The difference, as you know, is that the Council has agreed to the compromise proposal to grant a two-year derogation after the entry into force of the directive to a small number of producers of traditional-looking, present-day manufactured barometers.
This, we feel, is a reasonable solution and gives those manufacturers time to implement mercury-free substitutes into their products.
This view is not shared by some colleagues who hold the opinion expressed in Amendments 1 and 2 that there should be a permanent derogation for traditional-looking barometers.
The matter is not of huge importance in substance, as the amount of mercury used in these instruments is tiny and safety measures are adequately implemented by the manufacturers.
At the same time, as a question of principle, no long-term derogation is necessary as the manufacturers have ample time to adapt in the case of safe alternative chemicals without the need to introduce a risky precedent in safety directives.
The issue has, unfortunately, been blown out of all proportion by a section of the national press that want to portray the matter as one of heartless and bureaucratic big-brother-style EU interfering with poor, honest-to-goodness traditional instrument manufacturers and trying to destroy them.
This, as you will appreciate, is not true.
The position of my group is to follow scientific logic and not to accept permanent derogations for barometers but, realising the strength of feeling amongst some MEPs, we will not be unduly strict with those in our group who choose not to follow the group line, although there is always the risk of the barometer amendment going through and jeopardising the whole proposal.
Let us hope that this will not happen.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury is an important document as it limits the amount of mercury released into the environment.
Mercury enters the food chain in the form of methylmercury in an aquatic environment, affecting fish, fruit, vegetables and eventually human beings.
It accumulates in our bodies and poisons us.
Every year, 33 tonnes of mercury enter into circulation in new equipment and 27 tonnes in used equipment.
Technical advances have reduced the use of mercury in industry and manufactured products.
In dealing with mercury it is essential to recover it from used equipment and to drastically reduce imports of such equipment from countries outside the Union.
All European Union Member States should impose a ban of this kind following early amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain dangerous substances and preparations.
I would like to thank Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez for her work.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) I used to play with mercury as a little boy.
Hopefully, this directive will mean that future generations of children will not do so.
There is now a compromise with the Council, and it is high time that we accepted it.
We know that mercury is harmful both to people and to the environment and that it can almost always be replaced by less dangerous substances.
The compromise in the Council of Ministers is a balanced one and comes 14 years after Sweden introduced its national ban on mercury thermometers.
There is no more time to lose.
Those who are now considering voting through a technically unjustified proposal from the barometer lobby should know that the whole ban will be in danger of being delayed and made more difficult to implement if the proposal is approved.
It would be irresponsible to vote through such a proposal.
Dentists, laboratories and hospitals have phased out mercury.
There is no difficulty at all in measuring air pressure without mercury.
Anyone nostalgic for an old barometer will be able to buy one.
Even with this ban - which does not apply to antiques - it is still legal to do so in the internal market.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, it has long been known that mercury compounds are harmful to human beings and to the environment.
Mercury enters the food chain easily.
The groups most at risk are children, including unborn children, and people in direct contact with mercury.
Mercury damages the human body by impairing the nervous system, coordination, and also sight, with negative consequences for health and the environment.
It is therefore right and proper to introduce provisions restricting the use of mercury in certain measuring devices.
Medical devices containing mercury should, however, be withdrawn from the market gradually, especially in new Member States that have only limited resources available for their health services.
By way of example it is estimated that the additional public expenditure required pursuant to a ban on the use of mercury thermometers will amount to around PLN 3 million a year.
Sudden withdrawal of measuring devices containing mercury will not only be very costly, but may also dissuade people from measuring temperature and blood pressure.
This is particularly serious as cheap electronic devices are not very accurate.
We proposed extending the transitional period, which would reduce the costs significantly.
We also believe that the ban should exclude thermometers for premature babies because of the specific range of measurements, their reliability and precision, and also ovulation thermometers used to diagnose irregularities and for reproduction as part of the basic natural family planning method.
In addition, veterinary thermometers are required for use in the diagnosis of animal diseases.
Finally, I should like to say that such hurried changes to legislation tend to arouse suspicions that vested interests are involved.
In this case, withdrawal of equipment containing mercury might not be due exclusively to a desire to protect health and the environment.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measuring devices directive is intended to remove around 30 tonnes of mercury from circulation, not very much but nevertheless an appreciable quantity.
The dangers of mercury are well known, its neurotoxicity undisputed.
Where human health is at risk, I believe the strict principle of substitution applies.
Where mercury is absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives, it can be retained under strict conditions.
Exceptions are therefore permitted only where there are no significant risks or where no alternatives are yet available.
The exceptions include sphygmomanometers for special applications and old measuring instruments, and it goes without saying that the number of old measuring instruments will continue to fall of its own accord.
I believe the transitional period of two years for barometers is quite sufficient.
The decisive thing for me is the harmonisation of the internal market, which is taken a step further here.
I approve the common position.
(SV) It is, in actual fact, astonishing that we are forced to have this debate.
Mercury is one of the most dangerous poisons in our midst.
Of course it should not be used unless absolutely necessary.
I am amazed that anyone at all can believe that it is more important to go on manufacturing old-style barometers and thermometers than to protect public health.
As a pregnant woman, I am all too aware of all the risks that mercury entails.
I know that no one who is to give birth should eat the fish that I myself and others like me ate throughout the period when we were growing up.
Is that how things should be?
Should it not be possible for young women to eat ordinary food?
Should pregnant woman have to worry that their unborn children have been damaged by mercury from, for example, products that quite unnecessarily contain that substance?
In the run-up to this debate we received letters to the effect that we must safeguard the manufacture of traditional barometers.
That is genuinely embarrassing.
How can anyone believe that I attach more importance to whatever pleasure there may be in owning a barometer than to the risk posed to future generations by the use of mercury?
I hope that, by voting tomorrow against all the amendments aimed at retaining the use of mercury, all my fellow Members will show how embarrassing those letters are and demonstrate that we are taking our responsibility for the environment and public health seriously.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree: mercury is highly toxic.
It is harmful to the environment, to animals and, through the food chain and by other routes, to human beings.
It is right that this element should be replaced where it is possible and sensible to do so, but not always and at any price and not because of the properties of the substance itself, but whenever its use really does present a hazard to the environment.
We cannot remove mercury from circulation completely in any case, because then we would also have to say goodbye to another product that is much valued by many Members of this House.
The energy-saving light bulb, which many would prefer to impose by law in order to protect the climate, also contains mercury.
If energy-saving light bulbs were universally used, we would have at least as much of it in our households as at present with traditional barometers.
I do not think much of banning mercury and a whole group of craft businesses from the EU market tomorrow while at the same time wanting to screw mercury lamps into our light fittings.
I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about these conflicting aims.
(SK) Mercury is used in many measuring devices, thermometers and barometers.
Mercury has also been used successfully, and without major health implications, in dentistry in the form of amalgam fillings.
On the other hand, however, under certain circumstances mercury is known to be harmful and can accumulate in living organisms, including the human body.
We are all aware that the Council's joint position includes most of the amendments already adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2006.
This was reflected in the text, where the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs see almost eye to eye, so that we were close to finalising the legislative process during the first reading.
There is a major point of difference between the Council and Parliament, however, concerning the production of devices which use mercury, notably barometers.
As we know, Parliament voted in favour of a complete exemption, whereas the Council is proposing an exemption limited to two years, which appears to be appropriate.
A ban would apply to new mercury barometers, but it seems sensible to regard second-hand barometers as acceptable, as this would make possible their continued sale, repair and maintenance.
As a citizen and consumer, I support the type of compromise backed by the rapporteur, which will not jeopardise the overall health of the general public and will enable conventional barometer manufacturers to adapt more quickly to the new situation.
Mr President, I think we should remind ourselves that this is part of a wider strategy to phase out mercury.
No sector has been singled out - not thermometers, nor barometers - because there is going to be a set of actions over a number of years.
I think Mr Ulmer got it right: we have agreed under the REACH Directive that if there is a safe alternative to dangerous chemicals, we should move towards that alternative.
We have all agreed on that in this House; all the major political groups signed up to REACH.
So to say 'let us make an exemption for barometers' at this stage is totally inconsistent with the REACH Directive.
What is more, the REACH Directive would cover barometers.
There is an amendment about licensing barometers.
Well, that does not address the issue of spillages, accidental damage or waste disposal, landfill and incineration.
In the United States in May, somebody found a broken barometer in a storage cupboard in a school.
The school was closed for a week.
The whole school had to be evacuated and there was a clean-up bill amounting to thousands of dollars.
Sixteen US States are moving towards mercury prohibitions on barometers and other equipment.
In fact, they are going much further than the European Commission is proposing to go here today.
So anybody who is talking about nanny-state Europe is totally misplaced when they are looking at the barometer issue.
The PSE Group pushed for the two-year phase-out for the barometer industry.
We know these are small companies, we know it will pose some difficulties for them, but I think they were aware of the REACH Directive coming their way anyway, and I think this is a sensible compromise.
Finally, Mr Schlyter talked about how he used to play with mercury when he was a child.
Many people have said this to me during the course of this debate.
We used to play with it in the past.
I always point out that we used to drive in cars without seatbelts; we used to breathe in leaded petrol; and at Christmas time I used to get sweet cigarettes in my Christmas stocking.
There are things to change and I think now is the time to change them.
Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be glad to once again clarify the Commission's policy with regard to the handling of demonstrably highly toxic substances in our environment.
We cannot rule out risks in our society, but whenever the conditions for substitution are present, substitution must take priority.
I fail to understand how anyone could see it differently.
If it is not necessary to work with highly toxic substances in our environment, then we simply must not do it.
That also applies with regard to the energy-saving light bulbs that Mr Krahmer mentioned, which do indeed contain very small quantities of mercury.
There are as yet no substitutes for that.
But work must be done on it, and as soon as there are substitutes, manufacture without the use of mercury must of course be preferred here too.
May I conclude by talking about barometers again.
No one is a greater friend of beautiful old instruments than I am. I am a great friend of traditional production methods, a great friend of traditional firms, especially small firms.
And no one wants to drive even one small traditional firm off the European market.
I have here a catalogue from one of these manufacturers.
There is no doubt at all.
Even today they offer beautiful barometers that show not the slightest external difference from the barometers that were manufactured in the past, but they no longer contain mercury.
Even the famous Prince of Wales barometer, a copy of John Russel's royal barometer, nevertheless costing GBP 795, is already available without the slightest trace of mercury.
The argument that even one firm could be forced out of business is simply not correct.
I can therefore tell you quite clearly that we are not acting in these small firms' interests if we prevent them from doing what is necessary to give their products a future.
And these traditional barometers will only have a future if they are made without mercury.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007.
Mr President, I wonder if you could check that the interpretation came out correctly.
I said I played with mercury as a child and I hope future generations will not be exposed to that risk.
Just to be absolutely clear.
That is how I understood it, Mr Schlyter: I can assure you, I did the same thing and I hope to live to an old age.
European Critical Infrastructure (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection - C6-0053/2007 -
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for this important report, which follows the presentation of an initiative by the Commission.
The protection of critical infrastructure is, of course, a priority for the European Commission as well as for the Member States, not least because the need to protect critical infrastructure from the eventuality of a terrorist attack, for instance, derives from the very nature of such infrastructures and the interconnection and interdependence between them.
Indeed, if a physical or technological infrastructure is attacked in one Member State, the effect will inevitably be felt in other Member States.
That is why we need a common European prevention and protection framework.
Our view was that the best way forward was to involve the private sector first of all, which means drawing on currently available technologies and stimulating more technological research.
We would then call on companies and research laboratories to collaborate by placing the outcome of such research at the disposal of the common European framework.
The idea is to have proper security schemes devoted to the various infrastructure sectors and a real network of liaison officers to ensure that this common European framework functions.
Our idea is to take into consideration only those infrastructures that are truly cross-border in nature and not of course those confined to the territory of just one Member State, unless that particular critical infrastructure has an influence that goes beyond the borders of that Member State.
As you know, we adopted a communication last December to set up a European programme for critical infrastructure protection, together with a proposal for a directive to identify which infrastructure needs protecting.
I am therefore grateful to Parliament for having examined all the proposals on such an important subject.
The communication, of course, identifies principles and processes to be carried out as well as the instruments for carrying out the processes, while the directive lays down rules for identifying those infrastructures which, according to a common European approach, require protection.
It is our intention to develop this action plan through a broad web of public-private collaboration.
We think that the Member States should be assisted in developing the various initiatives included in the action plan; we are also convinced that the international dimension must be taken into account and that financial measures must be put in place.
Of course, we already have a financial programme for the prevention, preparation and management of the consequences of the terrorist threat, which may be able to provide appropriate funds for critical infrastructure protection measures.
I can say straight away that I can accept certain important amendments that Parliament is preparing to examine.
The first concerns the need to emphasise in the text of the directive that it is the responsibility of each Member State to identify the most appropriate forms and methods of implementing it: in other words, we must stress the principle of flexibility in the implementation of the directive, on the basis of which the measures, whether mandatory or not, should be put into practice without an excessively rigid approach.
The second point that I think is acceptable concerns the need to clarify the procedures for exempting certain sectors from some of the obligations laid down in the directive.
The Commission has foreseen the possibility of exempting certain sectors, and Parliament's draft amendments substantially seek to specify more clearly when a particular exemption applies to a given sector.
I believe I can agree on the need to introduce some specification, thus making things clearer.
I also agree with the proposal to amend the list of critical infrastructure protection sectors given in Annex I to the proposal for a directive.
I think Parliament's proposal to amend that annex is acceptable, as is the introduction of certain changes to the sectors where resorting to the comitology procedure is envisaged.
There is a specific proposal on that, although we should be aware that by limiting the use of comitology we would be increasing the time it would take to implement the directive.
Basically, comitology is perhaps a rather complicated instrument, but it does save time in implementation, However, I am not against accepting the idea behind those amendments.
To conclude, Mr President, I can say that I am happy and pleased with the report before us, and I hope Parliament will adopt it by a large majority.
We need to show that we are speaking with one voice on a strategic measure such as this European initiative to protect critical energy, transport and technological infrastructures, which require strong prevention and protection measures, because the terrorist threat is unfortunately directed first and foremost at critical infrastructures.
I am therefore grateful to Parliament for the contribution that it has already made and is yet to make to this work of ours.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, back in June 2004, the Council tabled a request in which the Commission was asked to prepare a general strategy to protect critical infrastructure.
In the past three years, the topic has not been off the Commission agenda, quite rightly so.
In line with the wishes of the Council and the European Parliament, the Commission finally moved a proposal for a European programme to protect critical infrastructure, which culminated in the Directive we are debating today.
As rapporteur, I support the idea of a common framework in this matter.
The effective protection of vulnerable critical infrastructures and services requires communication, coordination and cooperation in which all interested parties are involved, both at national and at European level.
The complex processes and interfaces of critical infrastructure with a transnational dimension are, as I see it, also legitimate areas for consideration.
As Commissioner Frattini has already explained on several occasions, damage to, or loss of, a certain infrastructural provision in a Member State can impact badly on various other Member States and even on the European economy as a whole.
Thanks to new technologies, for example the Internet, as well as the far-reaching liberalisation of the market, for example where the supply of electricity and gas is concerned, many infrastructural provisions are already part of bigger networks.
Indeed, in these circumstances, the effectiveness of all these protective measures is determined by the weakest link.
I do take the view, though, as Mr Frattini already observed, that the Commission has been slightly too proactive or overenthusiastic in some sections of the Directive.
It must be clear that the primary and ultimate responsibility lies with the Member States and the owners of this critical infrastructure.
From that point of view, I consider a bottom-up approach to be of critical importance.
Common action can, in my view, only be justified if at least three Member States were to experience adverse effects, or at least two Member States other than those in which the critical infrastructure is located.
After all, much has already been agreed upon bilaterally, which, to be honest, is also the most flexible solution.
In addition, I take the view that overlaps or inconsistencies with existing legislation and/or provisions should be avoided at all costs.
Existing criteria and mechanisms must therefore be taken into consideration.
It is equally important to me that the private sector is not faced with an unnecessary administrative burden.
I would urge them to make use of the expertise that is already available and would, above all, counsel against re-inventing the wheel.
I would therefore argue in favour of this pragmatic, yet structural, approach.
Following the debates in the parliamentary committees, certain groups of Parliament have also agreed to focus on so-called priority sectors.
It has, indeed, also been decided to scrap the proposed comitology procedure.
In the past, the use of the comitology procedure has too often led to shaky situations.
I am therefore very grateful to the Commissioner for his observations on this matter and on the other amendments and for the fact that he has shown his satisfaction.
I would like to have a reaction, however, to the definition of two to three Member States, because this is the most important amendment in my view.
I should like to finish off with an observation for the Council, which is once again conspicuous by its absence.
The agreement on a common position appears to be a bridge too far for them.
This is quite remarkable, given the fact that the Council asked for this common framework itself, and out of character too, because, if anything happens, then the Council is all too keen to be the first to immediately announce all manner of rules without really taking the quality of the proposals into account, their ramifications for the internal market, for example, or the European citizens for that matter.
After all, vision and power are two skills that can be expected from the Council in this matter.
At the opening of the plenary sitting earlier today, President Poettering spoke wise words.
Nobody is waiting for ad hoc rules and regulations that are dictated by panic.
A structural line of attack, on the other hand, taking the principles of rule of law into consideration - and the latter is vitally important - is very welcome.
I thank you and I thank the Commissioner.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, cross-border crises, whether caused by terrorism or natural disasters, call for Union-wide protection of critical infrastructures.
Critical infrastructures cannot be kept secret by not mentioning them.
It would be completely naÃ¯ve to think that.
From a psychological point of view, the destruction of critical infrastructures leads to a loss of public confidence in the European Union.
Crisis protection is not therefore only a national matter but requires European crisis management, as the Commission proposes.
Moreover, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has clearly pointed out, moving elements of European infrastructures outside the EU increases the risk of terrorist attacks and access to data in particular makes the entire infrastructure more vulnerable.
This is also true of banking and insurance.
Even if security and controls are constantly being improved in these areas, there is still a need for additional coordinated European action.
Nobody will want double regulation. What we need is greater security.
The Directorate General for the Market must be guided by that and not by short-sighted wishes expressed by industry.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is of the opinion, for its area of responsibility, that with this proposal for a directive the Commission is exceeding its powers, because it is misunderstanding its instructions.
It speaks of stabilising the internal market, but the directive is supposed to be principally about protection against acts of terrorism.
Moreover, the Commission proposal contravenes the principle of subsidiarity, because it seeks not only to complement Member States' existing measures, but to replace some of them.
Finally, the proposal does not address the real task, but delegates it to a comitology committee.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism therefore rejected the Commission proposal, although we know that we do of course need European cooperation.
The question is simply how.
My main concern is to ensure that the Member States are not obliged to notify their critical European infrastructures to the Commission so that it can then make a complete list of sensitive EU infrastructures, attach security plans to it and then store everything in some office in Brussels.
That would be against national security interests.
Such a list would be an interesting source of information for terrorists.
All that should be done by the Commission is to define and list in general terms the most important sectors at risk.
It should be left to the Member States to identify those sectors, because it is they who are primarily responsible for the protection of critical infrastructures and they carry the ultimate responsibility for measures to protect critical infrastructures within their national borders.
In the interests of national security, that must continue to be the case.
Only a devolved management of sensitive infrastructures can reduce the level of risk.
I believe the narrower definition of critical European infrastructures, according to which at least three Member States, or two others than the one in which the critical infrastructure is located, must be affected, is the right one.
We must ensure that the directive covers only European infrastructures and no national ones.
I also consider that bilateral cooperation between Member States is more sensible in this area on security grounds.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, most sincerely and assure her of my support.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, indisputably, we have raised a very difficult issue with critical European infrastructures.
There can be no doubt, however, that we need to get to grips with this question at European level and find and develop solutions jointly with the Member States, because the potential threats which the Commissioner has just described do exist and must therefore be taken seriously.
It is, however, extremely difficult to say where the European competence lies in this matter, what must be organised at European level and where particular devolved tasks must be dealt with.
This question occupied us in committee for a very long time.
We have tried - and I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her very fair and open cooperation - to find a way that will ensure the exchange of best practice between the Member States with EU-wide coordination, while at the same time keeping the subsidiarity principle central.
Neither, as Mrs Sommer has already said, do we want to notify specific critical infrastructures and collect them somewhere, rather we want to ensure that secrecy is guaranteed.
That is why we agreed that the Member States should notify the Commission of their respective critical sectors but not specific infrastructures.
It was important for us not to go for a comitology procedure, and I am grateful to the Commissioner for accommodating Parliament on this.
As the rapporteur has already pointed out, the procedure's inefficiency in the past does not encourage us to go further down that route.
We suggest another way.
I also want to say that it was important for us that unnecessary bureaucracy should be avoided, that a contact point in the Member States should do the designating and identifying and that no new bureaucracies should be created, that administrative costs should be reined in and that there should be plenty of flexibility.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Poettering, referred today to this very report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert when he condemned the latest terrorist attacks, both on European territory - where airports were the targets - and in third countries, such as Yemen - in the case of the murdered Spanish tourists.
In the latter case, the target was not a specific infrastructure, but rather tourists travelling in a vehicle along a road.
This reference once again demonstrates or reinforces the importance of this exercise proposed to us by the Commission and for which I would like to thank the Commissioner most warmly.
This is not a single measure but rather part of a long process - which began in 2004 - which is now taking the form of increasingly interesting and effective measures.
Furthermore, in view of the complexity of our European society, based on these complex and open networks of communication, supply and services on which, additionally, the economy is founded, we must defend them and defend ourselves in view of their potential vulnerability to terrorist attacks.
I wish to point out that my group was more in agreement with the Commission's original proposal relating to the definition of critical European infrastructures, in the sense of infrastructures shared by two or more countries, or cases in which a State is affected by an infrastructure of another Member State.
For example, for us, the Eurotunnel could be a good example for the application of this optimum protection from possible attacks, not to mention airports, etc., where we have already suffered such attacks.
Tomorrow, therefore, we shall maintain this position in favour of the Commission's original proposal, because we want to remain hopeful that we may find more support in the Council.
In any event, we prefer to continue moving towards more integrated and European approaches, and we prefer to avoid savings that appear to reduce costs but that we could end up regretting in the future.
We do support everything that Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert proposes in terms of protection with regard to third countries; we support everything relating to the protection of the individual data involved; naturally, we support everything relating to the necessary confidentiality - we have long experience of dealing with this confidentiality, both at national level and at Commission level, and we do not believe that it is going to be violated in this case - and we also agree that we should avoid any duplication of what has already been done within the Member States and what the Commission is now proposing.

In this way, we hope to overcome the backward-looking position that we had to accept in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and with which my group still does not agree.
We hope that, with the proposal that will be put to the vote tomorrow, we will be able to continue moving forward and that with both what Parliament is proposing - and I am grateful for the great work by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and all of the honourable Members - and with what the Council is proposing, we will be able to achieve better protection of our critical European infrastructures.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to thank the Commission member and the honourable rapporteur for their suggestions; however, I would like to stress that these suggestions should be interpreted as only the beginning of the discussion.
I do not know whether the Internet can be described as critical infrastructure according to the definition used by the Commission.
It is hard for me to know, if a website was blocked in one country, would that mean that it was no longer critical infrastructure?
One need only block the website of a large bank that has its headquarters, let us say, in Germany, France or Great Britain, and all the residents of Europe will feel it.
We are talking about the consolidation of the financial sector, the consolidation of economic activity, even the consolidation of hotel chains.
In other words, we have to acknowledge that critical infrastructure has spilled into cyberspace, and I believe that Estonia is the first country to have experienced elements of cyber-war.
I regret that little attention has been paid to this, and now this topic is getting beyond the scope of the concerns of the Commission Member responsible for communications.
However, I would like to say that this topic has to be highlighted from a security point of view, because it is hard to imagine what the lives of European citizens would be like without the Internet.
Whether the Internet is European or whether it belongs to one country we cannot say - it is a world-wide web, and of course, to define how to protect the web from an attack that could be carried out at any minute is rather complicated and the level of debate has to be quite different.
We are presently talking mainly about physical infrastructure and, without a doubt, tragic scenes upset us, but life is becoming ever more virtual and this needs attention.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one in this House disputes that close cooperation between the Member States is very important and necessary for countering terrorist risks.
Our criticism is of how this is to be done.
More bureaucracy will not help us against terrorism!
I would like to thank the rapporteur for at least bringing the proposal back down to earth and greatly improving the Commission's version.
She has also made a number of very practical suggestions.
We are all agreed that improved cooperation and information are good things.
That can be done bilaterally or multilaterally.
But compiling a list of all at-risk infrastructures will bring no gains in terms of security and may even be counterproductive.
In the end, however, competence lies with the Member States in any case, and there is no point at all in shifting it to the European level.
I hope that when we come to the vote tomorrow we will all proceed with the same realism as the rapporteur has shown and go on to secure what we now have: a sensible way forward that takes account of reality and fosters no illusions!
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, those who already wanted more government pressure in the areas of the army, police, security services, all kinds of other control system and the prison system in the past have been able to reinforce their position since the turn of the century.
They can now refer to the advent of a new kind of terrorism, which, as it came as a shock to everyone, creates scope for ill-thought-out solutions.
At all administrative levels, proposals have been moved to subject democracy, the freedom of association, the freedom of demonstration, the right to strike, the freedom to travel and privacy to the proposed guarantees for security.
The trouble with this line of attack is that it does nothing to remove the seedbed from which terrorism springs, including the utter inequality in wealth or power that divides the world.
Instead, we collect more intelligence, monitor more objects, organise more bureaucracy and bring about more displeasure.
In the European Union, in the area of critical infrastructure, there are already 32 directives, regulations, treaties and decisions that make a European approach possible.
This is why adding a new directive with yet more powers and obligations has raised a few eyebrows.
In January, the committee for the subsidiarity test of the Dutch Parliament drew my attention to this very subject.
This committee is calling into question Article 308 of the EC Treaty, which focuses on the interim enhancement of powers, as a legal basis, and considers the protection of critical infrastructure to be first of all a national affair.
As shadow rapporteur on this subject in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I was delighted to find that this committee decided to invite the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to emphatically reject the proposal.
The main reason for this request was that everything that is in the draft Directive can be regulated more effectively on a smaller scale, in other words by the Member States or their regions.
In this case, more interference from the European Union means, above all, more unproductive bureaucracy.
Unfortunately, the groups that voted 'no' unanimously in the Committee on Transport were divided in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
My group was no different.
Most smaller national delegations consider this to be a poor proposal, partly because unnecessary interference obscures the division of tasks between the Member States and the Union, and partly because it may be used inappropriately in order to cut down on civil rights, such as the freedom of demonstration, by referring to the protection of infrastructure, in which case it does not affect international terrorism, but rather domestic democracy.
By contrast, the members of our larger delegations from Germany and Italy also see positive points in the proposal.
They expect a reduction in the powers that are already being exercised by the Commission anyway and better parliamentary control of the application of the remaining powers.
Those in favour and against in my group applaud the fact that the amendments predominantly weaken the effect of the draft and confine the application to matters that affect at least three Member States.
(DE) Mr President, unlike the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy or the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the committee responsible, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, failed to recognise the importance of the European level for the protection of critical infrastructures.
The focus is no longer on the protection of individual infrastructures but on the consideration of sectors.
I think the procedure proposed in the report lacks resolve.
The added value that comes from including the European level has been almost completely abandoned.
It is clear that responsibility for critical infrastructures must rest with the Member States.
However, if we leave designation entirely to the nation states we will not identify the weaknesses and structural dependencies, and that is precisely what is needed for the designation of critical European infrastructures.
The idea that a list would be as good as a textbook for terrorist attacks is downright naÃ¯ve.
The Member States have had such lists for a long time.
One of the most important structural errors was, for example, not having checked those lists with NATO.
In the military sphere, NATO has had such lists of critical infrastructures for 40 years and relevant scenarios have long been provided for in anticipation of military crises.
(SV) I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a constructive report and an efficient piece of work.
It feels as if we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are systematically wading through all those areas of society that have bearing on the terrorist threats to our citizens.
The President too addressed this issue today.
It is very important that we not look at each individual measure in isolation but review all areas together so that we obtain common security regulations covering everything from visa regulations and security checks in aviation to better ways of protecting ourselves against the threats to airports, public transport and harbours and to the whole of the infrastructure which, because of the huge number of passengers involved, could be hit by a huge disaster if a terrorist attack were to occur.
The issue from the rapporteur's proposal that I wish to address is that of whether three or more Member States should have to be affected by disruption or destruction, or whether it is enough that two be so affected.
The rapporteur's proposal involves an increase to three Member States from the two referred to in the original proposal's directive.
I consider this increase to be unreasonable because a threat, disaster or instance of devastation may affect a lot of people, despite few countries being involved.
Moreover, the incident may make more impact on the place affected than it would have done on more centrally located places in the EU.
This proposal makes it still more difficult to take account of smaller EU Member States, in spite of the fact that they are in danger of being hit by equally serious crises on just as large a scale.
I also believe that as we plug the holes and make it more difficult to attack aviation, the terrorists will concentrate on other targets and on central locations within the infrastructure, to which a huge amount of damage can be caused.
We should not be naÃ¯ve.
Instead, we must be as well prepared as we possibly can be.
That is our responsibility.
(ET) The cyber attacks against Estonia that took place in April and May of this year were the first such events that gained global attention.
Yet these were not the first attacks against the essential infrastructure of Europe.
Until now, cyber attacks had been directed against individual companies, primarily in the financial sector, where the Internet has become an indispensable environment for transactions.
For understandable reasons banks prefer not to make a lot of noise about attacks.
Lack of confidence in the reliability of banking systems would have serious consequences for the entire European economy.
Fields of activity in which the Internet has become an essential part of infrastructure include public administration and the media.
The inability to repulse a cyber attack could in the worst case scenario throw the European Union back in time to the last century.
Imagine today, in the 21st century, a situation in which communication between ministries is interrupted, and both the government and the media are unable to inform the public.
This is precisely what happened in Estonia, as Mrs StarkeviÄiÅ«tso correctly stated.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and emphasise her excellent timing.
Cybersecurity is the best example of the need for cooperation in the defence of the essential infrastructure of the European Union.
During this hitherto unique cyber attack against an independent state, Estonian IT specialists were supported by experts from both the European Union and beyond.
May this cooperation be an example and a lesson in internal security to the responsible parties in all the Member States.
Neither wealth nor military force can help repulse a cyber attack.
The only defence is cooperation.
Once again, many thanks to the rapporteur.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I am grateful to all the speakers, including the rapporteur, I am afraid I have a few concerns about accepting the rather restrictive approach that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has tried to put across.
As certain Members have rightly pointed out - Mrs SegelstrÃ¶m was the last, and there were others - restricting the minimum threshold for defining a European infrastructure to just three or more Member States would, in my view, have two drawbacks, the first of which would be to prevent the smaller European Member States from taking part in the critical infrastructure protection programme.
We, of course, want to avoid any such eventuality.
We want to offer all Member States that are potential targets for terrorist attacks a way of taking part in this European strategy.
I must also raise objections to the restrictive attitude that is hostile to the idea that Europe should concern itself with a common infrastructure protection framework.
This is not a matter of subsidiarity, which we are extremely careful to respect.
The problem is that infrastructures nowadays are closely interconnected, and the last speech by the Member from Estonia, who recalled the cyberattack on her country, provides the most obvious proof of that: it was an attack that affected an entire countrywide system.
Even though only a single countrywide system was involved, can we have any doubt that that attack indirectly affected Estonia's entire network of relations with the other countries of Europe?
If the banking system of just one country is paralysed for a certain number of days, then one of the basic structures of the European Union is inevitably affected.
I therefore believe that the Commission's original proposal, for which I confirm my support, is better in that it provides a wider range of opportunities.
With regard to cyberattacks, I do not rule out the possibility that terrorists may plan an attack on a countrywide system, such as a banking system, a ministry or an administration system: we are examining what happened in Estonia and our information security agency will be producing a report after the summer.
I obviously intend to publish its report but, leaving aside the analysis of this particular incident, we cannot rule out the possibility that terrorist organisations may be thinking of knocking out an entire countrywide system by means of a cyberattack.
That is why I believe a rather less restrictive interpretation is absolutely essential.
To conclude, I once again thank the rapporteur and all the Members of this Parliament.
I believe that adopting a rigorous report on the initiatives undertaken by the Commission would show very clearly that we are concerned about prevention.
As someone rightly pointed out, the European Commission and the European Union's institutions have been acting to strengthen our policies on prevention ever since 2004.
It is only by doing so that we can provide a truly effective and coordinated response to the threat of terrorism.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007.
Law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('Rome II') (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('ROME II') (PE-CONS 3619/2007 - -.
rapporteur. - Mr President, this is, for us, the final chapter of a very long-running play that started with a Commission proposal in July 2003, but had a longer period of preparation stretching back beyond that.
It has very much been a first for the European Parliament, with there being no previous international convention to work on; it was the first time we had codecision in this area and it was the first time that we experienced conciliation in this area.
I, for my part, would like to thank all those in Parliament's conciliation delegation who participated.
We left a clear mark, on behalf of Parliament, on the final text - a text which, thanks to Parliament, goes beyond the mere technical and legal, bringing private international law into the open to serve the practical needs of our citizens, particularly in the area of road traffic accidents.
However, we also dealt with technical issues: clarifying definitions on the environment or supplying a solution on the issue of unfair competition, and then grappling with the relationship between European conflict of law rules and internal market instruments.
I am not entirely sure that we got it right.
I find I have been congratulated from many quarters, which makes me a little nervous.
Then we are still trying to have the same debates around Rome I and the review of the consumer acquis.
We have, at some point, to get this relationship correct.
It was heartening to us, as Parliament, to have representatives from no less than three DGs of the Commission present at the conciliation and working together.
I hope that in future we will be able to reinforce that and see civil justice as a thread that runs through many of the issues that we deal with in the internal market.
There are many leftovers from Rome II that form the basis of studies that I hope the Commissioner will mention in his declaration - studies on road traffic accidents, on defamation, and on the treatment of foreign law.
All these issues are absolutely integral to the relationship between civil justice and the internal market.
Indeed, we could say that the internal market will function only if we have a coherent system of civil justice.
Civil justice cannot just be an add-on to the internal market - some sort of limited competence where we tread only reluctantly at the invitation of Member States.
I seem to remember a long time ago in 1999 in Tampere that there was a vision of an area of civil justice.
Rome II was part of that.
We need to refocus, to question whether we have a civil justice system in Europe that functions for all the users of the internal market and for our citizens, and is accessible and understandable.
Rome II plays its part as forming the basis - the initial roadmap - but the following studies give us the chance to re-evaluate and make the next steps forward.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, in particular, on having helped make a success of the conciliation meeting.
She has enabled us to arrive at a balanced text after four years of discussions.
I believe that Mrs Wallis should be congratulated on the effectiveness with which she has largely helped to make a success of this matter.
In my view, this text is key to the completion of the European area of justice and to the proper functioning of the internal market.
It would seem that its implementation in practice is now keenly awaited by the legal and judicial fields as well as by economic operators at EU level.
On the one hand, 'Rome II' will help to increase legal certainty in the area of civil obligations, which is crucial to the proper functioning of the internal market.
On the other hand, this regulation will also facilitate the mutual recognition of decisions - a pillar of the European area of justice - and that, in turn, will make it possible to promote mutual confidence among the Member States' judicial systems.
A key issue for Parliament concerns the improved compensation for victims of road accidents.
In this regard, I can confirm my commitment and that of the Commission to launch an exhaustive study as soon as possible at EU level and to take the necessary measures, which will enable us to reach the stage of adopting a Green Paper.
I can also confirm the Commission's commitment to submit another study to the colegislator before the end of 2008 on the situation in terms of the law applicable to invasion of privacy, which takes account of the rules on freedom of the press and on freedom of media expression.
As I promised during the conciliation phase, should it prove necessary, appropriate measures will be taken, on the basis of consultations.
Finally, with regard to the complex issue of the application of foreign law by the courts, the Commission - which is aware of the existence of different practices in the Member States - is going to publish, at the very latest four years after the entry into force of 'Rome II', a comparative analysis and will be ready to take any appropriate measures that follow on from it.
To conclude, I should like Parliament to confirm this agreement reached in conciliation as the climax to the long-awaited adoption of the 'Rome II' regulation and I hope that the text will be endorsed by a large majority of Members.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in the debate on second reading we said that we want to keep as much room for manoeuvre open for Parliament as possible.
I have no doubt that tomorrow we shall at last find a broad majority, Commissioner.
I was present at the conciliation procedure right to the end and must therefore say that in my opinion we - not only Parliament, but everyone involved - made hardly any use of the room for manoeuvre.
We could have wished for something more on one or two points.
Mrs Wallis has already mentioned that.
I am convinced that a broad majority of the public would be prepared to go a lot further than the statesmen in the classic areas in particular, in road traffic accidents or such areas as punitive damages.
When I look at the results of the summit, I can already see something of a gap here.
We are trying to fight people's disaffection with Europe with things they do not at all want, but the statesmen are often unwilling to bring in the things the public really wants.
It is also apparent that our meetings will show greater transparency in future, and I have great hopes of that.
It is also apparent that officials often have their own hobbyhorses and are much more reserved and restrained than necessary.
Unfortunately, politics is not up to speed here.
It would be good to have bold political decisions more often, even in the conciliation committees.
A Member State that proved obstructive at the last minute might then in fact often not be so politically obstructive.
As Parliament, we have now set out down this road with one of the first cases where codecision has been used in this area, and we ought in future to be even more self-confident in using the room for manoeuvre and demonstrate that we are also capable of allowing such negotiations to fail.
In the long run, all the studies and assessments with which we have been prevaricating for three or four years are not enough when the citizens want a decision here and now!
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Wallis on the work that she has done.
I believe that we are going to achieve a good agreement, that a majority in Parliament is going to support this proposal and that we will have a new Regulation in the field of non-contractual obligations.
I would like to point out, however, that this Regulation is only going to be the beginning.
There is a fundamental difficulty throughout the field of international private law and in the field of conflict of laws, which is simply the judges' inability to apply a law that is not their own.
In the European Union - and in general - we have trained judges to apply their own law.
When an issue arises in which they have to apply a foreign law, there are immense difficulties.
It is clear that, if two English people have a road accident in France, they are going to apply France's traffic laws - they would not be able to see someone driving on the left as being in the right.
In the second part, with regard to the civil liability to be determined, if the judge is English I find it very hard to believe that he would accept the application of the restricted liability rules that exist in French law and not apply the English law.
I therefore believe that this work is only just beginning, as I said before.
Commissioner Frattini mentioned a subsequent study by the Commission - which is also mentioned in the draft Regulation - which is on the applicability of the law by the jurisdictions.
I believe that this is the second part, a crucial second part.
Those of us who have worked in this field have seen that the courts have a general tendency to apply their own law, the 'lex fori'.
This agreement or this Regulation cannot therefore be interpreted without taking account of which jurisdiction is applicable at a particular moment.
The jurisdiction is largely going to determine the law applicable because judges normally resort to any kind of subterfuge.
Here, for example, we have eliminated the subterfuge of referral, but there is still the whole issue of public order - the public order clauses - which take up the crucial provisions of national law contained in the draft agreement.
I therefore have the impression that, working on the basis that this Parliament is going to approve the proposal presented to us by Mrs Wallis by a large majority, once it has been approved we are going to have to carry on working in this field.
We eagerly await the Commission's studies on this subject and in particular an important element, which is the work with the people who are going to have to apply this Regulation: the judges themselves.
We wonder what the attitude of the judges is and how this Regulation will be applied in practice, since experience with international agreements and with the application of the rules of the States' international private law demonstrates this tendency on the part of judges to apply their own national law.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and also those who have contributed to the draft before us.
Clearly, even partial harmonisation of provisions concerning conflict in the area of non-contractual obligations will have a positive impact on the operation of the Community's internal market.
Harmonisation and regulation of the principles of procedure in situations arising in a cross-border context will make it possible to refer to a single legal basis common to all Member States.
Cases in point include road accidents, unfair competition, environmental damage, the treatment of foreign law and infringement of personal rights.
This would undoubtedly increase certainty regarding the choice of the appropriate law and the expected outcome of conflicts.
It will also facilitate recognition of court rulings.
It should be emphasised, however, that the regulation is an instrument of international private law.
It does not therefore harmonise the substantive law of Member States.
The latter retain full autonomy.
What the regulation does do is harmonise conflict with internal law.
The regulation will ensure that the same national law is applied in similar cases, but will not impact on decisions concerning the cases themselves.
Mr Medina Ortega rightly pointed out that the decisions and practices of the courts will be the most important element in this area.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) This regulation is truly a great step forward in the process of Community harmonisation.
In a Europe that is in the process of unification, it is indispensable for the judicial fora always to use the same national law in similar cases, regardless of which national court is hearing the case.
This measure does significantly increase the legal security of private individuals and business actors involved in cross-border disputes, and avoids 'forum shopping' - that is, the possibility for the plaintiffs to file their lawsuits in whichever Member State they like - while at the same time upholding the autonomy of national law.
I consider it important that we were able to make insurance cover cases of cross-border traffic accidents, and to ensure that the court would take into account the actual circumstances of victims with regard to the payment of damages.
Simply to choose the law of the country where the accident took place could have led to unsatisfactory situations on account of the vastly divergent amounts of damages awarded by the various national courts.
The specific rule concerning unfair competition is very important for judges and lawyers.
The same rule also limits to a large extent the practice of 'forum shopping'.
It is regrettable, but in the interests of a comprehensive compromise it is acceptable to leave out regulations concerning the infringement of personal rights - and in particular concerning the rules of libel in the press.
It is our hope that as part of the examination of the regulation, we will succeed in resolving this question as well.
It is important to define the notion of 'environmental damage', which is in harmony with other European Union legislation, and in particular with the Environmental Liability Directive.
All in all, I find the final text a satisfactory and balanced compromise.

Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century (debate)
The next item is the report by Jacek Protasiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
, rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, with this debate we are winding up several months of discussions in the European Parliament on the issue of modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
It has been quite an emotional and sometimes heated debate, but this is not really surprising, seeing as it is an issue affecting almost every European, regardless of their age, walk of life or place of living.
However, intensive discussion has not been confined to this House.
The publication of the Green Paper has given rise to wide public debate throughout the European Union, and has involved numerous trade unions, employers' organisations, local businesses and workers' organisations and various non-governmental initiatives both in the old and in the new Member States.
During these months, I have gained the impression that the majority of the participants in the debate agree that changes in labour law are necessary because of the challenges brought by this century.
What challenges were they referring to?
There were four main challenges.
Firstly, the positive and negative consequences on European economies of advancing globalisation.
Secondly, the rapid development of the service sector, which is rapidly giving rise to new jobs both in the new and old Member States, although these differ in nature to the jobs once created by industry.
The third challenge is the sea change in technology, and particularly new communications technology, which is having a major effect on our present way of working.
Another great challenge is demographic change, which even now has radically changed the situation in the European jobs market, and will change it even more radically in the near future.
Whilst there has been broad agreement that change is necessary, what direction these changes should take is not quite so clear-cut.
Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation, arguing that this will increase employment and reduce unemployment.
Others, by contrast, support a greater protective function for labour law.
Some MEPs support greater harmonisation of national legal systems, saying that this is a requirement of the process of creating a single European market.
Others steadfastly support the principles of subsidiarity, citing differences in the traditions and models prevailing in various Member States, and underlining that such diversity is a good thing because it allows best practice to be found through a practical exchange of experience, and is preferable to new, usually inflexible community regulation.
The initial draft of the report that I prepared as a draft position of the European Parliament, favoured greater flexibility and opposed harmonisation.
It also proposed clauses giving a positive assessment of the influence of 'atypical' forms of employment on job creation in the European Union and challenged Member States to apply active employment policy methods and support adaptability designed to protect people rather than specific existing jobs.
In the introductory draft report, I also pointed out the need to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape.
I pointed out in addition that excessively restrictive labour law may discourage enterprises from taking on new employees, even at times of economic growth.
Furthermore, I drew attention to the key significance of education to improve the chances of workers and the unemployed of finding new jobs.
In this context, I proposed that we appeal to the European Commission, Member States and employers to invest in lifelong learning and improve the quality of education for young people, in particular as regards the needs of local and regional jobs markets.
Finally, I drew attention to the great importance of mobility in improving the situation on the European labour market.
That is why I proposed challenging Member States to remove the barriers imposed on the citizens of other Member States and opening up their domestic labour markets.
The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs.
The heated debate and the 490 amendments proposed to the original text were subjected to further discussion and negotiations with all political groups.
At this point, I would in particular like to thank my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and in particular Ole Christensen and his advisors, for their contribution.
The result of the negotiations was put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg.
I must admit that the result of the vote was not completely what I myself had wished for.
I also have the impression that we lost a considerable contribution put forward by myself in the initial draft which, in my view, was not properly addressed in subsequent debates, which was that any reform of the labour market, including the reform of labour law, should serve to create new jobs in Europe in order to effectively face up to the challenge of the 17 million people who are currently out of work.
These high unemployment levels are a direct threat to the values on which the European social model is based, and we must do everything we can to radically reduce them.
There are over 60 amendments to the report in its present form.
Almost half of them support the approach of creating new jobs.
I hope that the results of the voting will be satisfactory enough to enable me to recommend that this House adopt this report, and that it will be an important vote in the debate which the European Commission started by publishing the Green Paper in November last year.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Paper has created a good opportunity for discussion on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
It elicited a huge response from a broad range of interested parties.
These responses contain useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by cross-border mobility and the expansion of international trade throughout the EU.
The quality of responses to the Green Paper was astonishing, and I believe that this is the outcome of consultations and discussions led by the governments and some parliaments of Member States, along with the social partners and other interested parties at both EU and national levels.
Some of the problems that emerged during the course of this public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the political groups and the MEPs for their contributions to the wording of this own-initiative report.
The report attempts to establish how to make practical use of the debate on the Green Paper, in the form of practical measures that would enjoy broad support.
The Green Paper also fully recognises the Member States' competence in labour law and their own labour relations and traditions, and progress on collective bargaining.
The debate has brought to the fore how useful labour law can be in resolving issues relating to cuts to the workforce in a fast-changing world with large mobility of capital and technologies.
Labour law and collective bargaining are intrinsically linked.
Labour law provides a basis on which the social partners at all levels can negotiate compromise agreements on employment relations, lifelong learning, flexible working time arrangements and the organisation of the labour market, which would facilitate movement between jobs and from one type of contract to another.
It will come as no surprise to anyone that, in responses to the Green Paper among social partner organisations, there has been a wide variety of opinion on how to move forward.
Sharp divisions emerged during Parliament's negotiations on this report and in parallel negotiations at EU and national levels in relation to the following points:
the status of full-time, standard contracts of indefinite duration in comparison with new flexible forms of work and the emphasis on measures to resolve labour market segmentation;
the approach when amending non-standard contracts, some of which lack appropriate guarantees of employment security; this mainly involves cases of multilateral employment relations; flexibility is often called for without suitable employment protection and without any actual chance of achieving genuine security in the framework of more stable labour relations;
the Green Paper's emphasis on individual employment relations has raised the issue of whether sufficient attention has been given to the collective dimension of labour law and the benefits of social dialogue;
it has been said that the Commission should have restricted this debate to the social partners at EU level and should not have opened up public debate in which EU bodies, EU Member State governments and EU- and national-level social partners were involved;
there were also arguments over the contribution the EU could make to supporting labour law reform and to developing minimal social standards applicable to all forms of labour contract.
I feel that the report in principle advocates:
an examination of flexibility and security as two mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality;
adopting an approach that, when it comes to developing employment security, takes account of the life cycle;
providing basic protection for all workers regardless of the type of contract that they have signed;
help for workers to change jobs quickly and sustainably;
ensuring that efforts to modernise labour law are in keeping with the approaches of better lawmaking and of cutting the excessive administrative burden, in particular as regards compliance with legal provisions on small businesses;
proper implementation of EU legal provisions on work and on improving information for employees and workers concerning the minimum EU provisions in force, with particular regard to the fight against illegal work.
We believe that the principles of non-discrimination, gender equality, flexible working time for the purposes of reconciling work and family life and the opportunities to gain an education and vocational training are the very cornerstones of employment security, essential for a smooth transition from one job to another, and from one type of employment contract to another.
The report acknowledges how complicated it is to distinguish between categories of worker and self-employed persons.
There is a prevailing fear that increased cross-border mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis.
I welcome Parliament's positive attitude to finding ways of resolving the problem, whilst respecting the Member States' right to establish whether employment relations are involved in a case.
I feel that the report also emphasises the benefits of dialogue between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU in this regard.
We must make the most of the ILO's expertise and experience, and use its efforts to establish basic labour standards enabling flexibility and security to coexist.
The Commission faces the task of assessing the main themes of this policy, and the alternatives to it that have emerged through a number of the answers we have received, including those that were recently incorporated into Parliament's own-initiative report.
Honourable Members, I await with interest the debate on this extremely sensitive and complex issue, and expect that it will bring further initiatives and will lead to the successful adoption of the report before us.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is giving a good account of itself.
The work carried out so far in committee - the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - has been of a good standard.
It has escaped the bottleneck of ideological clashes and opposition and has focused attention on the actual subject of the Green Paper on employment policies and on the actual possibility of planning innovation.
Globalisation and demographics are only two of the main challenges.
Sustainable development also requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time.
Very careful thought shows that there is no non-working time, but rather time for personal life in addition to family life; that we have been wrong to identify the new frontier in social conflict as a conflict between insiders and outsiders; that the relationship between flexibility and security is a two-way relationship and includes the needs of employers and the needs of workers; that extending rights is an action that must not be so many words on a piece of paper but that requires change and transparency, action against undeclared employment, a coordination of policies and renewed vigour in harmonisation towards the goal of European employment law.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) Mr President, I am pleased with this debate, but not with the method.
Commissioner, labour law is first and foremost a competence of the Member States and particularly of the social partners.
It guarantees the right to a decent wage, good working conditions and protection in the case of dismissal, and makes for a stable social climate which we need for economic growth and productivity.
In this, the normal contract of employment, as opposed to assorted, precarious statutes, is the point of reference.
I am therefore pleased that the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlines these two crucial elements and that the suggestion from my opinion by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for a European initiative for chain responsibility has been adopted.
The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees.
In recent weeks, I have met with a great deal of indignation in my country about the level of redundancy payments made by Opel Antwerp, but I have noticed that there is little indignation among those selfsame people about the immoral restructuring plans which companies are carrying out.
Both Parliament's report and the European Trade Union are very critical of the Green Paper, and this is why I hope, Commissioner, that you can address this criticism.
If one party in social consultation levels criticism of this kind, then we owe it to them to give them a decent answer.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (NL) Mr Protasiewicz, Commission, I am not opposed to the reform of labour law if it leads to more certainty for adequate health care, unemployment benefits, pensions for everyone: including those on the lowest incomes.
The Commission is turning this argument on its head, though.
Instead of arguing in favour of reinforcing employee rights, the Commission intends to turn Europe into a paradise for employers, in which the right not to be able to be dismissed without any justification will be consigned to the nostalgic past, where you no longer have the right to refuse unpaid overtime and collective labour agreements are deemed old-fashioned.
The Commission calls this flexicurity.
Sounds nice, but the translation of what the Commission is hoping to achieve with it is simple. More flexibility for the employer and more uncertainty for the employee.
This will have a particularly disastrous impact on women, young people and minorities, who already suffer a disadvantage within the labour market and are disproportionately represented in part-time jobs and temporary contracts.
They will be the first victims if this proposal is adopted intact, and the rest will follow.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to commend rapporteur Protasiewicz for his efforts.
However, I must say that the report, such as it has been presented to us, is unbalanced.
It is unbalanced because it covers, above all, aspects relating to social protection - which are undoubtedly important - but ignores the other fundamental perspective for a reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century, which must take into consideration greater flexibility in the functioning of the labour markets.
In addition, the text rests on a very conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict.
Well, what we need today is the opposite: a culture based on trust and cooperation between the sides.
This paradigmatic amendment, which is absolutely essential if the values of social justice and human dignity are to be reconciled with increased competitiveness, does not appear to have been assumed in this report.
A clear expression of the balance to which I refer, and which is absent from the text of the report, would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers, with a view to encouraging confidence levels.
In short, the text of this report is, in some way, a disappointment because it gives no indication that modern-day Europe has the spirit, talent and capability to become more competitive whilst simultaneously demonstrating the capacity to preserve the values that are representative of its social model.
The truth is that the text under discussion shows no signs of spirit, and no evidence of either talent or reform capability.
For this reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has put forward a series of amendments which will, if approved, ensure that this report does not become a lost opportunity.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Protasiewicz, for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report.
If the EU is to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and create sustainable growth with more and better jobs, we shall have improved the quality both of jobs and of work per se.
Labour law has a crucial role to play in this area.
If we compete on the basis of poor working conditions and low wages, we shall lose out against a background of increased globalisation and competition.
Security of employment is a factor in production.
A high degree of security promotes flexibility, employment and competitiveness.
This is a consideration that should be reflected in future labour law, and I reject any attempt to undermine the social and economic security for which employees have had to fight hard over a great many years.
In recent years, we have witnessed a clear increase in the use of atypical employment contracts, but this is unfortunately also a sign of companies wanting to circumvent labour law and their social obligations.
There are, unfortunately, still too many employees who have no choice in being offered such contracts and who do not enjoy protection and security.
They are often forced into jobs without pensions and without sick pay or maternity leave.
There are also still many employees working without basic social rights.
The International Labour Organisation has on quite a number of occasions pointed out the connection between, on the one hand, reduced security and poorer health in the workplace and, on the other hand, short-term contracts.
That being said, however, we also think that standard full-time contracts should be the norm.
Contracts of indeterminate length are good for both employees and companies.
They provide security, predictability and increased opportunities for development.
Flexibility and security of employment are not opposites but, instead, preconditions of each other.
This is something that needs to be reflected in future labour law.
Flexibility is basically about developing constructive cooperation and about mutual trust within companies.
It means that the collective bargaining system and the social dialogue have a major role to play in developing flexicurity.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commission's narrow focus on individual labour law.
The best balance between flexibility and security is achieved in many countries through the signing of collective agreements that are constantly adapted to developments in terms of both employees' and companies' needs.
The Commission must therefore promote the social dialogue both at national and European levels.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to welcome the work that has been done, not only by the rapporteur but, I believe, by all the groups as a whole.
This has produced the text we are considering, which was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I would like to try to clarify one point.
I do not think that conservative and disappointing ideas prevail in the text adopted.
I believe that this text is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship that today often not only exist but constitute a need to allow the system of companies at European level to respond to the competitive challenges posed to them on a worldwide scale.
In order to protect these needs, however, it is necessary for these forms of contract to be genuinely finalised.
A more flexible contract - whether it be part-time, fixed-term, or with temporary employment agencies - responds to a need for flexibility in the just in time response to peaks in demand and to production supply needs, which exist in the competition on the employment market.
It must not be, on the other hand, an inappropriate instrument for introducing forms of discrimination on costs and safeguards, which would transform the flexible contract into a kind of basis or short cut for social dumping that has nothing to do with the requirements of competitiveness and that transforms the challenge of competition into a challenge of mere competition on costs.
This is why I believe that, while we are affirming the need to accept the existence of these contractual forms and not to oppose them on ideological grounds, we also need to raise the level of specific protection, and guarantees, linked to these forms of flexible working.
The rest follows: the primacy of collective regulation over individual exceptions; the fact that there are European areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives in the social field and that there is a Community dimension, governed by subsidiarity, of specific regulatory competence, to guarantee minimum standards, which give a meaning to the European dimension, not reducing it to mere squeezing onto the market; the fight against the underground labour market; and, finally, the rejection of the logic of trade.
The problem is to achieve these objectives in a balanced way, and certainly to avoid trading safeguards, such as safeguards in companies for the safeguards of the employment market.
We need to push everything that promotes high-quality forms of mobility and transition and, once again, forms that are not linked to contradictions regarding social safeguards.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report we have discussed is in my opinion a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world.
This is only the beginning, and we are facing an extremely complicated task.
We need to achieve results which are hard to reconcile, such as increasing the number of jobs while preserving their quality, guaranteeing social security for workers and keeping as many standard contracts of employment as possible, while at the same time looking after employers' interests and dealing with competition in the global market.
One issue is paramount: regardless of whether a contract of employment is full-time or not, or whether there are more atypical forms of employment or conventional contracts of employment, every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services, and definitely the right to guaranteed health services.
My political group will gladly vote in favour of this report in tomorrow's voting.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of our time today.
It also shows that it is typically in the field of services that liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations.
In the face of such developments, everybody expects the Commission to support workers' rights in a Green Paper on workers' rights, to set minimum standards at European level to prevent workers' rights from going into freefall, and to strengthen trade union representation and social dialogue.
Instead, the Commission's Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping, which has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism.
This House has made a clear amendment here: worker's rights are not exclusive, but apply to all employees, regardless of what their collective bargaining situation is.
It is the situation on the ground that is decisive.
More flexibility is only possible if there is greater security.
This is the only way in which the report can be further developed.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe concerns itself too little with employment problems, and, when it does concern itself with them, it does so totally inadequately, as if employment were not at the heart of building democracy and of the European social model.
Certainly, many of the reasons for the problems of Europe lie in this culpable and deliberate undervaluation.
Within Europe, job insecurity is very widespread and is hindering social cohesion, constituting a real tragedy - in fact, the major social tragedy being experienced by whole generations of young people, as well as older workers who have been prematurely ejected from the labour market.
All this has an effect on our cities, our families, and on all of us.
Combating job insecurity is vital when it comes to building a future and to providing certainty and hope.
This is our main task.
The Commission, instead of combating job insecurity, seems to be adopting it and almost using it to reduce individual and collective rights, to further reduce the role of the trade unions and to set against each other those who have rights - who are in fact becoming increasingly few - and those who do not, in the name of a so-called employment policy.
This is unacceptable.
What needs to be said is that Europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and that Europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work: stable employment, for an unlimited period, protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions and with a requirement for equal conditions for standard and non-standard jobs, as part of employment equality.
This idea of employment is a healthy idea, which benefits production as well, because it says that competition is not based on exploitation but on quality and innovation.
Saving on employment costs and making workers compete against each other garners easy profits in the short term but does nothing to make the economy or society grow.
This is the social model that Europe should present to the world, and it should put itself forward as an example.
The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy, because it demonstrates the rules for activity upon which society rests.
Within these rights we should build a social unit of young and old, instead of placing them in a ridiculous opposition.
The employment contract should contain these rules and rights, which cannot be delegated to others or replaced by external action, which would leave the employment contract at the mercy of the law of the jungle.
This is why we are not convinced by the concept of flexicurity, of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits: no, the benefits must be in the contract and they must act as safeguards for the worker, as a European citizen.
The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise; it has ambiguous points, but important elements, too.
Attacks on this employment, such as those contained in some of the amendments, would be negative and would lead us in a backwards direction.
I say this in particular to my socialist comrades, especially with regard to those amendments that distort the nature of normal employment.
We would consider the approval of these amendments to be a breach of the compromise agreed on in committee.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the rapporteur's first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and to reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which, in fact, cause unemployment.
We are debating the second draft, which was more acceptable: he had toned it down.
A pity, because it means we are to continue with many of the restrictive practices in the name of harmonisation, while all the time that which you fear - globalisation - is stealing up on you.
For that, the EU will have to cope with competition on the free world markets, but you are not prepared for that.
Unless you learn to compete in Europe, you will not be able to compete globally.
Footballers continually practise ball skills and teamwork; they do not prepare for a match by playing cards in a backstreet bar!
Likewise, continued practice in Europe's protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile, global playing fields.
- Madam President, it is the policy of my party, the British Conservative Party, to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and to withdraw the United Kingdom from EU employment and social legislation.
I trust that my Conservative colleagues in this House will have the full support of their political group, the PPE-DE, in implementing this policy.
Turning to the report, I was astonished to read in recital C that 'the EU is not only a free trade area'.
Anyone who knows the first thing about international trade will know that the EU is not a free trade area at all: it is a customs union.
They will also know that the customs union or Zollverein is a 19th century Bismarckian concept which should have no place in the 21st century.
All the evidence from around the world shows that free trade areas work, while customs unions work far less well.
Indeed, the EU is the only group of developed countries still operating in this outdated mode.
If this House wishes to convert the EU from a customs union with political pretensions into a modern effective free trade area, it will have my full support.
The Commission's proposals on modernising labour law and our first draft report show a belated recognition of the huge damage that intrusive and inflexible labour market rules have done to European economies.
They made the first tentative steps towards liberalisation.
However, amendments passed in the Unemployment Committee reverse the direction and turn the report into a regressive socialist wish-list of deeply harmful proposals.
Today's amendments restore the balance, and so long as they are maintained the report's timid measures are better than nothing and deserve our support.
Paragraph 2 quotes the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That Charter was signed off twice by Tony Blair, yet after the Brussels summit of 22 June he came back like Chamberlain from Munich declaring he had protected his red line and that the charter would not affect UK labour law.
Could the Commission please give me a clear 'yes' or 'no' answer?
Is Blair's opt-out legally defensible?
I look forward to the Commission's reply.
As we have reached voting time, the debate is now suspended.
It will be resumed at 3 p.m.
