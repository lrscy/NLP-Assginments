It is a point that I am looking forward to discussing with the Swiss Foreign Minister when he comes to Brussels a little later in the summer, as well, I hope, as discussing more positive matters with him.
I want to assure all honourable Members that we have taken account of the detailed concerns that have been expressed in this useful debate and of the other comments that we have received on these negotiations.
As a number of honourable Members have said, the Swiss Parliament has already approved the seven agreements. They did that in October last year.
We very much hope that the Swiss people themselves will give their blessing in the referendum scheduled for May 21.
It would be constitutionally indelicate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland.
I am sure that the assent of the European Parliament will be very helpful in this respect in encouraging people in Switzerland to vote on May 21 in what we all think would be the right way.
So I very much hope that the vote which the Parliament holds tomorrow does not surprise any of you and does not surprise the Commission either.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Financial assistance to Moldova
The next item is the report (A5-0082/2000) drawn up by Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Council decision providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to Moldova (COM(1999) 516 - C5-0261/1999 - 1999/0213(CNS)).
Mr President, Moldova bears the heavy burden of communism as do many other newly independent countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.
Examined in human and economic terms, Moldova is faring very badly.
The social situation is chaotic and democratic progress painfully slow.
A civil war and the repercussions of the economic crisis in Russia have been paralysing the country for a long time now.
Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally.
A modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions.
A look at the figures will show the level of desperation that exists.
Since 1992, the Moldovan economy has shrunk by almost 70%. Life expectancy has fallen dramatically, and, according to a study undertaken last year by the UN, 50% of the people live below the absolute poverty line.
The Commission deserves praise for having proposed a considerable increase in financial aid to Moldova at the suggestion of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Bilateral financial aid via the TACIS programme has been reasonably successful.
A big step forward is particularly visible in the areas of local administrative training, the weeding out of corruption, and the promotion of exports and agriculture.
This, however, is not enough.
More financial aid must be made available if we are to solve the problem in macro-financial terms. This involves developing democracy and establishing a proper financial and economic policy.
Positive action to develop Moldova must be supported with measures that boost the democratic system.
The Commission must see to it that the additional funding is used properly, flexibly and in a way that strengthens the basic structures of society.
Since the biggest economic problem in Moldova is its dependence on Russia, the new EU aid action must aim at severing this dependence.
For example, Moldova relies totally on Russian imports of energy, and is consequently tied by a leash to Russian energy companies.
The circle can only be broken by establishing Moldova' s own energy sector and the diversification of its export trade.
The other problem with regard to Russia is connected with the withdrawal of troops from Moldovan territory.
The EU must do all it can to make it clear to the Duma that withdrawing Russian troops from Moldova would enhance the country' s stability.
Furthermore, talks on dismantling Russian missiles stockpiled in Moldova must be pushed through immediately.
My report was unanimously adopted in committee.
There were good and sensible additions made to it by the Committee on Budgets.
I hope that this spirit of consensus will be present too in tomorrow' s sitting.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. (FI) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to draw attention to the economic effects this legal decision will have.
The European Union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries.
Macro-financial aid is one of the most important, in addition to which equivalent forms of aid can be given in the form of European Investment Bank guarantees and Euratom loans.
There is, however, a ceiling to this provision of loans, which has been determined in interinstitutional agreements.
That is a maximum annual figure of EUR 200 million from the Guarantee Fund.
This causes problems for possible new loans from the European Union, because this ceiling is inflexible.
The present loan and guarantee decisions might lead to a situation where this ceiling is easily exceeded, if something unexpected happens.
I would therefore think that, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, it is important that the Commission should make a multiannual assessment of likely future fund requirements, which would serve as a general guide.
The aim should be that Parliament and the Council agree on priorities concerning the use of left-over margins, and that a procedure should be agreed in order to make any changes to these principles.
In the case of macro-financial aid, the Commission appears to have considerable faith in the ability of the international institutions - the IMF and the World Bank - to evaluate the economic situation in whatever countries are concerned.
The role of these institutions is perhaps too important, and the Commission often automatically accepts conditions imposed by others on these loans.
For this reason, I think that Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m' s remarks and amendments are very important, as they take account of the fact that such areas as employment and social security should also be examined when determining how the money from loans should be spent.
Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, on supplementary assistance for the budget of Moldova gives us a rare opportunity to cast our eyes on this small country on the periphery of the European Union, on its economic development and political orientation.
The people once again find themselves living in poverty.
The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30.
Privatisation is making only slow headway and so far the country has not managed to entirely resolve the problem of integrating its Russian minority groups.
It has still not achieved monetary or budgetary stability and Russian occupation troops are still stationed in part of the country, in Trans-Dnestr.
For days now, there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in Moldova.
The Russian energy company Gazprom suspended gas supplies because Moldova could not pay its bills in German Marks and US dollars.
So we are quite literally witnessing this country' s almost desperate fight for economic survival and political existence.
Geographically, Moldova is a narrow strip of land between Ukraine and Romania.
Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union.
Some are studying at our universities and technical colleges thanks to funding from the European Union and its Member States.
At home, most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union.
How can we, the European Parliament, make it easier for Moldova to become more open?
The macro-economic financial assistance, which the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly support, is an important step towards building up the necessary confidence in the Moldovan administration system and thereby consolidating its budget.
Moreover, the aid under the TACIS programmes must concentrate more on vocational training, education and improving the totally outmoded transport, communications and energy infrastructure.
Small crafts and services businesses can only be started up if there are prospects of improving the framework conditions for competition and investment, which is only feasible in the long term with the help of the European Union.
But Moldova must also know where it wants to go.
Does it want to remain in a state of insecurity because it relies so heavily on cheap Russian raw materials, which it cannot even pay for yet, and also remain incapable of reform in many areas, which would mean tying its long-term future to the imponderables of Russian economic and social development?
Or does it want to follow the example of Romania and resolutely tread the long and difficult road of economic reforms and closer cooperation with the European Union?
In that case, it also deserves stronger support on our part.
That support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration.
We hope Moldova will opt for renewal and for Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m' s report deserves our full support.
She has guided this 'child' in difficult circumstances, for which I thank her.
When we talk of transitional economies we might ask where these economies are really going.
It seems that the direction is not always clear.
Moldova imports all its raw materials from abroad and is very dependent on energy imports.
One tenth of its GNP goes on a bill from just one Russian company, Gazprom, which - as the previous speaker said - is switching out the lights in the state of Moldova.
There is therefore a stranglehold on energy that does not just affect Moldova but also its neighbour, Ukraine; and Belarus, too, for that matter.
Consequently, this phenomenon has a broader political significance, which may create tension in this region, and which we will then have to attempt to relieve.
Moldova' s need for finance will be huge in the years to come.
The Russian crisis on 17 August 1998 had an enormous effect on Moldova.
It has become a ragamuffin state.
The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat.
No nation can live and function like that.
The balance of trade surplus is a massive 23 - 25%.
As has been said, Russian troops are in the region of Trans-Dnestr, Lebed' s famous 14th army, not all of it, but nonetheless it has some influence.
We obviously support the loan decision and the line the report adopts, the macro-financial assistance, but this will not be enough.
We are taking stability eastwards, so that we will not have to import instability from there.
The next zone of enlargement, the following zone of candidate countries, will be the one we shall have to concentrate on.
We have to create an area of special action, of which Moldova will be a part, and we have to help them.
We therefore have to create an Eastern programme, to run alongside the current round of enlargement, which will help these countries - Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia - at a stage when we are receiving new members, so that no new curtain falls between these states.
Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Marjo Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, for preparing a sound report.
She has got to grips with the issue in a comprehensive way and raised some important issues connected with it.
Our Group supports the rapporteur' s views.
As has been said here several times, the situation in Moldova is extremely difficult.
Although a little headway has been made in the areas of administrative development, social pluralism, and human rights, the economic and social situation is still extremely grave.
The country' s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone.
Discrepancies in income have grown wildly and half the population lives below the poverty line.
Development in Moldova depends essentially on whether the country can achieve political, social and economic stability.
It will be extremely hard for Moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance.
The Union' s support for Moldova is thus in place.
The EUR 15 million loan now to be made must be coordinated with assistance from the IMF and other international agencies with the aim of boosting Moldova' s social and economic stability.
It is also important that the Commission guarantees the aid by attaching certain economic conditions to it, so that it is used properly in the right areas, for example, in improving administration, organising basic civil services and increasing economic efficiency.
Later, we have to ensure that the conditions have been fulfilled properly and that the country is progressing along the path of democracy and that people' s living conditions are improving.
The report' s proposal for the possibility of revising the financial perspective to increase the amount of funds in the guarantee reserve is also in order.
Mr President, establishing and consolidating a multi-ethnic state is no picnic in political terms.
Moldova is still living proof of this.
Ever since its conception in 1991, it has been faced with intransigent separatism from the Dnestr Republic.
And we ought to remind ourselves of the Russian military presence in that republic, which is again completely at odds with repeated international withdrawal obligations on the part of Moscow.
Faced with a double challenge in internal and external politics between being absorbed by Romania or by Russia, the political Ã©lite and the electorate of this small former Soviet Republic opted without hesitation in favour of its own independence in 1994. It did so precisely because of Moldova' s political unity.
This commendable strategy of phasing out internal and external hotbeds has made room for, among other things, the autonomous statute of the minority population of the Gagauz and the border treaty with neighbouring Ukraine which is less than one year old.
These achievements, however, cannot begin to conceal Moldova' s extremely difficult transformation process from ex-Soviet Republic to democratic constitutional state based on a social market economy.
In terms of energy supply and a market for its goods, Moldova is extremely dependent on the Russian Federation. As such, Chisinau is looking to the West for financial support for modernisation.
Hence the present, third request for macro-financial support from the European Union.
Given the level of exchange rate stability and internal currency stability achieved by Moldova, I can go along with this.
However, I have two questions.
What has been the effect of the European Union' s two previous capital injections into that country?
Could the Commission be specific about this?
Also, Amendment No 1 tabled by the competent Committee seems to clash with the objective of this specific long-term loan.
Needless to say, I too much prefer giving the average Moldovan citizen financial support rather than lining the pockets of the Gazprom bigshots!
Mr President, I should like to extend a warm thank you to Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m for the effort she has put into this report.
The European Union is prepared to invest EUR 15 million, equivalent to SEK 120 million, in a long-term loan.
The desire is for this to be given to Europe' s poorest country, which has a gross national product as low as that of the poorest countries in Africa.
Moldova is a country where the community, or society, has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas.
The average wage among State employees is MDL 230, which is to say approximately SEK 150 or about EUR 19.
The lowest pension is a mere quarter of this, or MDL 64.
Because the State' s finances have been completely undermined, neither State employees nor pensioners receive their payments on time.
Many have to wait for over a year for their money, and sometimes even longer.
Moldova is a deeply tragic example of the devastating consequences of Soviet Communism, an appalling ideology which has destroyed whole societies, countries and peoples spiritually, morally, socially and economically.
What we see fully revealed here is the harvest of the dragon' s teeth sown by communism.
According to the Swedish professor, Per RonnÃ¥s, Moldova has seen a more devastating peacetime fall in its standard of living than any other country in modern times.
At the same time, all the intelligence about people' s exposure to extensive torture by the police, involving electric shocks and suffocation with the aid of plastic bags placed over the head, is a very serious source of concern.
Moldova is today experiencing general migration.
A quarter of the country' s four million people are estimated to have travelled abroad in search of work.
Many poor and destitute girls have ended up in the hands of crime syndicates which degrade them and exploit them sexually.
We can do nothing other than support this country, Europe' s very poorest.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m for her report and all of you for the sensitivity you have shown with regard to such a serious problem as Moldova.
I note that the sensitivity of the different political groups is in line with the sensitivity of the Commission when it made the proposal for supplementary macroeconomic assistance for Moldova and, in this respect, we are especially grateful for their support.
It is true that today, we are talking about macro-financial assistance, therefore, with clearly defined objectives, which will undoubtedly improve the financial room for manoeuvre so that we can tackle the other difficulties such as those which you have raised during tonight' s debate.
Of the amendments presented in the report, the Commission has no difficulty in accepting Amendments Nos 1 to 4 referring to the final objective of the aid, the need for a coherent approach in our various instruments for Community assistance and the need for social balance in that assistance.
Therefore, the Commission will support these amendments in the Council and I hope they can be taken forward.
Nevertheless, I would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable Members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments.
Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 advocate the establishment of a new committee to control this type of aid.
In our opinion this initiative would be excessively bureaucratic and would not make sense.
Macro-financial assistance is usually granted for periods of one year, it is not always renewed, it is granted in different areas, different countries, according to the circumstances and we believe, therefore, that the current system of concentrating its control in a particular body, the Economic and Financial Committee, makes sense since this is the group of people with the greatest experience and knowledge of the control and management of this type of aid.
I would remind you that the Economic and Financial Committee is not a normal committee.
It is a committee provided for in the Treaties which, in practice, consists of personal representatives of the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs.
In our view these are the people who really have the ability to carry out this management.
The creation of specific ad hoc committees would achieve less and would not be as effective as the current model.
I would also like to make another comment on Amendment No 9, which asks us - and I suspect that it also coincides with Mr Belder' s demand - whether we can provide information on the effectiveness of aid.
We agree that the Commission should report on what we must do, but what causes us difficulty is the idea that this should be done before 15 September.
By definition, macro-financial assistance includes a series of general economic indicators, which are not always available at that time.
In some cases they will be available to us, in other cases they will not.
We think it is much more reasonable that the Commission' s obligation should refer to the whole year and that we should be allowed greater room for manoeuvre between 15 September and 31 December to present these reports. We believe they will be of better quality if we have additional time available to us.
The Commission' s concern, as I see it, that it should be provided with figures for the budgetary debate should not cause any difficulty, since every six months, a report is sent to the budgetary authority on the guarantees covered by the general budget along with an annual report on the management of the Guarantee Fund.
By means of both reports, the Commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information.
Nevertheless, in order to assess the aid we should be allowed more time.
Lastly, I would like to make a comment on Mr SeppÃ€nen' s concerns regarding the budgetary availability of resources for this type of aid.
In our view, there is no difficulty.
We believe that this type of aid can be dealt with by means of the current budgetary resources.
It is true that, in the future, we will possibly have to debate whether the current priorities and our financial room for manoeuvre are coherent or not, but we do not think that this is a debate which can be held in relation to a specific report; rather it will require a much more profound and more general debate, which we will be happy to take part in at this Parliament' s convenience.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I would like to make a correction to my statement on the EC/Switzerland agreement, because since 1 May this year, Mr JÃ¶rg Haider has been neither a member of the government nor the leader of Austria' s Freedom Party.
As such, the grounds for the sanctions imposed by the 14+1 on one Member State should be rescinded immediately.
Mr President, I would like to make the following comment in connection with the Minutes: reference was made in the Maat report on school milk yesterday to the fact that the Community' s contribution to financing shall be equal to 75% of the target price.
It says 65% in the German version of the Minutes.
Would you be so kind as to check again whether the various language versions are all in order?
Mr Goepel, the services have already informed me of this error and all the versions will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Combating counterfeiting and piracy
The next item is the report (A5-0096/2000) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission' s Green Paper 'Combating counterfeiting and piracy in the single market' .
Mr President, I would like, above all, to thank the Commission for appreciating the risk involved in the phenomenon of counterfeiting and piracy.
Their Green Paper initiative is a clear demonstration of their determination to tackle the problem, and I should also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the committees whose opinion was requested, who have made a considerable contribution to the enrichment of my work.
Piracy and counterfeiting constitute a risk to consumer health and safety.
Spare parts for cars and aircraft, toys and pharmaceutical products, all of which endanger the lives of consumers, are to be found on the counterfeit market.
Piracy also jeopardises innovation and the very future of certain firms. By way of example, I would cite the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year within the European Union due to this.
Counterfeiters take advantage of the investments made by bona fide industry in new product research and development and in advertising.
This also undermines the fiscal resources of the state authorities.
Finally, it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime.
My report advocates a coordinated overall approach in order to combat piracy and counterfeiting. This approach has two aspects: prevention and law enforcement.
If we are to prevent this scourge, we must first familiarise ourselves with it.
We therefore propose an extensive public awareness campaign, with whatever programmes the Commission can suggest, and increasing awareness among the police, judicial and customs authorities.
We plan to set up training schemes for these authorities and a cooperation plan involving the exchange of know-how and adoption of best national practice.
Prevention must also involve strengthened cooperation between the private and public sectors, and the legal protection of technical arrangements, while obviously respecting consumer rights.
Indeed, making allowances for consumer rights and the legitimate demands of professionals is one of the difficult aspects of this report.
Of course, each Member State has its own internal regulations for law enforcement.
In order to make them more effective, we must endeavour to harmonise current legislation and thereby remove the disparities between protection systems.
Obviously, penal sanctions must be made more stringent and civil measures and procedures must be simplified.
The approximation of the penal sanctions applied by different nations in the case of customs offences is certainly desirable.
It will also be appropriate to pay particular attention to matters of international judicial cooperation.
To conclude this brief overview of my report, I shall say that the effective protection and implementation of intellectual property rights must be an absolute priority in negotiations with countries seeking accession to the European Union and in all relations with third countries.
I shall add that we should try, in our plenary sitting, to preserve the consensus which emerged in committee when voting on this report, in order to ensure that the European Parliament thereby gives a strong political message as to its commitment in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.
And finally, I appeal to the Commission, which I hope will submit its proposed action programme for responding to the urgent nature of this phenomenon in the very near future.
Since the matter would indeed seem genuinely to be one of absolute urgency, especially as regards piracy in the audiovisual media, the Commission must not fail to respond in a decisive and urgent manner.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on this important report.
It is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and, most importantly, for the protection of consumers.
It is right that we should focus on the way in which counterfeiting is growing between the Member States, within the single market, as well as beyond the frontiers of the European Union.
The consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace.
It is a menace because the counterfeit product carries none of the necessary guarantees of safety and quality which come from a product which the manufacturer can stand by and endorse.
It can be dangerous to health.
It can certainly be dangerous to innovation.
It can be dangerous for the future of research.
There is very little to be said for the counterfeiter except that, at best, he or she is a parasite upon productive industry.
This is not a victimless crime.
We are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace.
For that reason, the Environment and Consumer Policy Committee takes much the same line as the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in supporting and endorsing this report.
Naturally the point we would wish to make in conclusion, however, is that in protection of the consumer, the provision of information must involve consumer organisations within the Member States themselves.
They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may, at first sight, appear to be a bargain, is really a snare and delusion.
My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker.
It is this: there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks.
These must be kept separate.
A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear.
There is a debate going on - and the Commissioner knows perfectly well about this - about parallel imports and whether these are now being used in some cases in a way which is damaging to trade, anti-competitive and against the interests of the consumer.
We do not want to see these two debates confused.
What we are attacking here in this proposal, and quite rightly, is those who, by the parasitic practice of counterfeiting, batten upon the public, confuse and deceive it and can sometimes actually damage society in the process.
Mr President, I am pleased to see Parliament, in the form of Mrs Fourtou' s report, prepared to undertake an extensive campaign against counterfeiting and piracy within the internal market.
The text gives an accurate outline of the extent of the damage and its catastrophic repercussions on the economies of our countries and also on the health and safety of our fellow citizens, since the phenomenon now involves sectors as potentially dangerous as medicines and car parts.
We can therefore welcome this appeal for increased awareness and for a uniform mobilisation of resources across the board in order to limit and eventually curb this scourge.
While the Fourtou report does not appear to play down the significance of the damage, it does, however, appear to disregard the urgency requiring that an appropriate policy is implemented straight away.
Reading this text gives the impression that Parliament is urging the Commission to consider with the utmost urgency the technical definition of the measures which should be implemented, whilst in this respect the counterfeiters are, as always, one step ahead in terms of technology.
If it is appropriate to use any more sophisticated technology that might make counterfeiting and piracy more expensive and more difficult to engage in, then the fight we undertake should not neglect to use radical means, applicable immediately. Failing to do so would mean that our policies, however well intentioned, will be forever missing the boat.
The text is still particularly vague as to the measures to actually protect patents and intellectual property rights which it would like to see Member States adopting. Without such measures, crafty economic opportunists and seasoned technological plagiarists will continue to pass well-disguised theft off as innovation.
Similarly, something is amiss when we are striving for a raft of protective measures, which would make it possible to put an immediate stop to the sale of these goods, while there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and when the only thing lacking is the time needed to furnish proof.
In addition to all the necessary schemes intended to combat the sale of these fraudulent goods, however, it is essential to cut off the supply of these goods pouring into the single market, flouting all the principles which are supposed to regulate its operation.
And in order to do so, Parliament must agree to remove the veil of doctrine which blurs the vision of the great majority of its Members when it comes to incontrovertible evidence of the need to re-establish internal border controls within the Community.
It would also have been wise to specify in some form other than the desperately vague paragraphs 31 and 34 exactly what obligations would be required of candidate countries on the subject.
Finally, and this is certainly the most serious issue, what cooperation policy do Member States intend to implement as of now in order to fight not only against the fly-by-night street trader, but more especially against organised crime, which nowadays apparently is becoming the real beneficiary of this expanding sector of activity?
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group will vote in favour of this report, even though it represents only the first minimal step in a Community-wide policy in which each Member State must take hard and fast action, and urges Parliament to vote in favour of its amendments, which would make it possible to give the text much more force than it has at it stands.
Mr President, this report is extremely late in coming, given that the Commission' s Green Paper was adopted on 15 October 1998.
It is true that, in the meantime, we have had the elections to the European Parliament, but if consultation with Parliament regarding a Green Paper takes more than a year and a half, something is not working as it should, and Parliament and the Commission should therefore review their methods for cooperation so that this issue can be resolved more speedily.
The Green Paper is, of course, a good one.
It was well received by the various parliamentary committees and Mrs Fourtou has produced a good report that was adopted almost unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee, with 23 votes for and one abstention.
The opinions of the various committees are also favourable and have been well received; the opinion of Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinion of Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the opinion of Mrs Montfort, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
The Legal Affairs Committee has incorporated most of the proposals made by the various committees asked for an opinion.
What is important is that we are moderate and restrained when it comes to adopting the report.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, for example, has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market.
Specifically, I think that Amendment No 6, tabled by Mrs Thomas-Mauro, which requests that border controls be established at internal borders, is extremely dangerous.
The purpose of this kind of initiative is not to rebuild the borders that we have already removed, and that is one of the reasons why Mr Berenguer Fuster and myself have tabled Amendment No 9, which is designed to prevent internal controls from being re-established by clamping down on piracy.
We must ensure, for example, that by clamping down on piracy, we do not contravene the agreements on the liberalisation of the internal market in matters of distribution. We must also prevent this provision, as Mr Whitehead said earlier, from leading to the regulation of all intellectual property rights, in the area of patents, for example, which is why we reject some of the amendments.
To sum up, I think that the report is a good one, but I would draw your attention to one issue: when we discuss the conditions for accession of the candidate countries, we must attach particular importance to the issue of the protection of intellectual property and protection against piracy.
In the accession negotiations, it must be made clear to candidate countries that the issue is extremely important to us and is, of course, extremely important to relations with third countries, since the development of international trade must be based on the recognition of the protection of intellectual and industrial property.
Mr President, this is a useful draft legislative provision.
We must dress the wounds suffered by European industry, amounting to millions of euros (though the movement of the euro may relativise such a figure).
We must consider the implications of these inferior quality products for consumers.
We must find the means to curb the globalisation of counterfeiting and piracy.
This text illustrates our inability to regulate the internal market since we eliminated internal border controls within the European Union.
The fact is, establishing a single market without internal borders, without these safety valves which, in the final analysis, would not disturb the ordinary citizen, offers an area which is a sheer delight, and a profitable one at that, for criminals of every kind.
Modern-day pirates, come to Europe, the only risk you run is that of a few spot checks being carried out by customs officials looking for the needle in the European haystack!
In this respect, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was indeed well advised and insightful when it adopted the opinion, since it adopted the amendments I tabled.
Admittedly, candidate countries must undertake not to counterfeit or make pirate copies of our services (only, perhaps, of our values) but we should also consider the countries with whom we sign customs agreements.
Should the aforesaid undertaking not be a condition sine qua non?
Moreover, let us not be naively optimistic. A totally free area cannot be created until the structures to monitor this freedom are ready.
I wished to point this out in my Amendment No 6, which was adopted within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Customs controls at the internal borders of Member States, in this specific context, do not represent a barrier to the single market but, quite the opposite, offer protection as regards the jobs, health and safety of European Union residents.
In adopting this very important amendment, realistic and constructive Members of Parliament will be cultivating the art of good border management.
We must ensure that the European Union is not replaced by a poor quality counterfeit which would leave our States vulnerable to cross-border crime and which would be to the detriment of its inhabitants.
Mr President, I have the impression that, by following the Commission in laying too much emphasis on the internal market, many of my fellow Members have not grasped the real scale of this phenomenon.
Our markets are adversely affected by counterfeiting and piracy, as are all world markets.
It would, therefore, be a dangerously narrow approach to confine ourselves too much to the single market, suggesting that the entire solution could be found there.
I should also like, at this Green Paper stage, to stress the fact that such illegal activities, when they affect pharmaceutical products, spare parts and toys, constitute a very real risk to human health and safety.
And I appeal to reason to ensure that the attempts to reconcile national approaches do not compromise the arrangements already in place in our national states.
I foresee the risks of allowing harmonisation to become an end in itself.
Given the real risk of losing focus, I should like to issue a warning to the Commission.
Rather than on the counterfeiting of garden gnomes which it mentions, we should be concentrating on protecting patents, trademarks and copyright, which make it possible to guarantee consumer protection as well as ensuring the continued existence of firms that undertake significant investment up front in research and development and in the manufacture of quality products.
Many jobs in the textile sector, the automobile industry and the sphere of culture also depend on these.
Let us be serious about this. Software protection within European or national administrations requires much more than a code of conduct, but rather the strict observance of regulations, and I hope that the Commission will acknowledge that this is more a matter of determination to adopt sound managerial practices than of the introduction of a harmonised arsenal of legislative and criminal law measures.
Mrs Fourtou' s report is valuable because it provides an important gloss on the Commission' s green paper 'Combating counterfeiting and piracy in the single market' .
This document clearly sets out the importance of intellectual property in the contemporary world and the damage that theft of that property can do.
While many people quite rightly consider that burglary is wrong, there is not somehow the same feeling about, for example, the illegal taking and using of intellectual property, for example, pirated CDs or using Napster to get other people' s music off the Internet.
But, of course, there is no fundamental difference between the two.
In some ways the most interesting challenge posed by these relatively new forms of crime are the means of countering them.
Clearly, in any pan-national single market, measures cannot be confined to a single Member State' s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties, criminal law and procedures.
There is undoubtedly an overriding requirement for coordination and a single strategy to deal with the counterfeiters and pirates, but the principles of mutual recognition have not, in my view, been given the prominence I would like to have seen in the conclusions to the report.
This tends to emphasise the need to harmonise more than is appropriate or necessary in the circumstances.
However, having said that, it is important for the European Union' s judicial area to have a coherent and comprehensive framework for dealing with the problems of counterfeiting and piracy which is widely carried out both within and without the Union by increasingly determined and technologically sophisticated criminals.
We are often glibly told, rightly in fact I believe, that we are moving into a knowledge-based society.
We therefore cannot allow that knowledge to be stolen from those to whom it belongs as doing that will undermine the economic base of the society.
If that happens, we allow it to happen at our peril.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Transitional civil administration/peace accords
The next item is the report (A5-0111/2000) by Mr Laschet, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on support to bodies set up by the international community after conflicts, either to take charge of the interim civilian administration of certain regions or to implement peace agreements.
Mr President, this specific proposal concerns support for those bodies which the international community must unfortunately establish now and again, either to take care of interim civilian administration in regions affected by conflict or to implement peace agreements.
As a Union, we must, of course, assume long-term responsibility for this type of task in Europe.
We are already involved in two cases, through the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina and through the EU' s participation in the UN' s transitional administration in Kosovo.
The major part of the EU' s operations in Kosovo, for example, will, of course, be concerned with actual reconstruction, but the EU must, naturally, also assume responsibility for those bodies which are required if there is to be a return to a society with a functioning civilian administration, able, in the long run, to become a democratic society cooperating closely with both the EU and the other Balkan countries.
It is equally obvious that responsibility must be shared fairly between different international players and that there must be correct and detailed regulations relating to how this is to take place.
In this regard, I nonetheless feel a certain unease.
We are receiving more and more information about an unduly small proportion of the EU' s aid to Kosovo in fact going to practical reconstruction and an extremely large proportion of those resources we have allocated for the year 2000 being spent in other ways.
Administration of the reconstruction bureau, which is also an important measure, is one such item of expenditure, but here we are also concerned with, for example, budgetary aid and energy imports.
We are not questioning the significance of these measures, but it is rather alarming if the cost of those operations which constitute the EU' s main task is actually much lower than the 360 million which has been allocated.
More information is required in this area.
In order that the work can be executed quickly, and in the absence of a legal basis, the Council has so far chosen to take a decision on the measures within the framework of the common foreign and security policy.
In accordance with the present proposal, this type of measure is now to be transferred to the first pillar.
We therefore demand a rethink, firstly of the legal basis for the aid provided by the Union and, secondly, of the way in which we are actually to use those resources which have traditionally been allocated within the sphere of foreign policy but which belong, rather, under the first pillar and Category 4.
There appear to be a number of gaps in this area.
If the Commission' s proposal and the Council' s wishes are to be complied with and a new budget item created, and if this is, moreover, to be provided with additional net financing, it will be necessary to consult Parliament and carry out a proper budget procedure.
I want to be clear on this point: it is not a question of Parliament enjoying the prestige of being able to express its opinion on these questions, but of our now having to realise that these tasks are not of an interim character but are to be more long term in nature.
Where operations are concerned, we must have a method which is fast and legally correct and which permits transparency, and we must therefore have a more regular budgetary procedure.
There must be a great readiness to engage in continued operations of this kind.
We must therefore also clarify the way in which the budget is managed, together with the legal basis for the aid. In this way, disputes about these matters will not become obstacles to constructive operations.
On the whole, I believe that transparency and public scrutiny are important elements of the measures which need to be taken in future. However, these must be combined with speed and efficiency.
In an area like Kosovo, decisions cannot be made on operations which are to be delayed for a long time, because the situation may already have had time to change.
We should establish conditions for how the resources concerned are to be used, but we should not have procedures which are so complicated that the EU is accused of inefficiency or that important reconstruction operations are delayed.
It is therefore important that support for the type of body we are now talking about should be accompanied by special agreements concerning how the money is to be used and that there should be subsequent proficient monitoring of the quality of the operations concerned.
Moreover, we must subsequently be given detailed reports on how, for example, the transitional administration is working.
There are positive features to be mentioned.
Even if the EU sometimes comes in for criticism, it is worth mentioning that the EU' s task force has received a lot of praise for the efficiency it has shown.
We only hope now that this efficiency really can also be transferred to the more permanent work in the reconstruction bureau and to the EU' s operations within the framework of UNMIK.
I want to emphasise that considerable freedom of action at local level is required, but we must, of course, be able nevertheless to check that the resources are being used correctly.
The present proposal also contains a new budget item of EUR 27 million.
This is to be accommodated within Category 4 which, in turn, of course, also gives practical expression to yesterday' s proposal from the Commission for a review of the budget in order to accommodate the more long-term support for democratisation and reconstruction in the Balkans.
The Committee on Budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures.
There is a definite desire on the part of Parliament to come up with the aid required and we are aware that the needs are very great indeed.
We must also focus on the needs of the Balkan peoples, but then it is the task of Parliament and of the other branches of the budgetary authority to find the technical solutions to the financing requirements.
I think that the sum of 27 million we are talking about here emphasises the need to review the budget.
I believe that most people judging the issue, possibly with the exception of the Council, would consider it impossible to use this aid in its entirety within the framework of the budget' s current Category 4.
It is unreasonable that support for other poor regions in the world should be affected by the problems in the Balkans.
To sum up, I think that we must now give more consideration to the quality of the operations.
Now that the Commission is presenting both the budget for implementation and this new way of dealing with the support for establishing the EU' s part in the civilian administration, it is important that we should not focus solely upon the overall figures or the formal decision-making processes.
It is at least as important to evaluate the operations and to make sure that these are implemented swiftly and efficiently.
In general, it is now being said that the implementation in Kosovo is more effective than in Bosnia, but there are still plenty of new issues which ought to be investigated.
The whole of this discussion shows how closely foreign and security policy is bound up with Parliament' s role in, for example, the budgetary procedure.
In this regard, we must develop a model for guaranteeing that aid is put together correctly and transparently in accordance with our regulations and in such a way that it can also be examined and reviewed, as Mr Staes pointed out.
These considerations must not lead to the aid programme becoming bogged down in vague decision-making processes.
Against this background, we support the Laschet report.
Mr President, Mr Laschet has produced an excellent report on a very technical subject, going into great detail and discovering certain features connected with the subject which have been discussed during this debate.
For this reason, I would like to congratulate him on his splendid work.
Parliament is considering a proposal for a Council Regulation on a basis for financing the UN operation in Kosovo, UNMIK, and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The intention is to transfer these appropriations from the common foreign and security policy in the second pillar to the first pillar, to be financed from the Commission' s budget.
Although this would appear to be a purely technical measure, there are certain problems associated with it.
The first concerns Category 4.
Category 4 is already overloaded.
For this reason, the Commission proposed yesterday that the financial perspective be revised and that there should be substantial use of agricultural appropriations for external action.
This transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in Category 4.
Another problem concerns competence.
If the proposal for a regulation were to be adopted without amendment, it would mean that there would be a syphon for transferring second pillar funds to the first pillar in Category 4, without consulting Parliament.
For this reason, the regulation must be amended so that Parliament may maintain its power of influence.
This syphon has to be blocked, so the annex to the proposal should be deleted and the amendments the Committee on Budgets is proposing should be adopted.
The proposal should therefore be restricted at this stage of the proceedings to just two situations: financing the UN operation in Kosovo and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Thirdly, if the funding of special envoys is transferred in future to the Council' s administration budget, as is supposed, it will mean that the gentlemen' s agreement between the Council and Parliament will have to be reviewed.
Under this agreement, the Council and Parliament do not interfere with the content of each other' s budget.
If, however, what are clearly operational appropriations, such as those for financing the work of special envoys, are transferred to the Council' s budget, they will no longer be serving to fund the Council' s administrative expenses, but rather providing common financing of the work of the European Union.
For this reason, these funds can no longer fall within the scope of the gentlemen' s agreement: the European Parliament must have the right to express its opinion and to influence the use of appropriations for financing the work of special envoys, even though they may have been included in the Council' s administrative budget.
The proposal for a Regulation may, as far as I can see, be adopted only if the Commission, and the Council too, accept Parliament' s amendments, since, otherwise, the proposal will go against the present interinstitutional agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express our Group' s support for the rapporteur' s report.
It is quite clear that we need to strengthen the powers of the Commission and of Parliament in matters relating to aid for Bosnia, because past experience has shown that this is fraught with problems.
There is the report from the Court of Auditors for a start, but there are also the experiences of the delegates of the last legislature, and particularly Edith MÃŒller, who kept on probing in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because it had become apparent that people' s sense of responsibility was nowhere near what is should have been when it came to the deployment of resources, spending money, investigations and the discharge procedure.
Transferring actions to the first pillar increases the likelihood of the Commission and Parliament being able to exert a great deal more influence over the allocation of funds, to carry out their responsibilities, and also check up on what becomes of the funds in the discharge procedure.
Firstly, this means that we will be able to make it clear to the European taxpayer that we are going to heighten the European institutions' sense of responsibility when it comes to spending money.
However, we will also - and I think this is at least as important - be setting the course for an important development, and I am with Mr Brok every step of the way on this point.
I believe it is absolutely vital for us to make it clear, in view of the fact that foreign policy is constantly gaining in importance within Europe, that the European institutions must be strengthened and that it is not for the Council alone to bear responsibility; rather it must be made clear, by increasing the level of responsibility of the Commission and Parliament, that we want to assume responsibility for foreign policy and that we also want to be involved in shaping policy in this sphere.
Mr President, the proposal for a regulation aims to provide a legal basis for transferring the financial contribution from the CFSP to the budget for the first pillar, which we consider a positive move, since Parliament' s lack of monitoring powers over the CFSP itself is a disgrace.
The draft resolution and the amendments therefore quite rightly stress the need to step up supervision of all operations to fund what are euphemistically called bodies in receipt of aid, in order to avoid any mention of a protectorate.
This is what is really at issue in Bosnia or in Kosovo.
The resolution indeed is silent on the key issue, which is the validity of the policy implemented in the former Yugoslavia.
What is the state of affairs, five years on, in Bosnia-Herzegovina?
How is the outcome of the war in Kosovo to be appraised?
How much did the military intervention cost?
How much did the destruction cost?
Through an 80% increase in the 2001 budget, the peoples of Europe are being asked to foot the bill for the parties that caused the destruction and that now want to embark on reconstruction, for the greater profit of a few industrialists.
But who do they think they are kidding when those self-same Heads of State that conducted the war are now causing living conditions everywhere to deteriorate and making employment less secure?
What is more, the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful.
For example, the level of the wages handed out to international organisations only serve to undermine these regions further.
For example, and this is still more tragic, there are still no effective controls on the distribution of aid.
Even the Committee on Budgetary Control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of European Union aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The deutschmark is foisted on Kosovo, and the law of the market prevails.
As far as we are concerned, the outcome of the military intervention speaks for itself.
Milosevic is still in power.
Kosovo is a ravaged country.
The ethnic divide is becoming entrenched, at the same time that an ungovernable protectorate is being set up which is seeking to deny the Kosovars independence without, for all that, being capable of applying the hypocritical framework of UN Resolution 1244.
For all these reasons, unlike my fellow Members who have spoken so far, we will be unable to vote in favour of a resolution which makes only marginal improvements to a disastrous policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended from 10.35 a.m. until the vote at 11 a.m.)
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome, on your behalf, a delegation from the Maltese Parliament, which is currently visiting our institution.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the European Parliament. We hope that, despite your very heavy schedule, you will have the opportunity to meet many of the Members of this House, and that your visit will be a productive one, helping relations between your country and the European Union to progress.
Vote
- (FR) Today, Parliament adopted the common position on the legal aspects of electronic commerce as it stands.
Everyone will acknowledge the value of clear regulations in a continually developing field where the economic and legal stakes are considerable.
I shall not dwell on aspects which have already been extensively discussed.
I should like at this point to return to one aspect I consider more fundamental.
Today we are setting regulations, quite rightly, for the litigation which may arise from impersonal, and therefore risky, electronic commercial transactions.
It is now imperative that we consider what steps we can take in advance to prevent such problems arising and, in order to achieve this, primarily combat the rationale according to which, in a world which is losing its most sacred ethical standards, e-commerce should be just another phase in the development of an unregulated society and one which therefore, as we can observe, inevitably places the very weakest at a disadvantage.
There is no question here of banning an extraordinary instrument of culture and openness. What we have to do is be as demanding with this as we are, legitimately, with any other form of trade.
And now we are getting to the heart of the matter: e-commerce and, more generally, the Internet, are the expression of a society without legitimate and, ultimately, human territorial limits.
This precious asset of freedom is caricatured by those who, deliberately or otherwise, promote the destruction of protective ethical standards. Indeed, freedom only really exists, in any society, when each person has the legal capacity to accept or reject, in full knowledge of the facts, what is being offered to him and not just to engage in litigation after the fact, which gives rise to many problems, as we have clearly seen in the course of these debates.
The law must be the expression of a general political vision, a social project.
Otherwise, all it can do is follow after developments that it can neither anticipate nor control.
International or supranational structures never have that extra spark of spirit which engenders motivating ideas and collective commitment.
The European Union is no exception.
Carraro recommendation (A5-0118/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the EU-Swiss Confederation agreements not only because I feel that it is extremely important for Switzerland, which will undoubtedly become part of the European Union in what we hope will be the near future, to have agreements established with the Member States of the Union, but also because, when I think of Switzerland, I feel a sense of relief.
Indeed, even today, all the newspapers in the European Union were proclaiming that even the fall of the European single currency, the euro, is the fault of the pensioners. Well!
So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong!
In Switzerland, on the other hand, where income tax is only 10%, pensions are much higher than in our States.
Therefore, the Pensioners' Party has a liking for Switzerland.
- (FR) The report under discussion today concerns relations between Switzerland and the European Union.
Let us remember that Switzerland participated in the negotiations that led to the signing of the agreement on the European Economic Area.
In a referendum held in 1992, however, the people of Switzerland voted against this agreement, thus making it impossible for Switzerland to participate in the agreement on the EEA and with the result that Switzerland' s application for European Union membership, submitted in May 1992, was put on hold.
It was therefore necessary to find some means of maintaining links between Switzerland and the EU.
This led to the signing of bilateral agreements.
Since 1993, Switzerland has submitted a series of requests to participate in the internal market in specific sectors.
Following these requests, negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union resulted in a package of sectoral agreements.
This 'package' is made up of seven agreements on road and air transport, the free movement of persons, public procurement, research and development, mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment, and agriculture.
In order to anticipate a situation in which any one of these agreements could be cancelled by referendum after the conclusion of the negotiations, the European Union decided to link these agreements together by including a standard clause in each of them to the effect that the agreements could only come into effect simultaneously and could only be applied in full.
This represented a minimum guarantee of coherence.
The procedure has undergone some delays in the Council due, in particular, to differences of opinion regarding the free movement of persons.
In April 2000, under pressure from the European Parliament, the Council presented the single, consolidated legislative instrument to approve the seven agreements between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Swiss Confederation, on the other.
This proposal for a decision combines the seven proposals, previously submitted by the Commission in a single legal instrument, with some amendments.
Shortly thereafter, the Council referred the matter to the European Parliament.
Only then did we have an opportunity to state our views and to decide whether or not we were going to give our assent to this package of agreements.
As it happens, our rapporteur is urging us to do so, and I shall follow his lead.
This is all the more important since a referendum on the agreement on the free movement of persons is due to be held in Switzerland on 21 May.
We must send out a positive political message by giving our assent.
I should, however, like to add a few minor points.
Switzerland must indeed clarify its position in relation to the European Union.
It must not be allowed to carry on picking and choosing the European policies it wishes to implement.
Madam President, the Pensioners' Party voted in favour of the Schierhuber report on the Convention on European Community Food Aid to the world.
We are all in agreement regarding this initiative, myself in particular, but I would like to stress the importance of avoiding the establishment of agricultural produce quotas such as milk, cereal or other food quotas resulting in these products being wasted, squashed by steam rollers in the form of citrus juicers, wine presses and so forth, whereas they could be preserved and delivered, whenever there is a need, and there is always a need, to states throughout the world which require food aid.
Laschet report (A5-0111/2000)
Madam President, this report is chiefly concerned with providing the current situation in Kosovo with the semblance of a legal basis and pseudo-democratic backing.
Parliament is invited to ratify the de facto situation created by the military attack upon Serbia and Kosovo a year ago.
After expressing at the time our opposition both to Milosevic' s ethnic cleansing and to the bombing by Western forces, we refuse to sanction in any way whatsoever the situation resulting from this bombing.
As for the financial aspects, we continue to maintain that it is the powers responsible for the bombing attacks who must fund the repairs to the damage caused by the war and its consequences, in both Kosovo and Serbia, and also in neighbouring countries, deducting the necessary sums from their military budget.
- (FR) The proposal for a regulation before us today seeks to provide an appropriate legal basis to enable the European Union to fund a number of bodies which have been set up by the international community following conflicts and which are responsible either for implementing certain peace agreements, as is the case in Bosnia-Herzegovina, or for ensuring the interim civilian administration of certain regions, as is the case, at present, in Kosovo.
The purpose of this text is also apparently to ensure the transparency of the funding, which would take the shape of subsidies, and also to make it possible to extend the type of action concerned to other bodies in future.
The text would, finally, provide the basis for the European Commission to take decisions on funding and, acting on behalf of the European Union, to then sign financial agreements with these various bodies.
Behind the sales pitch for this regulation, and as an inevitable progression from political decisions taken long ago, what we have here is no more and no less than a deliberate attempt to step up communitisation.
Let us make no mistake!
The present regulation, in response to a request from the Council, involves transferring the funding of joint actions, decided on within the framework of the CFSP and previously funded from the common foreign and security policy budget, to the first pillar, i.e. the vast range of Community policies managed by the Commission.
In this seemingly innocuous move we are also witness to a significant strengthening of the powers of the most integrative and most federalist body par excellence, i.e. the European Commission, on the grounds, although this is not admitted by the Council, that some operations should be perpetuated and that funds should be released for other actions.
Let us remember that if the European Commission decided to support them, any new bodies which might be set up by the international community would be guaranteed funding from the first pillar budget, without any need to even consider consulting the European Parliament.
Finally, strictly in terms of the actual budget, the proposal for a regulation puts a little more pressure on Category 4 of the financial perspective, for external measures, which is already under great strain on account of funding the reconstruction in the Western Balkans. If it were implemented this year, a supplementary and amending budget would be required.
For all the above reasons, the French Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group are unable to support Mr Laschet' s report.
Hatzidakis report (A5-0076/2000)
Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, which is part of the Group of the European People' s Party, and I, myself, as its representative, voted for the Hatzidakis report on the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European networks, mainly because communications within our Union are the single most important factor in the creation of Europe and the most important issue where the principle of subsidiarity is applied in practice.
There is no greater indication that Europe exists as a political, as well as a geographical, entity than the building of a network of links within Europe.
I hope that we will continue along this path and that national infrastructures will be established which give due consideration to European projects.
Sterckx report (A5-0075/2000)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Sterckx' s report, which I believe constitutes a serious threat to the future of air transport.
In the first place, this report gives no precise analysis of the liberalisation of air traffic.
There is no mention of its huge impact on the environment.
There is no mention of the major implications for airspace congestion related to the fact that the average number of passengers per flight has been considerably reduced as a result of competition.
There is no mention, or only very superficial discussion, of the great decline in the social conditions observed in these sectors of activity, nor is there any mention of the adverse effects on town and country planning, to the extent that, at the present time, it costs a lot to travel to a remote area of Europe, whereas costs have fallen for routes which are already well served.
These are the negative results of liberalisation.
Worse still, Mr Sterckx' s report proposes a new phase of liberalisation, envisaging not only a single European airspace, a proposal worth considering, but associating this inevitably with the privatisation of air traffic control.
Even the United States of America has not privatised its air traffic control agency.
It remains subject to the federal authority of the Federal Republic of the United States of America.
Even the home of liberalism did not go for this option.
One would have to be totally unaware of the deterioration in the safety of British transport systems, and the recurrence of accidents related to the privatisation of this means of transport, not to realise that, in terms of safety, there is nothing better than a public service.
Yet the choice made in this report is quite different, in fact the opposite, the complete antithesis.
I think that Europe is probably now, more so than before, in need of the confidence of its constituent nations, and that a new phase of liberalisation would run counter to the latter' s expectations.
They make this quite clear on a regular basis.
A subsequent return of liberalism will come as no surprise.
Madam President, on behalf of the Pensioners' Party, which is part of the Group of the European People' s Party, I voted for the Sterckx report on the regulation of the European airline industry.
I particularly welcome the recommendation in this report that national government delegations should be seconded to the European Union structures which deal with incentives for technical research.
I would also like to use these few, precious seconds allotted to me to point out that it would have been appropriate for these measures governing transport and, in particular, air transport in Europe, to make provision for young and elderly people who enjoy travelling, and that it would have been appropriate to provide flight discounts for them - but not necessarily during peak hours or on peak days - thereby promoting cultural exchanges among both young and elderly people from different States of the European Union.
. (PT) We are bound to agree with the report under discussion when it states that increasing competition has had harmful repercussions on social conditions and safety and has led to a great expansion in the number of routes, thereby causing congestion of air space.
We also support the report' s confirmation of the importance attached to passenger air transport as a public service for the remote and island regions and to the requirement that air transport safety be improved.
We are therefore bound to disagree with the fact that the report continues, despite this analysis and in a completely contradictory way, to seek greater liberalisation of every aspect of this sector, as well as the transfer of the sovereignty of air space.
These are some of the reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report.
Fourtou report (A5-0096/2000)
- (FR) I supported Mrs Fourtou' s draft report on the Commission' s Green Paper on combating counterfeiting and piracy because we are at the preparatory stage and I feel that our rapporteur has clearly outlined the serious risks involved in counterfeiting and piracy.
The fact is that, quite apart from the economic considerations, important enough in themselves, together with the activities of organised crime, consumers are being exposed to serious human health and safety risks.
I also share the views of the report when it stresses the need for public information and awareness campaigns and calls for a strengthening of the law enforcement aspect in view of the rising tide of counterfeiting and piracy.
On the other hand, I have rather more reservations as to the degree of harmonisation required, particularly in terms of criminal law.
In the same spirit, I should not like the involvement of national parliaments to be limited to a warning, inferring that we should be deadlocked if we did not take legislative powers on civil and criminal law away from the national level.
This way of reasoning, the seeds of which are to be found in the Green Paper, seems rather limited, but I have no doubts that, through cooperation between the competent authorities and the pooling of experience, it will be possible to obtain satisfactory results within optimum time limits without falling into this skewed way of thinking.
We must face facts. We already have tried and tested practices at national level.
What we should be doing is coordinating them better rather than ruling them out in the name of a uniformity which would only prove counter-productive.
Finally, I would like to welcome the invitation issued by our rapporteur to European and national authorities to monitor the internal use made of protected works, such as office software.
I would go even further and I believe, as my fellow Member, Mr Yves Butel, has said, that, in this area, what we need is not so much a code of conduct as for the regulations to be strictly observed.
- (FR) Computers, audio and video equipment, toys, fragrances, pharmaceutical products, clocks and watches, cars - absolutely everything is copied.
The harm suffered by the luxury goods industry is just the visible tip of the iceberg, probably also the least dangerous part.
Damage to the economy is much more significant.
A UNESCO Conference organised in Paris in June 1992 estimated the illegal gains due to counterfeiting at some BEF 3 000 billion per year.
According to the International Chamber of Commerce, the cost of counterfeiting represents between 5 and 7% of world trade.
Sales of illegal compact discs were reported to have increased by almost 20% in 1996 and comprise 14% of the world market.
In the software sector, piracy rates are estimated at 46% worldwide.
The number of jobs lost in the European Union is put at 100 000 over the past ten years.
These figures are probably still greatly underestimated, and Internet imperialism will make them higher still.
Current investigations show that piracy and counterfeiting are closely linked to other forms of organised crime, such as trafficking in drugs and armaments and money laundering.
This gives us an indication of the major stakes involved for the internal security of our Member States.
As the rapporteur quite rightly mentioned, I think that a balanced policy on the subject must combine prevention and law enforcement.
Prevention involves increasing public awareness, not just of the damage done to our firms, but also of the risks involved in purchasing poor quality products which may, in some instances, be dangerous to human health and safety.
I am thinking, for example, of pharmaceutical products and spare parts for cars.
I do not share the opinion expressed in Amendment No 8, since I think that confiscating illegally copied goods, even if it is only a simple compact disc, may well serve as an example and be of instructional value, particularly with regard to young people, who must learn that copying is damaging to the artist whose works they like.
As far as the law enforcement aspect is concerned, we must involve our Member States in a more proactive policy of fast and effective legal prosecution of offenders.
I think it would also be useful if the forces of law and order were to receive suitable training to be able to detect counterfeit goods more easily.
Increasing penalties might also have a deterrent effect.
Counterfeiting and piracy constitute a threat to the proper operation of the internal market.
They jeopardise the viability of some of our businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that undertake research.
They introduce distortions of competition.
They undermine the foundations of a sound economy.
Moreover, and most especially, they mislead the consumer, sometimes at the risk of his or her health or safety.
This consumer must be protected, so much is clear.
It is in this spirit that I support Mrs Fourtou' s report.
- (FR) Mrs Fourtou' s report has given us the opportunity for a preliminary discussion on the measures to be taken to combat counterfeiting and piracy.
This report rightly deplores the harmful consequences of these methods for the economies of our countries, as well as the risks they entail for the purchasers of inferior quality products.
Parliament has therefore adopted some of the conclusions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, particularly on what is at stake in this fight and on the importance of eliminating some of the disparities between intellectual property protection schemes in order to better address the problem.
We thought it useful to adopt, in the form of amendments, other conclusions which were not adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, particularly regarding the need for fast, effective civil law protection for intellectual property rights, and the need for realistic, appropriate and effective legislation on patents.
Regarding the definitions of scope, it would have been better to include not only the deliberate and fraudulent sides of such activities but also the commercial motives behind them.
Not to refer to the search for easy, illegal profits, which is characteristic of activities of this type, is to omit an essential feature, one which effectively makes them similar to one aspect of organised crime.
On the other hand, I am pleased to see that the House has adopted our amendment to define innovation and the improvement of innovation in an appropriate manner, since the similarity between these two areas often makes it possible to disguise counterfeits with nothing more than superficial changes and to introduce them as innovations.
There is a great deal at stake in piracy and counterfeiting, both for the people who are the victims of the illegal copying activities and of the counterfeit products, and also for the people who make money from them.
The fact that such activities are often associated with organised crime makes it imperative for us to define most precisely the legal instruments we wish to create in order to combat it.
The effectiveness of the law, especially within the Community area, will lie in this precision and in its capacity to provide a realistic response to practical problems.
That concludes the voting.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 May 2000.
- Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on Saturday, a horrific accident struck the people of Enschede, in the Netherlands.
There was an explosion in a fireworks warehouse which has already caused at least sixteen deaths and has injured over six hundred people, six of whom are in a critical condition, with many more people reported missing.
Around four hundred homes have been destroyed by the explosion, and more than a thousand have suffered damage.
This is one of the most terrible disasters in the Netherlands since the second world war.
I have contacted the Dutch authorities to express our deepest sympathy, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament.
At this sad time, our thoughts go out to the victims, to their families, and also to the emergency rescue teams who are working tirelessly.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President, on behalf of the 31 Dutch delegates of this European Parliament, I would like to convey to you my heartfelt thanks for the words you spoke a moment ago and for the respect this Parliament has shown for the victims of this terrible disaster in Enschede and for their relatives.
Madam President, on behalf of the 31 delegates, there is actually little I could add to your words.
I would, however, like to underline how we have been moved not only by what you said a moment ago and the silence that was observed, but also by the prompt assistance across the borders to relieve the distress following this disaster.
At a moment' s notice, German colleagues joined forces with their Dutch friends to carry out the frequently dangerous activities which were necessary to control the disaster.
German hospitals too have been involved in the care of the wounded, dozens of whom are still in hospital.
I find this an example of European solidarity which is what we stand for in this Parliament.
On behalf of the 31 delegates, I would also like to thank the Commission which immediately expressed sympathy in the form of a letter from Mr Prodi to the municipality of Enschede.
I would like to ask the Commission to consider what kind of a role it sees for itself in relieving distress and in preventing terrible disasters of this kind in which so many citizens are involved.
I am extremely grateful to you on behalf of the 31 for the sympathy this Parliament has shown, and I can see in our Parliament a true representation of the European solidarity which this continent so desperately needs.
- Thank you, Mr Oostlander.
- On 7 May last year, terrorism of the most undiscriminating and brutal kind once again struck in Spain with the murder of JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez de Lacalle, a journalist and co-founder of the Forum d' Ermua, a peace movement of Basque intellectuals.
The terrorists intended to strike a blow at one of the most precious assets of democracy, freedom of expression.
This forum was founded after Miguel Ãngel Blanco Garrido, a municipal councillor in Ermua, was murdered by ETA in July 1997.
This forum means to affirm that intimidation and blackmail are not enough to silence consciences.
Throughout his life JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez de Lacalle fought to defend freedom and democracy.
After spending five years in prison under the Franco regime, he fell victim to another dictatorship, that of terrorism.
That very day, I made a point of staunchly condemning this act of barbarism and of expressing, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, our deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and the newspaper he worked for.
I also notified the Spanish Government of our utmost support in the fight against terrorism.
Agenda
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 11 May 2000 has been distributed.
Relating to Thursday:
We can have five items in the Human Rights section.
At the moment, we only have four.
We therefore have the opportunity to add a further item, and I have received three requests.
A request from the GUE/NGL, the Greens and the TDI to add a new sub-item entitled "Tunisia" ; one from the PPE Group to add an item on "Spectator safety and the prevention of hooliganism at the forthcoming European football championship" ; and an item from the Union for a Europe of Nations Group to add a new sub-item entitled the "Situation of Bhutan refugees in Nepal" .
I shall therefore put these requests to the vote in the order in which I received them. Firstly, though, Mr Cohn-Bendit wishes to speak in support of the request by the GUE, the Greens and the TDI.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the association agreement between the European Union and Tunisia has been in force since 1 March 1998.
Since then we have not had a single major debate on Tunisia, and there have been no topical and urgent motions.
Every time one of the groups can be relied upon to say, "Yes, it is important, but you must see that Mr Ben Ali is still just settling in."
We have all read the reports in the papers of the status of human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia.
I find it outrageous that every time we attempt to discuss this, we are prevented by Members of Parliament and the Tunisian Government. I find it outrageous that one of the two major parties is trying once again to put off any debate or any topical and urgent motion on fundamental freedoms in Tunisia.
Our Group is therefore asking everyone to stop listening to the leaders of the two main parties, and instead to act like independently-minded adults and resolve at long last to have a debate on the situation in Tunisia.
Let us have the topical and urgent motion, and we shall see what majority there is for human rights, and what majority uses human rights purely in the interests of its own party and resorts to tactics when the situation is sensitive.
In opposition to a tactical stance on Tunisia, and in favour of frank and open debate, I urge you to vote in favour of the topical and urgent motion and to table the situation of human rights in Tunisia.
Madam President, for my part I wish to speak on a constructive rather than on a polemical basis. I think this is indeed an opportune moment to have a debate on human rights in Tunisia.
It must be held this week because today the trial of Taoufik Ben Brik' s brother is taking place in Tunis and tomorrow a delegation of Members of the European Parliament, from my Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be returning from Tunis.
This week we are also due to be visited by the President of the Tunisian League of Human Rights and perhaps by Mr Taoufik Ben Brik himself.
In view of these circumstances and the importance of the European Parliament decision to take action to encourage the release of Mr Ben Brik, I think it particularly appropriate for us to enter this item on the agenda.
Madam President, firstly I would like to say that, out of self-respect, we should not create false arguments amongst ourselves.
Human rights should not only be defended when we come here, but they should be defended constantly. I believe we are all united in this fight.
There are no substantial differences between us.
It would have been a good thing if, in the past, when the Socialist Group proposed an urgent debate on the situation in Tunisia, we could have counted on the votes of those people who are protesting today, because we have not managed to have that urgency approved.
However, I would like to remind you - I was the first speaker at the last Brussels part-session and I asked you, Madam President, on behalf of all of us, to write to President Ben Ali of Tunisia - that what we have to do now is wait for the President of Tunisia to reply to you in your capacity as leader of this Parliament.
Secondly, I would like to point out that the matter of our relations with Tunisia does not end with an urgent debate.
It is a much more important and substantial issue and my Group has agreed today to present an oral question to the Commission and the Council in order that we may hold a full debate on this issue.
I believe that if Mr Cohn-Bendit, for example, wishes for a full debate on this question, he should support our proposal so that we can include it in the next agenda.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I think the House is now sufficiently well informed to proceed to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
And now to the proposal from the Group of the European People' s Party on hooliganism.
Madam President, I wish to thank my own group for allowing this resolution to come this far.
It is not often that we discuss urgencies that might be able to change something for the better.
We are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect.
However, next month, before we sit again in Strasbourg, the European football championship starts.
A number of problems have already been raised by people such as the Belgian Police Federation, and there have been many documentaries in various countries about various games and the security arrangements for Euro 2000.
I know this is meant to be a human rights issue, and indeed it is about the rights of ordinary people.
Every real supporter of football has the right to go to a football game and spectate, and then come away without a threat of violence, without problems on the streets and without being harassed unduly by people we do not particularly like to meet at any time: football hooligans.
This is what this motion is about and I very much hope Members will support it.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Madam President, on Friday of last month, the four votes could not be held because of the absence of a quorum which had been requested.
Now, I do not think that this is the appropriate place to debate this.
Those who took the initiative have sent a letter to all Members to explain what exactly their intentions were in taking this action.
We will all have the chance next month, of course, to speak our minds regarding Fridays because we will then be discussing the 2001 Agenda.
However, that does mean that we have a problem in the short term, namely what we will be doing this coming Friday.
That problem has been addressed by this Parliament' s Bureau and, if I understand it correctly, the Bureau issued an opinion to the Conference of Presidents with a proposal not to hold any votes this coming Friday.
As I understand it, this has not been discussed by the Conference of Presidents.
Since it is, of course, up to this House to draft the agenda, I would like to propose simply moving all votes scheduled for Friday to Thursday because, whatever you may think of what happened last month, I think this would be the best way of avoiding the problem.
We can then decide next month what we want to do in the long term.
Thank you, Mrs van der Laan.
As you can see, this provides some incentive for you to attend in great numbers on Friday in order to vote.
I would address my very good friend, Mary Banotti, and ask what the situation is regarding Danish TV here in the Parliament building.
We are, of course, one of the small countries which are always oppressed, but we should like to be able to watch Danish television so that we can keep up with what is happening. We are Europe' s most important country.
We are simply the best. Just look at who won the Eurovision Song Contest.
But we cannot keep in touch with what is happening.
What are you going to do about it, Mary?
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Mrs Banotti will reply immediately.
Madam President, this is becoming a regular item.
We were not getting interpretation throughout.
So, dear Freddy, I did not understand a word you said - but I am sure it was wonderful!
Mr Blak will explain it to you.
Madam President, I should just like to say that last year in this House we democratically rejected a motion to cancel Friday sittings by a large majority.
We decided in favour of maintaining sittings on a Friday and said that on that day we would put items on the agenda which were uncontroversial, matters which had nonetheless to be dealt with and yet could also be properly settled with a rather smaller number of people.
Last Friday, a minority of people abused a provision in the Rules of Procedure in order, as it were, to undermine the Friday sitting and to prevent the votes from taking place.
In my view, this is an abuse of a rule which, in itself, is perfectly reasonable because, after all, a majority of this House made a decision on Friday sittings last year.
The matters which were not put to the vote that Friday - including the important issue of Ethiopia - were voted on in Brussels and the results were almost unanimous.
We could have voted on them almost unanimously on the Friday too, and I should like to ask colleagues to stop this sabotage, to let us get on with our work and to discuss the issue of how we organise our work separately and calmly.
But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet.
At the end of the day, the votes had to be repeated because those who had asked for there to be a check on the quorum were themselves no longer present and did not take part in the vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you are well aware, we are not going to start a debate on this sensitive issue.
I will allow two more speakers and then we shall move on to the order of business.
Madam President, I think there is a misunderstanding here.
Mrs Van der Laan spoke about the proposal made by the Bureau to the Conference of Presidents.
As I understand it, the Conference of Presidents has not discussed this matter any further.
According to Mrs Van der Laan, it is not the intention that we now pass judgement on an action regarding the use of the Rules of Procedure.
I would not want to term it misuse because then I would not know what else these Rules could be used for.
What matters is that we too discuss a proposal from the Bureau here and now.
Surely a proposal from the Bureau cannot simply be sidelined.
All we want is that it should also be discussed and that a vote should be taken on it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now give the floor to Mr Wiebenga, since he was in the chair for the Friday of the last part-session and he will be able to tell you that we have discussed this within the Bureau.
Madam President, for those Members who do not know, I would like to make it clear beforehand that I do not belong to the action group which started this Friday action, but that I was the acting President who had to contend with it.
I would like to remind you - and I am at liberty to say this here because I have also said this outside the Bureau - that I referred this point to the Bureau, to you and colleagues in the Bureau, and have, for the short term, suggested four possibilities for Fridays, before we decide on the agenda for the year 2001, because then we might just as well, of course, vote here in plenary.
The first possibility is to scrap Friday sittings altogether.
The second possibility is to have Friday sittings with a full agenda and hold votes at 12.00, at lunch times, or such like.
The third possibility is to hold debates on Fridays without voting and then delay the votes until Brussels or subsequent sittings.
The fourth possibility is to carry on as we are, that is to say, to hold minor debates on Fridays and round them off with votes.
Clearly, this last possibility will lead to situations in which other Members can request that the quorum be checked, meaning that we will once again be unable to hold votes this coming Friday.
Madam President, the competent body in these matters is not the Bureau but the Conference of Presidents.
I think that, whatever your opinion may be, whether you are for or against Fridays and whether you are for or against Strasbourg, our Parliament would benefit most if we were not to argue every Friday about the quorum and - I also told the Bureau this - if we were not to hold any votes this coming Friday.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents which is to meet on Thursday will look into the situation in any case and will see what grounds there are for holding the votes on Friday.
I must also inform you that Mr Provan is to present a report to the Bureau on the internal reforms to be applied to the operation of Parliament and, of course, the organisation of the Friday sitting, which Mr Wiebenga has just been discussing, will be one of the areas under consideration.
Having said that, if you wish to continue to discuss the matter, I see no objection to this.
We shall hear your comments, presented as procedural motions.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I was simply making a protest about the electronics here.
I was unable to receive interpretation, and I am sure that certain other Members were having difficulty with interpretation earlier.
I think I was getting Swedish at one point and I could not hear Mr Blak at all.
I just wanted to point that out.
I think Mrs Banotti referred to it but as I could not hear her, because I was getting Swedish at the time, I do not really know what she said.
Thank you, Mrs Ahern, we shall take steps to ensure that this does not happen again.
Madam President, on a point of order.
It is the same point, and for once I agree with Mrs Ahern.
This must be a first!
Madam President, I should like to start where Mrs van der Laan left off.
On the Friday of the last part-session, she announced that, from now on - for as long as there is still a sitting on a Friday - there will be a request on each occasion for a check on the quorum. This means that the group which made the request last time has itself made it plain that its only objective is destruction and not proper work.
The Bureau cannot tolerate this because the plenary has decided - Mr Posselt referred to this - that sittings should be held on a Friday, and not even the Bureau can overrule this.
We cannot allow a handful of people who, up until now, have seldom been present on a Friday, to make a mockery of us and blacken our public image.
When a roll-call vote took place at 10 o' clock, hardly any of the 30 proponents were still here.
We really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind!
Madam President, I should like to respond to what my fellow Member has just said.
I am among those who are in favour of the Friday sitting and who think it important to keep the sitting on that day, just like on the other days of the week.
I should like to add that some of us who, quite rightly, requested that that quorum be checked so that the sittings could be conducted in due order, remained in attendance throughout the votes.
It is inaccurate, therefore, to accuse Members of sabotage.
There are Members in the Chamber who attend from Monday to Friday, and remain until the end of the sitting on Friday.
Madam President, I could not agree more with the observations made by Mr Wiebenga.
The least we can do is to carefully examine once more how we have filled Fridays.
But I would add - also because a number of misconceptions have made their way into the media - that I am not one of those people who would like to solve the 'Strasbourg' discussion via the back door, but that I do belong to the group of people who want to examine, via a vote, whether we can hold a proper sitting in Strasbourg on a Friday, which also involves our French delegates.
I wanted to highlight these two aspects.
But that also means - and I must get this off my chest - that all those Members who criticised me last time because I had levelled criticism at them, must have left the Chamber before 12.00. (The last vote was held after 12.00.)
That was very hurtful because, unfortunately, the activists, comprising pro-Europeans from my own country and a large number of anti-Europeans, had left by the time the roll-call vote was held.
Reference can be made to the last roll-call vote for this.
Let us examine in a fair manner and through sound discussion how we can fill this part-session.
Madam President, I have little to add after Mrs Oomen' s intervention.
I only hope that you will understand this.
The Dutch group which made Fridays a subject for discussion in this way did not do this because they are against Strasbourg or anything like that.
They did so because time and again, there is heavy criticism, also in the Netherlands, regarding these Friday sittings and also because most of us prefer to work in our country on Fridays.
This is because we already spend a great deal of our time in Brussels and Strasbourg as it is, and because we need the time to talk to our electorate.
I think that a serious discussion about Fridays is urgently needed and this should not be confused with the discussion about Strasbourg.
It is a discussion on the question of whether we organise our work efficiently and well and whether we have any time left to spend in our own constituencies.
I support the action in this sense.
As I said, there is scope for discussing this when we come to examine Mr Provan' s report.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who were present throughout Friday.
It is easy to check up on, because electronic voting took place that day.
In fact, there is no question of sabotage. Rather, it is a question of taking Parliament seriously enough to find it actually embarrassing that there are only 70 Members here when we vote on important matters such as school milk or Ethiopia.
This has also given rise to quite a major debate in my own country, Sweden.
We must get a serious discussion under way about these matters.
Either we make Friday a proper working day or we do away with it.
I will be very brief, Madam President.
Moreover, I feel that this issue should be discussed in more detail, perhaps at a more convenient time.
I subscribe to the view that Parliament should work on Fridays. Solutions can, in all probability, be found by putting debates rather than voting sessions on the agenda, for we are all aware that Fridays are convenient for interaction with the Commission and, therefore, important in terms of our political work in the area of our function as MEPs representing our home territories.
When we discuss this issue, it would, however, be preferable for Members to refrain, when considering the action to be taken, from laying themselves open to misrepresentative publicity regarding the nature of Parliament' s function.
There are certain types of action which give our countries and our electorate the impression that, in actual fact, the European Parliament spends its time fooling around and doing no work. The effect of these actions is therefore damaging, whatever the motive behind them.
I therefore hope that we will be responsible enough to reach a point at which the debate can brought to a definitive conclusion without going down a path which none of us want to take and without laying ourselves open to criticism.
As Mr Wiebenga said, and as I said myself, we are currently investigating the best solutions.
Madam President, all I asked for is whether or not it is possible to put the request that we do not vote this coming Friday to the vote. After all, this is now the item on the agenda: determining the agenda for this plenary session.
No, Mrs van der Laan, you ought to know that according to the Rules of Procedure, this is a request that should have been presented in due form and at the due time, and this was not the case.
I cannot therefore put this request to the vote.
It only remains for me to express the hope that there will be a good attendance this Friday, votes or not.
I am counting on you all, if only for the benefit of the public that attends our debates.
Agricultural prices
The next item is the report (A5-0115/2000) by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission proposals relating to the prices for agricultural products (COM(2000) 77 - C5-0121/2000 to C5-0126/2000 - 2000/0045(CNS) to 2000/0050 (CNS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you had a wonderful weekend and that you were able to relax somewhere in Europe in our fantastically beautiful - and, above all, undamaged - agricultural landscape, which is responsibly and lovingly tended by our farmers.
It is in this spirit of optimism that we can begin this debate on our report on the prices for agricultural products in 2000/2001.
In the past, this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes.
The decisions made under Agenda 2000 established many principles, not necessarily always for the best as far as agriculture is concerned.
This Commission proposal, too, contains a series of points which will again lead to a reduction in farmers' incomes.
In my report I make my opposition to this absolutely clear.
The Commission is proposing to further reduce the additional charges on the intervention prices for cereals in two stages and then to fix them.
The Commission' s proposal to reduce the monthly increments would mean another substantial deterioration in farm incomes.
In this context, we also reject the Commission' s plan to make the intervention criteria stricter.
If the minimum moisture content threshold were lowered this would reduce the compass of the intervention safety net and increase the proportion of the cereal crop which is, in principle, excluded from intervention.
A third point - and here, judging by recent press releases, the Council appears to be coming round to the Agriculture Committee' s point of view - relates to Mrs Schreyer' s proposal to cut the agriculture budget by EUR 300 million per year in favour of the EU's foreign policy, despite the fact that additional money has still not been made available to remedy the extensive forest damage.
At this stage I should like to state clearly once again that however important the EU's commitment to the Balkans is, the agriculture budget does not constitute an inexhaustible supply of funds which we can use to finance all our other desirable policies.
The agriculture budget is neither a self-service shop nor a high-yielding dairy cow.
Mrs Schreyer says that, of course, the EUR 300 million will not come out of direct support, but that is irrelevant because in the second pillar of agricultural policy too - that is, promoting the development of rural areas and stewardship of the countryside - each and every euro is necessary and well-spent.
Our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think.
Structural change is not, in itself, a bad thing; it is much more the consequence of a huge improvement in training and therefore in knowledge, skills and technology.
But if an increasing number of farms are going out of business, farms which we have classified as viable from a political point of view, and if farmers are complaining about their workload, which is becoming unbearable, then something is wrong, and perhaps something is also wrong with our policy.
It is our job to put in place tangible and enduringly reliable or - with your permission I will borrow a word from our definition of modern land management - sustainable framework conditions and not to turn the screws - including the tiny ones - even further.
After all, we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go.
We need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term!
We need a new vision for our farmers which is forward-looking and geared towards future needs.
At this point I should like to ask the Commission whether, and to what extent, it is prepared to accept the amendments we adopted unanimously in committee.
I am obviously asking because there is the possibility of referring this back to the committee if the Commission is not prepared to take on board points which are important to Parliament.
I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments.
On the other hand, I recognise that the budget year begins on 1 July and that a referral back to the committee might mean that the Council would not be able to decide in time, which would again be disadvantageous for agriculture.
That is what I want to prevent at all costs.
I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European agricultural landscape.
I should like to finish with the sentence: 'Food and drink hold body and soul together' .
Let us not forget this, even in our political considerations and decisions!
Madam President, a large contingent within the Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that, as far as next year' s agricultural prices are concerned, we should adhere to what was agreed in Berlin.
Nothing more, nothing less.
This is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture.
In various European countries, large groups of farmers are in dire straits.
At present, there is a great deal of suffering in silence.
So far, it would seem that the agricultural budget was born under a lucky star.
The euro-dollar rate impacts favourably on the budget, although certain figures are a cause of concern.
There is nothing to say, however, that things will remain the same forever.
Despite this, the Commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget, if possible.
Sometimes, these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget.
The Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that we must keep to what was agreed in the plenary a number of months ago, namely a situation in which the agricultural budget serves as a primary source of funding for external EU action should never arise.
The budget will stick to this principle.
Secondly, according to the Committee on Budgets, the European Commission should come up with proposals to reform the sugar sector without delay.
If we start to discuss the budget for 2001 in structural terms in September or October of this year, then it is essential to know what the Commission has in mind for the sugar sector.
Am I not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the Berlin agreements?
And in order to evaluate the 2001 budget effectively, we need to know this.
I hope that Commissioner Fischler will be able to tell us this afternoon when he intends to produce reform proposals for sugar.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when our farmers read in the press that we in the European Parliament are debating agricultural prices for the 2000/2001 financial year, many will certainly cherish the hope that we might just be considering a few price increases.
But that is not the case!
In fact, we are discussing the proposals which the Commission has tabled following the Agenda 2000 reforms.
May I, at this stage, specifically thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work.
Hitherto, people have regarded it as a routine annual exercise when we have had to debate prices for agricultural products.
Year after year, blows were exchanged and, in that respect, I now welcome the fact that the fixed multiannual price proposals really can give farmers a rather more reliable framework in which to plan their production.
However, I should like to warn you that, with this system, the annual review by the Council, the Commission and Parliament might not perhaps receive the attention which it deserves.
The market situation, the outlook in the individual sectors and the trends in farm incomes as well as employment should continue to be examined by the European institutions on an annual basis.
The proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned.
Most prices were fixed under Agenda 2000, but the Commission is proposing to cut the monthly increments for cereals by 7.5%.
I should like to fully support the rapporteur' s stance in this regard.
In our group' s view, the reduction in the monthly increments for cereals cannot be supported, not least because the Commission' s proposal undermines the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000.
We should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers' incomes.
I now turn to a topical issue, Commissioner Fischler, which is of interest to me. During the last plenary part-session, we once again discussed with Mrs Schreyer whether this EUR 300 million for reconstruction aid in Kosovo for 2001/2002 really could be taken out of the agriculture budget.
I am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism.
This was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar.
But have I deduced correctly from the press that, at the beginning of last week, the Council in any case rejected this Commission proposal?
I interpreted the press report as meaning that it did not support this, and I would be grateful to have the answer from your point of view, otherwise we will provoke a discussion here and debate the reality afterwards.
Personally, I was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the Council at this stage.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no longer much point in discussing the package of agricultural prices since the 1992 CAP stipulated the gradual transition from a production price support system to a direct aid system, increasingly required to be dissociated from the production volumes.
And as Agenda 2000 adopted and extended this approach, the establishment of agricultural prices is henceforth multiannual.
While, however, it must still be possible to make annual adjustments, they must nonetheless comply, for the most part, with the commitments made in Berlin covering this period.
This leads me, together with my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to refuse to endorse the Commission' s proposal to reduce the monthly increments for cereals in two phases, by 7.5% each time.
The same applies to moisture content in cereals.
The Berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark.
This is the principled position that the European Union adopted in Seattle with regard to its trading partners and competitors within the World Trade Organisation.
Logically, then, it should also set the standard in our debates on internal CAP matters.
In particular, the European Union must fulfil its commitments in order to enable European farmers to have a clear idea of the policy as it affects them, in order to be able to manage their farms as wisely as possible.
I therefore think it imperative to lift the veil from this notion of making the agricultural sector pay for Kosovo.
In this connection, then, I would urge the Commission to provide us very quickly with its proposed reform of the COM in sugar.
Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and that of the Liberal Group more or less coincide.
This is purely accidental.
I will therefore not repeat what I said in the first two minutes.
All these points which I mentioned are also backed by the Liberal Group.
I would like to add a few more points, however.
We are living in an era in which the agricultural budget is extremely tight.
The slightest movement in the dollar and euro rates would get us into great difficulty.
This being the case, the Commission will have to make a choice as to what to do with the money that is available.
Potentially, however, there is another very large gap.
Over the past few years, we have been faced with outbreaks of epidemics of infectious animal diseases.
We had the BSE crisis in Europe and several European countries suffered from swine fever outbreaks.
These combined outbreaks have cost the European budget billions. It has so far been possible to finance them from categories other than the agricultural budget.
It was agreed in Berlin that this can no longer be the case.
If I am not mistaken, the agricultural budget only comprises one item of approximately EUR 100 million for the control of animal diseases.
This is peanuts compared to what was needed in the past to control outbreaks of infectious diseases.
This is why the Liberal Group is expressly asking the Commission to produce proposals as soon as possible for coping with any disasters.
One of the options is possibly to set up an insurance system throughout Europe, which would also promote fair competition.
In anticipation of the budgetary discussions in September, we would like the Commission to provide us with the necessary data so that we can take this into consideration in the discussions of the budgets for the year 2001.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, adoption of the 2000/2001 agricultural price package involves a commitment to save EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget and to use the appropriations released for reconstruction work in Kosovo.
In this context the report rightly points out that the Commission ought to submit a general document on this to Parliament, in the form of a concrete plan, before further austerity proposals can be accepted.
Without a doubt, the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role.
What I do not find satisfactory in this process, however, is the fact that we always speak first of reducing expenditure and revenue while at the same time transferring ever more tasks to the Commission, which, of course, does not reduce costs either.
Up until 2006 the Commission should work on the basis of the realistic targets set and should deduce its financial needs from them.
As a result of Agenda 2000, European farmers had to accept a EUR 5 billion reduction in their income.
This meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at EUR 50.5 billion and it should stay as such.
To achieve its objectives, the Commission should, in my view, be invited to present a report showing how costs have changed in the agricultural sector.
Today, more deals are concluded in a second than used to be in an entire day and change is the only constant.
Agricultural prices change particularly quickly.
In the EU in 1999, the prices of crop products fell by 4% and livestock products by 6%.
As a result of excessive over-production, pig prices fell by 9%.
All the important agricultural products such as milk, beef, cereals and pork are suffering from increased turbulence on the world' s foreign exchanges, reducing farmers' incomes still further.
That is why we are still far from answering the question of how European Union farmers should make a living in the future.
In the saturated marketplace, only products produced economically can be sold.
The price reductions will destroy farmers' livelihoods in Europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market.
Following this structural change the agricultural holdings which have been able to survive will further increase their output and wield even greater power on the world market.
Another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution.
Further developments will show whether the reform of the EU' s agricultural policy by means of Agenda 2000 is capable of achieving its overall aims or not.
Mr President, notwithstanding the fact that Agenda 2000 has set the parameters governing agriculture for the period up to 2006, the annual price package is still very important.
I agree fully with those who expressed their reservations today in relation to the Commission proposals on the cereals sector.
I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate.
To farmers the price received in the marketplace should represent the real value of their professional endeavours, rather than what they often perceive as social support for the products of their labour.
While not in any way wishing to detract from the overall success of CAP reform, as agreed in Agenda 2000, and acknowledging that without income support farmers would not survive, I must, at the same time, confess to some unease about a situation in which the produce of the land, as produced by our farmers, has to be sold at below production costs.
This happens in many instances.
In this context the support for agriculture - it is substantial and I acknowledge that because it represents almost 50% of the entire budget - must be seen also as a subsidy to consumers.
With the availability of employment outside agriculture and the advances made by the EU and Member States in reducing unemployment, there is now a serious threat to the sustainability of Europe's traditional family farm.
In recent weeks we have heard much talk about a review of the agricultural budget which was agreed in Berlin only a few months ago.
I get the feeling that those concerned only with book-keeping have absolutely no understanding of what is happening out there in the real world.
I warn that unless we become more vigilant and show a greater understanding of the unique and irreplaceable role of farmers in society, future generations and parliamentarians will be forced to react to save agriculture.
That is what we are now doing in our attempt to rectify the rural-urban imbalance which we have allowed to develop over a period of years.
Remember: that it was not the people who created this major problem for society; it was a lack of vision on the part of politicians and planners.
Let us take a fresh look at how better we can plan the long-term survival of agriculture as the profession responsible for food security and safety, taking account of the unique role of farmers as managers of the environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on the report that she has produced, on the work she has done and on having achieved the practically unanimous support of the Committee on Agriculture for her report.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals.
Nevertheless, although this is a little repetitive, I would like you to bear in mind and reconsider, with regard to cereals, both moisture content and the monthly price reviews, since they are issues which could cause us considerable harm.
There is also another question, and I feel that harsh words are required: every time a problem arises in this European Union or in its political positions - positions which I do not question - we consider taking funds away from the agricultural budget.
This issue is of serious concern to us, since the Commissioner for Budgets has repeated that she intends to take EUR 300 million away from sugar to send to Kosovo.
There are also other matters which I would like to stress, which do not appear in the proposal on prices, such as my concern for the nut sector, hazelnuts and almonds, which is facing such great problems at the moment, since, in some cases, the improvement plans implemented by the Commission are coming to an end.
Since its review is not finished, and until the problem of the nut industry is resolved, an extension of these improvement plans should be reconsidered, until its correct place is found, which should be the COM in fruits, where it will be treated in a genuinely differentiated fashion.
Other issues of concern to me do not appear, such as the case of asparagus intended for processing.
Article 10(3) of the Regulation on processed fruits and vegetables provides for lump sum aid.
This aid is going to stop very soon; it comes to an end during this season.
How does the Commission intend to ensure that, in Europe, this aid is used to promote competitiveness and continues to be given to asparagus producers?
With regard to table grapes, on 31 July aid expires for the production of juice, which is included in the COM in wine.
In my opinion, it should be included in the next amendment of the COM in fruits.
Once it has expired however, that is, from 31 July, what are we going to do, until the new reforms are approved, about the aid for table grape processing?
Will it be extended?
What is the intention here?
Regulation No 2275 also provides for aid for promotion in the flower and plant sector, and this aid is also coming to an end.
How can this happen, given that the Council has asked the Commission to carry out a study on the evolution of the aid, in order to justify whether or not it should continue?
I believe that, while waiting for this study to be presented - and we still know nothing about it - and then for a reform to be proposed, Regulation No 2275 should perhaps be extended.
Does this fit in with the Commission' s plans?
They are important sectors because they affect very specific areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 has created a certain kind of stability for the European Agricultural Policy.
I consider it a matter of great importance that we can have a clear and firm view of the future, at least until 2006.
The departure from the Berlin Agreement - these sums are significant to agriculture, but extremely small on the level of the Community as a whole - the question in principle of departing from what has been agreed, is a very serious matter.
It is necessary for this Parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 2006.
This kind of policy, which departs from what has been agreed upon, is not likely to create the stability and spirit that would enable us to share a common view of the future.
One thing of which we seem oblivious, is the present everyday reality of agriculture.
There has been a considerable rise in agricultural costs; fuel prices have gone up, and the level of costs in general is showing a constant upward trend.
In addition to this, farmers as well as the food industry have invested a great deal in quality, in order to rid us of the scandals which have marred the European agricultural model.
It is the farmers themselves who will ultimately have to pay these costs.
The farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations.
We may only hope that the other party will also hold to those mutual agreements that have been made.
Mr President, in its proposals to the Council of Ministers, the Commission has not set out the prices of products and subsidies, as it falsely claims it has done; in our opinion, it simply wants to remind us of the prices and subsidies which will be in force for the period from 2000-2001 in accordance with existing regulations, and at the very most, to amend some monthly increments to the intervention prices of any products to which this system still applies.
We should like to take this opportunity, however, to note that first: producer prices and subsidies have been frozen for numerous agricultural products for twelve consecutive years, as is the case with sheepmeat and goatmeat, whereas for other products they have been falling due to the constant increase in production costs, thereby reducing net agricultural incomes, as the Eurostat figures also show.
The question therefore is: what are the farmers doing about this?
Secondly, eroding or even abolishing the intervention system will leave farmers at the mercy of traders, who buy from producers at derisory prices and then often resell at substantially higher prices.
As a result, while nominal producer prices have fallen, often quite sharply, consumer prices have risen.
In other words, both producers and consumers are being bled dry in the name of protection, which is what the European Union claims it is doing.
The question is what will farmers and consumers do about this?
Will they step up their fight?
Thirdly, low quotas and the resultant extortionate fines are eating up the subsidies for the 1999 harvest.
Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant.
A blatant example is that of oil, which also concerns my country, and in particular my native island of Lesbos.
Despite declarations that the 1998-1999 subsidy would be GRD 460, producers were only paid GRD 330, one year later.
The same applies to cotton where, although the minimum price is EUR 101 per 100 kilos, Greek producers will be paid less than EUR 65 because of the co-responsibility levy.
We have the following comments to make on the issues addressed in the report: as regards cereals, we disagree with the reduction in the monthly increments of the intervention price, which should have been increased.
Also, it must be said that this approach is further eroding the intervention system and, as with other products, it will apparently be abolished altogether for cereals.
We also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in November, since harvest time in Greece is in June.
And similarly with rice, we recommend that intervention commence on 1 October or November and not on 1 April because otherwise, our producers are at the mercy of greedy profiteering traders for six months....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to support Mrs Jeggle' s report and the statements she has made by asking a few very simple questions.
Commissioner, I think it is in your interest to use the support offered by the Members of the European Parliament in order to attempt to safeguard your budget for agriculture.
When we see the way in which money is being used and diverted to finance other measures, we have good cause to wonder if we shall still have the resources to implement a European agricultural policy after enlargement, and moreover to ensure rural development.
When you achieve savings on cereals through moisture rates, how many millions does that amount to throughout Europe?
And how are these millions going to be used?
Do not forget that it is the intermediate regions that will be the first to suffer the effects, not the good cereal-growing areas, the main cereal-growing areas, but rather the regions where there are average production levels, where many farmers are currently experiencing problems.
Looking across the board at agricultural regions, I am forced to note that it is these small- and medium-sized farms whose continuity is not assured, where the farmers' children are looking for careers outside agriculture.
I therefore think that this policy calls for caution, Commissioner.
And you have our support.
The agricultural budget must be used to promote rural development and to step up support to the family-type farms that exist at grass-roots level, rather than containing only budget measures whose sole purpose is to make savings.
Commissioner, we are counting on you a great deal.
We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts. Within Parliament we are aiming to defend the family farm.
- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, on her work, and say that, in fact, this price package is no longer as important as it has been in the past, since, fortunately, it has started to turn into the presentation and definition of agricultural policy in the medium term.
This is why, only recently, we carried out a reform of Agenda 2000: these price packages tend merely to make annual adjustments in response to one-off situations.
The current price package comes at a time when the Commission has promised to present proposals for reform in various sectors over the current year, specifically the rice, sugar, fruit, vegetable and oil sectors. I hope that these reforms do take place.
There is one particular situation that I would like to highlight, which concerns the issue of fruit and vegetables and which is of particular importance to my country.
We are all aware of the iniquity of the present regulations of the policy on processed tomatoes.
Changes to quotas are made between Member States, and this happens every year within a framework which does not take account of unforeseen changes in the climate or the market, and this creates a permanent state of instability in the sector.
A short while ago, therefore, following Mrs GonzÃ¡lez' report, the European Parliament approved the urgent establishment of guarantee thresholds at Member State level and the Commission was asked to present these proposals as a matter of urgency.
However, in the price package, the Commission has not presented anything in this regard to remedy the situation, and the Commission does not appear to be in any hurry to put forward a proposal either.
My country is likely to lose 10% of its quota if the COM proposal is not adopted quickly, and this, quite frankly, is unacceptable.
So the question is, why has the Portuguese Presidency not adopted initiatives to ensure that a proposal would be put forward with due haste?
And why do they use the argument that "the tomato industry cannot be reformed because there is no money" when we spend the money we have on things other than agriculture, such as the financing provided for Kosovo?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you, Mrs Jeggle, very much for your report.
After all, it is the first which you have tabled in the House.
I should also like very much to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees, which have actively participated in the consultations, for their constructive cooperation.
I am pleased that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of the Commission's proposals, namely that we need more continuity and that prices therefore need to be fixed on a multiannual basis.
With your permission, I will first comment on the background to, and the content of, the proposals which we have made.
It is absolutely right - as has been stated here - that the price package is no longer as significant as it was in the past.
As a logical consequence of the multiannual approach which we chose for Agenda 2000, the Commission has now also proposed to set the institutional prices and amounts for those sectors for which this is actually still necessary for an unlimited period of time.
This offers our farmers a considerably more stable framework for their longer-term planning, although we do not, in principle, rule out making any changes which may later prove to be necessary.
The only exception to this multiannual approach in our proposals concerns the sugar sector, where the production quota regime currently in force - as most of you here probably know - will expire in the 2000/2001 financial year.
That is why it would not have been appropriate - given that this final year has to be fixed now first - to introduce a change here.
That is why we are also proposing that the current prices for sugar be kept for this final year of the production quota regime now in force.
I shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward.
Amendment No 4 seeks to leave the monthly increments unchanged.
I cannot, to be quite frank, agree to this proposal, because you are wrong to claim that the reduction which we have proposed contravenes the decisions made in Berlin.
On the contrary, this is the logical consequence of the decisions made in Berlin!
You see, in Berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments.
But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts.
In the past, too, we made adjustments- more or less - every year.
On the other hand, I should also like, as it were, to warn you against believing that it would not be sensible to make this adjustment, because you have to bear one thing in mind: if the amounts are not adjusted and this leads to market supply being disrupted and to cereals being held back in the hope of higher carryovers, then farmers will lose more in the spring when they market their products than they would gain through these higher monthly increments.
That is why I cannot accept this proposal.
The second issue, which involves updating and tightening up the quality criteria, has, of course, been under discussion for months now.
In the meantime, since we are, after all, dealing here with an area where the Commission has exclusive competence - I should also like to emphasise this - a vote has been held in the relevant Management Committee.
That actually puts an end to the debate because, as of 19 April, Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 was enacted.
I do not think that we should reopen this debate now.
That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 2 or 5.
Since the issue of moisture content has been raised here today, I should like to point out that the price of cereals might have been fixed in Berlin, but not the price of water! 14.5% is the maximum moisture content which traders customarily accept nowadays.
It does not present a particular problem to farmers.
After all, if a farmer does have bad luck and has rather higher moisture levels in his cereal crop, then all he needs to do is to pay the drying costs and the problem is solved!
But we can no longer accept the idea of having grain in intervention storage which does not comply with usual international trade practices.
Unfortunately, I also have a problem with including mustard seed in the support system, as you propose in Amendments Nos 1 and 3, because that would be contrary to the Marrakech Agreement.
It would run counter to the peace clause which states that no new products may be incorporated into the support system.
I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7.
Some clarification is probably called for here.
Firstly, the funding of foreign policy measures for the 2000/2001 financial year, which is what we are discussing here, is not in any way linked to the setting of sugar prices.
Secondly, the proposed reduction in the ceiling under heading 1a for the year 2002 does not prejudice the measures in any particular production sector either.
Thirdly, Mrs Jeggle also addressed the situation in 2003 and subsequent years. Here, the Commission has decided that appropriations are only to be withdrawn once the political situation in Serbia has changed dramatically.
If this is the case, the Commission will decide when it reviews the financial perspective in 2002 - as it decided to do in Berlin - how to meet any possible needs.
At this stage, the Commission has specifically decided not to prejudice anything here either.
In addition, the Commission has decided that, as a general rule, funds can only be taken from heading 1a if sufficient funds are not available from other sources, and at the moment it is far from certain that this will be the case.
Mrs Jeggle, you proposed that we should at least utilise the appropriations in 1b - i.e. those for rural development - and you linked this to the disastrous storms in Badem-WÃŒrttemberg in which many trees were uprooted by the strong winds.
This is a much more complex problem because here the Commission had originally intended to make it possible precisely to transfer funds between the two sub-headings.
However, this was rejected by Parliament.
That is why a transfer of this kind is not possible on the basis of the Financial Regulation currently in force and the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I now come to the question which Mrs Keppelhoff asked concerning what ECOFIN actually did decide. Well, the proposals which Mrs Schreyer circulated to ECOFIN were rejected for the time being.
At the moment, however, we are, of course, still in the discussion phase; the actual budget debate on the 2001 budget is yet to take place.
The rejection does not primarily or exclusively concern this issue of the 300 million; the proposals as a whole were given a negative reception by ECOFIN.
Amendment No 8, to which Mr Mulder, in particular, referred, concerns a study on alternative ways of covering financial losses arising in the event of outbreaks of animal diseases.
The study which Mr Mulder mentioned was also intended to examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory insurance scheme.
We will commission a study of this kind.
However, I have to tell you that the results will not be available until the end of the year.
We will not obtain the results from those carrying out the study any earlier than that.
I also share the view expressed in the amendment that producers ought to take on more of the financial responsibility for eradicating animal diseases.
However, in principle, it is the Member States who are responsible for this issue.
That is why initially all we can do here is carry out an evaluation of the possible ways in which we at Community level might support the Member States in setting up schemes of this kind.
In any case, this issue ought to be dealt with in the context of the review of veterinary legislation which is currently being carried out by the Directorate-General responsible for public and animal health.
Mrs Redondo asked a number of questions about the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, about nuts and about ornamental plants, and Mr Cunha asked about processed tomatoes.
As planned, the Commission will submit a report on the functioning of the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables before the end of this year.
This report will not only cover fresh fruit and vegetables but also processed fruit and vegetables, and therefore processed tomatoes.
We expect this report to be ready at the beginning of the second half of this year.
As far as promoting ornamental plants is concerned - or to be more precise, Mrs Redondo, publicity for the ornamental plants sector - it is true that the Commission is carrying out a review here.
In fact, we made this a requirement when the legal arrangements were introduced and, depending on the outcome of the assessment, we will table a proposal in sufficient time to ensure that there is no interruption in the publicity campaign.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Flax and hemp for fibre
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at first sight the importance of the flax and hemp sector may perhaps not be obvious, particularly to those colleagues who work less frequently on agricultural matters.
Flax and hemp are crops with a very rich tradition in Europe, whose popularity has nevertheless declined over the years and whose versatility is only now being rediscovered.
It is precisely the possibilities which this branch of agriculture offers of developing products with a promising future which we need to support at European level.
Insulation for houses, filling materials for vehicle bodywork and presses for furniture manufacture are just some of the examples of this modern technology.
The production of these materials from renewable raw materials should offer a real alternative to synthetically-produced ones and, at the same time, provide a new and attractive source of income for farmers as suppliers of those raw materials.
The need for reform is justified, above all, by misuses of funds and subsidy fraud in recent years.
I am firmly opposed to this subsidy hunting and strict controls are necessary to ensure compliance with legal provisions.
All the same, in my opinion, the Commission proposals overshoot the mark a little.
Allow me briefly to outline the basic considerations underlying my report.
Area payments should be set at EUR 126/t - or EUR 600/ha - and should only be disbursed if proof of delivery to the processor is furnished.
The area payments are being established under the regulation on the support system for producers of arable crops and, for this reason, this regulation also needs to be adjusted to take account of the specific characteristics of flax and hemp.
It goes without saying that the regional base areas envisaged in this regulation need to be expanded to incorporate the areas for flax and hemp.
Since flax and hemp are mainly grown for non-food purposes and no surpluses are produced, there should be no set-aside obligation, because set-aside serves as an instrument to regulate markets where surpluses are possible.
The processing aid which is to be paid out to the primary processor will only be granted if proof can be provided that processing has taken place within the last 18 months.
Since this aid is supposed to take account of the economic viability of the sector, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes setting this at EUR 120/t for long flax fibre and EUR 70/t for short flax fibre and hemp.
Of course, it is not only the premium for long fibres, but also that for short fibres which needs to be secured as a long-term measure because it is precisely short fibres which are of prime importance for innovative projects.
Commissioner, the national maximum quantities and the maximum quantity for the EU, which the Commission is proposing, need to be reconsidered.
The maximum quantities for each Member State should be calculated on the basis of existing processing capacities and adjusted to take account of planned processing capacities for which irreversible investments have already been made.
Allow me to make one further comment on hemp because there is still some misunderstanding here.
There is no risk of drugs being cultivated in Europe and the use of hempseed for nutritional purposes is deeply rooted in certain regions.
The existing control mechanisms and limits are sufficient, in my view, to prevent hemp from being cultivated for the production of psychotropic substances.
Specialities have developed in the individual regions - such as hempseed oil and hemp beer - which help to enrich regional identity through the food chain.
Mr President, I should once more like to point out that a reform, which is admittedly necessary, of the flax and hemp sector, which, on account of its multi-functionality, is so important for the future of European agriculture and for the future of farmers as suppliers of raw materials for new spheres, must not be allowed to render the entire sector unprofitable.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted this report by a large majority.
That is why I should like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who supported me when I was drawing up this report.
Mr President, according to Mrs Schierhuber' s present report, if something goes wrong with a certain regulation in Europe, in this case flax, it is quite possible to ensure that that regulation can remain intact by means of new proposals.
Flax, like hemp, is a special product, with a long European tradition.
The mere fact that both my trousers and jacket are made of linen and flax which is processed in Flanders and partly in Zeeland, and grown in France, bears out this product' s long-standing tradition.
The reason we are having to hold this debate is to do with the fact that the regulation has gone off the rails.
We all know what happened to short flax.
We also know that that derailment occurred in Southern Europe and we need to be prepared to adapt the policy.
But what is now happening with the Commission' s proposal is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
People have overstepped the mark.
At the same time, it is quite possible to tighten the flax and hemp regulations so that we can manage on a normal budget such as the one we have had over the past couple of years and, despite this, continue to grow flax and hemp in Europe at a profit.
I am saying this because, although the cultivation of flax and hemp is traditional, they are also used in special applications in linen for clothing and in other applications in the non-food sector. I am thinking of dashboards and bumpers for cars.
At the same time, they form a true complement to agricultural policy.
