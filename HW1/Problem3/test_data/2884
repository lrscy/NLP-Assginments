That is what we want to see the Commission look at.
Let me give you two UK-based examples.
First, price: should this be regulated?
Solicitors, my own profession, used to have a monopoly of conveyancing, the buying and selling of land.
Competition was introduced, licensed conveyancers allowed, and it drove down prices, but not standards.
I experienced this myself the other week. I had to renew the lease of my office.
I was bound to use my landlord's solicitors. To set up the original lease they charged me GBP 300; that seemed quite enough to me.
But to vary a couple of words in the self-same document, they proposed to charge me GBP 500.
That, to me, is licensed robbery by our profession.
They need to be challenged.
Secondly, a constituent of mine recently came to me with a history of a dispute over the last 15 years.
That dispute had taken him through five law firms, ruined his business and his family life, all about a debt that had actually been acknowledged in writing.
He had had no help from my profession's complaints body.
These are the kinds of examples that do the liberal professions no service; and sadly they are not limited or isolated.
Yes, professional standards can be imposed by professional bodies, but they can only be further enhanced by competition and external scrutiny.
That is why I ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, I would like to add just a few more comments.
Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission has been tackling these issues for a long time now.
In fact the first rule dates back to 1993.
In total, the Commission has issued three resolutions on competition amongst the liberal professions, the fundamental principles of which have been confirmed by the Court of Justice.
Two of the resolutions were directed against uniform tariffs which could not be justified on the grounds of the general interest.
In one case, which concerned the procedure to determine lawyers' fees in Italy, the Commission is waiting for the interpretation of Community law by the Court.
This ruling will prepare the way for the adoption of further measures.
I would also like to point out that the Commission believes that each of the liberal professions needs to be dealt with separately and not all according to the same pattern.
The example the speaker from Great Britain presented concerning doctors is evidence of the need for separate treatment.
I believe that, in my introductory comment, I said a great deal about consumer protection being our top priority.
The debate is closed.
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule (42)5 ()
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.25 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)()
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 5 April.
Agenda
The order of business was established on 2 April, but I have received a number of proposals for amendments.
Relating to Wednesday 2 May:
The Commission communication will deal with our partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues and will be made by Commissioner Nielson.
The second item of information I have is that on 11 April, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved the report by Mr MacCormick on the request for the waiver of Mrs Jeggle' s immunity.
Pursuant to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of Procedure, this report has been placed at the head of the agenda and will be followed immediately by Mr Zimeray' s report on the request for the waiver of Mr Voggenhuber' s immunity.
Madam President, according to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of the Procedure, committee reports concerning immunity of Members shall be placed at the head of the agenda.
Recent events have reminded us that questions of immunity are not mere matters of form, but go to the substance of great issues of democracy in Europe and you have, indeed, alluded to that yourself.
Are you certain that it satisfies Rule 6(6) to take these issues of immunity after the Commission communication which appears to have been placed at the head of the agenda ahead of the issues of immunity?
Is that a correct interpretation of Rule 6?
Mr MacCormick, you are quite right and you will be pleased, since the three reports on waivers of immunity have been placed at the head of the agenda, after the Commission communication and before Mr Cashman' s report on public access to documents.
Madam President, am I right in assuming that the item on Turkish prisoners on hunger strike has not been included in today' s agenda?
Yes, Mr Wurtz, you are right.
The Council did not believe that it was in a position to make this statement.
Of course, there would not be much point without the Council.
The Council can, however, attend the sitting of 14 May.
In my view, this answer, not the one you gave, Madam President, but the answer given by the Council, is unacceptable and we should not accept it.
(Applause from the left)
When I wrote to you on 25 April, you were, in fact, in favour of this yourself.
I believe I am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this.
At that time, 17 prisoners had died.
Since then, there have been a further two deaths.
A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition.
I think that the Council' s response to postpone this debate to some other later date is an unacceptable, bureaucratic answer.
We cannot allow the number of victims of the hunger strike to increase with each passing day, nor can we shirk our responsibilities.
If, as I understand it, the Swedish Minister for Justice will be present at this sitting to talk about the Cashman report, one cannot imagine that he would refuse to respond to our request, in other words, to send the Turkish government an urgent request to resume negotiations with the prisoners' representatives so that this dreadful slaughter can be brought to an end.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
Just to clarify matters, it is Mrs Lejon, Minister for Democratic Issues, Public Administration and Consumer Policies, who will be present.
Mr Danielsson is currently on a visit to Korea and so the only minister who will be available is Mrs Lejon, and she does not believe that she is in a position to address this issue.
Madam President, it would, of course, have been good if we could have debated this urgent matter here today.
I would like to remind you and the House that Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and for part of the time, I myself have been in Turkey over the last few days as part of a very spontaneous action.
Mr Cohn-Bendit is, of course, chair of the delegation that is to visit Turkey and its prisons in June.
We have also had a meeting on this subject today.
Mr Cohn-Bendit and I - to the extent that I was present - made the viewpoint of this House very clear to the Turkish Government, to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister for European Affairs, as we did to the organisations that are organising this hunger strike, to the human rights organisations and to the country's MPs.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
We have tried, by means of a very spontaneous action, and in view of the urgency of this matter, to make the views of this Parliament very clear to the Turkish Government, Parliament and to the human rights organisations.
Madam President, it is a matter of regret that the Council is not represented here today.
We are very well aware that the request for the Council to be represented here was made at very short notice.
For that reason I do not mean to criticise the Swedish Presidency as such, but I would like to make a point about the future, Madam President. Just as we expect the Commission to be present at meetings of the European Parliament, in future it should also be possible for the Council of Ministers to be available to make statements when the European Parliament is sitting in Brussels or Strasbourg.
We should focus our efforts, following the great success we had just last week with a regulation on transparency and access to documents, so that in future it goes without saying that the Council of Ministers, which is always welcome here, is not only welcomed by us when it is willing to attend, but rather that the Council should always be present here in future.
(Applause)
Mr Poettering, I fully agree with what you have said, and, as you know, I have already spoken to the Council about this matter, following a debate at the Conference of Presidents, where we all made this comment and fervently hoped that the Council would be available to attend, as you have said.
Madam President, I do not know whether our actions over the last two days will be successful.
Some members of the government told us that they were going to take measures and, that in fact, an agreement between the position of the hunger strikers and that of the government is now quite clearly achievable.
That is why we asked the Turkish government to take action.
If we are unable to discuss this matter today, I would like us to make a public statement to the effect that we shall discuss this issue with the Council at the May part-session and that we want to see some results in May.
The positions in Turkey are clearly evident today.
We can find a solution in two days.
We shall see what happens over the next two or three days and, in May, all of us in this House shall shoulder our responsibilities.
Madam President, in response to what Mr Cohn-Bendit said, I would just like to say that personal actions are to be admired as long as they are for a good cause.
This does not mean, however, that an institution is in any way exempt from carrying out its responsibilities.
This must not, in any way, then be used as an excuse by the Council, which should do what we ask by tomorrow at the latest.
Relating to Thursday 3 May:
President.
The report by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the accounts of certain types of companies, was only approved on 24 April.
The debate could, therefore, be included in the agenda and the vote could take place at the second May part-session in Strasbourg.
It seems that this proposal enjoys a very broad consensus.
This means that the deadline for tabling amendments would be 12 noon on Thursday 10 May.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Regarding the votes, the vote on Mr Colom i Naval' s report, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the adoption of the financial perspective, is to be added.
You will recall that this vote was postponed at the sitting of 3 April.
Speeches relating to procedure
Madam President, as you know many of us are very concerned with the prestige and reputation of this Parliament and for that reason I rise in connection with the procedures concerning the lifting of Mr Berlusconi's immunity.
At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents on 5 April this matter was referred to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Madame Garaud was invited to represent us vis-Ã -vis the Spanish authorities.
I understand that Madame Garaud cannot for the time being undertake that mission for personal reasons, which are fully understandable and have my deepest sympathy.
Nonetheless, the matter has become all the more urgent because of three new developments: first, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, using the same procedures as us to waive parliamentary immunity, appears to be moving much faster within a deadline of only two months, and the European Parliament could find itself in the unfortunate situation of being left well behind.
Secondly, the Spanish Government has transmitted a new request to the Italian authorities without waiting for the opinion of the Council of State of Spain, which is ostensibly the reason why it has not yet replied to the European Parliament.
Thirdly, again according to the press, the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, has written asking you to investigate the delay.
In these circumstances, do you agree that it is all the more urgent to proceed rapidly?
Do you intend to ensure that the mission to Spain takes place as soon as possible, if necessary with a different envoy?
Would you give us a deadline for this - would it be a matter of weeks, months or years?
Mr Corbett, I would like to thank you for raising this issue as a point of order, as this gives me the opportunity to give the House some extremely important information.
As a rule, I do not respond to controversial press stories with further controversy.
I have a deep respect for the dignity of this Parliament and so I am only too happy to be able to clarify matters for its Members.
What is the current situation?
As you said, there was a meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
Three decisions were reached, following a first decision that we had taken at Mr BarÃ³n Crespo' s request.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo had asked that we draw up an exhaustive document of all previous requests for waivers of parliamentary immunity, in other words, all the requests received since the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage.
I thought that this very comprehensive document would be of great use.
I would like to thank the Secretary-General for having diligently drawn up this document, which is extremely interesting.
It confirms that all requests, apart from those made by Portugal and one request made by Spain where there is some doubt, have always passed through the governments of the relevant Member State.
You have access to this document.
I am sure that it will have been sent to you through the appropriate channels.
At the Conference of Presidents, three decisions were taken.
The first decision was to ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a substantive document on how requests for waivers of immunity should be dealt with in general.
There would therefore be grounds for wondering whether there is a need to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
In these circumstances, as in others - I am thinking of the procedures for requests to withdraw a fellow Member' s mandate, or for other things - you realise that Rule 6 does, in actual fact, seem rather inadequate.
Mr Napolitano, the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has accepted to undertake this task on behalf of his committee and I would like to thank him for doing so.
I believe that the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs are meeting tomorrow to appoint a rapporteur.
I would repeat that this is an extremely important and serious matter which affects both this institution and the guarantee that every Member must be able to legitimately enjoy.
It was then decided that I should again write to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, reiterating my desire to see this issue investigated as soon as possible.
This letter was drafted, I believe, directly after the meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I believe that it is available to you, again, through the appropriate channels.
If you do not have access to this letter, we shall, of course, put the matter right.
The Conference of Presidents then asked me to appoint a Member of Parliament who would, more or less, be responsible for monitoring this issue.
I appointed Mrs Garaud, who is a member of the French Council of State, a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and a member of the Conference of Presidents; she does not belong to any political group, is therefore someone with an excellent profile and is acknowledged by all to be an excellent jurist.
I believe, Mr Corbett, that you are aware that Mrs Garaud has been through an extremely painful experience.
I do not know if she is present, but I would like to pass on my deepest condolences to her.
I do not think that we really could have blamed her for not being able to go to Spain during the period following her appointment to this position.
I think that you are aware of the situation.
I have some very important information and I would like to thank Mr Corbett for mentioning the Council of Europe.
The Spanish Supreme Court sent a request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity of the same Italian MEPs to the Council of Europe. However, you seem to be unaware that this request was sent to the Council of Europe via the Spanish government.
I am saying to you in all sincerity that this only adds to my doubts.
Who are they trying to embarrass here?
A request was made directly to the President of the European Parliament, the Supreme Court then passed this on to the European Parliament' s information office in Madrid and, a few months later, the same Supreme Court involved the government, through the Spanish government' s mission to the Council of Europe.
If I had not acted in the way I did, Mr Corbett, I would have had deep regrets.
I certainly would have acted in the wrong way and if I had taken a hasty decision to refer this to the Committee on Legal Affairs and to announce it to Parliament, this decision would have been subject to an appeal, a perfectly legitimate appeal, by those concerned.
I repeat, in order to respect the dignity of this Parliament, I think that we must treat this situation with all seriousness.
Referring this matter to the Council of Europe, therefore, fully endorses the approach that I took when this matter first arose.
I sincerely hope that the Supreme Court informs me why there are two different ways of dealing with this, one way for this Parliament and another way for the Council of Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for more than a month now, the Somme valley has been flooded, affecting the region of Amiens and the town of Abbeville in particular, which is where I live, and the surrounding area.
This is the first time that floods have hit our dÃ©partement.
I shall inform you of the extent of the disaster, which is a very difficult task for me.
In total, 125 municipalities are under water - in other words, approximately 1 500 houses are flooded and more than 2 000 people have been evacuated.
Substantial damage has been caused, and the people of the area are suffering untold misery and despair.
The situation is particularly worrying, because as well as the natural disaster, experts are predicting that water levels will take a very long time to subside and it could take several months.
We have gone beyond the stage of a localised disaster and we are looking for ways to drain the huge amounts of water.
People are showing great solidarity at local and regional level and help is being mobilised at national level.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should also take part in this solidarity, in other words, by providing considerable financial aid, bearing in mind that the cost of the damage will amount to several billion French francs.
This area of France, which is already badly affected by economic and social problems, has been devastated.
Admittedly, the media are saying that the water levels were yesterday beginning to subside. However, first of all, this is not happening everywhere and, secondly, the most difficult work still lies ahead of us, as we will now have to face the problems of restoration due to subsidence and pollution problems, which are already a threat.
For these reasons, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again appeal, if I may, for European solidarity.
Thank you, Mr Butel, I have absolutely no doubt that a request for a topical and urgent debate on the terrible situation that you have described will be tabled for the next part-session.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer to Mr Corbett's statement and also to your own, Madam President.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I would like to say that the President of this Parliament has behaved quite properly in this matter, and to express our full support for you on this, Madam President.
(Applause from the right)
It is amazing that the Socialist Group has raised this subject in debate during every part-session, either here in Brussels or else in Strasbourg.
Mr Corbett, you say you are concerned about the reputation of the European Parliament.
What you are really worried about is the election campaign in Italy, and you want to influence that campaign by enabling your political friends to benefit from a debate here in Brussels.
(Applause from the right)
However, unlike the President, I am free to express my own opinion, because things are being insinuated here, and to comment on the fact that Mrs Garaud, for whom I have great respect, has so far not been able to travel to Madrid.
The President made a discreet reference to the reason.
Why is it that Mrs Garaud has been unable to undertake the mission?
It is because her husband has died.
We offer her our sincere sympathy.
I am saying this so that there can be no more insinuations here.
(Applause from the right)
That brings me to the question of how this was dealt with in the Conference of Presidents. I am one of those people who not only always wants debates to be held here, but also believes that we should make decisions.
However, we need to recognise that the Conference of Presidents reached a unanimous decision.
It was unanimously agreed that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs chaired by our esteemed colleague Mr Napolitano, who is not a member of my group, should now draft a report on how we deal with the procedures for waiving immunity.
That was a unanimous decision.
That is why I was very surprised, after the Conference of Presidents, to hear about a letter from the chairman of the Socialist Group to the President of Parliament, in which the very decision we had agreed upon was once again called into question.
If this were about another person, if this did not involve a country in the middle of an election campaign, then I am sure that the Socialist Group would not keep raising this issue in this House.
That is why we very firmly reject these attempts to influence the election campaign in Italy and the democratic process of forming a new government in that country.
(Applause from the right)
Madam President, the various groups here have been adopting positions regarding the matter of Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity, and I would like to state, on behalf of my own group, that I have been studying some documents relating to earlier cases, which were in the possession of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and which relate to the immunity of the Spanish and other Members.
I think it is very important that Parliament should comply with the rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity in a way that is completely fair and consistent.
Having familiarised myself with these precedents, I could not help but come to the conclusion that there were two suitable precedents for concluding that the request to waive Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity should have been made in plenary immediately after last summer' s recess, and referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation.
I had the impression that the last argument you put forward, Madam President, was that the requests in question had come from the Spanish Supreme Court through Parliament' s Information Office.
My opinion is that this is not a very plausible reason for postponing the issue and delaying discussions on it.
Consequently, I can only state that it is the opinion of my group that there was every justification for announcing this request to waive parliamentary immunity in plenary without delay, and referring it to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation. The committee could then have discovered if there were any problems associated with this competent authority.
I believe the committee would have been very happy to do that.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
You may, of course, make a statement on behalf of your group.
I must, however, just pick up on two points that were inaccurate.
There were three requests to waive the parliamentary immunity of Spanish MEPs.
Two requests were sent directly through the intermediary of the Spanish governmental authorities.
There is only one request where there is some doubt.
The Official Journal reports that it was sent by the Spanish government.
In the report by the MEP at the time, which is the report on the request for the waiver of immunity, it says 'given the request made by the Spanish Minister for Justice' , but when you look into the case, the letter from the minister cannot be found.
Therefore, there are obviously two requests from the Minister of Justice, submitted by the Spanish governmental authorities, and one request where there is some doubt, in spite of the Official Journal, which, however, in principle, is deemed to be authentic.
With regard to the latest information that I have just provided, I have the impression that you might not have fully understood - perhaps there was a problem with the translation - this does not relate to the Council of State, this relates to a request for a waiver that was submitted by the Supreme Court at the Council of Europe, not long ago, and I clarified that this request was sent by the Spanish government' s mission, and this happened very recently.
This information that I have given you is new and extremely important information.
That is why my colleague at the Council of Europe was able to send it to the appropriate committee, since there was no doubt that the request came from the Spanish authorities.
I do understand that all these facts might be cause for regret for some Members, but unfortunately for them, these are the facts, and we cannot change them, as they certainly are objective and beyond question.
Madam President, I would just like to point out to Mr Poettering that the problem in this Parliament is ensuring that Members receive equal treatment.
The response to the case of Mr Berlusconi does not ensure equal treatment: indeed, if Mrs Frassoni - myself, that is - had been the person concerned in this case, I am sure that the President would have acted differently.
There is no doubt about it. Therefore, Mr Poettering, the matter in hand is that of the equality of Members.
That is the issue we must tackle and that is why Mr Corbett's question must be resolved by referring the question of the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Berlusconi without delay to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, precisely in order to preserve equality between all the 626 Members.
We cannot continue to beat about the bush.
I am totally shocked by what you have just said, Mrs Frassoni.
I think that, in all the years spent working in Parliament, I have shown
that I have always treated all Members equally, wherever they are from, whatever their political affiliation - and I did so again not so long ago - and that has always been my objective.
I am able to prove this very easily, Mrs Frassoni.
Madam President, thank you for your explanation.
In connection with it, I would first of all like to point out that you commissioned a study, at my request, in which two things were clear: firstly, that there were different types of treatment, and secondly, and I would like to stress this, that no request had ever remained in the drawers of the Bureau of Parliament for nine months.
This is important.
I would also like to say, with the utmost respect, that the President of Parliament has to submit to the Rules of Procedure, which means giving the responsibility to the corresponding committee.
I have said this to you in public and in private.
Out of respect for you and for the position that you hold I have tried to maintain a constructive attitude throughout this process and I would like to point out that the three proposals that you mentioned as agreements of the Conference of Presidents came from me.
Specifically, the nomination of Mrs Garaud, and I add my condolences for her situation, was your proposal, but the proposal to send an emissary was mine.
This therefore justifies the letter that I sent to you with the agreement of my Group.
My Group still considers that this issue should be announced in public.
The truth is that we are faced with a very paradoxical situation because a matter that has not been announced is taking up a large proportion of our plenary sittings, but in the end, that is how it is.
We also think that it should be the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that should deal with the matter.
Now, if you will allow me, Madam President, I am going to answer the allegations made by Mr Poettering who, with his usual elegance, has launched a torrent of abuse at the Socialist Group.
First of all, the problem could have been avoided.
This comes from August of last year, when the Italian elections had not yet been called.
If it had been dealt with at the time, we would not have had anything to say about it.
But also, Madam President, although the Secretary-General of the PPE insists that the Socialist International is behind everything, they are not going to tell me that we control media such as The Economist, El Mundo, Le Monde, Handesblat and even the Los Angeles Times.
Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have these powers and what is more, even if we had them, we would not use them.
Therefore, there is a very simple solution to the matter under consideration.
You belong to the same political group as Mr Berlusconi, who was enthroned as the rising star of the PPE at the Berlin Congress, and who is of the same political group as the President of the Government of my country.
And you are of the same political group as the President of Parliament and the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I did not wish to use these arguments.
So be careful what you say because everything has an answer.
Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Poettering a question in order to confirm what he said on Friday.
Do you think that, in your country, a person with a conflict of interests such as Mr Berlusconi has could stand for the German elections?
Because your colleague, Mr Brok, says that the answer is no.
Please do me the favour of answering the House.
(Applause from the left)
You have just done a great job in showing that this issue is certainly of a political nature.
However, I should like to return to the subject of the law.
You said that respecting the Rules of Procedure meant referral to the committee responsible.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, several years ago, we had an MEP in this House who was held in great esteem by all Members of this Parliament.
This MEP was Mrs Marie-Claude Vayssade, Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Here is what Mrs Vayssade wrote in a letter dated 8 March 1985. She said that she would like to point out straight away that, pursuant to Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure, a request for the waiver of immunity can only be referred once it has been established that the request is from the appropriate authority.
Therefore, I believe that this condition must be fulfilled before this is done, as well as the announcement to Parliament and the referral to committee, a point also laid down in the Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
Once again, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, there really is no getting away from the facts and you have my sympathy but everything points to this.
I am slightly weary of these groundless accusations and we know exactly what lies at the root of them.
I must start my speech by referring to certain allusions that have been made.
Whilst I have the utmost respect for Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, he said something that, as with so many things that are being said in this House today, he left unclear. We are compatriots, yes, we are all aware of that, and it is a great honour, may I add.
I am surprised at the tone of this debate.
I am surprised because you pointed out that we are discussing an issue that is essentially legal in nature, and we need to keep it within the boundaries that you, Madam President - and I would like to highlight this - have kept it within, come hell or high water, thus demonstrating conviction and legal certainty.
Mrs Frassoni started by making an accusation that I think discredits itself.
That is not all, however, as Mr Corbett, Mrs Hautala and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo also seem to be telling us that the important thing for an institution is who gets there first, and to be saying that we need to move faster, that we are going very slowly.
That is not the point of the issue, as you so rightly pointed out.
Here there are major doubts, doubts that are justified, as to whether the procedure was formally correct, and therefore time does not matter. We have to wait until the necessary legal steps have been taken in order to dispel that doubt.
It is unfortunate that we were not able to obtain an answer before, but what is most unfortunate is that it was not sent through the usual channels according to the Rules of Procedure.
I would also like to make a couple of points to Mrs Hautala, with all the admiration that she knows that I have for her.
Mrs Hautala, in the case that you mentioned and which you have consulted, there is a fact, aside from the two that the President gave to you. In the Official Journal it shows that the request came from the Minister of Justice, as it also shows in the report, but there is a letter from President Kleps, by which the President of Parliament notified the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which the Ministry is also mentioned.
Are we perhaps to think that in this Parliament, which drew up that letter, the official who drew it up is not able to tell whether something comes from the Ministry of Justice or not?
Therefore, an assumption has been made, despite the fact that there is no documentary evidence, but assumptions have been made, and very strong ones, that in one way or another the letter was sent through the Ministry of Justice, because I cannot believe that the person responsible for drawing up that letter for the President at the time was not able to tell and would say explicitly in the letter that it came from the Ministry of Justice if that was not the case.
Madam President I think that, as the Conference of Presidents very wisely decided, we should wait for Mrs Garaud to deal with this matter and to take the steps that she deems appropriate as the person mandated by the Conference of Presidents.
We need to give it that time.
With regard to the delay, I would like to say that this case is taking a long time, but that people should take a look in the files of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
At the moment, for example, we have a request for the German Government that has not been answered for nine months. That is how it is, and it is there for all of you to look at.
Finally, Madam President what is the problem that we are faced with?
It is a problem, if you will allow me, associated with the happy event of the growth of Europe in the context of a Europe of justice, the area of justice, because here the Supreme Court is arguing that appeals can be made to the European Parliament just as they can to national parliaments.
In my opinion, with the law as it stands, this is still not possible. Let us hope that it will be in the future.
Personally I hope so, but for the moment let us be content with respecting the law that is in force.
We do not want voluntarism, which, as you so rightly said, Madam President, would only lead us to the Court of Justice.
(Applause from the right)
Madam President, it seems clear that we face in all these issues two critical imperatives: on the one side, it is vitally important that democratic deliberation in an assembly of this kind goes forward without unfair impediment or abuse of legal processes to deter Members from exercising their democratic mandate properly.
That is very important.
On the other side, always when issues of immunity arise, the contemporary unpopularity of politicians becomes an issue and people say "politicians hide behind membership of legislative houses in order to get away with things that ordinary people are punished for doing".
It is equally important and vital to avoid giving that impression.
That is why it is so important in these cases that the House becomes seized as quickly as possible of the question whether what is before us is an abuse of the legal process in terrorem democratiae or whether on the other hand this is a case where something is being done which ought to be tried in the ordinary courts in the case of any ordinary citizen, for we are all ordinary citizens as well as legislators.
It is very regrettable that this issue has become a matter of long drawn-out deliberation in the executive branch of a Member State because that is exactly the wrong place for these vital issues to be debated.
We should get them into Parliament as quickly as possible.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Madam President, as you might have noticed, the Italian Members of the European Parliament on this side of the House have until now avoided intervening on the issues related to Mr Berlusconi's and Mr Dell'Utri's parliamentary immunity.
The reason is quite obvious.
The situation in my country is very delicate.
The question is very complex.
We are but a few weeks, or even a few days, away from Italian national elections.
But with due respect to the high functions and duties and role you are discharging, and after listening to all my honourable colleagues, particularly Richard Corbett, and to you, let me say that the situation is perceived outside this House as becoming more unbearable, more unacceptable by the day.
I am raising my voice therefore not as an Italian politician, but as a European Member of this House, to urge you to put an end to all the ambiguities and delays and specious protocol formalities, and to communicate to all of us, as Mr Corbett has suggested, a precise date, a deadline immediately after May 13, the national election day in my country, by which we intend to pursue a definite legal and procedural solution of the affair.
This is a matter that goes far beyond political partisanship, and concerns, or should concern, all members of this House, for it concerns the dignity and functioning of our institution.
Mr Manisco, I do understand that some Members are finding that this matter is dragging on.
However, you understand that, for myself, as a president who has been accused in an extremely unfair manner, it is nonetheless important, in the interests of transparency, that we are able to see all the unquestionable, legal facts before us, including archived documents, such as the letter from the then Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for example.
With regard to the deadline - there is a simple answer, which I have already given. I am now waiting for the Council of State to deliver an opinion.
You will understand that as soon as the government of the Member State concerned informs me that the matter has been referred to the Council of State, I will act when the Council of State has delivered an opinion, when the Spanish government informs me who in actual fact is considered in Spain to be the appropriate authority to issue these requests for immunity.
Immediately afterwards, I assure you that I shall make an announcement in Parliament, as Mrs Vayssade specified in her letter, and I shall refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The matter will then be perfectly clear.
Madam President, in response to what Mr Poettering has said, I would just like to underline that I did not raise any question relating to your past actions.
I simply asked for a deadline to be set for the mission which our Parliament has agreed to send to the Spanish authorities.
Nor did I cast any aspersions about why Mrs Garaud has not been able to go up to now.
On the contrary, I said we fully understood those reasons, and that she has our every sympathy.
I urge Mr Poettering in future to listen to what other Members say before he decides to attack them and to distinguish between a genuine concern for Parliament's reputation and procedures, and party political points.
I was not making a party political point.
I was making a point on behalf of this Parliament.
Madam President, I had no intention whatsoever of speaking on this issue, but since the debate has been sparked off again...(Heckling). Please be a little more patient!
You can tell me what you thought of what I am about to say in a moment.
You may even be slightly troubled by this.
Madam President, since the outset, the Members in my group believed that this was a matter involving a string of events that are all the more worrying and harmful since they evidently relate to a political issue, the scope of which is clear to all to see.
I am clear at least about one thing - and that is the political responsibilities used quite openly in this matter - namely, the prolonged silence, and then the delaying tactics used by the Spanish government for more than eight months since the matter was referred to it by your office, Madam President.
I think that we cannot help but associate this attitude with political collusion with Mr Berlusconi.
That is what is unacceptable. We must not accept it.
As for everything else, the more we have out into the open, the better it is for our institution, and, in my view, and I want to state this personally and very clearly, I do not question the integrity of the President of this Parliament, even though I do not approve the course of action she chose to follow in this sensitive matter.
I know only too well what courage you have shown in other circumstances, Madam President, and therefore I will not go accusing you of anything underhand today.
On the other hand, we have asked for complete transparency from the outset and you helped to provide this earlier by giving the details of this matter.
It was just so that the whole truth could be known by all, and possible misunderstandings avoided, and most importantly so that we could finally make up some lost time to look into this request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity. I hope that the precedent of the Council of Europe that you mentioned - the Council of Europe to which the Spanish government felt it could turn - will enable you to persuade the Spanish government to treat the European Parliament in the same way as soon as possible, so that we will finally be able to look into this issue and turn the page on this chapter.
Madam President, I too had not intended to take the floor, but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters of an hour.
In the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, all of the group leaders present made a very great effort to try to understand the precedents, to try to understand the complexity and to try to arrive at a reasoned and fair decision.
I believe the decision that was arrived at at the Conference of Presidents reflected a consensus view, which was a collective wisdom, and you have enunciated that view here today.
Everyone who has studied this dossier in great detail and who has discussed it free from polemics, but not free from their political preferences, has a view on these issues; no one made any personal accusation or imputation against you.
I want to say, on behalf of my own group, that although you find yourself in an extremely difficult personal position, you have behaved with honour personally, as President of this House, from the very first moment this issue was placed before you.
On 28 August last, you requested the assistance of the Spanish authorities on the issue of the competent authority to transmit this document.
I believe that the delay, for which you are now being reproached in debates like this, is totally undignified and unwarranted, and that you and this Parliament find themselves becoming the victim as bystander of a process of an Executive outside this House.
I intend, on behalf of my own group, notwithstanding the mission you have conferred on Madame Garaud, to whom again, on behalf of my group, I wish to express our profound sympathy, to take direct personal contact with the Spanish authorities, because we have a right to have an early and urgent answer.
The delay has been unwarranted and undignified and it has cast you in a light and in a role where you do not properly belong.
I defend what you have done.
I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member.
If Madame Garaud is not in a position, for perfectly understandable reasons, to undertake the mission that you have conferred on her, it could be advisable to see if, in such circumstances, an alternative may be found, if only because it is important for the Presidency of this House to be able to assure Members, as I believe we were assured at a prolonged debate of the Conference of Presidents, that you have acted with concern for due process and with propriety at all times.
We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting.
One was an Italian case which came as a direct reference from a court.
This is not a good precedent in this case because the Italian Constitution had changed between the earlier format of transmission and the most recent, and consequently the law itself had changed.
Therefore, because the constitution was a different constitution, it is not a precedent with regard to the issue of a competent authority to transmit such a request.
The second was one of three cases to lift the immunity of a Member, as it happened I think from Spain.
Two of them clearly came through the transmission mechanism where there was no argument on competent authority.
But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it, unlike this request, so it is an inadequate precedent, even if it is a modest step in that direction.
All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position, Madam President.
I believe the undignified delay is the primary cause of all this concern and therefore, if we have political anger, while we are entitled to feel and express that anger, we should direct it at those who have caused the delay: that is most certainly not you and it is not the office of the Presidency of the European Parliament.
Madam President, I do not think that anyone could doubt the uprightness of your actions.
I would just like to inform Chairman BarÃ³n Crespo that, in 1994, when Silvio Berlusconi was Prime Minister with a centre-right coalition, a bill was presented to Parliament, intended to resolve the issue of the conflict of interests - it is right for this House to be aware of this as well - and the proposal was adopted by a section of Parliament.
However, when the political situation changed, the law was not adopted by the other part of Parliament.
On several public occasions, Silvio Berlusconi and the parties supporting his candidacy for Prime Minister announced that, under the new legislature, a government bill would be tabled once again, with the aim of resolving the conflict of interests, and that, as a citizen, Mr Berlusconi would strictly observe this new law once it had been adopted by Parliament.
I would like to end by reminding Mr Manisco that the law is not a protocol formality.
It may be in some countries with which he is particularly concerned but, in Europe and in civilised countries, the law is not a protocol formality.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
We have reached the end of this debate.
I would quickly like to add one last thought, just a short comment, for the benefit of Mrs Frassoni.
I would just like to confirm to her that if the request had concerned Mrs Frassoni, I would have acted in exactly the same way.
However, where there would have been a difference, and I do not think that this will annoy you, is that there would not have been any comments about or contention surrounding my behaviour.
I think that this is precisely the problem, Mrs Frassoni.
I wish to ask your advice on raising this particular issue with the Petitions Committee: I wonder whether that would be in order.
It is about my constituent, Mark Forrester, who was arrested on alleged football hooliganism during the EURO 2000 championships.
He was subjected, and I say subjected with good reason, to the fast-track trial procedure last year, and was convicted: it was then deemed to be unfair and he went for retrial last month.
The conviction was upheld last week.
I believe this fast track trial and the conviction being upheld is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
It is contrary to Articles 47 and 48, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which you, Madam President, signed.
Every EU citizen has the right to a fair trial and should be deemed innocent until proven guilty.
The video evidence that we saw in Court showed that my constituent, Mark Forrester, was not involved in any way, shape or form with any violence.
A further video was offered to the Belgian authorities by the UK police.
The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence.
I believe the decision by the Court was more about propping up the fast-track trial procedure than about justice.
Mark Forrester is innocent and we will carry on that fight to prove that he is innocent and to clear his name.
I hope, Madam President, you will help us in that endeavour.
Thank you, Mrs Lynne.
According to the details of the situation that you have given, I think that the Committee on Petitions could indeed be the appropriate committee, but I suggest that you contact Mr Gemelli who is the Chair of this Committee and who will be able to advise you in full.
Madam President, very soon the European Parliament will vote on public access to documents.
In Ireland, the only country in the European Union which will vote on the Treaty of Nice, I am informed by my constituents that the Irish Government is not providing copies of the Treaty of Nice, but only its White Paper on the Treaty.
Our Government has made clear that it will support a yes vote for the Treaty of Nice, as of course democratically it is allowed to do, but my constituents would like to decide for themselves and would like to have copies of the Treaty itself.
Can you offer any advice in this situation?
Thank you, Mrs Scallon.
We shall see what can be done in order to make this possible.
EU/UN partnership on development and humanitarian issues
Commissioner, please accept my most sincere apologies, but you are a fervent supporter of transparency.
We are aware of the extent to which you defend this value that is indispensable for our democracy and our institution, and so, I shall give you the floor, an hour later than planned, unfortunately, to allow you to give us the communication on the partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues.
Mr President, I welcome the statement.
I am sorry that the discussion about one Member has taken so long that once again the discussion about the poorest countries of the world and how we can more effectively aid them has been relegated and diminished.
I have personally been involved in Europe's support for UNHCR for UN aids.
It is the best quality support.
I totally support what Mr Nielson has said about the financial regulation and given that Members of other committees than the Development Committee are here and are part of the process for agreeing such legislation perhaps he could elaborate on that more.
My questions to him are as follows: first, how will the communication actually change matters on the ground in countries so that in emergency situations better coordination takes place.
Secondly, how will the communication ensure that together we better meet the UN goals on development, for example, halving world poverty by 2015.
Finally, reflecting on his point about United Commissions or United Nations, how far will the Member States go along with this.
Too often in the past they have wanted to keep the European Union and its institutions away from the UN rather than ensuring effective collaboration.
Can he count on their support in achieving this communication?
Mr President, I am delighted to hear what the Commissioner has said about working closely with the United Nations.
Some of the United Nations programmes which deliver on the ground are very effective, and sometimes more effective, than what the European Union has been doing so far.
I want to ask two questions: first, what level of complementarity are you looking at when the Commission is trying to set an arrangement in place to work with the United Nations, or are we merely going to give the United Nations the money they require and they will do the delivery on the floor?
This is a point that has taken prominence in Indonesia and in the Jaffna area of Sri Lanka where the UNHCR has been doing an excellent job in trying to rehabilitate and give support to people.
The second question is really more broadly addressed to Parliament: are we going to set up a permanent standing liaison committee of MEPs involved with development and cooperation to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations each year on our joint cooperation?
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I want to state that, as chairman of Finland' s national UNICEF Committee, I have a special interest in this issue.
Secondly, I note with satisfaction the incredible importance of cooperation on particular themes.
Unfortunately, the feeling in UNICEF is that the organisation has been given assignments to carry out only for as long as there has been no special European organisation that has been able to do so.
As Mr Howitt mentioned, thematic cooperation must include education and the fight against poverty.
I hope that we shall be able to see a significant increase in the EU' s contribution to high-quality education for women and girls.
We know that this has been a topic taken up by the UN, and it will be a topic at the UN' s special session on children in September 2001.
We have obtained a communication from the Commission concerning the EU' s contribution to the conference for the poorest countries, but I wonder: will there also be a communication from the Commission about the efforts being made to prepare for the special session in September 2001?
The EU' s input will be required in this area too.
First to Mr Howitt, we can realistically expect better results on the ground if we look at the ability of being able to fund, for example, UNHCR actions in a more programme-based manner.
If we look at Kosovo, they were given the mandate of coordinating all humanitarian support, but the Commission was not allowed, and would still not be allowed, to do core funding, so they had very great difficulty in defining specific projects that we can legally fund.
But if we can have a broader definition defined by goals of what we can fund, we can make it possible for them to do their essential work of coordinating on the ground better.
We need that also to give security to all the NGOs working in these humanitarian theatres, therefore predictability and better planning is what we can expect from the changes.
As to the larger goals, certainly our influence on policy-making in UN bodies is increased when we have a more normal ongoing discussion instead of the hit-and-run operation of funding a project here and a project there.
To Mr Deva, we will not just give the money.
We are not contemplating core funding.
This is something the owners of the UN organisation, its Member States, should do, but where we are now is inadequate, it is too much split up on individual projects without predictability for the World Food Programme or for UNICEF, as was mentioned.
They need a quality partnership with a major donor like the Commission and, by doing what we are putting forward here, we can bring ourselves into that role.
Finally, for the special meeting in September, the Commission is planning to have a strong presence and make a strong contribution.
Mr President, Commissioner, when we in the Committee on Development and Cooperation heard the person in charge of UNDP speak last year, what I heard him say was: we are extremely competent, give us the money and we will do the rest.
I am pleased that you have adopted a different stance, and are urging us to respect our own priorities.
But I am still left with the big question as to when the key actors will begin to join forces.
UN aid might sound very prestigious, and expectations are high - with good reason, but in practice, too little aid from the UN bodies is filtering down to the smaller players at grassroots level where it could really make a difference.
That is why I not only urge you to look at the big picture when it comes to cooperation with those key players, I also urge you to consider how this work can penetrate down to grassroots level.
Mr President, we have taken good note of this decision by the Commission.
We would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with the Commission before it took the decision.
We were not able to do so, but in any event, I wish to say that we have no objection, in principle, to the idea of closer cooperation, which would lead to more effective and more appropriate action by the European Union.
There is, however, one specific question that I wish to raise, which is both a question and a fear: to what extent will the identity and visibility of the European Union become subordinated as a result of this cooperation, particularly in terms of defining guidelines to follow and, specifically, with regard to the agencies that are really behind all decisions taken in this area, by which I mean the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?
To what extent are we maintaining our independence from these institutions, which, as we know, have become greatly discredited?
Commissioner Nielson's department have produced an excellent communication and programme for action for communicable infectious diseases, HIV Aids, TB and malaria.
It is not possible for the EU to fund that programme alone and therefore I would like to ask, is he going to take the lead in initiating and establishing a global fund in cooperation with the UN and other agencies so that this can be done?
I am the rapporteur for that report and I hope this Parliament will put it on fast track so that it can be debated before the UN international conference on the subject in the third week of June.
I saw a lot of time wasted this afternoon.
This is an important subject and those responsible in this House should put that on the agenda for fast track debate, so Members of this House can debate it and the European Parliament's view can go to that conference for consideration.
To Mrs Maes first, the way we want to move forward is to participate fully as a donor in funding the realisation of sector programmes that are better organised than what we have done so far at country level.
It also has an impact on the demand that UN organisations have to meet, when all donors are more disciplined.
We are also raising the expectation that members of the UN family will play their part more in consultation with other donors: this has worked with the World Bank to a reasonable extent in very recent years and this is the same disciplining.
As regards the humanitarian side, it is quite different.
There, the main reason why we should support the UN instances is that they very often have the special mandate to do things where they have access and where others may have great difficulties.
We are trying to establish a balance using them and NGOs.
The only thing is coordination, but for example UNHCR has a special mandate and we have to be careful not to leave them marginalised.
Mr Miranda, quite frankly the Commission is not proposing anything today, which would surprise those who have been discussing these issues with me over recent years.
This is very much in line with what I have announced as the next logical and necessary step.
We will discuss it and it is important that we try to work out the same kind of well-informed consensus on this step as we managed to do on the overall policy paper.
This is part of implementing those ideas and we will both manage to do things more efficiently, also having more influence.
This ability is fine, but not enough and if it is a visible PR stunt, I prefer the kind of visibility that comes from professional respect and getting real influence on the global scene.
This is what we are aiming at.
Mr Khanbhai, this discussion about the global fund is in one way easy to understand and we can quite sympathetically step up the effort against communicable diseases to the extent that the creation of this fund actually mobilises new and additional money from new private sources.
We welcome it and we may also participate, but the real problem is delivery on the ground.
This is where the UN organisations need to answer our questions more directly and where we have to become better at actually doing things.
This is the bottleneck of the fight against these diseases, not whether we are adding EUR 100 million from money which is already devoted to do this job.
The reality on the ground is the bottleneck and we should never forget this in this discussion.
There are many fashions of the month in the discussion on these issues and I will be quite stubborn, with the support from this House, and stick to what we have defined.
May I thank the Commission for an excellent initiative on our relationship with the UN.
Three short simple questions: how in the Commissioner's analysis do the priorities of the United Nations differ from the priorities of the European Union in terms of the way we believe that humanitarian aid should be delivered?
How will the tensions which I have personally observed be overcome - the tensions which always exist on the ground between the UN and the European Union, and how will the new approach which you intend to adopt, facilitate a better partnership and a lessening of those kind of tensions on the ground?
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the statement he has just made.
One thing is quite clear: unless we get better cooperation between the donors, we will never get rid of the duplication and voids we see in aid.
Does he find already that we are getting better coordination with the United Nations because of what he is doing?
I noticed in the ninth EDF that 90% of the funds will be going to the least developed countries.
Do you think they have the capacity to deal with such a large amount of money?
And if not, are the United Nations organisations helping to build that capacity?
The EU policy is to move towards regional cooperation and integration.
Is that also a policy that the United Nations organisations are following and will support?
Mr President, Commissioner, I thought your Communication was interesting and I would like to ask you two questions.
This initiative for partnership between the Commission and United Nations bodies is important, in my opinion, as long as it is not detrimental to European development and humanitarian aid policies, the design and implementation of which are subject to the democratic control of this House.
I would therefore urge you that it should not be limited to giving or supplying funds or delegating responsibilities to a bigger partner, but that this responsibility should also be monitored.
My second question refers to the identity of Community aid, which is one of our fundamental pillars and which is focused on the non-governmental sector.
I would like this aid to continue, and in this respect I am concerned about the relationship that NGOs often have with United Nations bodies.
How will this continue to be organised or coordinated?
First to Mrs Kinnock, as I said before, in the area of humanitarian aid the organisational problems and the challenges on how to do things are not as complex as when we look at the transitional phase and general phase.
The tensions on the ground - here I would respond also Mrs Sauquillo's question concerning the relation between NGOs and UN organisations - have very often been a big problem.
Things are better now than they used to be.
There is more of an acceptance of the need for a professional manner of work also among humanitarian NGOs, and of the need and the obligation to accept coordination as part of our contracts with anybody we are funding.
So from case to case it looks somewhat better today.
I have already mentioned protection and security.
In Chechnya, the access to using radios has been discussed with the Russian government since the troubles started and only now is it possible to have that additional little element of security, but without the UN being there as those who can actually handle this part of the whole work, no one would ever get permission to have radios.
This is good and clear and this is being discussed now more and more internationally.
This is one of the aspects I mentioned in connection with the special mandate of some of these global UN organisations so we need a division of labour between specialised NGOs and the umbrella, in some cases, of UN organisations.
As a very large humanitarian donor, we need to be able to play on all the instruments available and by entering into a more structured relationship as we are foreseeing now, we shall also have a stronger voice in the discussion on these issues with the UN organisations, compared to just an on-and-off donor.
To Mr Corrie, the figure of how much we are allocating in the ninth European Development Fund of 90% covers both the least developed countries and the low-income group of countries.
It is these two added together which is the 90%.
On capacity building we need everybody who is able to do it, UNDP, World Bank and ourselves: this is such a big job that we should not even think of doing everything ourselves.
Let me remind Parliament that in the overall development policy paper, we have specified areas of special focus, which also means that we will frankly have to rely on others doing more in the areas where we will do less, and we have Member States who will and can do this.
But we also have the global system and it is in order not to exclude that type of partnership that we are doing what we are now.
Regional cooperation: we are using very clearly the Economic Commission for Africa and the other relevant UN players and they are extremely interested in the bold, ambitious line followed by the Commission in trying to organise the geo-economics especially of Africa.
We have a good partnership in this and good support.
Finally, that part of Mrs Sauquillo's question dealing more or less with visibility and clarity of our policy.
This is the self-confidence.
We could also look at this the other way around: we have now reached the point where we have some certainty and clarity and strong support for the line that we have defined.
Now we feel we have the strength and maturity to discuss more globally with the UN system.
We were not that organised before in this field, so we are increasing the ambition of influencing what goes on globally, and this is the thought behind it.
Mr President, Mrs Sauquillo was right to question the inspection procedure with regard to the way in which the Union' s money is spent.
The first inspection is carried out at the General Assembly which is held between September and December.
I should like to ask the Commission how this is done at the moment.
Does the European Commission fulfil a coordinating role at that Assembly?
Has anybody been especially appointed to carry out this task, and is this inspection carried out effectively in concert with the 15 Member States at this General Assembly?
I take a keen interest in this matter because I was Dutch representative working on this General Assembly in the 1970s.
My second question relates to the United Nations' refugee work.
I know that resources have been cut considerably in this respect.
The present High Commissioner for refugees has already paid a call on the Commissioner to see if matters could take a turn for the better.
Does this new alliance with the United Nations also mean a financial improvement for the work of the UN' s refugee organisation?
This would indeed be good news for the new High Commissioner.
Mr President, in welcoming the Commissioner's commitment to working with the UN agencies, can I ask him if he agrees with Kofi Annan that there can be no economic health without physical and mental health, and will he work with the agencies, particularly WHO and UNICEF, to achieve that.
We have heard a lot today and we will rightly hear a lot more about one of the biggest challenges, Aids: two days ago, Kofi Annan was appealing to the world to play a bigger part in this.
But there are other illnesses: TB, malaria, river blindness and the mental and neurological health area which this year was designated by the WHO as its key area.
Will he bring forward to this Parliament plans to do more work in that area?
Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability.
For example, there are more people with epilepsy than with Aids - 40 million people live with it, but only 8 million of those 40 million are treated for it.
That is a disgrace to the world.
We can do more.
Will he commit this Parliament, this Union, and this Commission to do more as well.
First to Mrs Maij-Weggen, it is not the role of the Commission to coordinate the Member States in the UN General Assembly, that is their job.
In general, what the EU Member States are doing in the political negotiating processes in the General Assembly is quite well coordinated.
However, when we move into the boards of the different UN organisations the level of coordination is lower, and this is where we, as a Commission, have a real presence in terms of being more of a practical partner, very much in line with what Member States are themselves, but where we have no voice except in a very few cases, namely the FAO.
We are not asking for a new legal basis.
We are asking for a closer partnership.
We do not need it, but it would be nice if it were to grow over time into a role where we play a more visual political role.
We will gain political influence by the changes we are suggesting, but it is a matter of process and achievement.
As regards the money I mentioned, the control issue: given the existing legal framework for how we can spend money, this is one of the few outstanding issues being discussed with the UN organisations before we can renew and improve the framework agreement on how we do things practically.
This is the final round of the war of accountants, but it is in fact still on.
We need a little more responsiveness from the UN organisations to give access to our auditors and controllers to follow our money, to open up in a manner which is comparable to what we have obtained with the World Bank.
The big thing is that to work well in a normal partnership, we should not insist on having everything done according to our rules.
If it is good enough for a Member State to do this together with a UN organisation and have its reporting accepted, it should be good enough for the European Union to do basically the same.
But we can only do this when we have the financial regulation changed.
Until then we are in the terrain we have described in this communication and there is ample room for improvement on how to do things.
I hope we will in this way be able to build up confidence and thus stimulate efficiency.
Mr Bowis, I agree that the issue of mental health is a very large one.
I would add other sorts of disabilities which, in a very poor environment, are often totally ignored.
From a human point of view this needs more attention.
In the humanitarian phase, we are now giving much more attention to the psychological aspects of the victims, not only children and women, but in general: it is quite clear that the demobilisation of soldiers is impossible without addressing the psychological aspects.
I am very pleased that you mentioned TB and malaria as diseases that we need to give the same emphasis as Aids.
This is another aspect we have tried to include in our communication and the programme of action on these communicable diseases.
This is as important as sticking to the line of giving prevention absolute priority.
We are trying to keep the broad picture of all these diseases at the top of the agenda.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Request for the waiver of Peter Sichrovsky's immunity
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0124/2001) by Mr Zimeray on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Peter Sichrovsky.
- (FR) Mr President, the case involving Mr Sichrovsky is probably the most sensitive that we have had to deal with in the course of our mandate, both because of reasons relating to procedure but also, and more importantly, because of the background to the matter.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the principles that have guided us in writing this report and which are, as we have seen in the previous debate, fundamental to this Parliament.
The first principle that must hold sway here is to disregard, as far as possible, all public opinion when we have to deal with a report on a request for the waiver of immunity, as well as to abstain, as far as possible, from judging or prejudging the Member of Parliament involved, something that is not always easy.
The second principle is that we must always act in accordance with the law, with respect for both the law of the Member State and also what is becoming parliamentary law, for substantive rules and formal rules, which imposes a strict obligation upon us to be consistent with decisions we have made in the past.
We must also focus solely on the charge laid against the Member, and this is a principle that cannot be violated.
This is a particularly important point in the case involving Mr Sichrovsky and I shall come back to this in a moment.
Finally, when there is some doubt, the doubt must always work in the favour of the accused, of the Member of Parliament whose immunity we are being asked to waive.
In the case of Mr Sichrovsky, therefore, as in all cases, I believe that it is important to reiterate the principle of immunity and the reasons for its existence.
Immunity is not a privilege granted to an individual Member of Parliament.
Its role is to protect: not to protect an individual, but rather to protect the institution through the individual concerned.
I must say that the case involving Mr Sichrovsky and those that we shall deal with in a moment have arisen in situations where information has been flowing freely, which explains why we have an increasing number of slander and libel cases. We have also entered into a democracy of opinion and a situation in which life and public life, in particular, are penalised, and I am taking this opportunity to reiterate that civil laws also exist to sue for alleged damages, particularly where the damages have been caused by a press article or by slander, and I think that we must take this opportunity to reiterate that immunity does not mean impunity, it is a suspension of the criminal law procedure, which does not, to any extent, prevent criminal proceedings being instigated during the mandate of the Member of Parliament.
In the case of Mr Sichrovsky, who, I must remind you, has been accused for having described the President of the Jewish community in Vienna as an 'idiot' , an 'aggressive, irascible, incredibly mean' and 'spiteful person' , a 'professional Jew' who 'would take advantage of his dead parents to appear on television' .
Naturally, one would think that these words constitute an incitement to racial hatred and to anti-Semitism.
I personally refuse to contemplate this theory for the simple reason that he is not being charged with this crime, and in these circumstances, I think that we must not allow ourselves to substitute the crime against him with another.
We were able to carry out a detailed analysis of the case within the Committee on Legal Affairs and this was a detailed investigation of the case over the course of several meetings, since this case has been before the Committee on Legal Affairs on three or four occasions. This investigation showed that these words, even if they were pointed, however excessive or hateful they may seem, were spoken in a political context and in response to criticism of which Mr Sichrovsky himself was a target and to criticism regarding his political affiliation on the basis of his religious beliefs.
His political position on the basis of his religious affiliation, in other words.
That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has taken the view, as it has in similar cases, namely those involving Portuguese Members of Parliament, that there was a link, albeit tenuous, between what he said and his political affiliation and political views.
However, this link does not, of course, apply to everything that was said but I think we should accept that all of Mr Sichrovsky' s words form a whole, and that the privilege of immunity should therefore be granted to him.
Mr President, we certainly endorse and support the outcome reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, presented to us by Mr Zimeray, because our Parliamentary immunity must be such as to allow us to use expressions, albeit as moderate as possible, of course, on political matters in every speech that politicians have to make in various different circumstances, whether they are made live on public occasions or reported through the general media.
I would like to take this opportunity, Mr President, to point out certain aspects of immunity, all or, at any rate, some of which I would like to explore in greater detail, despite the fact that they have already been mentioned by Mr Zimeray.
As we always state in the reports of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, our Parliamentary immunity is a European immunity and is therefore independent of national procedures. That is because this institution, the only European institution to be elected by universal suffrage, must be independent of any other European institution, as we always state in our reports.
In reality, however, we adhere to the clear provisions of the Treaties, the Rules of Procedure and the Statute of Parliament, with the result that this is not the case.
I will develop this point in my forthcoming speeches.
In any case, I endorse what was said in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market: we recommend that the immunity of the Member in question should not be waived.
Mr President, like the previous speakers, I believe that we should use the Sichrovsky case, which we are discussing today, as an opportunity to go beyond matters of pure routine and to reflect on the logic or otherwise of parliamentary immunity.
The historical roots of this concept, that is to say the protection of the free mandate of Members against interference from what originally were often still very much monarchy-led authorities, now only serve as a partial justification for the institution of immunity.
There must be no doubt that when it comes to statements made as a direct consequence of exercising our mandate or in connection with votes in this House, immunity, sometimes referred to as indemnity, needs to be fully guaranteed in practice.
However, in cases involving actions and statements with very tenuous political connections, and in particular where protection against prosecution by the state is not involved, but rather the rights of fellow citizens in relation to Members, then we are pushing at the limits of the legitimacy of blanket immunity. In such cases, there is a risk that immunity becomes a privilege.
If we in the European Parliament - in contrast to many national parliaments - still grant such wide-ranging protection, then every single Member should behave in such a way that we are justified in maintaining this practice.
The generosity of this Parliament, which is rooted in fundamental considerations in this case too, which is as it should be, therefore also benefits those Members who belong to parties which do not take the protection of freedom of expression and freedom of information very seriously at home.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can only tell you what Rule 6 of our Rules of Procedure says on this point: "Without prejudice to Rule 122, the Member whose immunity is subject to the request for a waiver shall not speak in the debate."
I am just telling you that, so that we all have the same information.
Thank you very much for your understanding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Request for the waiver of Johannes Voggenhuber's immunity
The next item is the report (A5-0124/2001) by Mr Zimeray on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Voggenhuber.
Mr President, to continue what I was saying earlier, in actual fact, as we have seen in this Chamber, we very often find ourselves talking about immunity or about requests for waiver of immunity, according to procedures, application methods and characteristics which differ according to the origins or allegiance, whether national or political - more national than political if the truth be known, of each of us.
Today, someone has raised this issue, which seemed to me, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, never to have been analysed before.
I feel that Parliament and the Presidency must make further endeavours - and we are doing - and reach a speedy conclusion on the matter for the difficulties that arise from the different laws of the nations to which we belong do not, when it comes down to it, make all the Members subject to the same conditions.
In the case in point - as Mr Zimeray very rightly said - the Committee on Legal Affairs expressed a unanimous vote on the matter.
It is true that, in politics, there is sometimes exaggeration, very often personal comments are made, and we have witnessed precisely that in this Chamber today.
However, we remain democratically of the opinion that, however strong the expressions used by each Member of Parliament, each politician, may be, they must be considered to be political actions - although I do not mean that Parliament must not cover up for individuals - and therefore, in order to protect Parliament, immunity must not be waived.
On behalf of the PPE, I therefore endorse the proposal of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, while making it clear that, if comments on the personal affairs and private, personal lives of all of us - which, I regret to say, are often made, as the international press is doing at present - could be avoided, it would be much better and would certainly be an indication of more democratic, more correct political behaviour.
Mr President, for a long time now, one thing that we have been able to rely on in Austria's domestic political scene is the Freedom Party and JÃ¶rg Haider bombarding their critics - the media in general, individual journalists, other politicians and also individual members of the public - with lawsuits.
The current Minister for Justice has in the past appeared in court in connection with some of these cases in his capacity as a lawyer.
Many of the legal judgments handed down are most interesting, because Austria's judges can now at least still display sufficient independence.
Not long ago, for example, it was established at appeal in the case brought by JÃ¶rg Haider against the university professor Anton Pelinka, which also attracted international attention, that the statement that the Freedom Party was playing down Nazi atrocities was permissible.
We would also have expected a similar clarification of a fundamental point in the case of the lawsuit brought by JÃ¶rg Haider against our fellow Member Johannes Voggenhuber, by which I mean establishing whether or not the Freedom Party is a fascist, neo-fascist, or post-fascist party.
In order to establish the facts of the matter, Johannes Voggenhuber, in contrast to his colleague Mr Sichrovsky, has himself asked for his immunity to be waived.
However, for reasons of principle, which I support, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unable to accede to this request.
Nevertheless, I hope that it will be possible to achieve legal clarification of the nature of the Freedom Party in some other way.
I would now like to use my remaining speaking time to point out that I am amazed that the report on the Sichrovsky case as adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was amended before it reached the plenary, so that in many places it is no longer as clear as when it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, Mr Voggenhuber has presented us with a serious problem, calling JÃ¶rg Heider a fascist and his party a neo-fascist party.
Mr. Voggenhuber himself hopes his parliamentary immunity might be waived, as he has very persuasively shown our group that this is a matter of standing up for freedom of speech, which is something he wishes to be involved in.
He therefore wants to fight verbally against this sort of fascist party and its leader, and he would not want parliamentary immunity to be a barrier to this.
Consequently, I have to inform you, Mr President, that, unlike the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, my group will respect Mr Voggenhuber' s wishes, as it considers them to be totally justified, and will recommend that his parliamentary immunity be waived.
This does by no means imply that we should question the principles adhered to by the Committee on Legal Affairs or the fact that it should stand to its principles, but in this case we consider that there are good reasons why Parliament can best safeguard its own independence by accepting this challenge Mr Heider has issued to Mr Voggenhuber.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Request for the waiver of Elisabeth Jeggle's immunity
The next item is the report (A5-0216/2001) by Mr MacCormick on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Elisabeth Jeggle [2001/2031(IMM)].
Mr President, the previous two cases we have considered dealt with issues of free speech and the conditions of maintaining robust political debate.
This case raises no such issue.
It is a case concerning a traffic violation, as the second to last paragraph on page 10 of my report says, "the charge against Mrs Jeggle relates to the offence of dangerous driving since it is alleged that when driving her car on 4 May 1999 she acted recklessly and in gross violation of road traffic regulations by overtaking another vehicle at a point that did not afford sufficient visibility to do so."
We are not in any sense called upon to form a judgment on the truth or falsity of these allegations or on Mrs Jeggle's conduct.
We are called upon only to decide whether an allegation and a trial on a matter of this kind attracts parliamentary immunity which ought not to be waived.
The German authorities have rightly halted proceedings which were already quite far advanced on learning that Mrs Jeggle had been elected to this Parliament and in due course sent a request to Parliament for Mrs Jeggle's immunity to be waived.
We come up here against what I regard as an extremely important principle: that we elected politicians ought to enjoy no special privileges over our fellow citizens.
Members of a democratic assembly of this kind should only not be subjected to harassment or persecution for carrying out their duties.
We are agreed, Mrs Jeggle as fully and firmly as anybody else, that traffic offences are not covered by that principle and that Parliament should never claim immunity for any of its Members on a matter of this kind.
Mrs Jeggle has passed to me word through another colleague that she is unable to be present in the House this afternoon and she wanted to assure me, and the House, that this is no intentional discourtesy on her part but an unavoidable conflict of obligations.
I am very happy to pass that assurance on, because it certainly has been the case that at no point in the discussion of this matter has she in any way deviated from the view which I am putting to the House.
This is not a case where Parliament should insist on a Member's immunity and I have no hesitation at all in reporting to the House the unanimous view of the Committee on Legal Affairs that immunity ought in this case to be waived on the request of the German authorities.
Mr President, of course we too endorse the opinion expressed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on this request for waiver of immunity; that is, we support the rapporteur's proposal.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the previous speaker - not the rapporteur, the Member who spoke before him - that the immunity is Parliamentary immunity, not immunity of the individual Members, that the European Parliament expresses its self-protection through its Members and that the will of the Members who find that they are the subject of a request for waiver of immunity has no bearing on the situation, because each one of us represents the entire Parliament, not himself or herself.
A Member's wish to relinquish immunity therefore has no effect: this is the custom and this is the written rule, and political expressions or, in any case, political activity - I repeat it is the custom - cannot be subjected to any type of judgment.
Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed a clear opinion in these three cases: it has already expressed this opinion in the past and I am sure that it will do so again in the future, simply because it is now consolidated practice.
Outside this Chamber, certainly no one could think or maintain that Parliament could be condemned for performing activities which are clearly and explicitly political.
The refusal to uphold immunity in this case, and therefore the committee's proposal to waive immunity for something which has nothing to do with politics, is proof of consistency.
I would like to make a brief point, Mr President, that, in Mrs Jeggle' s case, there is nothing to prevent parliamentary immunity being waived, even more so because the events, which today justify such a request, took place before Mrs Jeggle was elected to the European Parliament and they bear no relation, either direct or indirect, to her political activities.
I will, however, briefly comment on what the two previous speakers said. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, I believe, unanimous in its support of this outcome also because, although the offence was, admittedly, serious, there were, as far as I am aware, no victims, and because given the nature of this offence, Mrs Jeggle does not run any real risk of being imprisoned or prevented from exercising her mandate.
Having also taken this into consideration, the Committee decided, rightly in my view, to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Jeggle.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.a.m.
Public access to documents
The next item is the report (A5-0318/2001) by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]
, rapporteur. In November last year, I presented my report on public access to the EU institutions' documents, a subject which, as I said then, I consider crucial to the lives of the people we represent and to the future of the Union.
I am happy to say that I stand before you today to ask Parliament to endorse a compromise text, as this House requested of me in November 2000.
I, Hanja Maij-Weggen, my ex-co-rapporteur, and all the draftsmen of opinions and some shadows for the other Committees embarked on a series of meetings with the Council and the Commission, latterly called trialogues, in order to reach this compromise.
All the various versions of the compromise text during the trialogue processes were discussed in public meetings.
Indeed, the trialogue process, it can be argued, has been more transparent than a conciliation process, in which only final texts of negotiations are published.
The negotiations were not always easy and, contrary to what some believe, the distance between our institutions in January was great, but we fought hard to maintain what we considered to be essential elements to ensure the rights of the citizens.
Of course the text does not go as far as we would have liked.
I am the first to admit that, but it was a priority for me and my co-rapporteur Hanja Maij-Weggen to complete the dossier in line with the Treaty deadline, so that the institutions could not be accused of failing to deliver for the citizen under Article 232 of the Treaty.
The standpoints of the three institutions were difficult to reconcile in such a short space of time and even the Council, under the wonderful Swedish Presidency, found it difficult to achieve a political consensus, or at least a qualified majority, within itself.
Nonetheless, we have a text which improves on and consolidates the status quo and delivers to the citizen, within the time frame set in the Amsterdam Treaty, a comprehensive and practical framework for access to the institutions' documents.
It is by no means a step backwards.
We have established a self-evolving text which, I am sure, will be improved upon in the course of time.
The compromise text revolutionises the rights and procedures for access to documents of the institutions and sets in motion the enshrining of freedom of information in the EU and in Member States' national legislation.
It is the first common framework for the three institutions which recognises the citizen's rights so that the citizen no longer relies on the goodwill of each Institution.
Access to documents regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable, stimulates greater efficiency and enhances democracy.
The text would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Swedish Presidency.
I would like to take this opportunity to also pay tribute to the remarkable work on this dossier that they have contributed and to that of my co-rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and Graham Watson, Chair of the LIBE Committee.
Of course there are some cases when documents from the institutions should not be released into the public domain.
Indeed, it is part of our responsibility as deputies of this Parliament to protect the security of our citizens and the institutions.
MEPs have a responsibility to ensure the vital interests of the Union are protected by improving its internal security, whilst at the same time balancing the citizens' rights of access.
This new regime means that every document is considered on a case-by-case basis without blanket exceptions and documents concerning security and defence are by no means excluded from the Regulation.
Under this compromise text, the Council is obliged to repeal or amend the Solana Decision of August 2000 so that it conforms to the principles of this Regulation.
There is assumption in favour of access to the public for all documents in all areas of the Union's activities and access will only be denied to those in areas which directly relate to a listed exception.
It has to be shown that such an exception is necessary and the disclosure would cause harm.
The exceptions are therefore discretionary, not mandatory.
If access is refused to the citizen, the citizen must be given the reason for refusal and there is recourse to the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice.
Virtually all documents will be placed on a public register.
Documents from third parties will be accessible for the first time and agencies or bodies created by the institutions will also apply the Regulation.
If a document is excepted, or parts of the document are excepted, those parts of the document which are not excepted will be made public, and the exceptions will only apply for a limited maximum of thirty years, except in some cases.
Finally, each Institution will produce an annual report outlining where the Institution refused access and the number of sensitive documents not recorded in the register, thus ensuring a continuing review by the European Parliament, and the Commission will also report by January 2004 on the implementation of the principles in the Regulation, thereby offering another opportunity to refine and develop access.
Finally, this is not the end of the beginning.
This is one small step on the road to access to documents and ensuring that the European Project is accountable to its citizens.
Mr President, Mrs Lejon, Commissioner, today is a joyful day for the citizens of the European Union.
After years of sabotage and delay, there is now a Regulation before us which addresses public access to the EU institutions.
This European Parliament has pressed for this to happen for years.
Since 1979, I have been one of the MEPs who repeatedly put the need for public access on the agenda, even when I was allowed to sit on the European Council of Ministers.
Indeed, public access is directly linked to the democratic content of an institution and guards a government body from underhand politics, nepotism and financial irregularities.
When this proposal was submitted by the European Commission last year, it left a great deal to be desired.
The French Council proposal, which appeared subsequently, was not acceptable either.
In November, our Parliament tabled its proposal with a huge majority.
Since then, intense negotiations have taken place among the three institutions. In this respect, Parliament was a great support for the Swedish Presidency.
This coalition, which has, step-by-step, brought the Council and Commission closer to Parliament' s position, has proved to be very fruitful.
The outcome was a considerably improved text in which Parliament' s key points were adopted.
I would like to quote seven as these proved crucial to our positive stance vis-Ã -vis this compromise.
Firstly, Article 4, the most important article, which articulates the limitations of public access, has been cut down to size and the limitations are tied down to conditions.
A reason for secrecy should be given at all times, and there is an opportunity to appeal to the Ombudsman or the European court.
In the case of huge public interest, documents are to be disclosed nevertheless.
That was a key element for our Parliament.
Secondly, the term "document" should be taken in a broad sense.
Electronic mail also falls under this heading.
Thirdly, a register will be introduced after all, in which all documents need to be included with attendant details and which must be published on the Internet.
Fourthly, the Union' s agencies, such as the European Environment Bureau, the European Trade Mark Office and Europol, will fall within the remit of the Regulation.
This will happen in the near future thanks to a new act which has now been promised.
Fifthly, national legislation which goes beyond this Regulation - and this is a sensitive area for the country that I come from - should not be hindered by this Regulation.
This is clearly stipulated in recital 16.
I should like to see it explained accordingly.
Sixthly, the rules which Mr Solana imposed last year in August without any consultation now fall under this Regulation and will also be verified against the same.
The Netherlands has already noted that the appeal at the Court of Justice can then be withdrawn, and I believe that the European Parliament could follow suit.
Finally, an annual report will be drafted, and the Commission will need to compile an evaluation report with proposals for improvement before 2004.
Is this Regulation now perfect?
No, quite a few areas could be honed down further, such as the handling of documents of third parties, and the registration of secret documents, as well as a number of other issues.
However, in our opinion, it is better to grant approval now and to tighten the rules in two years' time, should this prove useful and necessary.
If we were to overhaul the Regulation now, we would end up in a long-term codecision procedure.
Moreover, we are familiar with this procedure: the Council could put us out of action if the European Commission were not to lend us their support.
I am not expecting the Commission to do this, but you never know.
All that remains for me now is to express my thanks to my fellow MEPs who have helped us over the course of last year to achieve this result.
I should first like to thank Mr Cashman.
He has done a sterling job, but that is also true of Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld and of the other draftsmen of opinions.
I would also like to thank Mrs Dean who, as Parliament official, has carried out much of the work on our behalf.
I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency, of course. I am convinced that, without the cooperation with the Swedish Presidency, we would not have achieved the result that is now before us, one that can withstand any criticism.
Finally, we should be acutely aware of what is at issue: democracy, transparency and the rights of the citizens.
That is the most important aspect, that is what this is all about, and this Regulation constitutes a step forward in this respect.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. (FI) Mr President, in the debate on transparency it is worth stating right away that we are not starting from scratch, as rules on public access to information have been in force in the institutions of the European Union since around 1993.
Therefore, the only true point of comparison is this: will we be improving the situation as it is now by means of these new rules?
We also have to take into account the fact that the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have, over the years, been improving the rules in force on public access to documents and making them much more specific.
For this thanks go to all those active NGOs and individuals that have refused to believe that the institutions can deny them access to certain documents, and that have sought to appeal against such negative decisions.
When to this we add the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam guarantees the right - in its broadest possible sense - to have access to documents of the Union institutions, we could say that the existing basic framework is quite demanding.
With regard to the matter in hand, it is my opinion that the acceptance of this compromise raises certain questions.
The European Parliament should have insisted on using its powers to repair the defects of this compromise.
I will most probably be accused of being a fanatical transparency activist, but I refuse to accept this and I refute the charge. I simply want to describe to you now how I think Parliament should have bided its time and continued the debate.
First of all, it is worth mentioning that these talks during the Swedish Presidency have been going on in camera.
The European Parliament should really be very careful about when it becomes involved in an accelerated codecision procedure such as this, as it tends to forsake the issue of transparency to a considerable degree.
Parliament has often been able to bring pressure on the Council of Ministers to make improvements to their proposals in accordance with its own objectives through various stages of the codecision procedure.
With regard to restrictions on time, it is a fact that the institutions - including Parliament - wasted quite a lot of time, which could have been successfully spent in the successive stages of the codecision procedure, where Parliament often makes considerable gains towards the end.
In this regard I have found that the Swedish Presidency has perhaps created a sort of Stockholm syndrome, and that Parliament' s negotiators maybe took the claim that only Sweden could bring this matter to a creditable conclusion too literally.
I myself have no reason to doubt that Belgium, for example, would rate as well as anyone else in the transparency stakes, and that it is learning all the time to respect the issue more and more. I therefore believe we would easily have been able to continue.
I would like to illustrate certain problems with this Regulation by showing you a small object.
This is a Russian wooden doll.
This one possibly has a rather ugly face: perhaps it should have a more beautiful one as we are talking about transparency.
Let us imagine that this doll is the Regulation on transparency in question.
When we open up the doll we find new dolls inside. This is just how these rules work.
Inside the regulation on transparency there is also a sort of shadow regulation that the Council has managed to smuggle in, saying that there is a whole pile of documents labelled as 'sensitive' , which are covered by quite separate rules from those we have written into the paragraphs of the Article relating to transparency.
When it is being said here that this Regulation on transparency repeals the so-called Solana Decision I can state that this is not the case at all, but in fact there are more new rules to be found in it, helping to ensure that the Solana Decision is incorporated in this Regulation in a new form.
And, at the end, who do we find but Mr Solana himself!
This is thus a question of these sensitive documents making it possible for the Council of Ministers in particular to conceal a large number of documents.
I think it a pity that the European Parliament did not challenge the Council of Ministers a little more forcefully on this issue.
For that we would have required rather more time, rather more transparency and some measure of public debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a day I should not have dared to hope for: to be able to stand before you at this decisive moment.
The European Parliament' s part-session for today and tomorrow is an important event for the institutions and Member States of the European Union. Above all, however, the meeting is an important event for the citizens of Europe.
At this meeting, Parliament will have the opportunity to take a decisive step in the work on bringing the European Union closer to its citizens.
For the first time in what will soon be the EU' s fifty-year history, the adoption of Treaty-based rules on public access to Parliament' s, the Council' s and the Commission' s documents is within the bounds of possibility.
I want to thank the European Parliament for its energetic and persistent work on establishing new and better rules on transparency.
In the process, I have had the great satisfaction of meeting a number of you personally, and I know what major contributions many of you have made on this important issue.
Far too many citizens in today' s EU find the administration of the EU' s institutions dusty, old-fashioned and unduly bureaucratic.
To overcome this, we need a modern, effective and efficient EU in which people' s participation and access to documents is the obvious basis for all the work done.
There are different ways of improving transparency in the EU' s institutions, but far and away the best and most effective way is to have generous rules concerning access to documents, combined with open registers.
Such rules increase public confidence in the institutions and make it possible for people to participate in the decision-making process.
The air is cleared when everyone knows that all the documentation concerning the decision-making process can be inspected and, as a rule, is also accessible.
The European Parliament emphasised the importance of greater transparency in the EU' s institutions early on.
Parliament' s resolution from January 1999 described its significance by saying that the trend towards greater transparency and public scrutiny of documents is of fundamental importance if the EU is to be successful in the future, because it helps clarify the EU' s political choices, promotes a more extensive and better balanced input into the political process, reduces the level of corruption and abuse of power and generally promotes a greater acceptance of EU decisions among the people of Europe.
It is my conviction that the European Parliament' s resolution set a standard for the implementation work which has now been completed and which the Commission in particular was forced to take into account when it devised its proposal for a Regulation.
For example, Parliament' s statement made it impossible in practice to exempt documents received by the institutions from the requirement that they be publicly accessible.
I am speaking here today as a representative of the Council, but I am also a cabinet minister in the Swedish Government.
When the treaty concerning Sweden' s, and a number of other countries' , membership of the EU was signed in Corfu in June 1994, the European Council stated that the new Member States were at the forefront of open government and public access to documents and it welcomed the further stimulus that the new Member States could provide on these issues.
Sweden has tried to fulfil these hopes, partly by taking the initiative, during the previous intergovernmental conference, to incorporate fundamental rules concerning transparency and public control of documents into the EU Treaties.
As the country holding the Presidency during the first six months of this year, we believe that we have an obligation to do everything in our power to head up the work on implementing those rules which were in fact incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Treaty of Amsterdam established people' s right to study the European Parliament' s, the Council' s and the Commission' s documents.
It means that people are entitled under the Treaty to be given access to these documents.
The new rules now to be discussed by Parliament will be much more stable and have much more of an effect than the current rules, which the institutions can change or even repeal unilaterally whenever they wish.
The work over the last few months has been very intensive.
All the parties involved have invested an enormous amount of time and resources in establishing sound rules on transparency.
Parliament' s representatives, in particular, have campaigned vigorously and persistently for such rules.
I particularly wish to thank the committee chairman, Mr Watson, the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, and Commissioner Barnier.
There are a number of reasons why both Parliament and the Swedish Presidency have put such intensive effort into pressing on with the negotiations.
First and foremost, there was a political commitment to have the new rules on transparency ready by May of this year.
We consequently have an obligation to do everything that can be done to fulfil these expectations.
Ultimately, it is the EU' s credibility that is at stake.
The Council and Parliament must show people that efforts really are being made to establish sound rules within the period promised.
Secondly, new and better provisions are needed.
As standards, the rules with which people have had to be content until now are of low status because they are founded upon the institutions' internal rules of procedure and have major gaps in them.
For example, the rules do not include documents submitted to the institutions. Nor is there any right to obtain parts of documents.
Of the institutions, it is as yet only the Council that has set up a public register, and the current rules mean that obtaining documents is time-consuming.
Another example of gaps in the current rules is the fact that the list of reasons for secrecy is not exhaustive.
The proposal on which Parliament is to adopt a position is a clear improvement upon the current legal position.
It is a proposal of its time.
In many cases, documents will be accessible directly via the Internet.
The European Parliament has been demanding this for a long time, and this demand is now met in the new proposal.
It will also be possible, just as before, for documents to be handed over upon written request.
The time which the institutions now have in which to respond to a request has been cut back.
Access must be provided as soon as possible, and no later than within 15 working days.
The institutions are obliged to give citizens all the help they need in order to acquaint themselves with documents.
In those cases in which international law may allow still greater public access to documents in certain areas, for example the right to environmental information under the Ãrhus Convention, the proposed new rules will not prevent this.
Another improvement is that the new rules apply to all the institutions' documents.
No exception is made for certain categories of document, for example documents relating to defence or security issues.
This improvement is also a result of the European Parliament' s initiative.
Naturally, the new rules on this point are designed in such a way as to guarantee secrecy in those cases in which this is justified for defence or security reasons.
The compromise text on which Parliament has now to adopt a position therefore constitutes progress towards a citizens' Europe and progress for democracy.
The new rules will markedly improve citizens' access to EU documents.
I am convinced that, in the long term, the new rules will also mean significantly positive changes to the institutions' administrative culture and to officials' relationship with the general public.
Through the new rules, the European Union will gain increased public confidence and acquire increased democratic legitimacy.
Access to the institutions' documents is the lever that is required if these objectives are to be attained.
As the country holding the Presidency, our task has not been to import either Swedish or other Member States' national rules on the public accessibility of documents into the institutions.
Rather, our task has been to combine the best in the various Member States' administrative cultures and historical experience, taking account of the institutions' own experiences and need for special adjustments.
This is a task in which, in the Council and together with the Commission and representatives of Parliament, we have succeeded, and it is now up to Parliament finally to adopt a position on a text which is the result of 15 months' hard, intensive and ultimately fruitful negotiations.
However good the new rules may be, they must be adapted little by little to new requirements.
It is therefore excellent that, in the course of the negotiations, the European Parliament should have taken the initiative to include a provision whereby the new rules are to be monitored and evaluated.
According to the proposal, the Commission must by 31 January 2004 at the latest - in good time for the next parliamentary election - present a comprehensive report on how the rules on transparency have operated in practice.
Anyone who has followed the dramatic negotiations of the last few weeks knows that the proposal for a Regulation, which has come about through the way in which all the institutions concerned have accepted responsibility, is balanced on a knife-edge.
I am convinced that this part-session has the potential to go down in history as the meeting at which Parliament took advantage of a unique opportunity to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.
It is also an historic decision because it is not now the Member States at an Intergovernmental Conference but the institutions themselves which are taking responsibility for the future of the European Union.
The very fact that the institutions managed to agree about an issue on which it was uniquely difficult to negotiate but which was crucial to public confidence in the EU - and to have done so within the period promised in the Treaty of Amsterdam - provides hope for the future, in my opinion.
It is now up to the European Parliament to decide.
I am convinced that future generations of Europeans will remember what happened on 2 and 3 May 2001.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of clear rules for public access to documents is absolutely essential, both in terms of the proper functioning of the Community institutions and also, as has just been mentioned, in order to reinforce the institutions' democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the European Union' s citizens.
The Commission therefore believes that the draft regulation before us today is of particular importance and significance.
Mrs Lejon, I would like to say how pleased I am to see that following many months of intensive work, the representatives of the three institutions have managed to draw up a text, which I believe is both clear and balanced, and which been approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of this Parliament, the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States and the Commission itself.
It is now the task of Parliament to deliver a completely independent opinion on the outcome of this work.
At this point, Mr President, I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and the co-rapporteurs, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Hautala, Mr Watson, the Chairman and the members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, for the work they have carried out over 15 or 16 months and for the receptive and tenacious attitude that they have shown.
I would also like to praise the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, and you yourself, Mrs Lejon and your whole team, which has tried successfully to reconcile differing points of view, which, as we know only too well, is not always an easy task, and for having made the draft regulation compatible with the various administrative procedures in the Member States.
As the rapporteurs stressed earlier, the draft regulation represents a major step forward compared to current practices and, as a result, it brings the Community system a step closer to the system used by the Member States that are the most advanced in the field of transparency.
Naturally, ladies and gentlemen, the text is probably far from perfect.
It is very likely that not everybody will be pleased with every aspect.
I heard Mrs Hautala use a symbolic expression earlier, involving Russian dolls.
Mrs Hautala, I do not think that you will find Mr Solana if you open all the boxes.
In my view, Mr Solana' s standing and personality are of a much higher level and far more important than your description of them earlier.
It is true, however, that once you have started to open the boxes or the Russian dolls, and you notice that there is something inside, it will then be difficult to stop yourself.
To this extent, the picture that you painted is probably fair and symbolic, on this point in any case.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this text does indeed strike a fair balance between the specific characteristics of each institution and the practices within the Member States.
In this respect, it does, in all sincerity, represent the best possible compromise.
The Commission, therefore, officially accepts all the amendments tabled today by the rapporteurs and which were approved on 25 April 2001 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, chaired by Mr Watson.
I hope that the European Parliament will also support the opinions and recommendations made by your rapporteurs, so that we can adopt this regulation and effectively implement it as soon as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the documents created and held by each institution, as well as the volume of the documents processed, does indeed reflect their specific characteristics and their roles, which are both different and complementary.
Out of the three institutions, the Commission is by far the one which handles the largest amount of documents. The nature of these documents varies greatly, due to its variety of tasks, ranging from initiating legislation to acting as Guardian of the Treaties and guarantor of Community law and to ensuring respect for Community law.
The Commission is, therefore, perfectly aware of the fact that the main responsibility for implementing the regulation on public access to documents will fall on its shoulders.
It is precisely because of this two-fold objective, which is, on the one hand, to ensure the public has the widest access to documents and, on the other hand, to ensure the respect of Community law, that the Commission has carefully considered which system to use with regard to the sensitive issue of infringement proceedings.
The Commission wishes to state here in Parliament, and will also state to the Council, that, in a spirit of compromise and as proposed by the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen in particular, the Commission can accept that infringement proceedings are not included in the derogations specified in the regulation, since it believes that this approach would not have an adverse effect on the fulfilment of its responsibilities in ensuring respect for Community law.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in implementing this regulation, we are doing the institutions and citizens of the European Union a good turn.
I would like to assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the importance of this text and is committed to implementing it diligently and efficiently, not only because this is our duty, but because I am deeply convinced - and it is in this spirit that I myself worked alongside you and the Council Presidency from the moment Mr Prodi entrusted me with this task - that this text will considerably enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and all those who have participated in this process, the European Parliament is about to vote on the proposal for a Regulation concerning public access to documents of the EU institutions. The proposal was prepared jointly by Parliament, the Council and the Commission within the framework of what has been termed tripartite collaboration.
This new Regulation is a step towards a more open and more democratic EU in as much as the work of the bureaucrats is to be subject to public scrutiny.
The point of departure must be that all documents are to be accessible to the public.
Obviously, there are exceptions to this main rule, just as there are from the Swedish principle of public access to official records, but the number of exceptions has been significantly reduced in comparison with the original proposal and is now limited to what is absolutely necessary to protect mainly military and security interests, commercial secrets and information about the private lives of individuals.
Every document must be examined on its own merits, and a new examination must take place in response to each new enquiry from the public.
A document may only be withheld if making it available would harm some aspect of the public interest.
In previous proposals, it was enough that releasing a document might harm the public interest.
To make things easier for the general public, there must be a register listing all documents, and both the register and the documents must, as far as possible, be available on the Internet.
These are some aspects of the progress that has been achieved in the course of the tough negotiations of recent months.
There are still critics of the compromise.
They should consider that most EU countries do not have anything approaching the Swedish principle of public access to official records and that a number of these countries think that the issue is incomprehensible and its significance overrated.
To vote against the proposal because 100 per cent of what was desired has not been achieved would be frivolous.
Is it sensible to go hungry just because a three-course meal has not been offered?
The demand for the proposal to be overhauled before the European elections in 2004 is a prerequisite for public support.
This will facilitate a subsequent improvement of the text in the event of political opposition, so that the electorate can influence the issue, partly by the way in which they vote.
The result that has been achieved has been presented as a victory for the Swedish Presidency and, because transparency has been a key issue for the Swedish Government, it would have been a clear failure on the Government' s part if it had had to hand it as a gift to the forthcoming Presidency.
I should nonetheless like to add something to that picture - not take the victory away from the Swedish Presidency, but nonetheless supplement the picture.
The Prime Minister, Mr Persson is known for being a proponent of the intergovernmental model, on the basis of which citizens exercise little control.
A theoretical, but relevant, issue in connection with the debate on transparency is that of how the result would have looked on the basis of Mr Persson' s intergovernmental model.
How much control would the public have exercised then?
The Commission' s and the Council' s original proposal was completely unacceptable from the perspectives both of transparency and citizenship.
The answer has been given: Parliament is the institution which has stood up for transparency and which it has been possible to use as a lever during the negotiations in the Council.
Without Parliament' s hard fight for more transparency, and without the codecision procedure, no such commendable result would have been achieved.
I want to conclude by extending heartfelt gratitude to Mr Cashman, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, as well as to Commissioner Barnier, who has made a major contribution in the Commission, and, finally, to the committee secretariat.
Mr President, as shadow rapporteur, I should, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, first of all like to thank the rapporteurs for the high level of commitment they have shown in their bid to reach a compromise with the Council and Commission on the Regulation, which is informally referred to in the Netherlands as the "Euro-WOB" .
Given the huge resistance on the part of a number of Member States, it was clear from the outset that the negotiations would be tough.
Needless to say, I, like many MEPs, including Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, would have liked to see more disclosure on a number of scores in the proposal, but to many Member States, that appeared to be a bridge too far.
The compromise receives our unqualified support, as it represents in our eyes the result which is most viable.
The agreement is a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal and on the existing regulations.
For example, I was unable to consent to the far too extensive and exhaustive list of often vague reasons on the basis of which access to documents could be denied.
But under heavy political pressure from both Parliament and a number of Member States, this list has been cut down considerably, with a ceiling put in place.
It is also very satisfying to see that Mr Solana' s rules of last summer, by means of which entire categories of documents were excluded from public access by definition, are being rescinded by the new disclosure regime.
It would also have been unacceptable to me if the European disclosure regime were to prejudice existing national legislation.
Fortunately, that is not the case.
Another bonus is that documents drafted in the preliminary phase of legislation and policy are now expressly made public.
At the same time, I regret that as a result of the heavy resistance of a number of Member States, among others, certain points were not included in the compromise.
For example, I would have preferred it if confidential documents originating from third parties, such as NATO, or a Member State, were to fall entirely within the scope of the European disclosure regime. Instead, permission from the third party involved is now required for this.
Also, in my view, all documents should have been included in the public register, where now an exception is made for confidential documents.
The European Parliament will need to closely monitor how the institutions involved will give substance to public access in their day-to-day practice.
This is why I greatly value the annual report on the implementation of the disclosure regime.
If in the evaluation in January 2004, it appears that the Regulation does not guarantee sufficient disclosure and that the percentage of sensitive documents is too high, then it is up to Parliament to do something about this.
Finally, I should like to say to those MEPs who wish to vote against the compromise that they cannot adopt a clean-hands policy in that way.
The implications of rejecting the current compromise would be that the European citizens would remain deprived of a clear, European disclosure regime for the time being.
The Swedish Presidency, in tandem with a number of Member States as well as Parliament, has bent over backwards to reach a compromise before 1 May.
It very much remains to be seen whether the next presidencies will deal with this issue with just as much drive, and there is also the risk that further negotiations will not have a beneficial, but rather a detrimental, effect on the Regulation.
That is why this is the right time for me to adopt this compromise.
Mr President, let there be no misunderstanding: the liberal group will be voting for the disclosure Regulation.
If we compare the present situation with that of a year ago, we are definitely making progress.
Last year, the European Commission had tabled a weak proposal, taking existing practice as a point of departure.
That was not acceptable to us.
Last summer, we also witnessed Mr Solana' s coup d' Ã©tat, who, in one fell swoop, declared all documents under his remit to be secret.
It is certainly thanks to Parliament' s persistent pressurising that there is now a better proposal before us, and I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs warmly on this.
I am all the more pleased, because the liberal group has been closely involved in the negotiation process: firstly by tabling a number of amendments, also in the later stages, in order to keep the pressure on; secondly by supplying no less than three draftsmen of opinions and thirdly, as already mentioned, by the commitment of the liberal Committee Chairman, Mr Watson, in the final and deciding stage.
Mr President, we will be voting for the Regulation, but I will not make a song and dance about it.
It is a fact that the compromise proposal still contains weak areas, such as the grounds for exception, the documents of third parties in Article 4, the secret documents of Article 9, and I could mention a few more, but the improvements definitely outweigh the weaknesses.
The proposal' s mainstay is disclosure, barring exceptions, and that is a huge step forward for the Brussels bureaucracy.
In addition, we can identify a number of liberal touches in the compromise: the agencies in recital 8, the exceptions which do not apply in the event of a predominantly public interest in Article 4, the register of Article 9 and the annual report of each institution, listing refusals in Article 17.
All in all, I am keeping it low-key. This is not a story with a happy ending, but we accept the compromise because the best is the enemy of the good.
Whoever now votes against, now that a compromise has been reached with the Swedish Presidency, will be wasting an opportunity, for as Mr Van den Berg stated a moment ago, other presidencies will not be prepared to go that far.
Mr President, tomorrow' s vote is not the end of the story, it is only the beginning.
The European Commission' s evaluation in January 2004 will certainly need to lead to adjustments.
The ELDR Group will make every effort to expose the weaknesses in the Regulation in the mean time, and to contribute to the improvement thereof.
And our motto is: "Secrecy shows up the weakness of bad government, disclosure reveals the strength of sound government" .
Mr President, in the thick of euphoria, people who vote against the Regulation are immediately accused of adopting a clean-hands policy or eloping into fantasy, but my group has fundamental objections to a number of aspects in this proposal, and I refuse to sweep them under the carpet.
My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accepts that there are exceptions to disclosure.
For example, a European defence policy could yield certain operational information which does not belong on the streets.
But all documents must be recorded in the register, and it must be possible to test exceptions against strict criteria, in the last instance by the Court of Justice.
That may be the procedure for normal documents, but unfortunately, special treatment has been agreed upon for potentially too large a group of special, sensitive documents, and I hear very little about this.
The documents which are rubberstamped as "sensitive" are identified by a select group of officials within the institutions themselves.
It is not necessary to include sensitive documents in the register, and the Court of Justice cannot verify whether this decision is justified.
Should a clever citizen find out that the document exists after all, the same officials will decide on the application.
And to cap it all, with regard to documents which do contribute to the decision-making process of European policy but which originate from outside, the author has a veto regarding both the inclusion in the register and the disclosure of the document.
The Court too has to accept this veto.
Sensitive documents constitute a black hole in this agreement on disclosure of information, and the right to information simply becomes an act of goodwill.
Mr President, there is quite a gap between the euphoria expressed by some today and the view expressed by others, to the effect that this is a compromise balanced on a knife edge.
If any way of characterising this result is to be found, then this is probably the most honest.
The process concerning transparency and public access to documents has, of course, been conducted for a long time behind hermetically sealed doors.
This is in itself a major problem because, in tackling such an essential area as public access to, and scrutiny of, documents - which is fundamental to our having democratically active citizens able to influence the decision-making process - it is crucial to involve people, partly in the debate as to how the rules are to be designed, and perhaps, in addition, to go so far as to listen to some of people' s objections.
I think we have a result which, in some respects, can be lived with, which in other respects is good but which, on a number of points, is unfortunately a retrograde step in relation to the current situation which is, of course, the result partly of a number of rules, partly of the practice of the courts and partly of intervention by the ombudsman.
One of the areas in which, in my view, there is a major problem is that of internal documents which are not clearly defined in this proposal and which can be kept secret if it is thought that publication will have a decisive influence on the decision-making process.
All right, but is that not precisely what transparency is all about - enabling people to have a decisive influence on the decision-making process?
I think it is a problem that Member States can demand that documents be classified and, in addition, decline to register them at all, without there being clear rules as to when and why the Solana documents, as they are called, are not generally exempt, but that the rules governing what may be exempt are so loose as to be largely meaningless.
There is, of course, no doubt about the fact that these rules will be of decisive importance to the rules in all member States, but large parts of the rapporteurs' presentation have been vague and it has been very difficult to get clear information about the whys and wherefores.
I doubt if there is a single document that cannot be accessed under the current rules but which it will be possible to access under the rules now being discussed.
I doubt if it will be possible to extract so much as one more document from the EU system than it is possible to extract today.
I think the European Parliament has played a difficult role in this, and I think it is also transparently obvious that the European Parliament' s own interests have, from time to time, unfortunately overshadowed the public' s interests.
By far the best thing about this proposal is that we nonetheless have a chance to look at the rules again in 2004, and I think we have some detailed and substantial work to do before then.
Public access to documents is, of course, the very stuff of democracy.
Control, public scrutiny and democracy are different sides of the same issue and, against that background, I essentially agree with the criticism forwarded to all my fellow MEPs from five distinctive organisations.
The conclusion is that this proposal is really worse than nothing.
Many aspects of the rules concerning sensitive documents are absurd, and administering these exceptions is a bit like selling elastic by the metre, as a Danish humorist once put it. It in any case requires a firm character and a significantly more democratic turn of mind and basic attitude than that which the Commission and the other institutions of the EU are used to exhibiting.
Article 5 undoubtedly involves a deterioration in the current rules governing public access to, and scrutiny of, public documents as practised, for example, in the Scandinavian countries.
Moreover, there is another thing which really surprises me, in addition to my fellow MEPs failure to understand the reality of the situation and to the praise forthcoming from the large political groups.
It is a source of surprise that not one person has raised the question of whether what has taken place is in accordance with the Treaty.
These negotiations have taken place in the strictest confidence, with all the small groups excluded.
The negotiations have been conducted by my fellow MEPs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, and by the brilliant chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Watson, from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
The major groups have gone through this process without the rest of us being involved at all in these negotiations.
All we can do is vote for or against.
This, I would point out, contravenes the basic rules of the Treaty which presuppose that there are three independent institutions which play their part. There are also rules relating to the conciliation procedure and so on, which ensure that the small groups are heard.
What we are concerned with here, moreover, is a matter concerning public access to documents. It is quite simply a farce in terms of democracy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and the rapporteur on their initiative.
It seems to me that transparency quite rightly has a special place in the Nordic legal world, and transparency should also occupy a special place in the institutions of the European Union.
I hope that we will go further than this expression of intent, this declaration, and that in future unlimited access to documents will be guaranteed.
Democracy and the need to bring the Union closer to its citizens are always associated with the transparency of political decision making.
It is not just the European public that has in the past complained - quite rightly in my view - about making policy behind closed doors.
I too would have preferred a more far-reaching compromise.
However, I think that for the time being we must be satisfied with what has been achieved.
As the representative of the European public, Parliament has a duty to ensure that this regulation is strictly adhered to.
In one or two years' time we will be able to review whether this regulation has really been a success.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the negotiations on the proposal for a regulation on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Committee on Budgets considered an opinion on this which I myself drafted.
I would like to reiterate the basic principles of that opinion, which are still valid today.
We highlighted three main points, the first of these being transparency and openness, which are a fundamental requirement for any system of democratic control.
These principles require an administration to be legitimate, efficient, responsible and meaningful for the public.
Furthermore, they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power.
In addition, they contribute to the exposure, punishment and prevention of irregularities and fraud, phenomena that the Commission in particular has been very much subject to in the past.
The second main point is the statement that documents produced by the institutions should be made public as a matter of principle.
Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified.
This has now been firmly established.
Furthermore, I believed at that time that it was not appropriate to draw up an extensive catalogue listing existing legal provisions, which would only lead to doubts and disputes.
The third main point is the public's desire for their rights to be respected in practice by guaranteeing the existence of an accessible registry, as is being requested now, and also, by means of the Internet, to respond swiftly to requests for documents and to justify any refusal of such a request, and last but not least to use the language of the applicant.
I would also like to see a coordinating body facilitating all this.
We shall see how this works in practice.
I am pleased to see that the basic requirements have been established, even if not in full as yet.
That can be covered in the revised version.
I also believe that the framework agreement should be revised to bring it in line with the requests we have made about openness and relations between the institutions.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, and I also want to thank the Commission, the Presidency and the Council for the constructive work they have done.
The first question one might ask oneself is whether, in Parliament' s view, this is the best proposal that can be achieved.
The answer is no.
There are details in this document about which we have reservations and which we could wish were better.
That applies, for example, to the issues surrounding documents of a sensitive nature.
Reservations might also be entertained about the way in which the process has been conducted and about the fact that it has sometimes been conducted behind closed doors, as has been the case, on the whole, where the conciliation procedure is concerned.
Even though discussions have taken place, the procedure is not especially open.
The second question we must ask ourselves is whether this proposal constitutes progress, or even considerable progress, in relation to the situation we have at present.
My answer is an unqualified yes.
It constitutes substantial progress in relation to the present situation.
I really cannot understand those who say that it is a retrograde step.
Is it not progress that all incoming documents are now to be made public, as is not of course the case at present?
Is it not progress that, in principle, all documents will have to be registered in a way that they are not at present?
Is it not progress that the secrecy rules which we have, which we recognise must exist and which exist in all those countries which have made the most progress of all in this area, are relatively few in number and, moreover, quite out in the open?
The answer is an unqualified yes.
Furthermore, an individual requiring access to a document will only have to wait for a short period of time while the matter is administered.
Documents must be more readily available on the Internet, and the administration period must be a maximum of fifteen days, meaning that the process is relatively quick.
If the individual is not satisfied with the result, there must be a right to appeal and have the decision reviewed.
That, if anything, surely constitutes progress.
Moreover, the national rules must apply in those countries which have better legislation than that now being proposed.
The proposal is not, therefore, a retrograde step for those countries which have more open legislation.
All this does constitute substantial progress.
It would therefore seem very odd if this Parliament were to vote against a proposal just because it does not go the whole hog, for we are nearly there and have the opportunity to carry out an annual audit.
Moreover, a review will take place in a few years' time.
It is quite clear that we in Parliament must vote in favour of this proposal.
People want the institutions to be more open.
This proposal constitutes a clear improvement when it comes to transparency and, in addition, to democratic administration within the EU.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen without whose drive, determination and doggedness, this would not have been possible.
I would like too to thank the rapporteurs of other committees for their considerable contribution.
If the House approves this tomorrow, credit will be due to all of those, including Mrs Hautala, who helped in the process.
This proposed new regulation is an important milestone on the road to abolishing unnecessary secrecy in government.
Other speakers have outlined its direct benefits to the citizen, but to me tomorrow's vote must mark the beginning of a change in the culture of the European institutions from secrecy to openness.
Many of us would have liked wider rights and fewer exceptions.
Some argued that delay would give us a better deal, but the overwhelming majority on my committee decided not to make the best the enemy of the good, believing that this proposed regulation gives us a framework for progress.
The European Parliament must now be vigilant in making sure the law is put into practice.
Some external critics have attacked us for not insisting on the naked civil servant. These proposals allow public officials a fig-leaf, but little more.
I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office, in particular, Ambassador Lund, for their willingness to grapple with this issue, to respect the deadline set by the treaties and to build a majority in Council.
It is fitting that freedom of information legislation should be adopted under the presidency of a Member State which has long standing rights for citizens in this area, thanks to the farsightedness of an eminent former legislator, Mr Chydenius.
Commissioner Barnier deserves the gratitude of the House for his work in the Commission.
In conclusion, it is said that only three legislatures in the world make their decisions entirely behind closed doors: one is in Havana, one is in Pyongyang, and the third is the Council of Ministers in Brussels.
We may not have broken down the doors, we may not have allowed in the TV cameras as the Swedish government once wanted, but we will shine the searchlight of public opinion into the darker corners of decision-making, in the Council, in the Commission and here in our own House.
Mr President, it should be a day for rejoicing when the European Parliament votes on EU rules on transparency and access to documents, but there are also too many flies in the ointment.
The reason for this lies in the wording concerning documents of a sensitive nature. This makes it possible in future to classify not only sensitive military documents as secret, but also more general documents concerning security and perhaps other policy areas too.
The wording concerning sensitive documents is too general and too vague.
When, subsequently, it is a matter of which documents are to be classified as secret in a Member State such as Sweden, is it not the Commission which will in future decide this?
In that case, it is a substantial infringement of the Swedish constitution.
What is more, I agree with what has been said about the procedure itself, namely that it is extremely difficult to understand how, as part of an informal process I would characterise as very dubious, the negotiations concerning such a sensitive and important subject could have taken place between the committee, the Council and the Commission but not been subject to scrutiny by ordinary Members of Parliament and the general public.
Mr President, transparency and the right to study the contents of documents are central elements of a living democracy, but the proposal on which we are now to adopt a position and which concerns access to EU documents is a disappointment.
In some areas, it is downright worse than the EU' s existing practice.
Moreover, the very negotiations concerning the proposal have been a display of lack of transparency.
The normal parliamentary process has been set aside, and significant parts of Parliament, including our group, have been excluded from influence.
Respect for national rules on transparency is not guaranteed by the proposal.
National rules are subordinate to an EU Regulation.
Paragraph 14 of this Regulation also specifies that the Member States must be loyal to the contents of the Regulation.
Furthermore, Article 5 states that, in cases which are not clear, Member States must ask the EU' s institutions for guidance in order to decide if EU documents are to be handed over.
Nor is it the case that the Swedish principle of public access to official records is guaranteed by this proposal.
On the contrary, it is the EU' s Court of Justice which has the power to decide in the event of conflicts arising in this area.
There are extensive and partially unclear exemptions from the rules concerning access to documents.
Whole areas such as security policy, internal documents and documents from the Member States are exempt in practice.
What are called 'sensitive documents' do not even need to be shown in the registers.
These exemptions substantially undermine the improvements made by the proposal, for example the demands for registers, time limits and access to electronic documents.
The European Parliament' s access to classified documents has also been dealt with in these negotiations, at the same time as the public' s right of access to documents.
It is an unfortunate confusion of different issues which ought not to have happened.
I cannot see how the advantages of this proposal significantly outweigh the disadvantages.
This is not the time to conclude this work, for it is not complete.
The conciliation ought to continue as normal.
Mr President, I cannot support the new rules concerning transparency because they impose a common limit upon transparency and open the way to directly retrograde steps.
Documents which are at present in the public domain may be classified tomorrow.
Documents which may at present be made available in Copenhagen or Stockholm may tomorrow be classified throughout the EU.
At present, we in practice operate with common minimum rules governing transparency.
It is possible for those countries that wish to do so to go further.
The EU Regulation makes the rules the same in every country.
That is good for consistency but bad for transparency.
The Member States will now be obliged to conform to the common rules and consult the EU authorities before they make documents available.
We are now to be given common maximum rules on transparency.
Just look at recitals 9a and 12, which exclude better national legislation, and Article 4a of the Regulation in which the Member States are obliged to consult the EU.
See also recital 5a concerning the actual decision-making process, recital 7 concerning countries' right to classify documents, recital 9 concerning personal information which, for example, makes it more difficult to know who sits on the 1 500 committees, and Article 6a, Paragraph 3 which excludes sensitive information from the registers.
See the text on euobserver.com, if you do not have it in your briefcases.
Transparency and the new ceiling are accompanied by a new procedure in which three opponents of transparency such as France, Spain and Germany are able to block progress on transparency, even if the whole of the European Parliament and twelve national parliaments are in agreement concerning a little more transparency.
