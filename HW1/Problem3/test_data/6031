This support for liberalisation is all the more surprising given that the attempts to establish freight corridors have not yet borne fruit save in the context of cooperation.
Europe needs to learn from experience.
It also needs a public rail service it can be proud of.
In our opinion, this is what is at stake.
Lastly, while I agree with MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs idea that the rail package constitutes a whole, and while we all agree on promoting rail transport, and moving forward in this direction, I do not think this necessarily entails liberalisation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I would first like to say how pleased I am with how this second rail package is progressing. More generally, I am also very happy with the admirable work to promote railways undertaken during this period.
I am sure all of us here today have different sensibilities.
Nonetheless, we are all united in the common cause of boosting the rail sector and of giving it new hope. It is a case of convincing all the players in the rail sector that Europe is not out to handicap national rail networks.
On the contrary, it is here to provide an opportunity for a renaissance of the railways.
This truly is the primary objective.
The second objective is to respond to public opinion.
Nowadays, we are judged on how well we discharge our responsibilities. In so-called transit and junction countries like mine the trend towards transporting everything by lorry has led to intolerable situations.
Significant political tensions have arisen in such countries.
These tensions came to the fore over the Mont Blanc incidents and a similar situation is arising in connection with the Pyrenees.
This second rail package has several dimensions.
Firstly, it has a very strong technical dimension, which is embodied in particular in the report by MrsÂ Ainardi. We fully support her report and I personally support it unreservedly, in particular because it provides for the installation of black boxes, something that is MrsÂ Ainardiâs personal wish.
The SterckxÂ report addresses technical concerns too and is also important as it establishes European safety standards. There is, therefore, no question of opening up the sector without providing a safety net.
Careful preparations will be made.
Safety will be at the heart of the opening up process.
Safety must always be our objective and our watchword.
In this connection, I have a more qualified opinion about the relationship between national safety standards and European safety standards.
I believe safety cannot be sacrificed in the interests of freedom.
As regards the rail sector, safety is obviously crucial at all times to the work of railway employees.
Nevertheless, I think it is essential not to use standards as a pretext for preventing other trains from using a particular network. Personally, I hope an appropriate agreement upholding the safety imperative will be reached on this matter.
Lastly, for the first time these texts have a very significant social dimension to them, which fills me with great hope.
I share the view that far greater progress has been made on integrating the European Unionâs roads than on integrating its railways and I have said as much. The reason why rail is lagging behind is that so far railway employees have failed to understand that we are also trying to integrate the railway employees of the European Union, which will be to their benefit too.
Significant progress has been made, nonetheless.
Firstly, there is the establishment of the Agency. This achievement is down to my fellow Members, and to the understanding and ongoing support of the Commission and the Council.
The Agency will bring employers and employees together for the first time.
I think we should feel satisfied with this.
I believe this agency should be a common forum for the rail sector. This was why we sought to include employeesâ representatives as well as bringing together rail users, rail companies and infrastructure managers.
I trust Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 5 will be upheld. In particular, I hope the provision in ArticleÂ 3 for trade unions in working groups will be retained.
I believe this represents a considerable step forward.
Both the Sterckx and the Ainardi reports uphold the principle of the primacy of social dialogue in the legislative processes of the EuropeanÂ Union. Whenever employers and unions can come to an agreement, within a suitable time frame, the need to legislate can be avoided.
Legislation can then be drafted at a later date. From this point of view, the developments regarding the driverâs licence mark a turning point.
This is the first time the 32 rail companies and union representatives have reached such an agreement which will form the basis of a text.
This text will, of course, inform the Commissionâs work too. Thanks to the agreement, the Commissionâs work will have far greater legitimacy than it would otherwise have had.
I hope all this augurs the establishment in the very near future of a convention bringing together all European rail employees. I believe that this will trigger the liberation of European Union railways and lead to their rapid integration.
Liberalisation is also an issue. My views on this are much more qualified than those of MrÂ Jarzembowski.
I am not sure that it is very useful to keep changing the agenda.
I am not sure that liberalisation is the only basis for integrating the railways of the EuropeanÂ Union. Indeed, I believe the opposite is the case.
Clearly, it is important to ensure trains can travel freely across all MemberÂ States. In my view, however, many other conditions still remain to be met for railways to regain their rightful status and be able to compete with road transport.
I am not sure we should address the issue of passenger transport prematurely. We must not adopt a blinkered approach.
In my opinion, there is no point in setting a date without being fully aware of what is involved, particularly on the economic front.
I fear we may be drawn inexorably towards a collision of all the risks. The nearer the elections draw, the greater are the opportunities for the Council to diminish certain positions.
I regret this but we shall move together in that direction, Georg, because we all accepted that this is a rail package.
Commissioner, I would like to finish by saying that we attach great importance to the budgetary aspect.
I am concerned that the directive on European tax discs falls short of the ambitions of the WhiteÂ Paper. It will allow national taxation policies to be implemented, which is likely to result in many contradictions concerning tax deductions and the allocation of these funds.
I would have preferred a Swiss-style system for the EuropeanÂ Union.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say first of all that work on this second rail package is proceeding in a highly satisfactory manner.
It is certainly satisfactory to be holding this debate in the morning, with the benefit of plenty of light and with Minute-takers present.
It is worth noting that we are actually working in daylight.
For once, we have not been relegated to the twilight hours.
Issues of this kind are usually consigned to evening sittings.
I would therefore like to reiterate how delighted I am to be dealing with them in prime parliamentary time.
I believe this programming is an indication of the widespread recognition of the importance of the subject under discussion.
In particular, it reflects the importance attributed to it by the House.
I would like to begin by thanking Parliament most sincerely for all the work undertaken over the years.
As several honourableÂ Members recalled, we have now been working together for a long time in the hope of breathing new life into European railways and ensuring the recovery of rail transport.
I should like to thank the four rapporteurs very much for their excellent work.
I admit to being one of those who would have preferred to conclude at second reading.
Nonetheless, we are proceeding to conciliation.
It is to be hoped that the amendments will be adopted tomorrow and will provide what little further clarification is required on the minor points remaining for discussion in Council.
I do believe that a positive result for the rail sector will eventually be achieved.
The ultimate beneficiary will be European society.
Throughout the time we have worked together we have contrived to find solutions to most of the problems raised.
We have also clarified our positions and found ways forward resulting in compromises and agreements.
I should like to begin by responding to MrÂ Savary.
The Commission(1) does not object to most of the amendments tabled concerning the EuropeanÂ RailwayÂ Agency.
We are only opposed to five of the 32 amendments tabled.
Essentially, we adopted this stance on the grounds of legal clarity or in the interests of avoiding complications or excessive bureaucracy in the Agencyâs work.
I think it is worth emphasising that the Commission does support the amendments relating to the composition of the AdministrativeÂ Board.
The rapporteur has just referred to these.
We also support the amendments concerning the composition of its working groups.
I believe a good balance can be achieved.
I would like to thank MrsÂ Ainardi for her work on such a technically complex matter.
We have cooperated in an exemplary manner.
I should state that the Commission is able to support the two amendments tabled by MrÂ Sterckx at the eleventh hour.
MrÂ Sterckx was the rapporteur for the directive on safety on the Communityâs railways. A large number of amendments to this directive were tabled.
This illustrates Parliamentâs wish to forge ahead more quickly in this area.
We are of course also eager to do so.
Nonetheless, some of the amendments tabled incorporate provisions that already exist in the directives on interoperability.
Others refer to provisions that will appear in our proposal on driving licences for train drivers due towards the end of this year.
Further amendments relate to systematic shortening of the deadlines for drafting European texts on rail safety.
The Council had already drastically shortened the deadlines.
I therefore believe this is not about being arbitrary but about being realistic.
The Council had already shortened the deadlines contained in the initial proposals.
A balance seems to have been reached.
In that connection, I maintain that for the future agency to succeed from the outset, it must not be overloaded with work.
It is also worth mentioning the issue of national safety rules and their monitoring at Community level.
These are the most significant amendments, especially in the context of preparing for the vote in the Council.
I believe the rapporteur achieved a good balance.
We therefore support his amendments to ArticleÂ 8.
Once again, I should like to thank MrÂ Sterckx for his work.
Turning to MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs report, it should be noted that it falls into two parts.
One concerns freight transport and the other passenger transport.
We fully support Parliamentâs amendments regarding freight transport.
It should be borne in mind, however, that eventually agreement will need to be reached with the Council concerning deadlines and authorised applicants.
Nonetheless, I am confident of a positive outcome.
Regarding passenger transport, I am well aware of Parliamentâs position.
The House made this abundantly clear at first reading.
I informed the Council accordingly.
The vote in plenary at first reading in Parliament was dealt with as appropriate.
The Commission is also fully aware that this position has been maintained in the vote in the CommitteeÂ onÂ RegionalÂ Policy, TransportÂ andÂ Tourism.
I should reiterate before the House that we appreciate the concerns underlying these amendments.
The Commission has, however, given an undertaking to Parliament and to the Council to present a proposal on opening up passenger transport to competition.
The Commission intends to present this proposal before the end of the year. The texts are practically finished.
The last internal discussions are under way.
The texts are more complex than they appear at first sight.
The document should be available to you in a month and a half.
You will have it before the end of the year.
It is indeed the case that even if the Commission presents the proposal on time, it will not be possible to debate it during this term.
MrÂ Jarzembowski was quite right to point that out.
The debate could perhaps be launched, but I suspect it would not be possible to conclude the first reading.
On this subject, I would like to say to honourableÂ Members that the Commission will present the text.
We trust this Parliament will begin work on it, and that it or its successor will bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion.
We are all fully aware of the importance of opening up passenger transport to competition.
Furthermore, as soon as the Trans-European network is established it will be essential to stop thinking in terms of national criteria for railways and begin to consider European railway criteria.
Henceforth, the geographical reference context will be the whole of Europe, not one specific country or another.
It will be necessary to think in terms of the European network as a whole.
Consequently, all the companies already in existence in the various European countries must have free access to that European network.
Once access is granted, the companies will compete amongst themselves.
That is the logical outcome of the steps taken.
As soon as a European railway law comes into force, existing European operators will begin to compete amongst themselves.
Competition will automatically come about as soon as Europe becomes the reference area, rather than some specific country.
This is not an ideological issue. It is a fact.
It is simply a logical consequence of the nature of the measures adopted.
It is one of the advantages of European integration.
In addition, I should say that I believe this kind of competition will spur the railway companies to modernise.
Modernisation is sorely needed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I certainly agree with you that the safety criterion is crucial. It must remain so.
Safety needs to be the aim and the watchword of rail transport.
It must not be compromised by the other changes envisaged.
Finally, MrÂ Jarzembowski, I should like to congratulate you on your efforts and on the work you have put in.
I understand your position, one shared by a substantial majority of the House, but I am unable to support those amendments.
I can, however, provide an assurance that the text on opening up passenger transport to competition will be presented before the end of the year.
As I conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteurs once again.
MrsÂ Ainardi, MrÂ Jarzembowski, MrÂ Sterckx and MrÂ Savary have all done splendid work.
Thanks are also due to the CommitteeÂ onÂ RegionalÂ Policy, TransportÂ andÂ Tourism and to the whole House.
Some points do remain for conciliation with the Council.
A number of them may prove problematic.
It is to be hoped that suitable accommodations will be found.
The second rail package could then be finalised.
The first rail package was completed during this Parliamentary term.
If the second package is concluded before the term comes to an end, this Parliament will be able to pride itself on having moved European rail freight transport forward into the twenty-first century.
This represents a considerable challenge. It is a challenge that must be met, however, if Europe is to have a balanced and sustainable transport system.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal is staked on the restructuring of Europeâs railways.
We must ensure that the twenty-first century marks the revival of rail travel in Europe, otherwise we shall have a gridlocked road network with all its repercussions on peopleâs lives, on the environment and on the economy.
The railways, of course, cannot be synonymous with long-distance transport as they were in the nineteenth century, but they should be an important link in a chain comprising all the modes of transport â air, road, sea, waterway and rail.
In order to play their part in this chain, the railways must be up to the tasks required of them.
They must be fully integrated within their own structures, and the grandiloquent concept of intermodal transport must be fleshed out so that the links between the various modes of transport can actually work in practice.
Time is short, which is why Parliament was dissatisfied â and, indeed, is still not quite satisfied â with the original timetable, but we do see signs of movement, and we hope that there will be further movement â and very soon, please, if possible.
Accordingly, we stand by our earlier proposals.
Especially with regard to the package covered by MrsÂ Ainardiâs report, we stand by our stated position, and we must insist on the realisation of interoperability throughout the network.
This, of course, cannot be fully achieved unless it is an effective binding requirement for all parts of the rail network and unless steps are taken to ensure that international transport operations are not obstructed again by piecemeal measures.
In the drafting and adoption of technical specifications, consideration must be given to the economic costs, and care must be taken to ensure that the requisite safety standards are in place and that due account is taken of environmental and social concerns too.
One of the main prerequisites for an entirely effective and safe trans-European high-speed rail network is a functioning system of communication, especially between those who conduct operations and those who oversee them.
For this reason we need an appropriate code of terminology for operational communications.
Rather than organising all of this on the basis of the lowest common denominator and minimum safety levels, we must guarantee compliance with the highest possible standards.
Finally, allow me, as an Austrian, to take this opportunity to comment on another subject that has been in the news again in recent days.
I refer to the proposed regulation on the ecopoints system for HGVs travelling through Austria, which was the subject of the Caveri report and which has now gone to conciliation, although the conciliation process has not yet begun in earnest.
In this context, may I make an urgent appeal, especially to the Council and its President-in-Office, MrÂ Lunardi, to ensure that the most directly affected countries are able to agree on a common position so that they can signal to everyone, including Parliament, that the deadlock is being broken.
The deadlock needs to be broken; once it has, MrÂ Schmidâs earlier quotation from Goethe can be applied to the ecopoints issue too, albeit in a slightly modified form: âFor he whose strivings never cease will finally achieve successâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteurs on their sterling work and on their close cooperation with all the other members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
In my contribution to this debate, I should like to focus on the work that MrÂ Jarzembowski has done and to enumerate the conditions in which liberalisation can truly succeed.
As far as freight transport is concerned, there are no differences between us; we agree on the need for liberalisation or opening of the market in freight transport, because, over the past few years, and indeed decades, the percentage of freight transported by rail has steadily fallen.
This is not the result of liberalisation, which came along much later.
On the contrary, liberalisation is actually a necessary, albeit inadequate, response to this development.
The domain of road haulage has experienced the very liberalisation that we actually want to see in the realm of rail transport.
National borders now present virtually no obstacle to international road transport within the European Union, nor do divergent technical or safety standards.
The external cost of road transport, however, is not borne by carriers, which has been to their advantage, and the road network has received massive amounts of public investment.
The primacy of road over rail cannot be regarded as the triumph of free enterprise over nationalised industries, because road transport could not have flourished without public investment.
As far as passenger transport is concerned, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her explanatory remarks, and I hope that the pragmatism and logic of her arguments have also convinced MrÂ Jarzembowski, who is not entirely immune to the sort of cogent argument of which the Commissioner availed herself so amply today.
Let us be honest: the crucial point is not whether the rules take effect in 2005 or not; what is crucial is that they are introduced at some time in the next few years.
We are in agreement on that point.
My group will vote for the Jarzembowski report, but I should like to say very clearly on its behalf that attempts to liberalise freight transport will only succeed if they are accompanied by greater flexibility on passenger transport.
Freight transport must take precedence for the reasons I have given, subject to certain conditions.
The successful liberalisation of rail transport will also depend on measures such as the harmonisation of technical specifications and safety standards.
Much has been said about this already, and we fully agree with what we have heard.
The obstacles to a single European market that still exist in this domain must be systematically removed.
This is a challenge to politicians throughout Europe and more particularly to both sides of the rail industry.
Which brings me to the second condition.
It has become fashionable today to implement reforms that run counter to the interests of the people who are most directly affected by them, namely the workforce.
I believe it would be better if we could secure the support of employees, particularly railway employees, for reforms and changes.
The agreement reached a few days ago on train driversâ licences is a very good sign.
If we assign responsibility to the two sides of the rail industry â employers and employees â subject, of course, to the proviso that failure to exercise this responsibility will result in an imposed political decision, I firmly believe that they will arrive at an effective solution, as has happened in the case of the train driversâ licence.
I hope that this is indeed the start of a constructive partnership between management and labour in the rail industry.
Thirdly, liberalisation will only work if more funds are invested in the infrastructure.
Reference has already been made to the electricity market, to the situation in the United Kingdom, for example.
If we liberalise but do not strive to ensure that there are sufficient incentives for investment, there is a real danger that networks will collapse and that the seeds of insecurity will be sown.
After all, the aims of competition are to push prices down, which also reduces profit margins for infrastructure operators, and to achieve better or fuller use of the infrastructure.
If no compensatory or supporting public investments are made, serious problems can arise.
I am somewhat saddened by the fact that, following a very good submission or submissions to the Council by the Commission, no clear statement has emerged on investments in the trans-European networks, particularly on additional incentives, in other words the 30% that the Commission is seeking for cross-border projects.
We must encourage all the Member States to step up their investment in the rail network, with special emphasis â needless to say â on cross-border measures.
How do we want to bring Europe together if there is insufficient investment in the rail infrastructure?
I hope that a statement on this point will be forthcoming at the December summit, if not before.
And let me reiterate my gratitude to the Commission, which has done so much good groundwork.
My last prerequisite for the success of liberalisation is the creation of a level playing field.
As I have already mentioned, one of the many reasons why road transport has established its supremacy is that road users do not pay the external costs, in other words the environmental costs.
They pay neither for the additional wear and tear caused by heavy vehicles nor for the environmental damage caused by vehicle emissions.
The Commissioner has presented a Directive on infrastructure pricing that I do not find entirely satisfactory, because I feel it offers too little scope for the rectification of this imbalance.
I do find it alarming, however, to read about what has been happening in the Council, to learn how little approval and support there is for the position adopted by the Commission.
I hope that this House will support the Commission more strongly on this issue, and I should like to express my thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their efforts in this direction.
MrÂ Jarzembowski has produced an excellent piece of work.
All he has to do now is to make that leap of faith and focus on freight transport; above all, he should fully endorse the position of his esteemed colleague, Commissioner De Palacio, and then we shall arrive at a good decision.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the MEPs â the rapporteurs â who have done so much work in order to put a coherent package on the table; because that is what the finished product is.
Since last week, I have been able to see with my own eyes that it is indeed possible to do business on the railways in Europe.
I visited a private company in Rotterdam that now transports half of its containers by rail: that means a 50%Â market share compared to the old monopolists that are stuck in their ways.
The entry of private entrepreneurs into the market has therefore contributed towards halting the comparative loss of a mode of transport.
We must therefore encourage more private players to invest in the use of the railways, so as to secure their future as an alternative mode of transport.
I admire and endorse MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs commitment to going the full distance with the railways and also to the aspiration of liberalising passenger transport byÂ 2008.
I do hope that the Council adopts this.
I should also like to warn, however, that in so doing we must not hinder a number of countries from liberalising freight transport.
Here, I am referring in particular to countries such as France and Belgium: although their organisations are investing abroad, they do not permit foreign undertakings to develop activities on their railways.
I hope that, byÂ January 2006, that will be a thing of the past, and I do believe that it will.
Safety and interoperability go hand in hand, and are also the most important reason why the railways have the potential to be a good, quick and competitive mode of transport compared to road transport.
For that to be the case, however, a great deal will have to change.
I have observed that a train travelling from the Netherlands to southern Germany â through two countries and three â has seven changes of locomotive.
It is absolutely ridiculous that this is supposed to be the alternative to road transport.
I am happy, therefore, that there is an excellent proposal on the table here that will enable us to eradicate conditions such as these.
It will enable us to ensure that we have uniform training throughout Europe, a single, recognisable, system, which is accessible and also promotes through-travel; thus increasing the real speed of freight railways, and, with it, safety and reliability.
I should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level, therefore.
This will clear the way for those wishing to travel by rail to be able to do so.
This would necessitate interconnection of routes.
Such things must not be organised separately for each and each country.
An all-encompassing, integrated approach is required, and I think that it is extremely important that this proposal is on the table.
In my opinion, this issue of safety and interoperability presents us with a very good chance of making the railways an attractive mode of transport, alongside road transport and also alongside transport over water.
I think that this represents a step that is of considerable importance to freight transport throughout Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, rail transport was once started by private companies who anticipated making a profit by doing so.
Their railway lines did not form a coherent network and were mostly inaccessible to other companies with different kinds of trains.
Many of those companies went bankrupt or were notable for their poor-quality, frequently interrupted service.
When that system failed, State-owned companies came along, and tried to develop a uniform model for their respective countries as far as possible.
Rail transport became a core responsibility of the State.
We have now reached a phase in which a large-scale uniform European model is aspired to on the one hand, but at the same time a return to the nineteenth century model of individual private companies is being propagated.
Those two aims will probably prove difficult to reconcile in practice, and be a constant source of tension.
The champions of this model hold up transport companies that have undergone prolific growth in the free market, such as airlines and HGV companies, as an example to the railways, which they see as outmoded.
They believe that freedom of competition will lead to growth and make the railways attractive to a broader clientele that has not been using them up to now.
Others fear that liberalisation will only lead to a separation between profitable and loss-making activities and to cutbacks in infrastructure, service and staff, resulting in a deterioration in safety and a rise in fares.
In their view, there are more grounds for entrusting long-distance cross-border transport to effective coordination between the existing State companies or to one individual European company than for making room for new private companies; and measures to restrict environmentally unfriendly air and road transport are a good supplement to that.
The four reports that are on the agenda today are a product of this major difference of opinion.
They all have in common that they envisage an important role for rail transport again in the future, too; and that represents progress in relation to the time when the railways were consigned to the museum of nineteenth century curiosities.
Opinion differs widely on the means to achieve this, however.
The Jarzembowski report is one of an endless succession of attempts at greater and faster liberalisation, not only for cross-border freight transport, but even for domestic passenger transport.
Although I am not a supporter of great power on the part of the Council, I hope that, if a majority in this Parliament supports the rapporteur, the Council will restrict such an attempt this time, too.
The Sterckx report places rather less emphasis on a free market, but takes a fairly centralistic view, such that it leaves insufficient scope for national and regional measures.
The Ainardi and Savary reports are aimed at quality for society, users and staff, and thus have my support.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, along with the entire communications infrastructure and the media, the rail network is crucial to turning the European Union into a political entity without frontiers.
This is as much the case now as it has been in the development of modern states over the last 200Â years.
These services are needed for economic progress and modernisation, just as the measure of extending the high speed network is also required, at present, in order to dynamise and revitalise productive activity.
The rail package, therefore, is not simply a new tool enabling private companies to do business as quickly as possible, but is rather a tool for building the road to political, economic and social integration throughout the Union.
My group rejects MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs report, since his approach runs counter to the one outlined above, but will vote in favour of the Sterckx report on safety, the Ainardi report on interoperability, and the Savary report on the European Railway Agency, which are compatible with it.
For me, as a Galician, and for all inhabitants of nations located far from the geographical centre of Europe, these European Parliament decisions should, of course, be a way for us to gain access to high-speed communication with the whole of Europe.
The plan for investment in infrastructure currently being developed by the Commission should share this aim, bearing in mind above all the fact that railways are kinder to nature and also more favourable to social welfare than any other transport network.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the aim of these proposals is to give an impetus to the railway sector so that it may become an attractive and viable alternative to other modes of transport.
Judging from the reactions to the White Paper, that has broad support.
The only question is how it should be done.
A drastic change in attitude is needed within the sector.
This package undoubtedly has the potential to contribute to this, provided it is properly developed and implemented.
An important element is access to the market.
Who receives user rights â and what for?
In order to stand up to competition with road transport, forwarders and consignors need comparable freedom.
That is to say, the parties involved in freight transport need direct access to the network.
Whether it is advisable to claim this for passenger transport, too, in the short term, I venture to doubt.
If we give entrepreneurs this scope, it is important that we lay down clear rules on use and safety.
In our opinion, MrÂ Sterckx has put his finger on the relevant areas.
We agree with most of his proposals, therefore.
The same goes for a number of proposals contained in the report by MrsÂ Ainardi.
As regards the functioning of the Agency, the development of the railways in recent decades has not produced what we had hoped.
The Agency should therefore provide the impetus for a new direction.
We should take this into consideration when it comes to the participation of the various parties concerned.
All in all, we have here a solid package that will hopefully enable us to create some scope for the sector to develop.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the treatment of these reports as a single unit named ârail packageâ, whereby various part-aspects of the railways issue are covered â for example safety on the Communityâs railways, the development of high-speed lines, the granting of licences to railway undertakings, and the levying of charges and the allocation of railway infrastructure â presents me with the opportunity of drawing Parliamentâs attention today, in the course of the discussion on the trans-European rail system, to the continuing blocking of the âIron Rhineâ dossier.
The Iron Rhine is an outstanding example of a European transport line that is useful to an open economy.
After all, the Iron Rhine in the Ruhr area of the German hinterland opens up not only the port of Antwerp, but also the ports of Ghent, Zeebrugge and Ostend.
The Iron Rhine already exists, and has proved its usefulness in the past, but it fell into disuse some decades ago because the costs of environmental adjustment, such as tunnelling in certain places, became much too high for the line to be made profitable in a short space of time.
This, however, is a bogus argument that the Dutch Government hides behind when continually blocking the matter.
Nowadays, however, Flanders feels the need to reactivate this railway line, in view of the growing problems with container traffic in Flanders, the Netherlands and Germany, which is growing at an exponential rate.
Germany, and more particularly the North Rhine-Westphalia, has been supporting Flanders for years in making this economically necessary call.
Unfortunately, however, the Netherlands is conducting a policy of obstruction in this matter, one that is dictated by its own plans to provide the port of Rotterdam with a modern connection to the Ruhr area via the extortionate and environmentally damaging Betuwe Line, from which, however, not a single European country stands to derive any economic benefit.
For years, therefore, the situation has been deadlocked in this way: this benefits no one, and has only resulted in great economic damage to the Flemish ports and to container traffic.
Now that Europe has formally recognised the importance of transnational railway lines, I should like to express my hope, as a Fleming and a , that a breakthrough â one that offers a satisfactory solution for all parties â be sought at European level in the Iron Rhine dossier that is so important to Flanders.
Â Â  Mr Sterckx on a point of order.
To which of the Rules of Procedure does your point relate?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I wish to make a personal statement.
I should like to point out that MrÂ Dillenâs group â his predecessors â when I proposed ...
Â Â  I must inform you that personal statements may be made at the end of a debate rather than during it.
Our Rules of Procedure are perfectly clear on that point.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on the work they have done and to wish them continuing success, because it is obvious that the conciliation procedure with the Council is going to follow.
I should like to focus mainly to start with on the question of the liberalisation of the railways, in order to make a number of political observations, in the belief that behind the discussions on individual amendments and technical arrangements we are losing the substance.
Ladies and gentlemen, shipping has been liberalised for a great many years now.
Road transport in Europe has been liberalised for a number of years now.
The same applies to air transport.
I think this is a paradox.
There is no justification for why the railways in particular should be shackled and why there should not be a single network and free competition at European level.
I should honestly like someone to explain this to me in good faith, not hidden behind the interests of certain groups or companies, but on the basis of the rules of common sense.
We must always bear in mind that we cannot talk about a single European market if we do not have a single transport network.
And unless the rail network is also liberalised, this cannot be achieved.
All the more so in that all the political powers of Europe want, theoretically at least, to promote the railways, because they are an environmentally-friendly means of transport.
Consequently, it is vital that we proceed with courageous steps in the field of liberalisation and I would honestly say to you that, if I personally had to decide what needed to be done on the railway market, I would liberalise it tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning, of course taking all the steps needed for safety rules, so that we have liberalisation at a high level with no risk to passengers, as is the case in air transport.
Having said which, I think it is absurd to continue this debate, which keeps putting the issue off and looks like a rearguard battle which quite simply, in my opinion, seeks to serve specific interests.
However, in all events, we need to operate here not on the basis of my personal wishes but on the basis of political consensus.
Parliament, for years at the vanguard of the liberalisation of the railways, is quite right to insist on the amendments made at first reading and I hope that, within the framework of the conciliation which will follow, we shall be able, with the Italian Presidency, to find the best possible result by December.
I hope that the Commissioner will help us with the statement she has made and which may be used as a final refuge so that, immediately afterwards, we can proceed to liberalise the railway market as far as passengers are concerned.
Thereafter, the permanent concern of Parliament, and obviously of our group, is safety.
That is why we talk in the Sterckx report of black boxes, as used on ships and in aeroplanes.
That is why we talk about European driving licences for train drivers, that is why, in the report by Mrs Ainardi, we raise the question of funding for interoperability, because we want interoperability at a high level and not at a minimum level, as the Council wants.
We shall proceed in this spirit, hoping that, by the end of the Italian Presidency at the end of December, we shall have the best possible result on the criterion of the liberalisation of the railway market, not because we consider it an end in itself, but because we believe that it is the best way of serving the European economy, European consumers and the workers themselves, in that more jobs will be created.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank all our rapporteurs for their work on a complicated yet important area within the transport brief, namely our railways and the future of our railways.
I would like to start with the issue of freight and what has been said about it.
In the area of rail freight, the rail industry is presently sitting in the 'last chance saloon'.
Unless we all pull together to develop rail freight on a European-wide scale â including opening up national networks, more progress on inter-operability and changes in the way the industry thinks and works â there will be no rail freight to defend or be worth mentioning by the year 2020.
It will have disappeared on to the roads mainly, with all the consequences that will entail.
So I start this morning with a friendly warning to the railway industry that unless it gets its act together, and unless we all work together in the area of rail freight, it will disappear in 20 years or so.
Of course, any action along those lines must be based on cooperation with the trade unions and the social partners.
A theme that my group has consistently pushed for, for many years now.
In that regard, I welcome some of the agreements recently undertaken between the ETF and the CER, particularly the issue of driving licences, as well as the commitment from the Commission to come forward with a proposal at the end of the year on that subject.
With regard to passengers, I would urge caution.
I note that my colleague Mr Hatzidakis says 'be bold'.
But the problem with that is that one country that decided to be bold with its railways some years back was the United Kingdom.
The result of that 'boldness' was a botched privatisation that caused absolute chaos in the railway industry and has caused the present government to spend a lot more money on the railways than was planned.
Yet we still do not have a better service.
That does not mean that we all retreat into our shells and say that the nationalised railway is the be-all and the end-all.
That clearly is not the case.
But we need to ensure that nobody makes the same mistakes as the United Kingdom.
Liberalisation of the passenger side must proceed step by step.
In that regard, our rapporteurs have produced a balanced compromise that everyone can live with.
We must all remember that providing a railway is not just about profit â it is also about safety â but it is also about service and service levels to the people that are supposed to be transported from one place to another.
In the end, people should come before profit but, sadly, that is not always the case.
Let me now focus briefly on Mr Sterckz's report which I shadowed for my group.
I would like to thank him for his work and, in particular, for his efforts to get a compromise solution that is acceptable to us all.
He should also be congratulated because the battle with the Council â indeed all our rapporteurs' battles with the Council â has made that work especially difficult.
I just want to say that everybody supports safety.
No politician is going to stand up here and say that he does not think safety is important, that is political suicide.
It is a matter of getting the balance right between what is practical and what we can do, as well as making sure that the safety levels we have are as high as possible.
Sadly, we have had instances on our railways recently where some standards have not been what they should be.
I again thank the rapporteurs and finish by saying to the railway industry that this is a crucial time for all railways in Europe.
For freight, this is the last opportunity.
I hope we do not throw it away.
Â Â  Mr Simpson, I should like to congratulate you on your second European act this morning.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to thank the rapporteurs with regard to the rail package.
They have done excellent work with respect to this important matter.
The rapporteurs have addressed the issue thoroughly, listened to various experts and committee members, negotiated, and sought viable compromises, keeping all the while to the main goal, which is to improve the competitiveness, safety and compatibility of the railways.
The proposal for a Railway Agency lends further support to this whole objective.
Now it is important for the Council not to put the brakes on the implementation of the reforms.
We have dawdled far too long in the development of the railways.
It is high time a competitive alternative with regard to railway transport were established.
Arguments for implementing the rail package have been put forward many times now.
Developing the railways means we can ease congestion on the roads and encourage environmentally friendly transport.
A workable railway system and moderately priced and competitive services are important both for congested areas and also the export industry in more remote regions.
The opening up of competition in freight and passenger transport will encourage the development of rail transport.
For this a viable package must be created, with a clear timetable too for opening up competition in the field of passenger traffic.
We must be able to make progress in the areas of technical compatibility and safety standards as well as other regulations, so that trains run throughout Europe speedily and safely, offering a competitive alternative for the transport of both freight and passengers.
MrÂ Sterckxâs aim for a high level of safety in rail transport will certainly have the support of everyone.
The role of the Member States in their adoption of national rules will also be important.
They should not slow down the long-term process of development, and Member States should obtain the approval of the Commission for new national rules.
For safetyâs sake it is also important for trains to be equipped with a black box and that the data compiled by the equipment and the way that data is processed are standardised.
The main task of the Railway Agency will be to promote best practice and facilitate cooperation between the players in the railway sector.
The various players in the railway sector must be involved in the work of the Agency but not every Member State can be represented on the Administrative Board.
The work of the Agency must nevertheless take account of the different conditions to be found in the Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Speaking both personally and as a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the left-wing group of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you in the clearest possible terms of the principles that must inform the assessment of this European rail package.
The first principle is that rail transport is a public service.
Where rail transport is still a public service, it must remain so. Where liberalisation has severely reduced its status as a public service, this must be restored.
The second principle is this.
Europe is a densely populated continent, with many urban areas.
It also has rural and mountainous areas affected by desertification. On our continent rail transport plays an essential role in national and regional development.
Only the railways can put a stop to two interrelated tendencies whose consequences are abundantly clear. On the one hand there is the unchecked concentration of people in urban areas and on the other the desertification of the countryside.
Together, they are laying waste to our land.
The third principle is as follows.
Rail transport is the only effective answer to the rapidly rising demand to transport more and more people and goods. It is also the only answer to the apparently contradictory but equally important need to preserve our environment and increase the quality of our lives.
These three principles are convergent and interlinked. These are the grounds on which my group and I oppose the compulsory privatisation of the railways.
We also oppose all decisions or measures seeking to regulate the rail industry solely by market forces. Countries that went down this road are in a worse position than those that did not.
They are in a worse position as lines have been closed. Worse, they have serious safety problems.
I am sure you know which countries I am referring to.
I need not name them.
On the basis of these three principles, our group opposed what I would term MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs compulsive desire for liberalisation.
This was also the basis for our rejection of the harmonisation of the networks as proposed in the SterckxÂ report. We would prefer harmonisation to be less of a herald of liberalisation.
We therefore endorsed the SavaryÂ report, concerning the creation of a EuropeanÂ RailwayÂ Agency. Representatives of employeesâ organisations would sit on its AdministrativeÂ Board.
Lastly, it was because of these three principles that we voted for MrsÂ Ainardiâs proposals. The latter provide for social and environmental issues to be taken into account and for high safety requirements.
Following the decisions of the Council after the first reading, and the recent votes in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we will again oppose liberalisation of freight transport by 2006 and of passenger transport by 2007.
We will establish our final position on the SterckxÂ report on the basis of the results of the vote on the amendments in plenary.
We will continue to support the reports and positions of MrÂ Savary and MrsÂ Ainardi. They are in line with the principles we hold dear.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the national States flourished in the nineteenth century, and that was partly thanks to the railways.
Well then, in the twenty-first century, Europe must finally be put back on the railways.
That is why this package is so important.
In the period between the debate at first reading and this debate, however, the facts have demonstrated that it is still too soon to support MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs high-speed rail system.
The Sterckx, Ainardi and Savary reports are more in tune with the needs of today.
My fellow MEP MrÂ Jarzembowski is impatient and is already arguing in favour of the accelerated liberalisation of passenger transport.
We are already seeing in a few countries the damage this can do to regional cross-border passenger rail transport.
Conventional international trains are being cancelled, for example.
Service is declining in those cases, therefore.
Surely it cannot be the case that, in a United Europe, non-TGV cross-border rail traffic, of all things, becomes much more expensive or even disappears.
I have already drawn the Commissionâs attention to this, in a parliamentary question, and, in its reply, it shares my opinion, calling this âan anomaly in the internal marketâ.
Try explaining that to the electorate.
Another pressing concern is the disappearance of, or change in, the range of international trains that is therefore not being identified.
I hope that the European Agency carries out a clear evaluation of this, and that we include this aspect in the debate on trans-European networks.
We shall vote against premature liberalisation without a framework of accompanying measures.
MrÂ Simpson has pointed out the potential consequences of this.
We propose awaiting the proposals that the Commission is going to make at the end of this year with regard to liberalisation.
That is the point at which we should hold this debate, MrÂ Jarzembowski, and I hope that we are still able to get through the first reading here, so that this work is not wasted.
Let us first concentrate on freight transport, however, as that surging flow needs to be put on the railways urgently.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the radical reform of the railways is based on a noble idea.
The initial aim was to put rail transport back on an equal footing in the face of the success of road transport. While road transport is cheaper and more practical in terms of accessibility, it also causes a great deal of pollution.
From my point of view, I would have preferred interoperability to be firmly implemented.
The advocates of this liberalism were spurred on by the Commissionâs initial proposal that national and international freight transport should be liberalised. They then set their sights still higher.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament made a higher bid and declared its support for opening up rail passenger transport to competition at the first reading.
Faced with the opposition of the Council, we are now witnessing an attempt to force this through at the second reading.
This is quite unacceptable especially as no impact assessment of the first package has demonstrated the benefits of excessive liberalisation.
Perhaps we would be afraid of the result.
As a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I cannot subscribe to Amendment No 2 or Amendment No 7. They take liberalisation too far.
Such liberalisation would particularly affect France. In France, international passenger transport accounts for 20% of rail passenger transport whereas the figure for other countries is between 2 and 7%.
The desertification of the least profitable areas of the country is inevitable.
What will become of life in country areas? These are of little interest to private operators looking to make a profit.
The concept of rail transport is that of a precious public service that contributes to social cohesion and to harmonious national and regional development.
Lastly, where liberalisation has been badly managed, there have unfortunately been more and more accidents, indicating a dearth of investment. It has even been necessary to renationalise in some cases.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been invited to decide at the second reading on the schedule for opening up freight rail services to competition.
The common position of the Council is 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006 for opening up international freight services and 1Â JanuaryÂ 2008 for national freight services.
No schedule for passenger rail transport has been established.
The Council has adopted a prudent approach taking account of the need to move ahead stage by stage.
On the other hand, our rapporteur advocates doing away with the schedule altogether. He proposes instead that all crossborder freight and passenger services be opened up as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006 and all services across the network as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2008.
We must question whether it is pertinent to lump everything together in this way.
There is a pressing need to address the underdevelopment of freight transport services affecting many countries. Freight transport tends to be characterised by poor service, prohibitive costs, archaic procedures and constant strikes.
This all means that timetables are not kept to. In this respect, the prospect of the appropriately staged liberalisation of services could provide a salutary incentive for national reforms, provided that the highest safety standards are upheld and that the existing quality of passenger services is not compromised.
It is necessary, however, to distinguish clearly between freight and passenger services.
In many MemberÂ States passenger rail services are instrumental in national and regional development. They also have public service responsibilities, which must not be sacrificed to hasty liberalisation.
A trend is emerging in certain railway companies.
They are passing their duty as public service providers onto local authorities.
They are also neglecting the equipment and networks providing important links between regions in order to concentrate solely on the most lucrative lines. It is important to ensure that premature liberalisation does not make this situation worse instead of better.
We must ensure that this decline is not accelerated instead of remedied. Premature liberalisation entails the risk of creating areas totally bereft of rail services and of aggravating regional inequalities.
This is not what the citizens of the MemberÂ States want.
It is not what the EuropeanÂ Union wants either.
We prefer the wise approach adopted by the Council to the haste advocated by our rapporteur.
We will therefore support the common position of the Council. This provides for access rights for passenger transport services to be addressed within the framework of the third rail package.
MadamÂ President, this work will be based on the conclusions drawn from a careful assessment of the first stage of the process. In this assessment, particular attention should be paid to safety, market share and rail freight volumes, the status of companies and employeesâ working conditions.
Â Â  Madam President, let me begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on their very hard work over a very long period of time.
It has been very important because the maintenance, safety and development of our railway system throughout Europe have to be encouraged and not discouraged.
Liberalisation is certainly inevitable; it has got to come.
Traffic has to come off the roads.
Taking traffic straight off roads and on to the railway can only be good for the future.
The development of high-speed trains has to be welcomed; it should not be stopped.
Where I come from â and I am going to be parochial for a little while â we are lucky to have any rail links left at all.
We have the Belfast to Dublin rail link, but we have hardly any rail links left in Northern Ireland.
TGV is not an option for us.
We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links.
Indeed, they are even trying to close the important link between Belfast and the port of Larne.
I just do not understand this.
At a time when we are going towards rail, here are people in my region trying to close down railways!
This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace.
It is not a solution simply to put more traffic and freight on to our roads.
This is a part of our problem.
While Northern Ireland may be a very small place compared to other European areas, we need and require railways in Northern Ireland as well.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs.
I believe most if not all of those present here today agree that the rapporteurs have done excellent work.
They are in fact working on the Council right down to the last moment.
They are still requesting greater speed in certain areas, and calling for approaches more in line with what we require.
I should like to start by saying it is essential to take account of four variables if the vital importance of the subject we are concerned with today is to be properly recognised and assessed.
The first is the serious situation European transport finds itself in at present, bearing in mind too the forecasts provided by all the studies received.
In no way can this be a measured legislative process.
On the contrary, essential urgent legislation is called for.
The second is the European variable as presented by the Commissioner.
It is crucial to the rationalisation of European transport.
Whatever its heritage, no State can attempt to resolve its transport problems without reference to this splendid and vitally important European variable.
This variable is essential.
There needs to be a holistic European approach to transport problems.
Thirdly, nothing other than an integrated analysis is appropriate.
It is essential to understand the situation of each of the forms of transport. They all need to be involved in the solution.
Railway transport is in a critical position in the context of the other forms of transport. This must be remedied.
Lastly, each individual form of transport is not important in itself.
What is actually important is interoperability between them.
I trust rail transport will receive a new lease of life thanks to these reports and proposals.
Unfortunately, although to date directives have operated efficiently in Europe, trains have not.
It should be stated unambiguously that our current mission is to save the railways.
That is what we are about.
As MrÂ Simpson clearly stated, the railways are in decline.
Parliament hopes to reinvigorate and strengthen them and get them back on track.
Liberalisation is the only way to do so.
The time for monopolies is past.
In a monopoly, the railway waits for freight to arrive on its doorstep. The employees sit tight in their offices.
That is how monopolies operate. By contrast, orderly, appropriate and socially responsible liberalisation involves going out to companies and local authorities in search of freight.
Freight has to be sought out.
I therefore believe that safety should be the only consideration governing the deadlines.
No other reason is sufficiently powerful to be allowed to delay liberalisation of the railways.
It has to be recognised that safety is vital. Delays could be tolerated in the interests of safety.
Safety must never be used as a pretext for artificially delaying the entry into service of the various sections, however.
Commissioner, these reports will highlight the importance of finance and bring it to the attention of all concerned.
The railways need finance.
There are no adequate budget lines for the purpose.
Parliament proposed setting up a European transport fund.
This proposal should be developed further in the next financial perspective.
Safety is certainly the crucial factor where the railways are concerned.
I would venture to remind you also, Commissioner, that road safety is another area of concern for us.
We would welcome an initiative by you to ensure that the European Road Safety Agency is presented at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jarzembowski report emphasises the importance of faster development of freight rail networks, giving particular consideration to cross-border issues.
In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the untenable situation of the Italian railway line between Savona and the border with France; a rail link connecting western Liguria with the Cote dâAzur.
This single trackÂ âÂ I repeat, single trackÂ âÂ line is a bottleneck for freight and passenger rail traffic, causing substantial damage to the economy of the area, which is dependent on tourism, olive-growing as well as the production of flowers and fruit and vegetables.
The single track also increases safety risks and such a shortfall in the rail system has repercussions on road traffic, with serious congestion problems and pollution in an area that is heavily geared towards tourism.
There has been talk of laying a second track since the 1950s, when I was still a small boy.
Since then, the situation has not changed and increases in the volume of traffic make it even more critical, almost unsustainable, due to the continual delays that are building up and also affecting the adjoining French section of the line.
Relatively recent works have moved further inland some sections of the railway lineÂ âÂ also single trackÂ âÂ that runs right along the coast and is therefore subject to coastal erosion.
This has worsened the state of affairs because it has caused further bottlenecks.
I will conclude with the hope that, as part of revitalising the international networks in the European Union, a speedy solution will be found by 1Â January 2006, the date set for opening the rail networks to all types of rail freight services.
Â Â  Madam President, I shall not get into the argument between the European Parliament and the Council about the pace at which rail transport is being liberalised, because, for everyone concerned, the objectives are the same, namely to turn Europeâs railways into a commodity providing large profits for predatory capitalist businesses such as BASF, Ikea and Connex, which is a subsidiary of Vivendi.
Far from learning the lessons of the liberalisation in Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere, the reports by Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx in fact propose only that liberalisation be speeded up and made the norm.
Not only international and national freight but also passenger traffic is from now on to be exposed to the laws of the jungle prevailing in the market.
The proposed standardisation will take place only on the basis of the lowest common denominator, to the detriment of high safety standards and in such a way as to encourage social dumping, as in the case of road transport.
This ultra-liberal position must therefore be rejected.
To adopt it would be, on a long-term basis, to turn our backs on the prospect of putting in place a European public rail transport service.
As an MEP, I shall not wait for the next disasters to be announced before joining forces at European level with rail users and railway staff to thwart these trends.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, thank you for the work you have done.
I should mainly like to focus on the development of rail transport rather than safety, interoperability and suchlike. In the first instance, these seem to me to be excellent reports.
The importance of this development of the railways to the environment and to safety is of course abundantly clear.
The first rail package was aimed at opening up freight transport, particularly internationally, and set a specific date.
We fought hard for that, and we actually agreed at the time that we would keep our hands off passenger rail transport until there was a separate document about it.
In my opinion, Parliament is going two steps too far: firstly, in going ahead and talking about liberalisation of countries at internal level, and, secondly, as regards the liberalisation of passenger transport, in particular.
If this is a lever for negotiations, I can understand it.
In my view, however, we should drop it immediately and wait until the Commission makes a proposal following a detailed evaluation of the situation in a number of countries, particularly in the UK (privatisation), the Netherlands and several other countries.
These are experiencing great problems as a result of splitting up companies.
It already starts with deregulation; it already starts with the division of companies.
As an industrial engineer, with knowledge of the way companies should be organised, I say that it is necessary to keep a firm hold on the maintenance of materials and other things, for example.
We should go back to that.
We should have an evaluation first, and then a debate on how to proceed with this kind of liberalisation.
I wholeheartedly support the position of the Council in this connection.
Â Â  Madam President, the proposal before us is to complete the liberalisation of rail freight services, increasing competition in those Member States that have yet to liberalise their markets.
In principle, some might view this as a positive development, since it could provide the UK with new market opportunities in other Member States.
However, even my limited experience has taught me to be cynical.
Whereas the UK market is largely open, according to single market principles, regrettably the same cannot be said for many other Member States.
France, Belgium and Luxembourg remain solidly against completing freight liberalisation.
The safety directive has introduced a European Railway Agency so that all national safety regulations henceforth can only be introduced by prior consultation and notification to the Commission, thus enabling the Commission to examine draft national rules and question them if it wants.
So out of the window goes any possibility of introducing urgent Member States' legislation if national rail safety so requires.
This, in my view, is yet another example of the nanny super-state, where Brussels supposedly knows best.
Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers!
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs on the substantive, good work that they have done.
The rail package makes a contribution to the liberalisation and modernisation of rail transport in Europe, even though work on this is not yet finished.
New EU rules provide the railway sector with a new framework.
Nevertheless, this sector needs to develop its own economic strength if it is to contribute to solving Europeâs traffic and transport problems.
If it does not, other modes of transport will finish the job.
The railways can still learn a good deal from them.
First of all, I should like to express my opinion on the report by MrÂ Jarzembowski about the development of the rail network.
In so doing I should like to thank him personally once more for his work as a rapporteur.
He deserves praise for striving for the complete liberalisation of freight transport byÂ 2006.
In view of the comparatively international nature of this mode of transport, it is a logical development that this market be opened up quickly.
As regards the European railway sector, there is still no genuine internal market in spite of efforts in the context of the common transport policy.
The railways directive has not led to a complete opening-up of the market.
The railways are still unable to compete with road, water and air transport in many cases.
The amendment of the Directive on the development of the Communityâs railways would, in my view, contribute to a positive development in this regard.
In addition, there must above all be a change in attitude in the sector itself, too.
The present rail package holds out the possibility of a genuine European rail transport market.
For example, granting what are known as âauthorised applicantsâ (consignors and forwarders) the right to use the services of the railways is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient use of the infrastructure.
The recent reports of forthcoming cooperation between the German, French and Italian operators of high-speed trains on the construction of train units are a signal that European cooperation is getting up steam; and now on electricity, too.
The momentum currently existing with regard to the rail package is not unconditional, however.
The European Council makes a more definite distinction than the European Parliament here between the liberalisation of freight transport on the one hand, and the liberalisation of passenger transport on the other.
In my opinion, the liberalisation of freight transport is more important than that of passenger transport at this time.
The liberalisation of freight transport must not fall victim to fighting between Parliament and Council on this matter.
It is of the utmost importance that we have a complete rail package by the end of the year.
I also hold the report by MrÂ Sterckx in high regard.
Maintaining high safety standards, whilst preventing the protection of abuses on our own market, is a good combination of priorities.
I also agree with the reports by MrsÂ Ainardi and MrÂ Savary.
Â Â  Madam President, the debate is very much centred on the notion of Europe being a continent.
So far, we have ignored the reality that there are some parts of Europe that are not connected by a land bridge or indeed rail tunnel.
I come from one of those islands, the island of Ireland that does not have a tunnel connecting the rest of Europe, or indeed a land bridge.
Much of the debate, therefore, about opening up rail links and so forth to some extent goes over our heads.
Having said that, we have a population of 4 million people, and we export 90% of our production.
We need good internal links between our major urban centres, and we need good links to our major ports so that our goods can be shipped out effectively and efficiently.
For that reason, I am quite keen on the idea the Commission recently mentioned â and perhaps the Commissioner might listen to what I have to say â in relation to 'motorways of the sea'.
This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold.
The other point I want to make is that rail internally, both on the continent of Europe and in Ireland, is important as a public service.
It is not going to be possible to ensure the free and fast flow of goods and people around the continent, or indeed on the island of Ireland, unless we have fast, efficient, safe and comfortable rail services, not only to and from our major urban centres, but also to provide cohesion in those parts of our continent whether there is underdevelopment.
The major financiers who would be interested in cherrypicking the key commuter belt rail services are not interested in providing rail services in the western corridor of the island of Ireland, for instance.
But that is essential if we are going to provide any kind of proper spatial development to ensure that the population does not drift entirely to the eastern coast.
These are aspects that need to be addressed.
This is why I am quite keen on the idea of the European Rail Agency proposed in the Savary report, because there are a lot of other aspects in this rail debate which need to be addressed, both in terms of the commercial life of Europe, but also its spatial development and the development of cohesion.
That, after all, is an objective of the Lisbon process.
Â Â  Madam President, by adopting the Jarzembowski report, Parliament, in collusion with the Council, would be pursuing its policy of demolishing the public service status of the vital sector that is rail transport.
In the majority of European countries, the rail infrastructure has in large part been put in place with state money, that is to say with taxpayersâ money.
Now that this infrastructure exists, a horde of private businesses is hurling itself upon this sector so as to be able to derive profit from it.
Apart from the fact that it is a case of fraud and of collective funds being misappropriated and directed towards private groups, it also constitutes a danger for the future.
The British experience has shown that, in order to increase their profits, private companies cut back on staff and make savings on infrastructure and maintenance, so putting passenger safety seriously at risk.
This also leads to stations being closed and unprofitable lines being done away with, even if they are essential to the population to which they provide a service and which then has no choice but to use the roads.
We reiterate our total opposition to the privatisations and to competition in rail transport.
Public transport must remain a public service, the objective of which is to provide the best possible service to our populations.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the realm of rail transport will not be solved by liberalisation but only by removing the obstacles to fair competition that are stacked up against the railways.
We urgently need an end to social dumping.
It is a scandal that the Italian Presidency of the Council is not putting the Markov report on its agenda.
It is a scandal that road and air carriers are still not required to foot the bill for the social costs of their respective transport operations; we need an internalising mechanism along the lines of the Swiss model.
The great demise of the railways, incidentally, is not confined to freight traffic.
Are you aware that even a privately operated passenger service such as the Thalys high-speed link between Paris and Brussels is not profitable?
In fact, all European passenger lines are running at a loss today, and liberalisation will not change that.
In other words, we need less ideology and more political action; we need investments in the infrastructure, financial compensation for anti-rail dumping on the basis of the model we have in the domain of renewable sources of energy, where we subsidise losses to compensate for the fact that producers of energy from non-renewable sources do not pay for their environmental impact, and, thirdly, an end to social dumping.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, the European Union has once again shown its support, in this joint debate on the second rail package, for the liberalisation of the railways in order to promote greater competition in this crisis-ridden sector.
In this context, I feel that rapid liberalisation of the rail sector in all the Member States would favour this mode of transport as a credible alternative to rail and road transport, and as a means of combating the explosion in these sectors, which have disastrous effects on the environment and on regional planning.
To my mind, this liberalisation can only be understood in the broad sense of greater competition in both the freight and passenger transport sectors, at both national and international levels.
This liberalisation will mean that any Community rail transport company will have fair and equal access to infrastructure in all the Member States for commercial ends.
As I have already had occasion to emphasise, however, we need to fight against a very widely-held prejudice: liberalising rail transport does not mean that safety standards cannot be stepped up.
This rail package actually enables safety regulations to be toughened, in particular by harmonising working times and rest periods for train drivers and other train staff performing safety tasks.
Since technology enables extremely high levels of safety, there is no good reason why legislators should be content to pass laws providing less protection for passengers.
For instance, installing black boxes on trains is another safety measure that I completely endorse.
Since these devices have proved to have clear benefits in the air and road sectors, in lorries and on buses, I cannot conceive of any justification for not applying the same technology on the railways.
I insist that safety must have top priority, and would also like to express my support for the establishment of a European Railway Agency, which would permit a higher degree of interoperability and safety of the various trans-European networks.
I cannot end this speech without levelling some harsh criticism at the EUâs new priority projects scheme, known as the Quick-Start Programme.
With a view to stimulating economic growth in Europe through large-scale projects, the Commission has drawn up a list of 13Â initiatives, seven of them linked to rail transport.
It is regrettable that the list only benefits transport networks in the centre of the European Union, failing to include the Iberian TGV links between Lisbon and Madrid.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, although it breaks with customary rail practice in Europe, we have accepted the idea of dividing the use of the railways between, on the one hand, those who run the rail network and, on the other, those who use the railways for transport purposes.
We have accepted this as a worthwhile experiment, partly because it is not beyond the bounds of possibility â although this is by no means proven â that it will help increase the amount of goods transported, and partly because it will enable a more detailed comparison to be made between rail and road transport, with the latter having, from the start, been familiar with the dual approach being introduced by the Community to the railways.
The same reasons have led us to oppose the ceaseless efforts on the part of the right to anticipate the possible parameters of passenger transport, the Commissionâs proposal, the current wishes of the Council of Ministers and, above all, the Commissionâs evaluation of experience, included by Parliament at first reading in the draft directive.
This constant push on the part of the right towards anticipating liberalisation demonstrates what we have persisted in saying, namely that, for many, liberalisation is only a back door to privatisation.
We have voted against such anticipation by rejecting MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs report, and we shall continue to do so.
In spite of the many and varied efforts made by MrÂ Sterckx, we have also voted against his report on safety.
In spite of many major improvements, emphasised by my colleague Mr Savary, Mr Sterckxâ report does in fact ratify what has been accepted by the Council of Ministers, namely the subordination of safety to profitability.
The fact that Europe â a little, a lot or passionately, depending upon the circumstances â contributes to making safety dependent upon profitability, even though experience clearly shows that liberalisation, by its nature, increases the risks, says a lot about the wayward liberal approach to European integration.
Acceptance of this notion is all the more dangerous in as much as, once it has taken root in the railway sector, it will spread like a cancer to the other means of transport.
For this reason, among others, my colleagues and I shall therefore also continue to oppose Mr Sterckxâ report.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I do not need to emphasise the importance of the vote on this second railway package and, above all, the importance of guaranteeing that this package is also soon adopted by the Council.
We all believe that we need to work to ensure that there is the necessary shift of demand for and burden on certain means of transport, road and air in particular, to avoid congestion and problems caused by excessive use, and subsequent overloading.
It is, to some extent, a question of moving from intentions to facts and to specific proposals, guaranteeing competitive prices, safety, reliability and, above all, the provision of the infrastructure and the investment needed to optimise the available alternatives, beginning with the railways.
Although it is necessary, I must honestly admit that I never thought that the opening up of the market and the processes of liberalisation would, in themselves, be the sole answer, a kind of a shortcut to a miracle.
They have to be subject to certain conditions: if we remove ideological pretexts and inflexibility, then we must recognise that they can help and facilitate these processes.
On certain conditions, of course: without a doubt, all aspects of safety, professionalism and the social protection that have to be provided for in the processes of opening up the markets and competition, are indispensable, precisely to avoid competition being achieved to the detriment of these factors and guarantees; in the same way, it is also necessary to increase the provision of universal services and services of public interest in order, once again, to prevent competition from concentrating investment and management interests solely in strong market areas where demand is high, disregarding the situations where the supply of services is crucial, rather, for encouraging and driving forward development processes, in other words to respond to what are actually inalienable needs for both freight and passenger transport services.
Subject to these conditions, there must be fixed deadlines for liberalisation, although not too short, because it is only under these conditions that it is possible to guarantee private resources are contributed to infrastructure investment projects.
Otherwise, they could be destined to be delayed because of the chronic difficulties that we have, as we know, in raising the necessary public funds to complete these processes.
We need to guarantee the principle of reciprocity in this context, as stated in the amendments tabled before Parliament, because we believe that this will avoid distortion of the market, which has already occurred in other liberalisation processes.
I hope that adequate solutions can be found which take into consideration these principles and choices in our negotiations with the Council too.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we speak of the railways, we are compelled to refer time and again to the relationship between service provision and liberalisation.
I must once more express my regret that we in Parliament have never managed to engage in a comprehensive discussion of this subject instead of focusing our deliberations on one mode of transport at a time, on the basis of the project under consideration.
Had we been able to have such a discussion, I believe we could have broken down certain prejudices that rear their heads in every debate.
As I see it, liberalisation is something that can only take place â and road transport, I believe, illustrates this very well â if we accompany it with supporting regulatory measures.
These measures relate to safety, working conditions, the right to practise a trade and other factors, including technical interoperability.
It is our task to make this happen, and what we have on the table today is, in my opinion, a considerable step forward which will enable us to discuss not only the liberalisation of rail transport but also accompanying measures that will meet the requirements to which I have referred.
Must liberalisation mean social dumping?
Not in my view.
Does it have to result in job losses?
Again, the answer is no.
And does liberalisation mean less safety?
Not at all, as I believe is very clearly illustrated in MrÂ Sterckxâs report .
Britain is not a good example for us, and no one in this House would want to follow it.
What we have tabled here relates to the very thing that was not done in Britain, namely proper preparation of the liberalisation process.
And let me say to the Members from Belgium and France that jobs are already being lost at the present time.
In my own country of Belgium, for example, the railwaysâ share of the transport markets is falling; in ten years the number of private sidings has fallen to a third of its former level; this means that the rail industry has not furnished proof of its efficiency, and as a result of this it has been gradually shedding jobs.
Anyone who warns us that jobs will be lost and forgets that they are already being lost now, when the railways are still in the public sector, has not, to my mind, assessed the situation fairly and objectively.
We have to grasp the nettle in our own countries too and acknowledge that our governments have been underfunding the railways and that we have not provided our rail operators with the resources they would need to organise tomorrowâs large-scale rail network.
We must also recognise that the wage bills these institutions have to meet are far too high and that national governments must intervene here too in the first instance.
I have no wish to become obsessed with dates, but I should like to point out that it would be bad for the railways and for our countries if we in this House did not set any deadlines, because we are convinced that tomorrowâs transport map will cover the whole of Europe, and this development must not be stopped in its tracks by special measures and special rules in the small countries.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs and the entire committee for their work.
The harmonisation and liberalisation of rail transport in the EU is an important step towards the aims of transferring more transport from road to rail and creating an integrated intermodal transport system.
In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, it is essential that the trans-European network projects affecting the eastern part of Austria should actually be implemented on schedule.
This infrastructure is needed to preserve the quality of life enjoyed by the population of those areas and to ensure that they remain favourably disposed to enlargement.
These are normal projects, relating to the rail and road networks and the Danube improvement scheme.
One word on a topical issue: we all know that every Member State has its own particular set of circumstances and its own problems.
May I therefore appeal again today to all those involved in the ecopoints negotiations to work out a compromise that is acceptable to all parties.
Â Â  . Â MadamÂ President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members who took the floor for their contributions.
A number of different approaches were put forward. Everyone seems to agree, however, that this is the last opportunity to give a real boost to the rail sector.
It is the last chance to make rail a competitive form of transport in the twenty-first century.
Thus, it is the last chance to ensure rail becomes a genuine alternative to road for freight transport.
That is the first task. It is being completed today by means of this second rail package.
The next challenge will be to make rail a genuine alternative form of passenger transport also.
We totally agree that a number of actors will emerge once the railways are fully integrated in the field, when a European railway network is in place and geographical integration a reality.
Competition will then come about. This will result in better services, prices and quality and increased competitiveness.
The need for funds was also mentioned.
Funds are required to carry out the necessary technological changes in the years to come. These changes will secure the existence of a Trans-European network transcending current borders.
In this connection I should point out that new proposals for amendments to the regulation give priority to this factor with regard to the Trans-European networks.
You will nonetheless be aware that in the context of the financial perspective after 2007, I am proposing an eight or nine-fold increase of the funds allocated to these networks.
I am actually proposing that in excess of EURÂ 4Â 000 million be set aside for this purpose each year.
The rail sector will certainly be a priority then, along with the accomplishment of a Trans-European railway network, or to put it in other words, interoperability.
Turning to the human factor, this is crucial.
We will be presenting the third rail package for passenger transport.
In addition though, we shall deal with the whole issue of qualifications, as I mentioned earlier.
I am sure we all realise safety is absolutely essential in the rail sector. It is essential for any form of transport.
The railways certainly have a fine tradition to live up to.
It is important to maintain and build on this tradition.
Indeed, it should be developed further and common criteria shared across the European network.
MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the House already helped to ensure the survival of the railways by supporting the first rail package.
This second rail package will allow Parliament to make a further contribution to ensuring that our railways do not end up as relics of the past.
They need to become the network of the future, dedicated to the service of society and of the common good.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs de Palacio.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I wanted to say this a minute ago, during the debate, straight after MrÂ Dillenâs speech.
In it, he made a passionate plea for the âIron Rhineâ railway connection between the port of Antwerp and the Ruhr area.
I wanted to point out that, when, a year or 18Â months ago, we discussed a Commission proposal to extend the TEN projects â a proposal which did not make it through in the end, and which has now been replaced by a new one â I tabled an amendment to include the Iron Rhine as a matter of priority.
I just wanted to put on the record that MrÂ Dillenâs predecessors abstained on that proposal back then.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, one undoubted reason why Members are so attentive is that they know that this report deals, among other things, with Eurostat, though not with the secret bank accounts but with the quite respectable matter of a proposal for a regulation which would require the Member States to submit quarterly data to Eurostat concerning financial transactions and financial assets and liabilities for all units classified in the general government sector.
The proposal regulates the compilation and characteristics of quarterly data on each Member Stateâs financing expenses and the timetable for their transmission.
In the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, these are crucial data, because they are the basis of a stable euro.
In the budgetary situation in which several Member States find themselves at the present time and in view of chronic deficits in excess of the 3% ceiling, these data assume even greater importance as a means of accurately measuring the extent of the problems with a view to taking appropriate remedial action.
The French, the Germans and others are already all too familiar with this situation.
My report contains an amendment with which we seek to alter two points in the Commissionâs proposal.
First of all, the deadline for the transmission of quarterly data for the central government, state government, local government and social security funds subsectors is shifted from 30Â June to 31Â December of this year.
This is logical, because June 2003 is now in the past.
Secondly, the Commission is to be given the right to grant a derogation, not exceeding two years, for the starting date of transmission of these data in exceptional cases.
This extension was requested in the Council by various Member States, and particularly by the countries that will be acceding to the Union next year, since these States would find it difficult, pending adaptation of their national statistical systems, to deliver reliable data on time.
Such an extension, however, is without prejudice to the aim of full transmission of all data by 30 JuneÂ 2005.
I move that this amendment be adopted, so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation, otherwise the regulation, which is already overdue, could not enter into force in good time.
There is, of course, the possibility that some people here might prefer to continue working with nebulous data in order to conceal their countryâs true financial position.
Nevertheless, the Italians would be delighted if they could add this to the list of regulations that have been adopted under their presidency.
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . This regulation seeks to impose on the Member States a requirement to forward quarterly data concerning financial transactions and financial assets and liabilities in the general government sector.
The main amendment aims to put back the first transmission of data to 31Â DecemberÂ 2003, to allow for the delay in approving this proposal.
It also ensures a derogation of two years for any government whose ânational statistical system requires major adaptationsâ.
Nevertheless, this regulation is clearly part and parcel of the guiding philosophy of the Ecofin Council of 18Â JanuaryÂ 1999.
That philosophy seeks to gather statistical information in order to ascertain the best way of controlling and coordinating economic policies, a concept linked, over and above economic and monetary union (EMU), to the issue of the Stability Pact.
In itself, however, having more statistical information is no bad thing.
The way such information is gathered or used might be.
Â Â  MrÂ Purvisâs report has the virtue of gently putting an end to exceptional arrangements for Corsica, which there is nothing to justify.
The French Government cannot, at one and the same time, conduct a merciless anti-smoking campaign and ask for the prolongation, in Corsica, of a privilege that helps promote nicotine addiction, particularly among young people.
Nor do metropolitan tobacconists understand this schizophrenic attitude at a time when they are having serious difficulties surviving.
In seeking to save 53 jobs, the French Government is making itself a party to the serious consequences of tobacco for our fellow citizensâ health.
It is making itself guilty of the failure to assist those whom it has a duty to protect.
That is why I shall vote in favour of Mr Purvisâs report.
Â Â  Part of a new initiative by the French Government, aimed at improving local economic development, the Commission proposal authorising France to prolong the application of lower rates of excise duty to tobacco products released for consumption in Corsica is by no means a privilege accorded to this French administrative department, a department that, unlike the neighbouring islands, no longer benefits, I am sorry to say, from the status of Objective 1 region.
These specific arrangements, enabling the additional costs of cigarette production on the island to be offset, are, in reality, a response to the pressing need to safeguard a sector of activity that generates a lot of jobs.
Indeed, tobacco products are retailed in Corsica by some 350 retailers employing an equivalent number of staff. Suddenly bringing the tax applied in Corsica into line with that in force on the continent would force half of the retailers on the island purely and simply to cease their activities.
That is why I shall not follow the rapporteur who, in only taking account of the interests of the internal market and in deliberately ignoring the problems linked to island status, is proposing tax arrangements totally inappropriate to the situation.
Â Â  . â On the whole, I support the derogations that are being put to the vote in favour of the so-called âoutermost regionsâ.
These derogations are justified on account of the endeavour to give those islands a starting position that is more comparable to the mainland, by compensating them for the inevitably higher costs of transport over long distances to the centre of the State of which they form part.
That kind of derogation does not apply in this case.
What is necessary to protect the Azores or Martinique is much less relevant in the case of Corsica, which is less remote.
Cigarettes are produced on that island and the price is kept down for local consumers and tourists.
TheÂ 32% tax is nearly half the rate applied in France, and also lower than the 57%Â minimum rate laid down for the EU as a whole.
This derogation is a remnant from the regime of the Emperor Napoleon I â who hailed from that island â fromÂ 1811.
Continuing this derogation until the end ofÂ 2009 is not in the interests of public health.
I certainly do not begrudge the inhabitants of Corsica, who speak a language other than French, greater autonomy and even the right of secession, but I am not willing to buy their favour by keeping the price of an unhealthy stimulant artificially low.
Â Â  . I voted against this report, even though I understand its aim of prolonging the application of a lower rate of excise duty on tobacco products released in Corsica.
I voted simply on a point of procedure: I believe that the European Commissionâs original proposal should have been considered first, since it is, of course, the result of proper deliberations in the course of negotiations with local businesspeople and representatives of the sector.
I feel that, as in other cases such as this, the specific requirements of the tobacco industry in the area in question â Corsica, in this case â should be taken into account, without losing sight of the general principles as a result.
The rapporteurâs proposal to initiate a gradual phasing out of the derogation scheme, in order to arrive at the same result by 2010, may theoretically seem reasonable, in terms of effectiveness.
It would, however, conflict with the principle of allowing local industry a period of time because it is less competitive due to its production costs, which have been proved to be higher.
It would also have a direct effect on a significant number of jobs being kept.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like firstly to express my pleasure at the fact that, after a long fight and a long journey, we have finally been able to make reason prevail and have saved the budget line relating to the prevention and combating of forest fires.
Following the summer of fires that we have experienced, particularly in Portugal, I think it would have been the last straw â and no doubt a disgrace â if the European Parliament had not shown its solidarity with all of Europeâs foresters who are subject to these risks of fire.
I should like therefore to thank all of our fellow MEPs.
Unfortunately, there was no way around these disasters or of avoiding a resolution by voting in favour of which all MEPs have agreed to join with the representatives of the Southern countries with a view to saving this budget line.
I hope that, beyond 2006, we shall be able to have a still more generous policy, for these EUR 9 million â although not to be sneezed at, especially when these credits are underconsumed â are probably not enough, given the formidable challenge of preventing fires in the Mediterranean forests and in those of southern Europe.
Â Â  We chose to vote in favour of compromise Amendments Nos 22 to 33 in the report concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus).
We are extremely hesitant about increasing the contribution of Community policy to forestry.
We believe that the basic conditions within the EU are so different that it is questionable what added value such a Community policy would have.
Nor should we ideally like to see fire prevention measures mentioned at all in this regulation, since such measures are out of place in this environmental monitoring programme.
Moreover, they would be in danger of stealing a lot of resources from other monitoring areas.
Fire prevention is instead a part of the EU regulation on rural development and should remain so in the future.
Â Â  The EU has no competence in the area of forestry policy.
In spite of this, the programme adopted by the European Parliament means that the monitoring of forestry, biodiversity and forest fires is being centralised.
We Moderates do not accept that the EU should be given competence for forestry policy by the back door.
European forests cannot be compared with each other.
Sweden and Finland at present account for 40% of EU forest production.
In Sweden and Finland, forestry is the most important industry economically and cannot be a European matter.
In these countries, we have a long tradition of looking after our forests in an economically and ecologically sustainable way.
Our forests do not present the same biodiversity as the forests in southern Europe.
That has to do with the natural basic conditions, because the climate is colder.
We do not believe that there is any reason for centralising forestry.
We are, however, able to support fire prevention activity.
Unlike air and water, forests are not a cross-border issue.
We Moderates will continue to protect the forests of Sweden.
Â Â  We have voted against the current report.
We do not believe that a forestry policy needs to be developed at EU level.
Issues concerning forest fires and how to fund the fighting of such fires are best dealt with at national level or through direct cooperation between the Member States affected.
Â Â  . It is unfortunate that the compromise adopted on forest fire prevention and financing for the Forest Focus programme did not live up to the rapporteurâs original proposals, which we supported.
Now, after the vote in plenary, the compromise has diminished the overall report, which contained deeper and more wide-ranging amendments on monitoring and developing forest fire prevention measures.
As we know, the aim of the compromise adopted is to ensure fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council, but the fact is that the funding for the programme has now been slashed by EURÂ 6Â million, whereas an increase of EURÂ 15Â million was originally proposed.
It is also unfortunate that the financing of prevention measures has fallen below the levels required and has no clear mandate.
Bearing in mind the disaster of the summerâs forest fires and the need to ensure that there is enough funding to preserve the forest legacy of the European Union, the reservations of the Council and of some national groupings within the European Parliament are incomprehensible.
This compromise is a far cry from the position adopted by the European Parliament in its resolution of 4Â SeptemberÂ 2003, on the effects of the summer heat wave.
Â Â  Fires have ravaged the dry regions of Spain, Portugal and the South of France, which have been the victims of this summerâs extremely low rainfall.
Other regions, such as the Vosges, have also been victims of the heatwave.
I am therefore in favour of including fire prevention in Forest Focus, even if, in my opinion, the best firefighting tool is still the regulation on sustainable development.
An entire section of the regulation deals with forestry, involving an annual subsidy of EUR 450 million.
In comparison, the Forest Focus budget seems very low. Following the COREPER compromise, only EUR 61 million have been allocated over four years to fund actions in the fifteen Member States.
Spread as thinly as that, this sum will not be very effective in preventing fires.
That will be all the more the case, given that measures designed to promote the harmonised collection, processing and validation of data and to improve the understanding of forests are to be added to fire prevention.
Forest Focus should, in my view, not replace or compete with the regulation on sustainable development but supplement it by providing for the gathering of data on forests.
In conclusion, the question arises as to the appropriateness of bestowing new remits upon a regulation that is already underfunded and overburdened. Are we really focusing on our forests?
Â Â  . The main question posed during the debate was this: should fire prevention be covered under the regulation on rural development, or should it be reintroduced into Forest Focus?
Fire prevention had actually been incorporated into the regulation on rural development in 1999 (see the chapter on forestry).
Our group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, rightly supports the rapporteurâs desire to include fire-fighting and fire prevention under the umbrella of Forest Focus, and to increase the relevant budget significantly.
Although some Member States, especially in northern Europe, where the climatic conditions largely preclude the fire problem, have indicated their opposition to this reinsertion, the horrifying spectacle of last summerâs fires imposes on Members the duty of voting for this increase in appropriations and for a âfire capacityâ.
That is why I voted in favour of this report, which I feel is a satisfactory compromise, further assisted by the amendments tabled to it and adopted.
Â Â  . Todayâs vote was the culmination of a lengthy Parliamentary process.
That process began at first reading, which took place in February.
Once again, I would like to congratulate (and thank) MrsÂ RedondoÂ JimÃ©nez for her excellent and tireless work.
I also welcome the great progress made in the positions of the Council and the Commission, progress which has allowed us to achieve a satisfactory compromise based on draft amendments supported by my group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, among others.
Those draft amendments will leave their mark on the final text of the regulation.
Recalling the issues we have fought for hardest in the process of adopting this Forest Focus programme, they are: greater budgetary openness, respect for the principle of subsidiarity, and above all inclusion of the line on forest fire prevention.
It would, of course, be incomprehensible if, after so many years of positive steps under the previous regulation, Forest Focus were now to neglect the field of forest fire prevention.
More than that, in fact, it would be totally intolerable, given the striking lessons imparted anew last summer by yet another ruinous disaster.
I wanted this regulation to go further, but, all things considered, and taking into account the need to avoid wasting the whole of 2003 on the delays and uncertainties of a conciliation procedure, I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission have heeded Parliamentâs reiterated demands in the most important areas.
Â Â  I have voted against the report because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the EU really does not have, or should not have, its own forestry policy.
The purpose of the report is, therefore, in the first place to appropriate EU funds (EURÂ 67Â million or slightly more than SEK 600 million) to Portugal and Spain in connection with the forest fires by which these countries are often hit.
That is certainly a lawful aim, but it is scarcely a European matter to provide economic aid in relation to forest fires generally.
Â Â  The Redondo JimÃ©nez report provides a precise account of the state of our forests but does not, unfortunately, propose practical solutions either for protecting them or for ensuring that they are monitored.
As an elected representative of the Provence-Alpes-CÃŽte dâAzur region, I was appalled by the forest fires which, this summer, destroyed more than 60Â 000 hectares of land in France, mainly in the Var and Haute-Corse administrative departments.
It turns out that the vast majority of these fires are of criminal origin.
Penal sanctions against the arsonists and those behind such acts should therefore be strengthened.
Everyone involved, all of whom have also agreed upon the need to step up prevention and to strengthen the protection of forests as a national heritage that we have to administer jointly, wants to see the criminalisation of these acts.
We also believe that human activities carried on in our forests need to be considered a public service of general interest and that, given their non-profitability, they therefore need to be supported financially.
Forest owners should also be offered tax breaks and financial incentives to encourage them to clear brushwood and carry out maintenance work.
âPrivate forester-firefightersâ could do this work.
There we have a genuine environmental policy.
I should like to conclude by asking a questionÂ : will France, like Portugal, be entitled to aid from the new European Solidarity Fund?
Â Â  MrÂ President, we were in the future and you, MrÂ President, had become honorary President of the great Pensionerâs Party, which had 30% of the vote across Europe.
You came up to me, as honorary President, linked arms with me and said: âDear Mr Fatuzzo, you not only have to vote, and I advise you to vote, for MrsÂ deÂ Sarnezâs report that provides for the Erasmus Mundus masters for cultural exchanges between young people, but you must also propose the foundation of the Fatuzzus Mundus senior mastersÂ âÂ I repeat: Â âÂ so that there can be intercultural exchanges between pensioners, who would dearly love thisâ.
Will this remain a dream?
Â Â  . Following negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the rapporteur tabled amendments to her recommendation for second reading, in order to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme would be equipped to achieve its desired ends.
This programme is an essential instrument for exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education.
Any measure enabling it to be effectively implemented, therefore, deserves our support.
Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses should be synonymous with quality.
They should, therefore, be selected on the basis of the quality of the training on offer, as well as the hosting provided for students.
One of the principal objectives of this programme is to promote linguistic diversity.
While attending a Masters Course, students should have the opportunity to use the languages of at least two of the countries where the institutions involved in these courses are situated.
The financial framework for implementing the programme is essential to its success.
The Council agreed on a budget of EURÂ 180Â million.
This amount, however, is insufficient and that is why we support the request for appropriations totalling EURÂ 230Â million.
Â Â  In proposing 250 inter-university European Masters with a quality label (âErasmus Mundus Masters Coursesâ) and with the support of the European Union; in awarding scholarships for 4Â 200 postgraduate students from third countries; or, again, in offering scholarships for 1Â 000 scholars invited from third countries to Europe, the stakes have been set high, and the budget should be commensurate with these.
If, clearly, the budget made available for this new instrument must not in any way put a strain on the budgets for the existing programmes, it remains no less the case that the budgets initially provided for by the Commission (EUR 200 million) and by the Council (EUR 180 million) are far too niggardly to give full scope to this new instrument of exchange and cooperation within the field of higher education.
Now, the stakes are high. It is, in fact, a question not only of forging closer links between the European universities but also of boosting the competitiveness of higher education provision by making it more attractive to students and teachers in the rest of the world.
The linguistic stakes cannot be ignored. It is a question of emphasising both the importance of the EUâs linguistic diversity and the need for third-country students to know at least two EU languages.
Â Â  . Although the European Parliament agrees with the Commission on this issue, it wants to increase the budget to EURÂ 230Â million, compared to the Councilâs proposal of just EURÂ 180Â million.
It should be noted that this programme goes beyond the standard Erasmus scheme, since it covers Europe and the rest of the world, as well as Masters and postgraduate courses.
As we know, the underlying argument proposes to integrate European higher education systems to form a European education market, where postgraduate courses will have a particularly prominent role to play.
On the other hand, we already know from our experience of other projects, particularly the traditional Erasmus programme, that less well-off students tend to be doubly discriminated against and alienated by these schemes, which fail to reimburse all the costs.
My point is that the difficulties encountered in increasing the amount of funding for this programme prove that there is no intention of fighting such discrimination and that a set of conditions to which we object is going to be retained.
What we really need to know is not so much which universities will teach courses like these as who will be taught on them.
The amounts earmarked for scholarships and to the âquality of the hosting provided for studentsâ, already mentioned here, still fall well below what is required in order to broaden the social base from which Erasmus students and teachers are drawn.
That gives us cause for regret.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that the priorities of a more mutually supportive European Union, one which is genuinely mindful of the needs of the rest of the world, should include enhancing the quality of higher education and promoting intercultural understanding through cooperation between Member States and with third countries.
To that end, I feel it is crucial both to establish knowledge networks and partnerships which transcend the borders of the European Union, and to award multiple qualifications involving various higher education institutions in different Member States.
The establishment of âErasmus Mundus Masters Coursesâ is hugely important.
These courses will set uniform standards of achievements and excellence, with the European Unionâs seal of approval.
The importance of the Unionâs linguistic diversity will be reflected in the need for third-country students to be familiar with at least two European Union languages.
The proposal to increase the programmeâs financial framework so that it can achieve its aims deserves particular support.
Erasmus Mundus really does offer âa new vision of higher education in Europeâ, by allowing foreign students to undertake a âEuropean tourâ.
When existing exchange programmes come up for review, it is important that this new dimension of European higher education be taken into account.
Â Â  By adopting today a new instrument of exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education, we are sending out a positive signal to students and teachers in third countries in the rest of the world that we are outward-looking and welcoming.
This Erasmus Mundus programme offers a new vision of higher education in Europe, enabling foreign students to make a âtour of Europeâ in two or three different universities, including those entered by competitive examination.
Thanks to the title, âErasmus Mundus Masters Courseâ, it will be possible for the training proposed by the European Union easily to be recognised in all countries.
Students will therefore be guaranteed a warm welcome and high-quality training.
We must make our higher education attractive.
The promotion of linguistic ability, before and during the periods spent here by students and academics from third countries, must be strongly encouraged.
We sincerely hope that the Council will put its weight behind the budget of EURÂ 230Â million proposed for this programme, a budget that should be equal to the ambitions of the latter.
Indeed, almost 4Â 000 students from third countries and almost a thousand academics should benefit from this programme between now and 2008.
In my report on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, I drew attention to the Bologna Declaration of June 1999, to the effect that â[t]he vitality and efficiency of any civilisation can be measured by the appeal that its culture has for other countriesâ.
Â Â  I was in Paris MrÂ President.
A night at the a cabaret, dance, topless dancers, with feathers as appropriate.
Fantastic!
There, in the middle of these hundred dancers, the only male dancer appeared.
I looked at him: it was MrÂ Mauro, who was dancing with the gracefulness of Fred Astaire and was singing with the voice of Frank Sinatra.
Then, at one point, the music stopped and MrÂ Mauro, dancer at the turned to me and said: âe-twinning of universities: that is what my document will achieve.â
Could I vote against this report, MrÂ President, after MrÂ Mauroâs exploit?
Â Â  . It is to be welcomed that the Councilâs common position on the Learning Programme outlined the same priorities as were approved by the European Parliament at first reading.
The overall budget of EURÂ 33Â million proposed for the programme by the Council, however, is not satisfactory.
If there are insufficient funds, the successful implementation of the programme will be undermined, and it will be impossible to begin it in good time.
The sum of EURÂ 44Â million has now been proposed as a minimum appropriation.
This amount is reasonable and adequate, bearing in mind the aims we want to achieve.
The overall aim is to encourage the integration of the new information and communication technologies into European education and training systems, thereby enabling:
- greater intercultural dialogue;
- awareness of languages;
- development of lifelong learning;
- exchanges of good practice.
I voted in favour, since this programme provides the impetus needed to achieve the knowledge-based society to which we aspire.
Â Â  We quite obviously want education and training systems to benefit from Information and Communication Technologies and, in short, from everything implied by the European Learning Programme.
While the European institutions set great store, however, by programmes presented as being at the forefront of progress, the education of working class children, even at elementary level, is in decline everywhere in Europe.
To take only France as an example, there is an increase in illiteracy and a decline in the ability to speak correctly and to do simple arithmetic.
The reasons are simple: a shortage of funds and a lack of teachers, teaching assistants and various teaching support staff.
Governments prefer to shower the employers with subsidies, while reducing the social budgets, including that for state education.
If high technology is perhaps making a little progress in the classroom, state education is in decline for lack of resources.
For that reason, a whole generation of children and young people from working class backgrounds and environments is being deprived of the minimum of education, not even to mention an education worthy of the name and commensurate with the wealth of the continent, for, in this area as in all others, it is the working classes who pay the price for the anti-social choices of governments serving only the privileged and affluent classes.
Â Â  . This report enshrines the plan to pursue and entrench the policy of destructuring both training methods and the means of producing teaching and learning products (which now fall within the multimedia industryâs sphere of competence).
This is happening in response to the so-called example gleaned from the experiences and policies of countries that have gone further along the path of privatising schools and of commercialising education.
There, the companies that provide such goods and services are more experienced and have already accumulated considerable economic weight and cultural influence.
This reportâs support for measures that destructure modes of formal education, and in particular education, comes to the fore at various points.
These measures combine with the under-funding of educational institutions to help dismantle public education systems.
In addition, they pave the way for private organisations to supply informal educational methods such as distance learning, whose value as an educational qualification is meaningless, and also for the contracting of workers trained in such informal âeducation systemsâ.
Doubts remain as to the composition of the Commissionâs advisory committee, though it will, naturally, include âexpertsâ, thereby circumventing governmentsâ representative authority.
The rash of programmes such as Learning, Leonardo, Socrates, and so forth, tend to reduce the room for manoeuvre, the authority, of each Member State, each educational institution.
These programmes reduce the purpose of education itself to a supporting role, or to being a means to some other end.
Â Â  . I congratulate MrÂ Mauro on the legislative resolution on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council decision on a multiannual programme (2004-2006) for the effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (Learning Programme).
I fully support this resolution, particularly regarding the need to encourage the integration of new information and communication technologies in education and training systems in Europe, thereby improving the quality of those systems and access to them.
I would also like to emphasise that I believe the European Parliamentâs efforts to increase the overall budget for this multiannual programme to be totally justified.
This is the only way to achieve the programmeâs objectives and ambitions.
Â Â  . Like the rapporteur, I believe that social cohesion and intercultural dialogue are among the European Unionâs aims.
If fostered and achieved, they will allow us to bridge the âdigital divideâ, which stems mainly from a failure to encourage lifelong learning, the speed at which technology is advancing and the economic (and also physical) difficulties of many citizens.
I do not underestimate the need to recognise that education has a European dimension.
That European dimension justifies more structured cooperation between Community programmes and instruments on the one hand, and, on the other, the actions of the Member States.
I would make one exception, however: such cooperation cannot involve any interference with the freedom of Member States to determine the content of educational programmes, otherwise for dialogue between cultures will be replaced with a single mode of thought.
The effective enhancement of goods and services, guarantees of effective dissemination and exchanges of good practice are reasons to support the rapporteurâs proposal to amend the quantity of budget appropriations for the multiannual programme, and will also make it possible to promote genuine integration of the new information and communication technologies in education and training systems in Europe.
I welcome the support given to the creation of European virtual campuses and to the -twinning of European schools.
More than political declarations or legal and institutional constructs devised behind the backs of nations and Member States, these measures will assist with the gradual construction of a truly pluralist European spirit.
It goes without saying that I voted in favour.
Â Â  I was on holiday, bathing at the seaside.
On the beach, I saw MrÂ Maaten, tanned, a great swimmer and a surfer, but still an MEP and a politician.
At one point, in fact, he held a meeting, giving a speech to retired swimmers who had rushed in their numbers to hear him.
He spoke about his directive, he said that he wanted clean waters, and everyone was listening to him.
I, however, saw that he was glancing towards the sea where there were some beautiful bathers, buxom like the lifeguards in Baywatch, and his eyes were constantly following them.
Then, I had a doubt: was he not calling for clearer and more transparent waters so that he would be better able to see the beauties that swim in these waters?
The suspicion persisted, but still I had to vote for the motion.
Â Â  We chose to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 76 and 19 and against, for example, Amendments Nos 5 and 7.
That is because we believe that the definition of bathing water must be simple and clear and afford as little room for interpretation as possible.
It is very unsatisfactory for legal certainty that the directive does not contain a simple and clear definition.
Nor do we believe that an unmanageable number of bathing areas should be covered by the directive.
Furthermore, we are opposed to extending the scope of the directive to include water activities in addition to bathing.
That would place unreasonable demands upon the local authorities, which would then also have to take samples in connection with various sports, which might also have much longer seasons than the actual bathing season.
Finally, we should like to see transitory contamination mentioned in the directive, but with a clear definition of what is meant by transitory contamination, together with a restriction upon the permitted period for such contamination.
When the outcome of the vote was not as we had wished where these important points were concerned, we chose to vote against the proposal for a directive in the final vote.
Â Â  Water quality is an important environmental issue, and it was therefore important and commendable that the EU should have adopted a framework directive on water, 2000/60/EC.
The framework directive establishes the general framework for protecting all types of water (water in rivers and lakes, together with coastal and groundwater).
It is not, however, important that the EU should have a directive regulating the quality of bathing water.
That is an example of the EUâs being unnecessarily detailed in regulating matters that are not even cross-border in nature.
We would instead emphasise the autonomy of local authorities and the Member States in this area.
Â Â  I abstained from voting on the proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water.
I do not think that this directive is really necessary, in any case not with such a wealth of detail.
This is bureaucratic Europe in all its splendour.
Does not the principle of subsidiarity exist to leave responsibility for the quality of bathing water to the national or regional authorities?
Â Â  . â Many in this Parliament believe that the EU should concern itself less with the protection of health at the workplace or with environmental pollution.
That became clear earlier, in the course of the voting on my proposals regarding substances harmful to health, such as asbestos and solvents in paint.
EU involvement is limited to exerting pressure for a reduction in the costs of health care, and to implementing the Stability and Growth Pact that is to support the value of the euro.
Only when I pressed for far-reaching measures to counter the advance of the new disease SARS was there short-lived support for a more active policy.
Today, we are talking about the quality of bathing water, which, at first glance, is the kind of thing that would only be a matter for municipalities and provinces.
Now that many people are bathing and swimming in lakes and seas far from home, however, there is good cause to introduce international safety standards.
It is notable that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is proposing to reject the report on this by the ELDR rapporteur, and thus also, of course, the Directive aimed at protecting the quality of the environment and human health against chemical and microbiological contamination.
In addition, more amendments aimed at lowering the standards for contamination are being kept in reserve in case that fails.
I have recommended that my group cast a âyesâ vote after these attempts at dilution have been rejected.
Â Â  . Portugal is synonymous with a high-quality travel industry.
One hundred and sixty-nine Portuguese beaches unfurled blue flags in 2003. There were 47 in the Algarve alone, including one riverside beach.
These results prove the high degree of quality and commitment shown by local authorities in their management of the coastline, particularly with regard to basic sanitation, water supply and pollution.
Apart from technical and scientific improvements in water management, it behoves us not to forget one recent development.
Tourism has created new recreational activities for holidaymakers.
Apart from bathing, there are now activities such as surfing, windsurfing and sailing.
In the Algarve, these sports are becoming more popular all the time among young people.
Although these new activities are practised further out from shore, I feel that they ought to be protected under the new regime.
I would argue, therefore, that the definition of âbatherâ should be extended to include not just swimmers in the strict sense but also those taking part in water sports.
Finally, I would like to draw attention to one more fact, gleaned from my own experience as a mayor.
Health and water quality are important enough to justify a public information campaign.
This, however, is the joint responsibility of the EU, its Member States, the regions and local authorities.
Local authorities alone cannot shoulder the financial burden of ensuring that water quality remains high.
That burden includes the financial losses suffered in areas where water quality temporarily falls below the required standard.
Â Â  . I cast my final vote against this report on the European Commissionâs document designed to update a Directive on bathing water dating from as long ago as 1976, no less.
I agree with many of the amendments tabled in it, however.
In particular, I agree with public information on standards of water quality, to be delivered via a simple and universal system of signalling, involving symbols.
This would be implemented by the enforcing authorities and tourist information offices, and would include sites where urban waste water is discharged near the bathing area.
With regard to the languages in which the information should be made available, on the other hand, it is unfortunate that the rapporteur did not pursue to its logical conclusion the principle he formulated in this connection.
I believe it is essential to provide such information in a range of languages, not just in English and French.
I also voted in favour of draft AmendmentÂ NoÂ 19, on the question of transitory contamination.
There can be no doubt that the issue of protecting bathers is of fundamental importance to public health, and also to how well tourists are received in Europe.
As I feel that the text is too intrusive and fails to show sufficient respect for the principle of subsidiarity, however, I was unable to support it overall in the final vote.
Â Â  Making the EU rules on bathing water more stringent and then extending them to cover water sports is symptomatic of an inability to leave things alone.
Instead, these should be the local authoritiesâ and the Member Statesâ own areas of responsibility in accordance with the proximity principle, because it is only in a few cases that waste water gives rise to problems across the national borders.
How are these ill thought-out, centralist and expensive EU rules to operate in purely practical terms, and how are they to be funded, in a country like Sweden with its 95Â 000 lakes and hundreds of miles of coast?
Together with the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have voted ânoâ in the final vote and supported AmendmentÂ NoÂ 59 about rejecting the Commissionâs proposal in its entirety.
With a view to limiting the directiveâs administrative and economic consequences for the Swedish local authorities, I have signed AmendmentÂ NoÂ 76, which was voted down: in order to be defined as such, the bathing areas concerned must have âmore than 100 bathers a day for at least 20 days a yearâ and âhave been designated as bathing water by the competent authoritiesâ.
Â Â  This morning, I flew to Strasbourg on the plane that leaves Milan Malpensa at 7Â a.m.
A little sleepy, I found myself in a car with MrÂ Napolitano and MrÂ Fiori, who like me were flying from Milan; I half-closed my eyes and I had a kind of vision.
What did I see MrÂ President?
I saw that we were in Europe in 2050: there were beautiful flowers everywhere, every colour under the sun, so much green; kind people, with kind hearts, there were no more wars; everyone lived happily amongst the flowers.
I stopped a person who was passing byÂ âÂ and, what a coincidence, it was MrÂ Sacconi, the rapporteur for this reportÂ âÂ who said to me: âSee, despite everything that has been done in the past, the greenhouse effect has increased, it has grown and grown.
The whole earth has become a hothouse full of flowers, like the type used by people who want to cultivate flowers, and, in this way, all humans have become better people.â
Therefore, I did vote in favour of this report, but I have a doubt, MrÂ President: would it not, perhaps, be better to let the greenhouse effect increase and let things take their natural course, even with the help of mankind?
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal aims to establish a framework for a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions, with a view to implementing the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Of the many different issues at stake, it might be worth emphasising the following:
- measures which encourage a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in an objective, rational manner are much-needed and positive, but it is just as important to emphasise that reduction as a goal must not be mystified or made into a big deal;
- the Commission has stated its aim of attempting to establish the right conditions for creating an emissions allowance market, by means of a Community scheme for managing pollutant emissions.
The Commission, moreover, is seeking to take centre stage yet again in overseeing the extent to which each country is meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
The European Parliament is acting, yet again, to stall these plans, ensuring that Member States retain their prerogatives in this area and in respect of their international obligations.
In conclusion, no solution to the grave threat of air pollution can be envisaged without the necessary research into other sources of energy, such as renewable ones.
Â Â  This new debate on the monitoring mechanism of Community greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is in danger of being nothing but a further series of pious hopes if a proactive approach with an element of compulsion is not adopted on this issue.
We have voted in favour of the amendments aimed at making the mechanism more coercive and rigorous, because the climate situation, as tragically demonstrated by the recent heatwave, requires more than half-measures.
Over and above the simple regulatory aspect, we have, however, a duty to reflect upon alternative models of development and production.
We cannot let the market impose laws and criteria that make production the be-all and end-all.
We need, on the contrary, to make these issues the subject of a genuine choice reflecting the view of society as a whole and, therefore, to give some thought to an alternative transport policy in Europe, edging out road transport, which produces a lot of greenhouse gases.
We need, by way of continent-wide public policies, to develop public transport for travel by rail, sea and river.
We need to go a step further in ecological terms, both in the production process and in forms of consumption.
Other energy choices are needed in the end, beginning with energy savings, an end to nuclear energy and the search for non-polluting and renewable energy solutions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, which is part of the European Communityâs strategy for complying with the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the Kyoto Protocol.
I would remind you that it was decided at Kyoto that the Union must reduce its gas emissions in the period from 2008 to 2012 by 8% compared with the 1990 levels.
Adopting this monitoring mechanism, in the form in which it is proposed here, is a basic condition for complying with the targets the Union has set itself in terms of sustainability, first at Copenhagen and then at Lisbon.
From now on, moreover, adopting the mechanism appears a more realistic possibility, and more workable in practical terms.
It is quite true to say that it will only be possible to fulfil the commitments entered into at Kyoto if the information relayed by each Member State is complete, timely, transparent and comparable, and if national inventory systems are introduced at the same time.
Good progress has been made, then, by tabling amendments to the analytical methods and cooperation procedures, introducing more precise (and reliable) provisions on the frequency of data submission, and requiring that only data which is of interest at Community level will have to be provided.
In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the European Commission has undertaken to submit a Community greenhouse gas inventory to the Secretariat of the above-mentioned UNFCCC by 15Â April each year.
Â Â  Mr President, I could not fail to vote in favour of this important report by MrÂ Lange on reducing emissions of gaseous pollutants.
It is excellent, I had to vote in favour of it, but I have seen that, after the incident which took place in Parliament with MrÂ Schulz, the President-in-Office of the CouncilÂ âÂ MrÂ BerlusconiÂ âÂ does not miss an opportunity to listen to all the Members who speak in this House.
After listening to and watching MrÂ Lange, MrÂ Berlusconi declared that he had prepared a film in which he saw him as the protagonist.
MrÂ Lange was, however, luckier than MrÂ Schulz, because the film was a remake of âGone with the Windâ, because of the resemblance between MrÂ Lange and Clark Gable.
Oh, how I envied and I continue to envy MrÂ Lange who is to be part of this film, a remake of âGone with the Windâ, as the new romantic Clark Gable!
Could I vote against it, MrÂ President?
Â Â  . Given the demands of sustainable development, which is one of our goals, and the widespread advocacy of âcross-complianceâ requirements in every sphere of the Unionâs economic activity, determined efforts, such as those proposed here, are needed in order to reduce air pollution.
I have always maintained that a European freight transport policy favouring railways and inland waterways, together with coastal shipping lanes, should be championed over main roads.
It is important, furthermore, to set stricter limits for emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants from vehicles favoured under such a framework, especially barges and locomotives.
In this way, these types of transport will become even more firmly established as the most beneficial and appealing of all.
Finally, as the rapporteur suggests, I believe it is absolutely crucial to understand that we need more than just stricter limit-values if we are to achieve our air quality targets.
We also need realistic test procedures, which will, of course, require the adoption of clear rules governing how operators gather and analyse information.
Such rules are the only way to avoid distortions of competition, and they will come into force through the creation of an internal market based on genuinely sustainable growth.
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  I am sure that Mr Lange will be delighted to know that he looks like Clark Gable.
That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)

Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A5-0349/2003 by MrÂ Mulder, on behalf of the CommitteeÂ onÂ Budgets, on the draft general budget of the EuropeanÂ Union for the financial year 2004, SectionÂ III, Commission (C5-0300/2003 â 2003/2001(BUD)).
- A5-0350/2003 by MrsÂ Gill, on behalf of the CommitteeÂ onÂ Budgets, on the draft general budget of the EuropeanÂ Union for the financial year 2004, SectionÂ I, European Parliament, SectionÂ II, Council, SectionÂ IV, Court of Justice, SectionÂ V, Court of Auditors, SectionÂ VI, Economic and Social Committee, SectionÂ VII, Committee of the Regions, SectionÂ VIIIÂ (A), European Ombudsman, SectionÂ VIIIÂ (B), European Data-Protection Supervisor (C5-0300/3002 â 2003/2002(BUD)).
Â Â  . â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I can tell you that the result we now have regarding the budget, following the vote in the Committee on Budgets, very much resembles the budget guidelines that we adopted at the start of this year.
What have the main issues been up to now from the point of view of Parliament?
We want to make a success of the integration of the new Member States into the European Union.
Enlargement must succeed, and that is why we have been saying right from the outset that the 25Â countries must be dealt with in a single budget.
