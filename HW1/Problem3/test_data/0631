3) Ultimately, particularly where budget carriers are concerned, it might be preferable to require airlines to offer consumers the option of paying a separate insurance premium, on top of the price of their ticket, thereby guaranteeing them compensation for cancellation and delay beyond the airline's control.
. (PT) This report is in line with the process of liberalising the electricity and natural gas markets and takes account of the decisions of the Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils, advocating the new guidelines for these sectors following the decision to liberalise.
It therefore states that, as a rule, the construction and maintenance of infrastructures in the energy sector should be subject to market principles.
This exerts pressure for the sector's privatisation, including its infrastructures, and this is something we do not agree with.
Although the rapporteur claims that the aim of competition and completion of the internal energy market should be implemented in such a way as to allow for universal service obligations, the options it favours for supporting the funding of priority projects, even in tricky areas, cannot exceed 20% and then only in exceptional cases.
Nevertheless, it goes further than the Commission proposal, which was only of 10%, but only mentions the construction phase, which remains subject to the non-distortion of competition between undertakings, which means advocating liberalisation in this field too and subjecting it to the criteria of economic rather than social benefit.
The proposal we are today debating and voting on, revising the guidelines on the Trans-European Energy Networks, provides for a redefinition of priorities for the Trans-European Networks (TENs) and identifies, amongst the projects of common interest, the priority projects of European interest, to which priority will be given as soon as funding is decided under the regulation on granting financial support to the TENs.
The category of priority projects encompasses a range of energy network projects with quite a significant impact on the completion of the internal market and which are designed to improve the security of supply.
I wish, however, to highlight the strategic importance of the TENs as a crucial tool for overcoming the constraints of geographical remoteness in countries such as Portugal. This is all the more relevant in the case of the outermost regions such as the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores.
This fact explains why I have been advocating a differentiated treatment of these regions, given their inability to link up with the European electricity and gas networks.
I therefore feel it is crucial that we support energy production projects based on renewable energy sources in the context of the local supply of each of these regions and their place on the priority axes.
It is crucial that the regulation of the Trans-European Energy Networks is subject not only to criteria of the security of energy supply and for the non-distortion of competition, but also to criteria of environmental sustainability.
I therefore propose that the issue must hinge on the production of energy from renewable sources, because this is the sector that requires the fewest environmental externalities.
It is also important to focus on research in the field of new energies in order to ensure that their production costs come down and on decentralised sources.
I have voted in favour of this report because I believe that the approach adopted by the Commission of making greater use of the financial support instrument for the TENs (Trans-European Networks) with a view to completing the internal market for electricity and gas is, by and large, the right one.
It corresponds, in fact, to the report by the European Parliament, adopted on 13 March 2002 at first reading, on the proposal for a regulation on promoting cross-border electricity trading.
In fact, since such slow progress has been made in recent years, as the Commission states - with only 3 out of 14 specific projects having already been implemented - the rapporteur's suggestion to identify a new category of work is entirely appropriate.
Indeed, within projects of common interest, there is a proposal to identify a category of priority projects of European interest.
This category will include a limited number of energy network projects with a very significant impact from the point of view of the essential criteria of energy policy, in other words, to complete the internal market and to strengthen security of supply.
I also agreed with the recommended guideline to link more closely the production of renewable energies to interconnected energy networks, thereby leading to a desirable increase in the production and consumption of these energies.
It is my view that the amendments tabled by the European Parliament on the timing and frequency of export notifications, the level of information required, technical assistance and training are crucial to better meeting the objectives established by the Rotterdam Convention and so we hope that the Council and the Commission will receive these amendments favourably.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
This resolution comes at a crucial time for world peace, in view of the imminent attack on Iraq.
The European Parliament feels the need to take a stand once again on this issue, expressing its full support for the militaristic policy of the EU, naming the 'fight against terrorism' as the main objective of the European security and defence policy and calling for full and fast implementation of the European terrorism law and other autocratic measures by the Member States.
It fully espouses the American interpretation of the events of 11 September, endorsing statements on the global threat of terrorism and lending credence to propaganda about attacks on Iraq or anywhere else.
More to the point, the resolution states that ???? is instrumental to Euro-Atlantic stability and openly supports the new ???? doctrine, orientated as it is towards the fight against 'terrorism'.
Of course, it does not fail to put the EU on a par with the USA in its role as global policeman, accusing the USA of unilateralism.
Against this background, statements about respecting the rule of law, freedom and democracy ring extremely hollow.
We consider the reference to the UN Charter to be both extremely dangerous and revealing, accompanied as it is by the view that 11 September was a case of armed attack.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution.
. (FR) I supported the European Parliament resolution on combating terrorism in order to show my commitment to this cause, but, if the truth be known, I find the text extremely dissatisfactory in a number of respects.
In Paragraph 6, the European Parliament appears to be saying that the legitimate right of a State which has been attacked to defend itself can only be exercised with the authorisation of the UN Security Council, which would appear to be entirely incorrect.
In the event of an attack, the Security Council can only pronounce on the collective use of force, not on the right of the State which is the object of the attack to defend itself.
In Paragraph 36, the European Parliament suggests that what is known as the 'pillar' structure of the European institutions could hamper the fight against terrorism, and this hardly makes any sense.
The general 'disarmament' which the Union has undertaken, abolishing internal border controls and turning a blind eye to the flow of 'unidentifiable' immigrants in the name of human rights, has a much more damaging effect.
Lastly, as regards recital P, if, as we must, we want to avoid equating the Muslim world with terrorism, we also have to be conscious of the need to expose the ambiguities contained in the concept of jihad, which are extremely unhealthy fuel for terrorism.
The terrorist threat has assumed global dimensions, requiring a global reaction in order effectively to combat this threat to democracy and the free exercise of human rights.
The EU prides itself on its ongoing protection of respect for these fundamental values throughout the world and within Community territory.
The rapid and effective EU action in defining its global anti-terrorist strategy (the European Action Plan on Combating Terrorism) is to be praised.
The aims of the global EU and Member State Strategy must be:
1 - to reinforce the principles of the rule of law;
2 - to strengthen democratic control - it is regrettable that both the EP and national parliaments have only been partially informed about measures decided on by the Council;
3 - to enhance the means of prevention and suppression of terrorist crimes.
It is crucial that the Member States have effective criminal legislation in place and adopt measures for police and judicial cooperation.
The area of Freedom, Security and Justice that we are gradually constructing only makes sense if there is a balance between these three components, without any one of them impinging on the others.
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 cannot be used to justify excesses or abuses that enable security to suffocate freedom and justice.
The resolution on 'Assessment of and prospects for the EU strategy on terrorism one year after 11 September 2001' contains several contradictions.
Amongst others, I would highlight, some of its more negative aspects:
its defence of the militarisation of the 'fight against terrorism', examples of which are changing the current concept of defence to what is being called a 'broader concept of security', which includes 'pre-emptive strikes', such as we are seeing now, at the hands of George W. Bush, confusing Member States' internal security missions with defence policy;
the reaffirmation of NATO and of partnership with the USA as a framework reference for the EU in the 'fight against terrorism';
its support for the reform of NATO (its political and military structures) in order to change its defence alliance missions into an offensive alliance;
its willingness to criminalise the action of organisations and movements that fight, sometimes by means of an armed struggle, against the repression with which their peoples are targeted, confusing these with 'terrorism';
the use of the war against terrorism to move ahead with the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs in the EU.
Hence our vote against the report.
. (FR) Terrorism sows and inspires horror.
No country in the world is safe from the effects of terrorism now.
In democratic States, there is no religious, political or economic justification for recourse to terrorism.
We must combat international terrorism actively, and, of course, in this regard, we support the joint motion for a resolution.
I regret to say that the attacks which took place on 11 September 2001 and, more recently, in Bali, have revealed the weak links in the global fight against terrorism.
The 50 or so European texts - European Parliament resolutions, framework decisions, conventions, regulations, directives - currently in force have had absolutely no success in reducing terrorism.
Yesterday, however, all the political groups one by one welcomed the speed with which Europe reacted after 11 September. Of course, in the crisis, a common definition of terrorism was produced, although with difficulty.
Moreover, Europol was given new responsibilities in this field and a list of unstable States harbouring fundamentalist cells was drawn up, but, a year later, the terrorist networks are still there and we are witnessing more and more terrorist attacks.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The panic caused by 11 September 2001 has still not died down.
Fear of terrorism has led to decisions which, under normal circumstances, would only be supported by a minority of this Parliament.
Although EU Member States are more restrained than America with regard to preventive warfare and more prepared to make payments to Developing World countries, we are still significantly affected by the short-sighted policies of Bush junior.
In preparing this resolution, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has made gains from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the Christian Democrats and Liberals have been able to largely impose their will on the Social Democrats and the Greens.
This means that more importance is being attached to NATO than the United Nations and that the curtailment of the rights of freedom has been considered more important than removing the causes which make humiliated people into terrorists.
This is exactly what it takes to ensure the enduring and increasing indignation of the victims of the current balance of power, ownership and income in the world.
It is nice that the Liberal party still wants to add a charitable slant to this poor position but it does not change the effect.
I am disappointed by the support of the Social Democrats and the Greens, who are showing that they now want to belong to the emerging parliamentary majority at any price.
I opposed two truly deplorable paragraphs in the joint resolution, but in the end I have voted in favour of it, because I believe that combating terrorism is crucial - it is the greatest global threat of our times - and because I do not wish in any way to contribute to sending out a weaker message in this field.
The taking only yesterday of hundreds of innocent citizens hostage in a local theatre in Moscow, creating a new drama, the outcome of which is still completely unsure, has actually confirmed all of our greatest fears following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attack on Bali and various other actions dotted around the world.
This brutal and increasingly terrifying climate, however, lays bare the vulnerabilities of modern society and should, for this very reason, counsel us against the ambiguities and the traps of pseudo-justification of which, unfortunately, the text of the resolution is full.
Under the pressure of successive compromises, the text is too long and resembles nothing so much as a boring waltz or a tiresome tango, with steps to the left and to the right, forwards and backwards - to such an extent that, eventually, we even forget in which direction it is moving.
Consequently, we do not get very far and terrorists of all hues will be able to keep on smiling as they target innocent and defenceless civilians and sow their hatred, brutality and destruction.
A resolute fight against terrorism is one of the fundamental political fights at the dawn of this century if we do not wish to reach its close in a worse state than when it started.
Without giving in to any political or moral buck-passing, the fight must be pursued by means of all available political, diplomatic, military, police and judicial instruments available, as circumstances on the ground and the effectiveness of dissuasion or suppression dictate, rejecting shilly-shallying that blames the victims and favour the aggressors.

I, like many of my British Conservative colleagues, abstained in the final vote today on the terrorist resolution, since a number of paragraphs adopted were directly aimed at undermining the inherent right to self defence enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and the right, when there is a clear and imminent threat from a rogue state or terrorist organisation to the security of a country or region, to act pre-emptively under the same inherent legal authority.
In addition there were references to diverse political concepts from CFSP to ESDP and the Echelon project.
On these we have distinct policies which are well known and differ from those of the majority of this Parliament.
Needless to say, we as a party condemn terrorist activities of all types everywhere and have as a country suffered at the hands of the brutal IRA and other paramilitaries for a very long time, so our abstention also reflects the rather weak tone of the resolution.
In parts this seems to be more concerned with protecting the civil rights of terrorists than with condemning their murderous behaviour towards innocent civilians.
. (FR) Although he mentions the '75% of the 1.2 billion people living below USD 1 a day ? in rural areas', the rapporteur makes no proposal for remedying the food shortage in poor countries other than 'access to markets for developing countries in order to allow them to benefit from common prosperity and achieve economic growth', together with a number of charitable measures.
Yet it is precisely the market economy which has driven these countries to abandon food-producing traditions in favour of single-crop farming for the world market, and this same market economy which means that even the growth of the world economy leads to more poverty and hunger for over a billion people.
Moreover, the rapporteur is quite aware that the major powers are cutting aid to poor countries and that it only actually benefits a tiny section of the local population, and that is when it does not take the form of orders for wealthy countries' corporations.
In any case, what the poor countries need is not patronising charity but an end to the plundering and exploitation they have always suffered at the hands of precisely these large industrial groups and major powers.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) Europe is strongly divided over the debate currently taking place on the future of the common agricultural policy.
Basically, on one side, there are the advocates of multifunctional farming, of which I am one, who find it unacceptable that 80% of Community aid should end up in the purses of 20% of the farmers, and, on the other side, there are the defenders of the status quo.
In this respect, Mr Kanbhai's report gives me the opportunity to put paid to a rumour which is all too often spread about and which I consider to be erroneous, namely that the European Union is closed to exports coming from the world's poorest countries.
The implication is that we are falling short of our duty of solidarity towards the developing countries by implementing a protectionist agricultural policy focusing solely on European farmers.
Where does this rumour come from, considering that the European Union imports more agricultural products from developing countries than from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand taken together?
Lies, I suppose.
Are we to infer from this that boosting trade and agricultural deregulation are the essential pillars of development policy?
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr Khanbhai is once again proving to be an effective champion for developing countries.
He recognises the right of every country to protect its products by raising tariff barriers and urges rich countries to open themselves up to exported products from the poorest countries in spite of all this.
He also asks the wealthy countries to spend a minimum of 0.7% of their Gross National Product on development aid and recognises the need to redistribute agricultural land ownership.
I hope his views are shared by his Christian Democratic and Conservative group colleagues.
Unfortunately they have discovered a new priority during recent times. This is the priority of free trade, that is, support for the wrong kind of globalisation than is encouraged by the World Trade Organisation.
If free trade is implemented, this will mean survival of the fittest.
Companies with the lowest labour and environmental costs will then be able to steal the market from their competitors, wealthy countries will become richer at the expense of the poorest and the number of those excluded will grow at national level and world level.
It is therefore delightful to see that a majority is now forming for an attitude which relies on solidarity rather than the opinion 'you do not get anything for nothing'.
Incidentally, I am aware that this relates to a non-legislative initiative proposal with few direct consequences in practice.
. (FR) We do not endorse the contents of the resolution on the 12th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held from 3 to 15 November 2002 in Santiago, Chile.
Returning all the African elephant populations from Appendix II (marketing authorisation) to Appendix I is tantamount to banning the export of limited quantities of skins and ivory under the supervision of the Convention Secretariat, whereas such export activities have been made possible again by the substantial increase in herds in a number of southern African countries.
The increase in the populations in these countries is a considerable nuisance, causing the destruction of harvests, damage to local habitats and substantial losses of revenue for local farmers.
With a view to the proper management of elephant populations in southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa), we supported the amendments tabled by our group calling for the transfer to Appendix I to be postponed.
Our vote and our position reflect the mutual interests of the local populations and the wild fauna which is threatened with extinction.
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0492/02), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to the Commission, on the Commission's strategy for the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change.
Mr President, this is a question about the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol dealing with the reduction of CO2 emissions.
Is an urgent matter because the New Delhi Conference, to which the question refers, is now beginning.
The European Parliament, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in particular, are very concerned that we should keep the Kyoto momentum going.
In the European Union all is really not well, because some of the Member States that have ratified Kyoto are in the process of increasing their emissions of CO2, notably Spain.
We have adopted a number of directives tending to decrease CO2 emissions, and the Commission has put forward a very useful programme showing what it has done and what it intends to do.
We are particularly interested in the proposals on monitoring mechanisms, which are likely to come forward soon.
I want to ask three things.
Firstly, how important is the New Delhi Conference?
The Commissioner would say that it is very important.
If so, then my next question is why is she here and is she planning to go?
I am sure that if she is not planning to go, it is not a symptom of the downgrading of the status of the conference.
We simply want to know what is likely to happen at New Delhi.
We have heard conflicting rumours.
Secondly, it would be interesting to hear how the Commission thinks other countries could be encouraged to participate in the Kyoto process.
For example, I recently met with the Australian Ambassador to the European Union.
Australia is not a party to Kyoto and is clearly not planning to become one.
Australia might not have major CO2 emissions, but it could lead the way in South East Asia - a very important area where increasing industrialisation is increasing those emissions.
Thirdly, we should sort out what the role of MEPs is when they attend such conferences.
In the past, my colleagues have had increasingly uncomfortable experiences attending these conferences, for example the Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development.
The Commission is always extremely helpful and briefs MEPs as much as possible, but our delegations are not part of the meetings held by the EU delegation as such.
We cannot understand why we cannot be observers at that process.
It is absurd for the representatives of the people of Europe to travel halfway round the world only to be spectators at a conference where the people negotiating on their behalf are not directly elected on a European mandate.
We would like to see this changed so that we are at least given observer status in EU meetings at such conferences.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is no longer a matter for negotiation - it is a matter for action.
And I would say that, in terms of the EU's new political agenda, there is a set of three objectives in this field that must be achieved in the short term.
First of all, ensuring that the Protocol will enter into force.
In order for this to happen, Russia must ratify the Protocol.
The problem, however, is that Russia has already promised on several occasions that it would ratify the Protocol and this has not yet happened.
I ask the Commissioner, what type of concrete political and diplomatic initiatives are being and will be adopted in conjunction with the Russian Government to ensure that the Protocol is urgently submitted for ratification in the Duma?
Secondly, I believe it is important not to give up - and in fact we cannot give up - attempting to convince the US administration to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol.
The directive on emissions trading will help the European campaign to persuade the Americans to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol.
Let us say that, with emissions trading, we will be able to demonstrate that it is possible to comply with Kyoto at less economic cost.
I do feel, however, that on this issue too, embarking on a charm offensive is not enough.
We must take Kyoto to the next round at the World Trade Organisation.
And I wish to ask the Commission, is it prepared to submit an initiative to the next World Trade Organisation round, that guarantees the elimination of competitive and legitimate advantages that American products will gain as a result of their economy not being covered by the Kyoto Protocol?
Thirdly, Mr President, I believe it is important for the European Union to strengthen its international leadership on the basis of action rather than words.
On this matter, I wish to congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m on the excellent work she is doing in this field.
The Commission has demonstrated its ability to take the initiative, not least in its directive on emissions allowance trading and in the European Programme on Climate Change, but I do feel that this is a serious political problem: where the Member States are concerned, we are seeing real paralysis.
I believe it is crucial, for the sake of the credibility of our leadership, that the Member States also start to take action.
With regard to the role of Parliament's delegation in New Delhi, I would emphasise the words of its Chairman, Caroline Jackson: the parliamentary delegation must be allowed to attend the daily meetings held by the EU representatives.
Mr President, I want to begin by emphasising what Mr Moreira Da Silva and Mrs Jackson have just said.
Political leadership on this issue is incredibly important.
I also think that the way in which the EU has dealt with the issue via the Commission has been excellent.
These issues need nonetheless, in the future too, to go on being given a high profile.
It is not acceptable for there to be certain Member States that do not really take the issue seriously and that, instead of reducing emissions, are tending to do the opposite.
Almost the same situation applies too to the candidate countries that wish to become members of the EU but that have still not ratified the treaty.
We must continue to exert pressure and say that we require ratification if membership is to become possible.
What we expect first and foremost from the New Delhi conference is political leadership and the maintenance of a strong political message from the EU.
The most important issue, even if we are now beginning to understand that it will probably not be possible to concentrate on it, is about what will happen during the next commitment period.
What, then, will happen after 2012?
What shall we do?
What are the objectives?
I should also like to put these issues to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
What is it intended should happen during the forthcoming period?
Does the Commission already have plans as to how matters need to proceed?
What demands are to be made, and how are we to make progress in solving the problem of climate change?
The same applies to our role in relation to the developing countries.
We quite often point out the need to ensure we help the developing countries fulfil what is required of them by the Kyoto Protocol.
How are we to do this in purely practical terms?
We have today voted on the EU budget at first reading.
There will of course be a second reading, but it is difficult to see where climate issues in particular fit into the picture.
To repeat Parliament's old demands, it should soon no doubt be time to incorporate shipping and aviation into these talks.
That has still not happened, but it is no doubt desirable that it should.
Even if these issues cannot perhaps be among those raised in New Delhi, it is nonetheless important that we make these demands.
In conclusion, I want to repeat the principle on the basis of which I think this discussion ought to proceed and which, in actual fact, gave rise for once to some discussion at the most recent meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I mean that we must seek equal rights for all citizens of the world.
The committee certainly adds the rider that this is to happen in the long term, but what is nonetheless required is for all citizens to have the right of access to good, renewable energy on equal terms.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson, because, although I was not here when the resolution was debated, she accepted four of the five amendments we tabled.
Secondly, we must correct recital C of the motion for a resolution we tabled, because this recital states that 83 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol but - as the Commissioner so rightly said - at the beginning of October, 95 countries had ratified it, which equates to 37.1% of CO2 emissions.
I believe we are going to repeat ourselves; I believe we all agree that some matters should take priority - as the Commissioner said - succeeding in persuading Russia, by means of all the necessary diplomatic steps and pressure, to sign the Protocol would mean exceeding 55% of emissions, which would enable us to consider the Kyoto Protocol implemented.
I must say that, sadly, my country is no example when it comes to reducing emissions, but rather the opposite.
We need to put pressure on the various countries so that they continue to fulfil the commitments we have all undertaken, and there is no doubt that renewable energies will play a very important part in this direction we are taking, in addition to transport, despite the poor result achieved in Johannesburg with regard to renewable energies.
The need to instigate a debate in New Delhi on objectives beyond 2012, on means and mechanisms for sanctions and on conflict-resolution mechanisms, could be of great importance for the summit.
Mr President, I shall end by referring to the role of the Members of the European Parliament in these summits which - as the Commissioner so rightly said - should be substantial, but not because we want to be present in every single discussion, but because I believe we can be of help to the Commission and to those who are determined that the Kyoto Protocol should become reality.
Mr President, Commissioner, whilst there is genuine cause to welcome the question and the resolution tabled by Mrs Jackson on the Union's position at the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change, the fact that the report has been tabled so late leaves us with some doubts as to its real aim.
So, ladies and gentlemen, how should we interpret this debate, which is being held after the opening of the Conference, if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change?
We must ask ourselves whether the latest UNEP report, which revealed that USD 150 billion is spent on environmental damage each year, escaped the scrutiny of certain European visionaries.
Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen of this House. I do not mean you.
Commissioner, how do you intend to convince your fellow Commissioners of the urgent need for practical measures?
In New Delhi, what we actually need to do is to increase the international reaction to the threat of climate change a little more.
This momentum, which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible, must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, as defined at Bonn and Marrakech.
The European Union must continue to be a driving force in combating climate change.
At New Delhi, we must also pave the way for the second period, as you have said, and prepare to address requirements which are more pressing because of the gravity of the situation, and we know that time is of the essence.
There are three essential points we must uphold in New Delhi.
Firstly, as regards carbon wells, which distort the true environmental picture, scientific rigour and objectivity exclude this simple solution, this expedient.
Secondly, it is imperative that the surge in air traffic and its impact on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are included in the process.
What is the Commission's current view on this?
Thirdly and lastly, the COP 8 must not fail to condemn the attempt to include nuclear power as a renewable energy, for nuclear power is limited and even obsolete.
For example, Amendment No 15 to our resolution, seeking to reinstate it, must be rejected.
There is no more urgent subject for us and our debates than the potential future impact of climate change.
There is nothing more essential in politics than the very essence of all politics: the continued survival and proper functioning of the Earth itself.
We must act now to give ourselves the chance of a future.
Mr President, many other conferences have already taken place since the climate conference in Kyoto.
Now that we are preparing for New Delhi, the Kyoto Protocol is still not in force, however.
Obviously we cannot have complete control over the world just like that.
Certainly not when we consider that man has limited influence over CO2 emissions.
Technically speaking there are vast sources of CO2 emissions and CO2 wells.
It is therefore only to be expected that emissions caused by man have only a limited effect on the overall amount.
However, we still have a duty to limit CO2 emissions as far as possible.
A glance at the conference programme shows me that specific matters relating to the implementation are up for discussion.
The emphasis being placed on wind energy, cooperation with third countries and emissions trading schemes is a positive development.
In my opinion the European Union can make a substantial contribution towards projects for clean development in developing countries.
The EU already has a pioneering role to play with regard to emissions trading schemes.
Parliament has chosen to implement an unambiguous and well-thought-out system to be introduced in 2005.
Economies can be made by businesses being more frugal with energy and the link with the overall energy policy is of course very important.
With regard to CO2 wells I would like to point out the danger that we might overestimate in our accounting for CO2 wells in, for example, the ocean.
As the water warms up, its capacity for absorbing CO2 will fall again.
The European Union ratified the Protocol six months ago.
Let us hope that the New Delhi climate conference will result in ratification by the Russian and Canadian Governments.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to Mrs Jackson for tabling such an important question and to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for her honest answer.
It is, though, a pity that, realistically speaking, no serious political progress is expected in New Delhi because people are in fact hoping for something else.
After the dreadful floods in Germany and neighbouring countries, people expected the climate problem to be resolved once and for all in Johannesburg, only to be told that it had a different agenda.
The same appears to be true of New Delhi, but we must continue to be tough negotiators, even if we cannot always make rapid progress.
We must also remember that Kyoto is, of course, just the first step, which is why we reiterate quite clearly in our resolution that all citizens must end up with the same rights, which basically means that per capita emissions should be the same the world over.
For the developing countries, this implies a great deal more than we promised in Kyoto.
In view of the recent debate on emissions trading in Germany, we have to keep reminding ourselves that all the parties in Germany are in fact agreed that we need to reduce emissions in the long term by 80% - I repeat 80% by 2050 - and if we are already arguing so energetically against it now, when first steps need to be taken, then I do not hold out much hope for this long-term objective.
Nonetheless, we must stand by it and our resolution reaffirms this.
Ratification by Russia, Japan and the USA is still very, very important.
As we have been told on numerous occasions, all we can do is keep on making demands and ensuring that every meeting, at whatever level, between representatives of the European Union, be it the Commission or the Council of Ministers or us here in the European Parliament, between the EU and the USA, between the EU and Russia, addresses this issue.
It must be our top priority in our dealings with these countries.
We must not relax in our efforts and I expressly endorse what Mr Moreira Da Silva said about the WTO.
We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change.
The credibility of the European Union is, of course, vital.
We have to clean up our own act.
Parliament has, by a very large majority, taken a clear stand on emissions trading.
I am sorry that the Council of Ministers has postponed its decision yet again and I am sorry to hear from initial reactions that important amendments which we adopted, for example on the CAP or on 1990 as the base year, may not meet with the Council's approval.
The Council needs to adopt a clear concept, and quickly, and we, the European Parliament, need to be tough negotiators.
That is all I have to say.
Three minutes is too short a time to expand on the whole issue but I think it really is important for us to keep clarifying our position here in this House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate policy is a process that will inform everything we do in the twenty-first century and I trust that Europe will continue to play a leading role here.
I have something to say to the members of the parliaments.
We have more and more global processes, not just now with Kyoto, but on other issues - I am thinking of the International Monetary Fund, financial policy, worldwide credit policy, environmental policy and trade policy - which are in fact decided solely by the executive.
The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice.
The question is: surely, with increasing globalisation, parliaments could be more involved in the opinion-forming process?
This question is directed both to us and to our parliaments.
We need to find new ways of working together instead of just taking recourse to the executive - in this case the Commission.
Secondly, Kyoto must be ratified and that will be our main job in New Delhi.
We must convince our counterparts, especially our Russian counterparts, that this makes sense.
Thirdly, when we talk of reducing CO2 - and other greenhouse gas emissions, but mainly CO2 - we always mention renewable energy in the same breath.
And so we should.
I have no wish to contradict that.
It is just that, in New Delhi, we will be in a country that generates well over 50% of its electricity from coal.
If they could bring their coal technology up to current European standards, we would save much, much more CO2 throughout the world than with all the other very costly reduction measures put together.
This is a fact and we must face it.
In other words, if we want a climate policy, we need an active coal policy and we should mention that in the same breath as renewable energy, because 80% of the world's energy is still generated from fossil fuels.
Finally, I think that climate policy also gives us a chance to foster a new relationship with developing countries, in the form of emissions trading.
The Commission itself conducted a very interesting study in its institute in Seville, with a time frame of up to 2030, when, it states, emissions trading with Asia will be worth around EUR 80 billion.
That implies a capital inflow of around EUR 80 billion for these countries.
Know-how will be transmitted to these countries and the advantage to us is that the reduction in emissions will be entered against our account, meaning that both sides will benefit from the trade off.
We should be thinking more along these lines.
Mr President, Russia intends to ratify shortly and then the Kyoto Protocol will be in force.
A worldwide discussion will immediately arise - how and when will the US and the developing countries participate in this issue?
Europe has to take the lead again in this discussion.
Much greater reductions are to be implemented in Europe after 2012, for example minus 30% in 2020 as proposed by the German Government.
How do the Commissioners feel about this?
On the other hand, as has already been stated, equal rights to emit CO2 per world citizen at a sustainable level is also written in the Parliamentary resolution.
How does the Commission feel about this idea?
That will mean that India will be allowed to emit double its current amount, China must stabilise, Europe must reduce its emissions by 80% and the US by 90%.
Worldwide burden sharing is necessary if we really want to make progress in the fight against climate change.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard several times, one of the most important items on the agenda of the COP 8 conference in New Delhi in India is to agree on when the Kyoto Protocol will finally enter into force, with the emphasis on ratification by Russia.
I should like to reiterate what Mrs Annelie HulthÃ©n said, namely that we must make sure that future Member States of the European Union understand that this is one of our priorities.
Another important issue -- and at this time and at this conference, which should not be taking place anyway, this probably has less to do with specific negotiations and more to do with thinking up a strategy and enumerating its features - is how we can convince numerous developing countries to join the fight against climate change in the future.
This will of course depend on our own credibility when it comes to climate change.
In other words, Europe and the European Union must deliver satisfactory results here.
Our success or failure in achieving this credibility with our partners in the developing countries - for whom I realise, Commissioner, this will not be easy - will not depend solely on our environmental policy; it will also depend on whether we have coherent policies in other sectors, such as European agriculture.
One point, which has not yet been raised today but which I consider very important, is the question of monitoring.
I think that, if we want the Kyoto Protocol to be a success and deliver demonstrable results, then we need a reasonable, reliable monitoring system.
In other words, we must ensure that the Member States deliver reliable figures on their emissions and on the flexible mechanisms.
We also need reliable data on what Europe sees as the very negative question of planting, in other words reforestation and similar activities.
My final point, which numerous members have raised, is of course the question of what happens after 2012, at the end of the first period, and it seems to me that we can make good use of COP 8 if we avoid getting embroiled in finer points and negotiations in order to table this problem and start thinking now about what must and will happen in 2012.
Mr President, thank you for these valuable contributions to this debate.
I would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised.
First of all, what can we do to influence Russia and to push for ratification from the Russian side?
It is difficult to talk to the Russians.
We have for some time now been planning a troika visit to Russia and we are continuing to plan for that visit because we want to meet the right people.
We want to have it at a high political level in order to have a meaningful discussion.
In all bilateral talks, including those between Commissioner Prodi and Prime Minister Putin, climate change and the Kyoto Protocol have been on the agenda.
Of course we raise this issue in all our bilateral contacts.
We are also aware of a study that has just been published by the Russian Government on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
We are currently analysing the results - hopefully we will be able to use some of them in our ongoing debate.
We are keeping a close eye on what happens in Russia, in order to be able to use the positive forces that exist in Russia.
In the end, I suppose that it is Prime Minister Putin who will decide.
What about a WTO initiative?
That has not yet been included in our plans at all.
Maybe that is a good idea.
I have not though about it enough to give you a really considered answer today, but I am worried about anything that could complicate or halt the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
We should be very careful not to raise the issue in such a way that we create more stumbling blocks in the debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
I would be happy to come back to the debate on the WTO and the links between these issues.
What happens in the second commitment period?
First of all, we are interested in establishing the process in Delhi and COP8.
It is too early and in view of the risk of complicating the whole debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, we want first of all to establish the process and decide how to get to the second commitment period.
It seems a little pointless to go into the details on that before the Kyoto Protocol has even entered into force.
So first things first.
We have to stick to that strategy at COP8 as well.
There was one question on air traffic.
Of course the Commission and the European Union are working within ICAO, because this is clearly an international issue.
I am sure we would all agree that the work in ICAO has not been satisfactory when it comes to speed and commitment, but it also has a UNCCC mandate to work on the climate change issue.
This is an area where we can hopefully do more, but we will have to continue to work in an international context.
Finally, what about equal rights per world citizen?
The ultimate goal is to stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels.
Remember that.
We need to reduce emissions as a result.
I believe this will lead to convergence of per capita emissions internationally.
Whether equal rights is the right target, I cannot say.
I do not want to say to the European Parliament that it is a ridiculous idea, but my personal opinion is that it might not be the most sensible approach.
It is a moral concept rather than an environmental measure.
Our main objective is to protect the environment.
That, I believe, is how we should formulate it.
We emit eight times more, on average, than an Indian citizen.
How do we create equal rights for citizens throughout the world?
I would like to approach it from an environmental point of view, so that we make sure that we stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels.
I hope you understand my argument.
Perhaps this is something which requires further debate.
We have an important role to play in New Delhi, in the COP8 discussions, because we can definitely work with the developing countries.
We will probably be the bridge between G77, China and the developed countries in the debate on how to deal with climate change.
To conclude this debate, I have received, pursuant to Article 42 of the Rules of Procedure, the motion for a resolution B5-0531/2002, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0497/2002), on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to the Commission, on the adventitious presence of genetically modified organisms in seeds.
Mr President, Commissioner, when we debated the seed directive here in Parliament in the mid-1990s, I acted as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
At the time, we successfully applied for the final vote on the issue of genetically modified organisms to be deferred.
I then negotiated for two years on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture.
The issue at stake then was not whether genetic engineering should or should not be used; the issue at stake was labelling and the inclusion of this seed directive and its methods in the release directive, which at the time was still Directive 90/220.
We achieved this.
At the time, the scientists still insisted that genetically modified crops could coexist alongside non-genetically modified crops; they excluded the possibility of contamination.
This stand has now been overtaken both by events and by opinion within the scientific community itself.
Now those who wish or rather who, under the bio regulation, are legally obliged to farm - be it conventionally or organically - without using genetic engineering, face the problem of unwanted contamination.
Now the Commission wants to set a threshold below which no labelling is required.
This is where the figures start to get confusing.
Once upon a time there was talk of 1% contamination; now we are down to 0.3 and 0.5%.
But the fact remains that genetically modified organisms are being released unintentionally in huge quantities.
If we relate this to an area of seven-and-a-half or eight million hectares of rape or corn, 7 million plants seed every year.
This is not going to be negotiated with Parliament, not even in the Standing Committee on the release directive, which has now been renewed; it is to be decided in the Standing Committee on Seeds, where a ruling is to be laid down under the comitology procedure which, if implemented as it stands, contradicts Parliament's figure of 0.5% in the food labelling directive.
If we approve seeding in these quantities without labelling, then we must assume that the other value will be exceeded during seeding and that even those who do not use any form of genetically modified organism will be forced to comply with labelling and testing requirements.
We need a ruling here which clarifies once and for all - and this is also the position which the Committee on Agriculture has just adopted - that there has to be coexistence, that those who wish to use genetically modified organisms must ensure that those who do not are not brought into contact with them.
That applies both to the 70% of farmers in Germany who do not want GMOs and to about the same percentage of consumers who do not want GMOs.
So there is no point in starting from a specific threshold because, if it is exceeded, the risk and the individual costs will be impossible to bear under compensation rules.
So we need a ruling whereby those who are to blame can be held to account under the polluter-pays principle.
This process, these rulings are no simple matter, Commissioner, and cannot be decided under the comitology procedure or in the standing committee and technical annex; they need further debate and another vote, with codecision by Parliament.
We should also hold science to account and organise hearings in order to clarify how coexistence which is really worth its name, can be applied.
All this takes time and must not, under any circumstances, be rushed.
Until then, the rule must be that uncontaminated seed can be guaranteed for those who do not want to use genetically modified organisms.
Mr President, the questions are very important in the context of the current debate on GMOs in Europe.
We still do not have a clear-cut reply to some of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's questions.
Please accept that my answers are to some extent preliminary ones, which will require further scrutiny and reflection, both within the Commission and in our ongoing discussions with the Member States and the different stakeholders.
I wish to begin with a short description of the problem we are faced with when dealing with the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional products.
This is also important for everyone who has followed this debate.
On a global scale, GMO cultivation has increased dramatically in recent years.
In 2001, 5.5 million farmers in 13 countries grew an estimated 52.6 million acres with GM crops.
Between 2000 and 2001, the number of acres planted to GM crops increased by almost 20%.
For some crops, the increase was particularly large.
In the US, GM corn increased from 4.4% of all planted acres in 1996 to 32% in 2002.
GM soya beans increased from 7.4% in 1996 to 74% in 2002.
To date, the cultivation of GMOs has been geographically concentrated, with 99% of all GM crops produced by four nations: the United States of America, Argentina, Canada and China.
However, GM cultivation is likely to spread to other nations in the next few years.
So far Europe has played a very marginal role, with fewer than 20 000 acres of GM crops, mainly in Spain and France.
That is some 0.03% of the worldwide area.
Europe has large volumes of trade with major GM producers - although trade in GM products has mainly concerned products for animal feed.
Imports of GM products for human consumption, like maize, have largely ceased, because of the inability of exporters to ensure the identity of all individual GMOs in shipments.
The last few years have shown that the adventitious presence of traces of GMOs in conventional products has become inevitable.
Cross-pollination between plants is a natural phenomenon - that also happens between other seeds.
We simply cannot completely control its mechanisms, which include factors such as wind and insect movements.
It is therefore largely unavoidable that small traces of GMOs will be transferred to conventional crops and their harvested products.
Storage and transportation practices may also make it difficult or extremely costly to ensure total segregation.
Consequently, conventional seed lots will contain traces of GM seeds.
Setting tolerance thresholds for impurities for GM seeds in this particular case is the only way to address the problem.
Closing our market completely is not a viable option.
Against this background, the Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a Commission directive amending the annexes to the seed directives.
This proposal includes additional conditions and requirements concerning the adventitious presence of GM seeds in lots of non-GM seeds.
The Committee on Agriculture has been informed twice about the status of this proposal.
Commissioner Byrne has written to inform Mrs Jackson that the text will be formally submitted to the European Parliament, which will then have the opportunity to scrutinise it.
Article 21(2) of Directive 18/2001/EC provides for the possibility of establishing thresholds below which traces of authorised GMOs are exempted from labelling requirements.
Hence, conventional products containing adventitious traces of such GM seeds below this threshold would not have to be labelled.
Let me now answer some of the questions raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
On the competent body to set thresholds, the Regulatory Committee, provided for in Directive 18/2001/EC, is competent for decisions pertaining to thresholds under Article 21(2) of the directive, with regard to exemption from labelling requirements.
However, it is not competent for decisions made under the sector-specific seeds directives, where thresholds relate specifically to marketing criteria for seeds.
The Standing Committee on Seeds rightly has the necessary competence in this case.
Consistency between the different pieces of legislation has to be maintained.
On the risks that a significant percentage of GM seeds may be released out of control into the environment, I would first say that it is paramount that any threshold should take account of the protection of human health and, importantly, in the case of seeds, the environment.
You will be aware that this includes a comprehensive free-market assessment of the potential risks.
Secondly, thresholds must be workable and enforceable.
The proposed thresholds arise directly from the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants and are scientifically founded with reference to the characteristics of the crop species.
Thirdly, on the registration of GMO cultivation, under the provisions of Article 31(3)(b), Member States are required to establish registers for recording the location of GM fields grown for commercial purposes.
As detailed in the article, the objective of this is to allow the possible effects of these GMOs on the environment to be monitored.
As for the scope of Directive 18/2001/EC, this clearly relates to cultivation of a GM seed product itself and not a conventional seed product containing traces of GM seeds.
The GM seed product itself has to be labelled as such and also traced, so that growers will know what they are sowing.
It will therefore be possible for Member States to record the locations of the resultant crops.
However, the threshold values, which are based on robust scientific assessment, should aim at ensuring that the cultivation of conventional seeds basically maintains the characteristics of non-GM cultivation.
Coexistence is a key issue in the Commission communication on Life Sciences and Biotechnology - a Strategy for the Future.
The Commission has commissioned a number of studies on this issue.
The main aim is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence.
So far, we only have preliminary data based on hypothetical scenarios, and further experimental data is required to provide a more accurate picture.
The Commission is actively pursuing such work before considering possible options to ensure the viability of conventional and organic farming and their sustainable coexistence with GM crops.
As a further step in this process, the Commission has commenced discussions in partnership with Member States, farmers and other private operators to find the most appropriate solutions.
It is important to say that the issue of coexistence is not one of risk per se.
It does, however, highlight a possible need to establish correct agricultural management systems and practices for the different crop types to ensure their coexistence and consumer choice.
This is my initial reply to your questions and I will be happy to make further comments at the end of the debate.
Mr President, allow me if you will another brief supplementary question.
The Commissioner said that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been informed.
That is correct.
She said that Parliament will be informed.
This too has been promised.
But we do not want to be informed, Commissioner, once you have made your decision; we want to be included in the decision-making process.
Our complaint is that this is to be regulated in the form of a technical annex.
We feel that this is a core amendment to the directive and we want to be included in the decision-making process.
I would be grateful if you could comment on this or if you could at least pass this on to the Commission as a whole.
Mr President, this is a recurring institutional debate.
Should the codecision procedure or comitology be used?
The seeds directives provide for purity criteria in the annexes and they can be adapted to scientific and technical knowledge by the comitology procedure provided for under the seeds directive.
It is thus possible to set thresholds for GM presence in non-GM varieties through a comitology procedure.
The 1% food labelling threshold provided for in a Council regulation has been set by the comitology procedure provided for under the foodstuff labelling legislation.
Article 21(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC also states that labelling thresholds may be set in the comitology procedure provided for under the directive.
Timing and the possibility of making it a practical procedure are also factors.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too have, on numerous occasions in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, bemoaned the fact that seed regulations are being pushed to such an extent under the comitology procedure.
I have said that I think it would make more sense if the Commission held fire on the regulation for GMOs in seed under the comitology procedure until Parliament has completed the current procedure.
We need the new seed regulations to be consistent with the regulations on GMOs in food and feed and on the traceability and labelling of GMOs.
These issues were hotly debated at first reading here in this House as recently as the summer.
The resolution was extremely tight on several points, especially the question of threshold values.
We are now waiting for the Council of Ministers to reach a decision, which since last week has again been postponed to December.
A final decision by the Council cannot now be expected before the middle of next year.
I think it would be far better if the Commission were to keep its paper in the pending tray for another year, so that the threshold values can be adjusted to the regulations currently on the agenda.
So much for the procedure.
Now for a brief material comment.
The question of whether GMOs are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today's debate.
But as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf refers in his question to positions on GMOs, I wish to do likewise.
It is clear from all the Member's questions that there is something he has failed to understand or does not wish to admit.
There is a difference between releasing GMOs under Directive 2001/18, on the one hand, and setting a technical limit value for the adventitious presence of GMOs in conventional seed by amending the annexes to the seed directives, on the other.
These directives contain an array of technical rules and requirements on the quality and marketing of seed in the EU.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself said that the actual directives were adopted in the usual manner after hearing the European Parliament and that it was decided in the process that certain technical details were to be regulated under the regulatory committee procedure.
The committee does not of course decide on the release of GMOs, it decides how to define a further quality standard for conventional seed and it has the jurisdiction to do so under current EU law.
The Commissioner said as much.
The scientific committee has, in its turn, confirmed, as do countless other scientific works, that statistically halfway reliable statements do not brook a limit value of less than 0.1%.
This is the cut-off point.
There is no such thing as a 0% value, and nothing is GM-free.
The Commission draft suggests threshold values for GMOs that do not represent a risk to the environment and consumers, and which can therefore be commercially cultivated in the EU.
The registration requirements in Directive 2001/18 have nothing to do with the marketing of conventional seed.
Reproduction seed, which farmers themselves cultivate, is at times much more of a problem.
It is not subject to any quality testing requirements whatsoever and does not therefore undergo any tests to detect GMOs.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself is in favour of liberalising these reproduction regulations.
And another thing.
The lower the threshold value for the adventitious presence of GMOs is set, the more conventional and organic products will have to be labelled, which is why the Commission, various Member States and a large majority in the European Parliament are calling for a realistic limit value of 1% in the forthcoming GMO regulations.
To close, may I say that working farmers need a fundamental understanding of the simple biologic facts of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of type A seed in type B. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf works as a farmer.
There are such things as natural events.
There will always be GMOs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after so much criticism, I should like to offer Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf my warmest thanks for his oral question to the Commission.
It is not just on the mind of my group, it is, of course, also on Mrs Sommer's mind.
As she said, we worked together with an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment on this issue, precisely because we have the impression that our right of codetermination is being curtailed, whatever the legal situation here; I think we all know that, Mrs Sommer.
We have asked the Commission and various representatives working on this directive for a deferment on several occasions, because the message we keep getting is that the idea is to railroad these legal provisions through before the end of the year.
The legislation in this area, which is currently being dealt with by the Council but which was dealt with by Parliament at first reading up to July, signals that we are taking this seriously.
I shall resist the temptation to rehash the debate we held up to July, but I should like to comment on one point which is, of course, also addressed in the legislation and which, as rapporteur, I am familiar with, namely the regulation on genetically modified food and feedingstuffs.
What we want to know is: what is being done to prevent technically unavoidable, unwanted contamination?
What proposals does the Commission have for investigating this question?
Word is spreading that we are in fact regulating something at European level.
We are regulating limit values, threshold values for technically unavoidable, adventitious contamination.
We all agree here that we need these limit values and that there is no such thing as completely 'GM-free'.
At the same time, we are not saying that there are laws in the pipeline, there are recommendations in the pipeline tackling how this can be avoided in future.
If the objective - and here too we agree with the Commission - is to deny this contamination and if the objective is the coexistence of various types of farming, such as traditional and organic farming, then this is a question we really should be asking ourselves.
If the Commissioner says that there are no clear-cut replies to these questions, which is perfectly understandable, then I understand even less why this is now being railroaded through here under the comitology procedure.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Mrs Figueiredo, who has had to leave.
I have translated her Portuguese notes off the cuff, so I hope I shall be clear.
Following the adoption by the Commission of Directive 2001/18/EC on the release into the environment of GMOs, there are serious concerns relating to health, the environment and farmers' interests.
As we know, beyond the ethical issues concerning the commercialisation and patentability of life and natural heritage, the release of GMOs into the environment is irreversible and difficult to control, and can have direct consequences for the contamination of conventional agriculture and the reduction of biodiversity.
In practice, even farmers who do not cultivate genetically modified plants, due to cross-pollination or similar phenomena, are forced to label their products.
This could lead to conventional farmers or organic farmers not having any choice.
Therefore, in the absence of detailed studies, does the Commission not think that the precautionary principle of maintaining the moratorium in place should prevail?
How should we address the labelling of products which contain GMOs due to chance or circumstances that are difficult to avoid?
Mr President, Commissioner, I really am appalled by your reply, because you said absolutely nothing about the central issue of how we want to achieve or can guarantee freedom of choice for the consumer.
You said absolutely nothing about how we are to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on a limit value of 0.5% for labelling.
That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating.
With your planned limit value for seed, this value is not achievable.
You know that, which is why I should now like to ask you to tell us what conclusions you intend to draw from this vote by Parliament.
Is it in fact that you want to press ahead, that you want to bring about a fait accompli, that you want, as it were, to give the seed industry a Christmas present?
I think you should state here today how you intend to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on this regulation.
You said just now that contamination is unavoidable.
That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable!
In saying this, you are setting yourself up as the mouthpiece of the genetic engineering industry because that is what the lobby claims, but it is not true.
Tests in Europe have shown that there is no contamination of seed of any consequence and in Austria we even have purity requirements for seed and I think that is exactly what we need.
We need freedom of choice for consumers and, in order to guarantee it, we need purity requirements.
We should not just throw in the towel in the face of contamination when, with the right policy, there is no contamination, because products or seeds which cause such widespread contamination cannot be released.
So what we need is freedom of choice for consumers and, please, rather than giving Christmas presents to the seed industry, give us a timetable today.
We want to know what the Commission is planning to do and if it really is prepared to accept Parliament's democratic resolution and wait until we have adopted a resolution on the Scheele Report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with you that all the directives and regulations on GMOs should be part of the same framework and should not conflict with each other.
Secondly, I understand that the Commission chooses the quantitative detectability techniques in order to define the adventitious presence of GMOs.
That I quite understand.
In fact, you sometimes even disregard the 1% adventitious presence of GMOs because - and I agree with you here - the authorisation for the circulation of a given GMO comes under a different directive, which takes into account the risks for human health and the environment.
If there is no risk to human health and the environment, an authorisation is given.
However, when it comes to the directives on traceability, for some peculiar reason, you do not follow the principle of detectability which you follow for all the others.
This will also create problems for the World Trade Organisation, because if you accept that the presence of 1% is not a problem for health and so on, why do you not accept that detectability should be included in all traceability directives?
If GMOs are present, whether adventitious or not, that fact should be stated.
You insist on not including detectability in the traceability directives.
You must abide by what you have said, namely, that all directives should be part of the same framework.
I expect to hear what you have to say about the detectability issue, which is very important, even in trade.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important, in the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's question, to remember that we are discussing the adventitious presence of GMOs which are licensed in the European Union.
We are not discussing the release of GMOs, but the definition of a further quality standard in the marketing of conventional seed.
Parliament adopted the proposal for a regulation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs or genetically modified food and feedingstuffs at first reading in June, calling for a threshold value of 0.5%.
I agree with the Commission here that this value is pitched too low and is impracticable.
A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic.
In setting threshold values for seed, which is what we are discussing here, the Commission has to take due account of Parliament's and the Council's suggested thresholds in the procedure mentioned.
The threshold values for the adventitious presence of GMOs need to be coordinated in the two texts.
I should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of GMOs in food and feed.
Reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs.
That needs to be made perfectly clear here.
The Commission's biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority.
Coexistence is only possible if we have reasonable threshold values as, technically, wind-borne pollen can never be discounted in nature.
One hundred percent purity was never possible for biological reasons and never will be in the future.
Threshold values for product purity are standard and necessary in numerous industries.
In the organic farming sector, for example, there is a threshold value of 5%.
That means that products labelled as organic products may contain up to 5% of certain non-organic ingredients.
I say that for the benefit of the Greens.
The important criterion must be that the statutory framework is practicable.
More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and must not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe by tying it up in unnecessary red tape.
Mr President, of course the questions and the statistics by our Green colleagues are loaded and selective.
Can I therefore ask if the Commission agrees that a Eurobarometer survey shows that 75% of Europeans favour basic research aimed at new technologies which help knowledge to progress?
Is it true that, according to Eurobarometer surveys, 48% of Europeans agree or strongly agree that GM is useful in food production for improved nutrition and for improving shelf life or taste, despite the emotive campaign by the Greens to convince them of the contrary?
Not only are these campaigns emotionally charged, they muster distorted and misleading information to support their ultimately untenable and irrational opposition to the new technology of genetically modified crops.
I wish they would be honest enough to recognise that there are at least some benefits.
I believe that these actual benefits, not to mention the potential benefits, substantially outweigh any risks.
Yes, there are always potential risks in any new technology product or process.
We are challenging the frontiers of knowledge, but we have safeguards in place.
We require exhaustive testing and trials in laboratory and field.
But the opponents do not want proof.
They condone obstruction and destruction of these trials.
Will they deny that GM crops have major environmental benefits?
Not only do they reduce production costs, they also cut back on the use of energy, pesticides and herbicides and reduce CO2 emissions.
Though their opponents are still grasping at straws, it is clear from experience in America and elsewhere that the environment benefits.
In Europe we can perhaps afford the luxury of denying ourselves the food productivity benefits which GM crops offer, but do our Green colleagues not consider the interests of their fellow human beings in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia to whom GM crops will bring nutrition and health benefits and may even help them survive?
Do they consider the effect that turning our backs on this advance will have on our scientific base and researchers, on our farmers and farm workers' jobs?
On thousands of jobs in the food processing industry?
On the price of food as well as the quality and the variety available to our consumers?
Yes, European consumers are entitled to be able to choose what food they buy and eat.
We must protect our environment as best we can, but we also owe it to our constituents to be frank and honest about the risks and benefits.
It is accepted that an organic label indicates 95% organic, i.e. up to 5% not organic.
Why make the non-GMO label almost unobtainable by specifying unachievable levels of purity?
I could well accept that premise, with the mischievous intention of making non-GMO so rare that no one could afford it.
Then everyone will be forced to come to terms with the real world, where there will always be the possibility of some adventitious GM content.
Mr President and Mr Purvis, I know one thing and that is that the GMO issue will give me grey hairs.
We know from Eurobarometer opinion polls that most people are worried about GMOs.
At the same time, they say that they do not know enough about them.
Perhaps there is a connection.
I would like to say to Mrs Breyer that we have looked at those concerns very carefully to ensure that we establish clear legislation - a clear framework - for handling both the potential benefits and the risks of GMOs.
That is why we have revised Directive 18/2001/EC to include better risk assessment and better information, so that consumers can make an informed choice.
That is why we have proposed further legislation on traceability and labelling.
However, it would not be honest to say that if we continue to import seeds, for example, we can guarantee total purity and no adventitious presence of GMOs.
We know that everything in nature escapes - through cross-pollination for example - so closing borders is not a viable solution.
We have to be pragmatic and establish levels and thresholds to deal with natural phenomena.
We have to look at the situation as it actually is and at the products we import.
This leads me to Mr Trakatellis' question about traceability.
The proposals on traceability and labelling, as well as on food and feed, are not based entirely on the detectability of GMOs.
Even if they cannot be detected, consumers have the right to know.
The current Novel Foods Regulation will be replaced by these proposals and the scope will be broadened to give consumers a choice, even if the GMOs are not detectable.
Consumers have the right to be informed of the presence of GMOs in the products they buy, even if the GMOs are not detectable.
I shall comment on two further issues that have been raised.
Firstly, on labelling thresholds, the Commission can only take account of existing legislation and, for the time being, a 1% threshold is in force for foodstuffs.
This 1% threshold is provided for by the Council regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000.
Above that 1% threshold, an indication of the presence of a genetic modification in a food is compulsory.
As the recital of the regulation states, the 1% value best serves the purpose of establishing a tolerance level which simultaneously remains low and takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain.
All these factors along the production chain are involved.
The seeds thresholds are based on this 1% threshold.
You have to count backwards in order to reach this 1% threshold.
A recital of the draft Commission directive on seeds provides that, should the food threshold change, the thresholds for seeds would need to be reconsidered accordingly.
On the coexistence issue, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies is carrying out a study entitled 'Scenarios for Coexistence of Genetically Modified, Conventional and Organic Crops in European Agriculture', commissioned by the Agriculture Directorate-General and coordinated by the Joint Research Centre.
The main aim of the study is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence.
The study aimed to identify the source and estimated levels of adventitious presence of GM crops in non-GM crops at farm level, identify and assess changes in farming practices that could reduce adventitious presence below policy relevant thresholds and estimate the costs of relevant changes in farming practices, monitoring systems and potential insurance systems.
The study confirms that cross-pollination and coexistence are issues that need to be considered in relation to agricultural production in general.
The results of the study need to be interpreted with caution.
Only three crops were analysed: oilseed rape for seed production, maize for feed use and potatoes for human consumption.
The results are derived from models and have not been validated by real field data.
Therefore this study provided preliminary conclusions but the hypothetical results need to be confirmed and further research will be done.
The Commission is discussing this and coordinating with the various directorate-generals.
This debate will certainly continue.
This is a very complex and sensitive issue, legally, technically and politically.
As I said earlier, we readily admit that we do not have all the answers.
However, what we can do - as we have done with other technologies - is to put in place a legal framework to deal with the potential benefits as well as the risks.
That is what we have tried to do with the revised Directive 18/2001/EC, traceability and labelling.
Consequently it will, for example, affect thresholds when it comes to seed regulation.
I thank you for this debate and I am sure we shall continue it at a later date.
Thank you Commissioner.
The next item is the debates on cases of violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The next item is the debate on the following five motions for resolutions on the International Criminal Court:
B5-0546/2002 by Mr Sakellariou and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the General Affairs Council's position concerning the International Criminal Court;
B5-0549/2002 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the International Criminal Court;
B5-0553/2002 by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the International Criminal Court;
B5-0557/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the International Criminal Court;
B5-0561/2002 by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the International Criminal Court.
Mr President, the aim of this report is to call upon the Council of the European Union to fulfil the commitments it has made as regards the ratification and effective establishment of the European Criminal Court.
Credit is due to the Danish Presidency for having made every endeavour to maintain a united Union position.
However, the General Affairs Council has assumed a very ambiguous position regarding the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements, following the offensive launched by the current US Administration in an attempt to obtain immunity for all US citizens across the board and the willingness to accept this demand displayed by a number of European countries, including Italy - something which particularly pains me - which, apart from being my native country, was also the first Member State to ratify the Treaty of Rome.
I would therefore like to stress how shameful it is that the United States should have gone so far as to resort to threatening to impose sanctions on the countries which have ratified or intend to ratify the International Criminal Court Statute, and emphasise that there can be no agreements allowing those who have debased themselves by committing crimes against humanity or genocide to do so with impunity.
Since the Rome Statute does not allow for derogations from this requirement, any agreement to that effect is to be deemed not to be compatible.
That applies to the 15 Member States, but also to the countries which are going to join the Union and the countries with which the Union enjoys relations.
The Council therefore needs to make every effort to hold a frank dialogue with the US Administration and to present to us a report stating a clear position on the compatibility of any potential bilateral agreements with the Rome Statute, before the Copenhagen European Council takes place.
Mr President, the United States' refusal to ratify the International Criminal Court is indicative of its pride, but also of the ridiculous, hypocritical nature of the Court.
It is supposed to give substance to the concept of international, immanent justice which can punish, if not prevent, genocide and crimes against humanity.
Even with one International Criminal Court conducting an investigation into a few crooks who bear a large part of the responsibility for the massacres in the former Yugoslavia and another conducting an investigation into the genocide in Rwanda, however, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that all those guilty of offences which are just as serious will be prosecuted.
How likely is it that the politicians and economic profiteers of the former colonial Belgian power, who consciously set the Tutsis and the Hutus against each other, will be prosecuted?
Will the French leaders be prosecuted, those leaders whose troops in Rwanda were present, holding their fire at the massacres unleashed by the government in office, when they did not make matters worse by supplying weapons to either side?
Will the United Kingdom be prosecuted for its part in the political man?uvres which played such a major role in the ethnic massacres in Sierra Leone?
How likely is it that George Bush, who is preparing, openly and publicly, to bombard tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians with the excuse that he is punishing their dictator, will be prosecuted before the Court for crimes against humanity?
How likely is it that the industrial groups which, thanks to the gung-ho activities of politicians, are free to derive considerable profits from the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, will be prosecuted?
Well then, the only effect of the International Criminal Court will be to add a touch of hypocrisy to an imperialist world where the strongest have the last word.
Mr President, we must maintain the integrity of the Rome Statute and be instrumental in getting the International Criminal Court up and running as soon as possible.
That is why it is unacceptable for the American Government to undermine the Court by trying to enter into bilateral agreements with EU countries or candidate countries.
I am pleased that the Danish Presidency has worked hard to maintain a common EU position, and I am sorry that no such position has come about.
The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure, and I want, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened.
As is well known, the United States signed the statute, but has withdrawn its signature.
I hope that the Council will embark upon a new dialogue with the American Government concerning the recognition of the International Criminal Court, which all the Member States and most of the candidate countries have now ratified.
The EU and the United States share the same basic values.
Both parties profess freedom and democracy and the defence of human rights and the principles of the rule of law.
That is why the United States, which will be able to contribute in a particularly positive way to the Court and to the way it operates, should be among the signatories of the Rome Statute.
Since 1998, the EU has tried to accommodate American anxieties in relation to certain provisions of the Statute, but its efforts have unfortunately been in vain.
It is unfortunate, moreover, that the United States does not now intend to be a party to the statute which, as I say, it in fact signed during the Clinton administration.
The United States' decision is wrong, and we must all regret the American measures.
We must therefore hope that the United States can be convinced to adopt a more positive line once the Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be misused for political purposes.
Mr President, this debate on the International Criminal Court has gone from one extreme to another.
We heard one extreme earlier, in Mrs Cauquil's speech.
Mrs Cauquil, I must say to you in all honesty that we do not want an international revolutionary tribunal.
Putting forward theses such as yours is a sure-fire way of scuppering the whole idea of a criminal court.
On the other hand - and here I do agree with you - we do not want a criminal court to be no more than a rubber stamp in the hands of the major powers.
I am really sorry that the forces that, even if they are not willing or able to prevent this court completely, want to downgrade it to some sort of rubberstamp are gaining ground in the USA and China and Russia and other countries.
We in the European Union are going the way of the law and I think that this forms part of a good and important tradition.
The Council of Europe was founded as a human rights community here in Strasbourg over 50 years ago.
The Human Rights Convention was adopted and the Court of Human Rights was created here in Strasbourg.
For the last 50 years, the European Parliament has sat here in Strasbourg as the voice of the people, as the voice of the European rule of law and because we want to extend this rule of law to the whole continent, we quite deliberately set the idea of the Copenhagen criteria, democracy and the rule of the law, at the spearhead of the historic enlargement process, which is now approaching its culmination.
This is a consequence of our history, which has, unfortunately, seen its own share of genocide, expulsion, disenfranchisement, suppressed minorities and crimes against humanity.
We have no right to play teacher to the rest of the world, as we sometimes do, unless we take our own rule of law seriously.
That does not just mean respecting the rule of law internally, it also means being the strong partner for others throughout the world, when it comes to the worldwide rule of law.
The criminal court, like our founding treaty, was born in Rome and the idea of Rome is somehow bound up with the concept of law.
The Rome Statute underlying the criminal court should not be undermined, weakened or watered down.
If we do not want the courts needed for genocide and recurrent crimes against humanity to be wrongly denigrated as victor's justice or one-off justice, then we need a permanent criminal court to which all are equally subject, large and small states alike, whatever the nationality of the perpetrator or criminal.
That is why we want to hold on to this Statute as it stands.
We are severely critical of the Council of the European Union for skimping on clarity and dignity here, for repeatedly trying to get by with devious manoeuvres and for repeatedly giving in to the powers that be.
If Europe wants to take itself seriously, it must fight for this criminal court and must say to the United States of America that they are indeed our most important ally, but that just such an ally has a duty within the free world to take the law seriously, however uncomfortable it may find it.
We do not need more unilateralism in response to 11 September; we need to strengthen the rule of law throughout the world, which is why we are calling for fast, undiluted ratification of the Rome Statute.
Mr President, the last time we debated this, in answer to my question, the President-in-Office confirmed that agreements under Article 98(2) are compatible with the Rome Statute and indeed are foreseen in the Rome Statute.
I am therefore slightly surprised at the negative text of the resolution we have before us and at some of the contributions to the debate, because the General Affairs Council surely produced a very good outcome - European solidarity was confirmed.
It was a good example of how the common foreign and security policy works in bringing Member States together and it preserved the integrity of the International Criminal Court.
So we should really be welcoming that agreement, particularly as it established the general principles governing any agreement to be signed, including the point made by colleagues that no agreement should be signed if it means that people will enjoy impunity.
That is specifically ruled out.
We must recognise the reality: the Americans need to be brought gently along and persuaded that this is not a witch-hunt against American forces, it is about having international law ruling the whole of global politics.
Mr President, in response to this interesting albeit short debate, I would like to say, on behalf of the Commission, that the European Union is, as we have already heard, firmly committed to the International Criminal Court, which it considers to be a critical development in the quest for international protection and human rights.
The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the Court, are obviously in line with the principles and objectives of the Union.
Our commitment is articulated, as Mr Titley just reminded us, in the common positions on the ICC adopted in June 2001 and revised in June 2002.
It is reflected in the Action Plan on the ICC adopted in May of this year and the conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council as recently as 20 September.
These decisions all give clear evidence of the European Union's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court.
Consistent with that is the fact that the European Union is actively committed to ensuring the widest possible signature, ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute.
To that end, between 1995 and 2001, the Commission's European initiative for democracy and human rights financed nearly EUR 7 million in projects with this purpose in various parts of the world.
An additional EUR 6 million is earmarked for projects in 2002/2003.
As well as continuing to encourage all states that have not already done so to sign, ratify and adopt implementing legislation for the Rome Statute as soon as possible, we also encourage all states to respond to Washington's request for immunity agreements in a manner which is consistent with the Rome Statute.
The conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council on 30 September provide guidance on the ways to ensure that such responses preserve the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which is absolutely fundamental and vital.
The European Union also wants all states which have ratified the Rome Statute to be actively involved in nominating and electing the chief prosecutor and judges of the International Court.
This should be done in a manner consistent with the process and criteria established by the Rome Statute and the resolution of the first assembly of states parties.
I am grateful for this opportunity to set out the position of the Commission and the European Union.
Mr President, pursuant to Article 142, I should like to ask the Bureau how, under Article 50 of our Rules of Procedure we will be discussing a matter such as the dialogue with Iran in the field of human rights? What does this have to do with urgent cases of breaches of human rights?
This has nothing to do with the provision of Article 50(1).
The motion tabled by the Socialist Group, concerning the stoning of women, a frequent practice in Iran, which is even inflicted on girls of 9 years old, made perfect sense.
This is something I fail to understand, Mr President.
I wish, however, to ask the Bureau a second question: If we are going to look at the dialogue on human rights between Iran and the European Union; I should like the Bureau to clarify the precise meaning and scope of this debate, because according to the Iranian authorities and according to what we can read about the dialogue on the Internet, what they are saying is that Islam is being persecuted in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom.
It is there, in print.
I should like to have clarification of this matter.
Mr Casaca, I would remind you that it is the Conference of Presidents which establishes our agenda, after which it is approved by the plenary, and that it is then, and only then, that Members may express their objections.
I am afraid you have waited too long to express your objections and I urge you to do so earlier next time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately after the debates, at about 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions concerning the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran:
B5-0548/2002 by Mr Ford and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on death by stoning;
B5-0551/2002 by Mrs Frahm and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;
B5-0552/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;
B5-0554/2002 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Gahler, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;
B5-0556/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Iran;
B5-0559/2002 by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on executions and stoning in Iran.
Before giving the floor to the authors of these motions for resolutions, I would point out, ladies and gentlemen, that we are extremely behind schedule.
If you want the House to be able to express itself by voting on your scintillating speeches, I would ask you to genuinely respect your speaking time.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in this debate on a resolution that has jointly been tabled by five groups.
This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and, more rarely, men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years.
Seventy-five people died in 2000, 139 in 2001 and so far this year 250.
We note the letter of 23 October from the Iranian ambassador to the EU, assuring us that there have been no cases of stoning in recent months and that directives have been issued by the competent authorities for the cessation of this process and are being observed.
Nevertheless, we are not entirely reassured while sentences of death by stoning continue to be passed and while the use of the death penalty more generally continues to grow.
The European Parliament and the EU generally protest against the use of the death penalty throughout the world, whether it be in the United States, China, Japan or anywhere else, and Iran is no exception.
Nevertheless, we recognise that sections of Iranian society are trying to move on.
Forces of progress who want to see a less cruel form of Islamic society exist and they are growing in numbers.
This resolution does not threaten talks between the EU and Iran regarding future trade and cooperation agreements, though it is clear that this will include a human rights clause.
The European Parliament, which has to approve such agreements, will watch with close attention.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a government that has presided over the execution of over 250 people since January 2002, including 27 since 30 September alone - the day on which negotiations were held between the EU and Iran; one which, secondly, includes a woman such as the advisor to President Khatami, a woman who has said that stoning is a legitimate and defensible method of protecting family values; thirdly, one that sentences human rights activists such as Nasser Zarafshan to years in prison - such a government deserves the label 'inhumane regime' and must be condemned in the strongest terms.
I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran.
However, I simply cannot understand why negotiations on a cooperation and trade agreement between the European Union and Iran should begin on 29 October.
Parliament has called on numerous occasions for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be suspended or frozen when human rights are being violated.
So why are we applying this double standard?
The Council decided on 22 October, just two days ago, not to table a human rights resolution on Iran at the next sitting of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
I find that totally unacceptable.
I cannot but wonder if the reason for not wanting to expose the Iranian Government now is that it does not square with the policy on Iraq?
We in the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left support the joint motion, although it does represent a shift from the real resolution on human rights to a composite resolution on human rights plus cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but we think that parts of items 4 and 5 are wrong for the reasons I have mentioned and we have therefore applied for a split vote.
I really would be delighted if the hope reflected by this common motion were to be fulfilled, by which I mean if an end to human rights violations in Iran were to give us cause for optimism.
However, present circumstances alone give me no cause whatsoever for any such belief, which is why we must raise our voices, at any rate here in Parliament.
Mr President, first of all a point of parliamentary self-criticism.
As far as I can see, this draft resolution seems to be remiss on one particular point from an editorial point of view.
The four Iranian women condemned to death by stoning have not been fully named with first names and surnames - see the end of Paragraph 3.
Of the four names mentioned, for example, two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names.
I therefore propose a correction to the text for the sake of the case of these condemned women.
Speaking metaphorically, the dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran on human rights is very much an uphill struggle.
From the European perspective, we have to guard against being responsible for obstructing the way ourselves.
Any hand extended by Iran is therefore welcome.
We welcome particularly the valuable gesture made by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kharrazi, to an ad hoc delegation visit of this Parliament on 20 July, who wanted direct contact between representatives of the Iranian legal system and EU lawyers.
I would like to see the Council and the Commission seize this offer as quickly as possible. After all, the Iranian sentences, which have been rightly challenged, can be dealt with by this motion for a resolution at a correct and conclusive level.
The chance of this type of contact should also be seized upon in order to oppose the barbaric sharia punishment of stoning.
For let there be no misunderstanding with regard to Europe's position towards Iran.
We cannot and will not live with a system which condones stoning fellow human beings, wherever this may be.
Mr President, as rapporteur for Iran, I support the joint motion for a resolution.
Dialogue with Iran is important, but our main concern, as the European Parliament, is for a human rights dialogue.
As parliamentary representatives, we are free from diplomatic constraints when it comes to demanding this universal principle, which is why we say loud and clear to any country concerned that we reject the death penalty in general.
As far as the rise in the number of death sentences carried out in Iran compared with previous years is concerned, I should like to state here how I evaluate the situation.
Conservative forces within both formal and informal structures are obviously using death sentences carried out or corporal punishment inflicted to intimidate both the people and the liberal forces in parliament and other societal institutions.
It has nothing to do with Islam or the Koran.
Because internal pressure is increasing, so is repression.
That is why we must stick to the demonstrable facts in all our criticism and check every allegation, irrespective of its source.
That is why I am against overloading the resolution with allegations which, in the final analysis, we cannot prove, thereby undermining our own credibility.
People have been sentenced to be stoned to death.
We have proof that two of these sentences were carried out in the first half of 2001, but not for 25 September 2002.
Let us therefore make use of Iran's readiness to discuss all human rights issues, including individual cases, without preliminary conditions, as expressed in talks with the EU-Iran Human Rights Exploratory Experts mission at the beginning of the month.
I still worry that the Council has drawn the short straw by officially refraining from tabling the annual human rights resolution on Iran at the United Nations.
It is not the Presidency that deserves to be criticised here, but the usual suspects who feel their plans may be upset.
What we do say is that it is good that they want to talk; let us hold a comprehensive dialogue and, if we see improvements, only then should we refrain from tabling new resolutions in due course.
There can be no upfront concessions at the expense of human rights.
Given the situation, we should clearly remind the structures in question in Iran - and in my view the Council and Commission as well - of one thing.
A negotiated agreement will only come about with Parliament's assent and the issues to which we shall be paying particular attention are those I have just addressed.
Modernisation currently taking place within Iran is still not leading to an improvement in the human rights situation.
Barbaric punishments are still being carried out.
The backward and medieval practice of stoning still forms part of its criminal justice system.
Individuals are publicly hanged, hands are chopped off for minor transgressions and eyes are even put out without anaesthetic.
Women are predominantly the victims of this inhuman judicial procedure.
If Iran is serious about opening itself up to the West, if it is serious about a dialogue with the European Union, then this violation of human rights has to stop.
The extreme nature of the sharia represents an insurmountable obstacle for normal relations.
There can be no question of a trade and cooperation agreement with Europe as long as the human rights situation is not resolved.
The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union have to make this very clear right from the start.
Does Commissioner Kinnock agree with me on this?
Clearly we cannot abandon a condemnation resolution in the UN if Iran continues with its evil infringement of universal principles.
This is not a question of a successful human rights dialogue with the EU as was suggested, but of a successful abolition of barbaric methods.
The European Union cannot afford to isolate Iran.
It is very important for reformists to be supported in their battle for a democratic and more humane Iran.
The younger generation wants change and offers hope.
Unfortunately the Iranian authorities do not know how to handle the situation.
But there is no substitute for openness and democratisation.
Modernisation can only triumph if barbaric practices and an evil past are brought to an end.
Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately what Mr van den Bos is saying is not presented clearly in this joint motion for a resolution and that is why we have not signed it.
As long as Khatami's adviser on women's affairs considers stoning to be a measure which underpins the family, we can only consider this to be truly horrible.
Since our resolution of 13 December 2001, 250 people have been executed in Iran, and 75 the previous year.
How can they speak about progress!
It does not look as if the human rights situation is improving.
I find that the motion for a resolution placed before us for our vote is not sufficiently clear.
Despite the visit by a European delegation in connection with human rights, there were still five public executions on 30 September.
We therefore condemn the European Council's decision not to introduce a resolution about human rights in Iran before the next sitting of the UN Comission on Human Rights in Geneva.
We want to state clearly and unambiguously that this resolution must be introduced before the next sitting.
We want to say in all clarity that the European Parliament cannot assume that we can discuss cooperation agreements if there is no real improvement to the situation on human rights in Iran and that is why we have not signed.
Mr President, Iran is a large and important country with an ancient tradition of culture and learning going back to the pre-Islamic Zoroastrian period.
It is also a country with which the West has had troubled relations over a number of years.
In rejecting Western consumerist values, Iran radicalised itself and supported radical Islamic groups in Lebanon, such as Hizbollah.
There is added complexity because the conflicts with the West have long been bound up with internal disagreements within Iran itself.
Recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere.
The result has been a thaw in relations which we should welcome in the EU.
Our relations will depend on fundamental progress in the areas of human rights and illegal immigration, weapons of mass destruction, in particular the country's nuclear weapons programme, drugs, the Middle East, Afghanistan and the battle against terrorism.
With regard to drug trafficking, the Iranians, who have a very serious drug problem of their own, should be commended for their efforts and cooperation.
They have also resisted the temptation to destabilise Afghanistan and have indicated they will not attempt to foment instability in Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein's departure from the scene.
Iran needs regional stability, and this has been recognised by the Iranian leadership.
On the Middle East, Iran has joined Saudi Arabia in accepting the principle of 'land for peace', if that is what the Palestinians want.
All of these developments are important and very welcome.
Iran needs to understand that Europe is extending the hand of friendship and that ways can be found to live together without Iran losing either its identity or its opposition to the worst of Western values.
It would be wrong for the European Union to overstress the issue of capital punishment per se, which remains legal, if used appropriately, in international law.
It is practised in the world's largest democracies such as the USA, Japan and India and is supported by tens of millions of citizens in my country, the UK.
Iran's leaders, however, should be in no doubt about the universal horror felt by us about the barbaric and medieval Sharia punishment of stoning to death.
I urge the Iranian leadership to reflect on this and to find solutions commensurate with Iran's dignity and history.
Mr President, sadly, it cannot be denied that there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of executions in Iran in the past year.
The practice of stoning men and, in particular, women, not only continues to be provided for by law but is frequently applied, as is shown by the many death sentences already pronounced.
As we are aware, in the coming months, a further four women will be stoned under a legislative framework which forces an oppressive, discriminatory system of control on women.
As far as respect for fundamental rights is concerned, the deterioration of the situation in Iran has been pointed out and emphasised by a number of organisations as well as a UN General Assembly resolution and the most recent report produced by the Special Representative of the UN Human Rights Commission on Iran.
Now, in the dialogue taking place between the European Union and Iran, the Union's exploratory mission did indeed record willingness on the part of the Iranian Government to discuss human rights issues, including specific cases, but this verbal expression of good will has not been borne out by any practical measure.
Quite the opposite: the situation seems to be deteriorating. Although it is true that we must welcome signs of cooperation from the Iranian Government, we also need to realise that the increase in executions and the continued stonings are a negative sign for the Union, which cannot accept them out of respect for its own Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions.
It is therefore imperative that, at all stages of the current dialogue, the Union makes clear that it is an absolute necessity that Iran guarantees respect for fundamental rights, especially women's rights, and that it reiterates the need for Iran to abolish the death penalty, the practice of stoning and all other inhuman or debasing practices.
There were many of us, not only here in Europe but throughout the world, who put our faith in President Khatami.
That applied above all, of course, to the Iranian people.
We all hoped that he would be able to lead Iran onto a more democratically open and tolerant path.
Unfortunately, we have all, time after time after time, been disappointed.
The latest reports are frightening.
Journalists, intellectuals and critics of the regime disappear and are tortured, imprisoned and put on trial for trivial reasons.
The death penalty is frequently applied.
In that respect, Iran is one of the world's worst offenders.
The latest reports of women having been stoned to death according to ancient sharia laws are utterly hair-raising.
The fact that this is happening in 2002 is completely unacceptable.
A whole world turns in abhorrence upon Iran.
Relations between the EU and Iran are characterised by a certain amount of caution, which is good.
If these relations are to become meaningful, the issue of human rights must always be at the top of the agenda, however.
I would also draw attention to the fact that Parliament has its veto when it comes to acknowledging possible agreements, and this is something we shall use if the situation does not improve.
Mr President, we too protest against the sentences inflicted on many Iranian women, against the disgraceful sentence of death by stoning and against the two-fold oppression of women by the dictatorship of mullahs.
We will vote for the resolution on the table in the hope that it will put pressure on the leaders of these countries and induce them to put an end to these barbaric practices.
The dictatorship of mullahs is not the only regime under which women are barbarically oppressed, however.
This is also the common practice of numerous regimes which the major powers consider to be their allies and on which they have the means to exert effective pressure, starting with Saudi Arabia and some of the oil emirates in the region.
I also protest against the barbarity of the death penalty and against obscurantism, even when it is not practised by primitive religions but by the leaders of the principal world superpower, which has the gall to set itself up as the defender of civilisation.
Mr President, it is true that President Khatami inspired hope concerning human rights in Iran, hopes that he himself crushed a long time ago, however.
Now, he is demonstrating good will in the light of the trade agreement with the EU.
We do not need good will, however; we need results.
I agree with all my fellow MEPs who have said that we cannot enter into any trade agreement with Iran.
It would be completely schizophrenic, on the one hand, to say that we want to see a strongly critical resolution in the UN and, on the other hand, to enter into a trade agreement with the same country.
Let us think for a moment.
Of course we must embark upon the critical dialogue with Iran, and if this yields fruit in terms of our no longer seeing stonings or barbaric death penalties and sentences in Iran, then we can of course begin to pave the way for trade agreements.
Not a moment before, however.
Mr President, I hope that discussions on Iran will take place soon in the form of a dialogue between parliamentary committees and that an association agreement will be signed and implemented as a result.
Both sides need to make an effort if we are to achieve this objective.
On our side, we need to show we are willing to acknowledge the history of this vast country, as well as its present situation and the natural and socio-economic factors which shape it from both within and without.
We need to set an example and show our confidence in the leaders and people of Iran, the charming, dignified, talented people of Iran looking forward to democracy and reform, witness the hope they still place in President Hatami, who really is fighting to bring about changes in their theocratic regime.
On Iran's side, its leaders must realise that the West, and the European Union in particular, will only open up to and work with the developing world if it respects human rights; these are not values Europe wishes to impose, they are ecumenical values and they include women's rights, which are particularly prone to abuse.
Communication and dialogue will help here.
So let us continue and strengthen this dialogue and signal once again, via this resolution, that we shall not waver from our principles and values and that this will be reflected in the preparations for and final text of the association agreement.
May I state, as coordinator of the European People's Party in the Committee on Women's Rights, that we are giving this matter serious attention.
We are planning a fact-finding mission with our opposite numbers and representatives of civil society and we shall lobby for the final text of the agreement, if it comes to that, to include a clear, express clause on women's rights.
Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to honourable Members for tabling this motion for a resolution.
Naturally, the Commission continues to be concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and, in particular, by the persistence of repressive measures against democratic institutions, civil society and the media.
The prevalence of arbitrary arrests, torture, discrimination against minorities and evident lack of the rule of law are all deeply disturbing.
The all-too-plentiful evidence of the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, including the appalling stoning of children, of women and of men, continue to demonstrate the scarcity of civilised standards.
The most effective way to raise these concerns is through the half-yearly comprehensive dialogue meetings, bilateral talks at ministerial level and similar sustained activities.
In addition, avenues for more direct and specific dialogue have been explored recently by the troika, as several Members said.
On 21 October the GAERC endorsed the strategy for starting a human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the recommendations of the exploratory troika mission that visited Teheran from 30 September to 1 October last.
During these explanatory talks, the Iranian Government voiced a political will to enter into a human rights dialogue and to do so largely on the EU's terms.
No restrictions were requested in relation to the list of human rights issues to be discussed and the dialogue will be regularly assessed with the help of specific and realistic benchmarks, such as reports from the visits of the United Nations thematics rapporteurs.
The dialogue would initially take the form of an experimental round table in Teheran in December of this year.
Its format will be assessed immediately after the first session and could be revised, as necessary, in the spring of 2003.
The opening of negotiations with Iran on a trade and cooperation agreement, indissolubly linked to instruments on political dialogue and counter-terrorism, gives the European Union substantial leverage, since the progress in the negotiations will be directly related to parallel progress in, among other things, human rights.
This connection is at the heart of the political package defined at the June Council and formally adopted on 12 July.
The establishment of a structured EU-Iran dialogue on human rights is obviously not a complete antidote to the variety of deep and serious concerns.
At this juncture, however, it seems to constitute the most effective available means of promoting our attempts to bring about tangible improvements in the grievous human rights situation in Iran.
I emphasise that, in all of this, our concerns relate to the basic rights and well-being of human beings, regardless of their faith, regardless of their customs.
That is the fundamental value that guides us and provides the motivation of the European Union.
We will continue to act upon those fundamentals.
Mr President, Commissioner, just one supplementary question.
Would the Commission be prepared to include the European Parliament in the December round table in Teheran which was mentioned?
Mr President, I can certainly make enquiries of my colleagues whose portfolios directly concern this issue.
I am certain that the Commission, whether Parliament is involved or not, will welcome any reinforcement of its consistent and assiduous efforts to achieve objectives that we know are fully shared by this House.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m., that is if the Members wishing to speak on the final item on the agenda make an effort to be concise.
The next item is the following six motions for resolution on the situation in Nepal:
B5-0545/2002 by Mr Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0547/2002 by Mrs Carrilho and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0550/2002 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0555/2002 by Mr Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0558/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Nepal;
B5-0560/2002 by Mr Messner and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Nepal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing our sympathy for the Nepalese people, for whom the last few years have been one of the most difficult periods in their history.
Nepal's fledgling democracy is shaky and the rule of law is constantly giving way to the arbitrary and to violence.
Over 3000 people have died in less than a year - which is appalling - following the violent confrontations between the army and the Maoist guerrillas, whose aim is to overthrow the monarchy, apparently against the wish of the population.
In actual fact, this people has been subjected to a genuine civil war for over six years, and the reaction of the international community has been almost total indifference.
The difficult situation has just been violently exacerbated by the events which took place at the beginning of this month.
In announcing the dismissal of the Prime Minister and temporarily assuming the executive powers, something which has not happened since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1990, King Gyanendra has sparked off a major political crisis. Indeed, even though he subsequently appointed another Prime Minister, the new Prime Minister has no representative legitimacy and, indeed, the King must be sorely tempted to use the fight against Maoist guerrilla groups to suspend the rule of law and put an end to the period of parliamentary democracy which has prevailed for 12 years.
These events have destabilised Nepal and thus exacerbated the unrest and instability throughout the region as a whole.
The European Union can no longer be content just to express good intentions faced with such a situation.
We must urge the new Prime Minister in the strongest terms possible to resume unconditional dialogue with the Maoist rebels. Moreover, it would be desirable, in this respect, for the Council to appoint a special representative for Nepal without delay, who would, if necessary, be able to serve as mediator between the two sides.
Lastly and most importantly, given that this conflict is largely the result of economic and social problems, we must set aside a substantial amount of financial aid in order to be able to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and democracy in this small kingdom when the time comes.
Mr President, the escalation of force in Nepal is an unacceptable threat to stability in the entire region of the Himalayas.
The destructive work of the Maoist guerrillas continues unabated.
In many parts of Nepal there are no longer any schools or hospitals and the infrastructure will be in ruins for years to come.
Every week we hear of more police officers and civilians murdered.
The most recent low point was when the famous statue of King Gyanendra was blown up in the middle of Patan, an area that I know well.
One passer-by was killed and nine others were injured.
The guerrillas - unlike the majority of the population who are unequivocal in their support - want an end to the constitutional monarchy.
Over 5 000 people have fallen victim to the violence since 1996.
It was only last May that the European Parliament conferred with Prime Minister Deuba in Brussels.
Now the King has sacked him because, contrary to what he said in public, he was in favour of postponing the November elections for a year.
Bahadur Khadka, whom the King appointed as his successor , and who has already been prime minister twice before, is now heading the transitional government and has announced that he intends to secure peace and stability in the country and start negotiating with the rebels.
The position of the PPE-DE is perfectly clear.
Nepal needs the rule of law, pluralism and continuing parliamentary democracy.
The fight against corruption and nepotism must be stepped up and the postponed elections must be accompanied by effective security measures, so that they can be held as quickly as possible.
We call on the European Union, across the party political divide, to offer its services as mediator.
The Council should appoint a special representative for Nepal.
I hope the Commission shares this position.
I have acted as vice-chairman of the SAARC delegation for many years and know from my regular contacts with and in Nepal that Europeans are held in high regard.
We could start acting as honest brokers right now and make an important contribution to the peace that the Nepalese people have long deserved.
Mr President, it looks as though in Nepal, the very beginning of democracy has been murdered along with King Birendra.
The current ruler is concentrating all power in his own hands.
The state of emergency has been replaced by a permanent state of absolute power with no real hope of improvement.
The rebel movement grows daily because the sense of hopelessness is steadily increasing in the countryside and young people join the rebels.
They are fighting a corrupt regime which owns 95% of the country's wealth.
And some of our Member States, including my own, Belgium, are sending weapons to this country.
In its earlier resolutions, the European Parliament has rightly urged that Europe should make the effort not just to support democracy but also to ensure that a political solution and negotiations can be achieved, but not that more powerful weapons should be delivered allowing even greater repression. This contravenes the European code of conduct itself.
In the last six years alone five thousand people died in Nepal.
Yesterday, another 25 were killed in various clashes.
I do not care which side the victims come from, what concerns me is that we must strive for a peaceful solution, that the only hope we can give this country is developing its land and providing opportunities for its people.
I therefore hope that you will support our amendments which refer to these points.
For surely it is unacceptable for there only to be one answer: shooting and killing.
We do not think that this is acceptable and we ask your support otherwise we will not be able to endorse this resolution, at least as far as I am concerned.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is universally known that human rights are being violated in Nepal.
This resolution rightly condemns all acts of violence, those perpetrated by the security forces, but also those by the Maoist rebels.
It rightly presses for mediation and political consultation.
However, it rightly asks for the underlying causes of the conflict to be addressed, that is, abject poverty, social inequality and marginalised population groups.
In August, the European Commission provided EUR 615 000 for a peaceful solution to the conflict.
Against this background, it is unwise to supply murder weapons to Nepal.
It is also a clear violation of the code of conduct regarding the export of weapons.
The Flemish Greens clearly state that the conditions for supply are not fulfilled and our party will continue to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Belgian Parliament whether it is still possible to suspend the planned supply of weapons.
In this sense, this resolution is a more than obvious sign to Mr Michel of a poor, incoherent document.
The Nepalese need ploughshares, not weapons, Mr Michel.
Mr President, together with honourable Members, the Commission deplores the increasing number of victims generated by the clashes between Maoists and government forces in Nepal.
It is particularly concerned by human rights violations both by the insurgents and by counter-insurgency forces in and around the country.
Observers believe that there cannot be a durable military solution to the crisis and that it is extremely urgent to end a period of political instability caused by endemic rivalries among the different leaders of various political parties.
The Commission hopes that the designation by the king of the new Prime Minister, Mr Chand, as head of an interim caretaker government, will give the necessary impetus to rebuild the national consensus, including efforts to improve governance, allow free and fair elections as soon as possible and re-open the dialogue with the Maoist insurgents.
Ongoing consultations with political parties should help to complete the formation of the new government From it, we expect tangible initiatives to foster multi-party dialogue and the implementation of urgent measures to fight the underlying socio-economic causes of conflict to which Mr Staes and other Members have rightly referred.
Within the context of its cooperation activities, the Commission is ready to provide support to long-term development initiatives, especially for poverty alleviation in critical areas of the mid-western part of Nepal and to provide support to local institutions seeking to strengthen the rule of law and the protection of human rights.
The Commission calls on the authorities to create the conditions for holding peaceful and democratic elections and to announce new dates for local and parliamentary elections soon.
Meanwhile, the Commission confirms that the funding foreseen for the planned EU election observer mission will remain committed until December 2003.
At this juncture, these are all the feasible and practical undertakings we can give to try and resolve an appalling and long-lasting bloody situation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed immediately to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5 40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 24 October 2002.
On 31 October 2002, a violent earthquake hit the region of Molise in Italy which resulted in the destruction of some villages and claimed the lives of a number of people.
In particular the small town of San Giuliano di Puglia was destroyed and a school collapsed killing 29 people, 26 of whom were children.
The entire primary class of children born in 1996 was killed under the rubble of that disaster.
Many of the families are now left homeless with winter approaching.
All natural disasters and tragic events provoke in us a response of sympathy and kindred feeling for those who have suffered.
On this occasion, however, throughout Europe and further afield, people were deeply touched at the tragic loss of the lives of so many young children.
On behalf of the European Parliament I have expressed our sympathy and condolences to the Mayor of San Giuliano di Puglia, to the President of the region of Molise and to the families of the victims.
I invite you now to observe a minute's silence in their memory.
(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)
I also regret to inform the House that this morning a Luxair plane flying from Berlin to Luxembourg crashed in Niederanven on its approach to Luxembourg Airport, carrying 19 passengers and three crew.
The initial reports suggest that as many as 17 people have died in this tragic accident.
Earlier this morning in France, a train en route from Paris to Vienna caught fire near Nancy.
Twelve people lost their lives in this tragic accident.
I would like to inform you that on my own behalf and in the name of the European Parliament, I have expressed to the Luxembourg and French authorities our solidarity with and deepest sympathy for the families of all those involved in these tragic accidents.
I would also like to inform the House that I have written a letter to the President of the Duma expressing our condemnation of the act of terrorism in the Doubrovka Theatre in Moscow where over 700 people were held hostage.
I expressed our deep regret at the subsequent loss of life.
Mr President, I have just returned from a trip to the Mexican State of Jalisco, where I was an eyewitness to the devastating effects of a hurricane, particularly in Puerto Vallarta.
Fortunately, thanks to the diligence of the local authorities, there have been no human casualties, but the material damage has been very considerable.
Mr President, I would be grateful if you could contact the Mexican authorities, the President of the Republic, who was here in our Parliament in May, and the Governor of the State of Jalisco, on behalf of this House, to express our solidarity with them in the face of these events.
I would also like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that its Vice-President is here - to study as carefully as possible how the European Union can respond with solidarity in the face of a disaster of this type, whether in the form of emergency aid or of reconstruction and rehabilitation, given that Mexico is a positive and active partner of the European Union and is linked to the Union by means of an Association Agreement and shares our system of values, as demonstrated recently on the issues of the death penalty, the International Criminal Court and the various debates that have been held recently within the United Nations.
Pursuant to Rule 111a I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for the inclusion on the agenda of an extraordinary debate on the seizure of hostages in Moscow and its tragic ending, and on the war in Chechnya.
Mr Solana will be making a contribution and will include a report on the EU-Russia Summit. This matter could be dealt with under this heading.
In the light of the horrific tragedy which occurred in Moscow and the horrific tragedy which has been going on for years in Chechnya, we feel it is necessary, on the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, in the presence of the Commission and of Mr Solana, to include a debate on Chechnya in our debates on foreign policy, as there are questions that we wish to raise with Russia regarding the massacres that have been carried out in Chechnya and regarding the lack of information Russian citizens were given following the horrific, tragic hostage-taking.
We therefore call for this item to be officially placed on the agenda and to be raised during the debates with the Commission and Mr Solana.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to say that we agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that this topic is of key importance.
However, our group does see the need for a thorough and somewhat more systematically-prepared debate to be held during the second November part-session, when we will be discussing relations between Europe and Russia.
There is obviously, though, no objection at all to the dreadful events in Moscow being specifically mentioned in items 22 and 23 of the resolution on the results of the European Council and to the topic also being raised during the debate with Mr Solana.
However, we consider it necessary for this topic to be discussed in a more structured way during the second November part-session, but as I said before, we have no objections at all to this point also being discussed in the debate on the results of the European Council and in this afternoon's debate with Mr Solana.
Mr President, on a point of order: I was somewhat astonished, at 1 p.m. this lunchtime, to learn of the existence of this application by the Greens.
We are a democratic group, in which decisions are never taken by the chairman acting alone.
I immediately sent an e-mail to the bureau and to the two co-ordinators, Philippe Morillon and Arie Oostlander, to the effect that we would support this application by the Greens subject to no objection being expressed to me.
My dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, I would, however, ask you to ensure that, in future, our groups have the time to discuss such an issue in a democratic manner.
In the absence of any objection from the bureau and the co-ordinators, our group is in favour of taking this topic and Mr Solana's statement together.
We are agreed therefore that we do not need a vote.
The matter is simply going to be taken as part of the general debate on Mr Solana's report on foreign policy.
Mr President, a few days ago, in Northern Ireland, a young Irish catholic was crucified by Protestant activists.
It seems incredible that a universal symbol such as the cross should be transformed into a hideous instrument of torture for political ends.
This is a disgrace to Europe.
I call upon the Presidency to express strong condemnation of a criminal action which goes against the most sacred values of our European civilisation, and not just in symbolic terms.
I certainly agree that it was a horrific attack and I will forward your request to the President.
The next item is the communication from the Commission on the package of proposals relating to nuclear energy: decommissioning and safety of reactors in the candidate countries, waste management and nuclear trade with Russia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its meeting today the Commission adopted a series of measures which, within the framework of the Euratom Treaty, are aimed at achieving a Community approach to the management of nuclear waste and nuclear safety.
This package consists of a communication, a proposal for a directive defining the general principles and obligations in relation to the safety of nuclear installations in the European Union and a proposal for a directive on the management of radioactive waste.
The package is supplemented by a draft Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement between Euratom and the Russian Federation on the trade in nuclear material.
I will comment on the reasons for, and the timeliness of, the proposal.
Ladies and gentlemen, the broad debate on the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply has highlighted the problem of the security of supply in Europe and the role played by nuclear energy in relation to it and our environmental commitments with regard to greenhouse emissions within the framework of the Kyoto agreements and Protocol.
Furthermore, nuclear energy is currently faced with two challenges, two problems mentioned during this debate: the safety of installations and the treatment of nuclear waste.
Despite the fact that the Euratom Treaty provides for important measures guaranteeing a high level of safety, above all with regard to non-proliferation, that is, the appropriate use of fissile material and radioactive material, the current situation is not as ideal as we would like.
Firstly, I must point out that in the various States of the Union there is no equivalent application of nuclear safety standards.
Secondly, it must be said that, in the negotiations with the candidate countries, we are demanding that the candidate countries comply with certain obligations and behave in a certain way, in the field of nuclear safety, which cannot be compared with anything in the current countries of the Union.
We are therefore faced with a situation in which there are significant disparities within Europe.
To a certain extent we are faced with a surprising situation.
We may, as I have pointed out on other occasions, have complete and detailed legislation on the quality of bathing water in the European Union but, nevertheless, we do not regulate the levels of security required of nuclear installations within the Union.
But furthermore, as I pointed out, in view of enlargement and the concerns of the European citizens, we must act quickly and decisively.
We are creating - and there is no other way of putting it - a situation of asymmetry between the candidate countries and the Member States of the Union.
What is our intention through these proposals?
Simply, a new Community vision of nuclear security and the treatment of radioactive waste.
The first relates to increasing safety in nuclear power stations and the issue of their dismantling.
We are talking about a proposal for a directive that is not yet approved since its legal basis is Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and that obliges us to submit this text to a committee of experts, consisting of experts from the different countries of the Union; it is still awaiting this procedure, and then the proposal will be approved definitively so that it can be communicated to Parliament and the Council.
Now, the proposal we are presenting today has three fundamental axes.
Firstly, it proposes common rules for nuclear safety; secondly, a Community system for controlling the application of these common rules and thirdly, it guarantees the existence and availability of the funds necessary for the dismantling of nuclear installations.
The common rules are based simply on the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the headquarters of which is in Vienna, but our proposal provides for something completely innovative.
That is that these rules, which within the framework of the Atomic Energy Agency are simply recommendations, thanks to the proposal for a directive, when they come to be adopted - as I hope they will - will become Community rules, and will therefore be binding on all the countries of the Union, with the legal force that Community law always has.
But furthermore, they are able to evolve and take up the results of the negotiations held over recent years with the candidate countries, negotiations which have allowed these common rules to be developed, which must be complied with, not only by the candidate countries, but also, in the Commission's opinion, by all the countries of the European Union without exception.
The second fundamental axis consists of how, once we have these common rules, we will control their effective application.
How can we guarantee to all the citizens that the required standards will be complied with in all the nuclear installations of the European Union?
Well that is very simple, ladies and gentlemen, there will be two systems.
Firstly, control is required of all countries.
Independent control authorities already exist.
The control of installations will still be a task for the national competent authorities of each and every Member State of the Union.
The innovation is that we are establishing a system of auditing crosschecks, promoted and coordinated by the Commission, which will guarantee the appropriate application of the Community rules within the different Member States of the Union.
But, furthermore, the third element of this proposal for a directive is the definition of Community rules for the creation, management and use of funds for dismantling nuclear power stations, with the aim of guaranteeing that the funds are sufficient and available.
I would insist that we believe it is essential that these funds are available when they become necessary.
We therefore propose a series of elements, but essentially the externalisation of these funds or an equivalent means of guaranteeing their availability to prevent them from, for example, in the event of bankruptcy, being included in the bankrupt assets and therefore not being available for their objective of dismantling the installations when the time comes.
The second directive, ladies and gentlemen, will contribute to the creation of new habits in the management of irradiated fuel and radioactive waste in the Member States of the Union.
