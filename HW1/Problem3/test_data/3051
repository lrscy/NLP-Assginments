However, we must also ensure that measures are taken which we must support through dialogue based on equality and an absence of tutelage.
Mr President, the slaughter of the Berbers is a fresh reminder of Algeria' s horrific reality.
Once again, our courageous foreign affairs ministers have decided to put their heads in the sand.
The entire world is being condemned, except for Algeria.
However, neither the oil interests, nor the current negotiations are enough to keep the gross human rights violations under wraps.
The MEDA agreements demand respect for diversity.
One third of the Algerian population are Berbers.
Pluriformity should form part of the state fabric.
Cultural, linguistic, but mainly social rights must be recognised if Algeria wishes to become a Treaty partner.
It is questionable whether we should enter into an agreement with Algeria where human rights are being violated on such a massive scale, even by government officials.
In my view, this can only be done if the government assures us that it will make every attempt to prevent the wrong-doings, and to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible, from whatever quarter.
An agreement on judicial cooperation is only meaningful if this is given substance by the Algerians.
At this moment in time, I still have grave doubts as to whether that is the case.
If I look back on ten years of oppression and extreme violence, I am shocked by the statistics. One hundred and fifty thousand killed and on top of that, 10 000 people who have disappeared without a trace, and Europe remains silent.
President Bouteflika constantly promises to contain the violence.
He pledges to investigate the recent tragedy in Kabylia, but will the guilty be punished?
I should like to reiterate it: the State' s most fundamental task is to protect its population.
It is shameful that the Algerian authorities should not be able to put an end to the abhorrent reality in their country.
Mr President, for ten days the region of Kabylia was the scene of a series of very serious incidents.
Following the death, on 18 April, of the young high school student, Guermah Massinissa in the police station at Beni Douala, impressive peaceful demonstrations were held at several locations, demanding that the persons responsible for this 'mistake' be brought to justice.
In addition, thousands of demonstrators, often very young, turned out to demand important social measures in this region, which has been hard hit by unemployment, poverty and even a housing shortage.
Without doubt, the roots of this discontent lie in the serious social crisis which has affected the whole of Algeria.
One rightly wonders if speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation already under way risks exacerbating the situation.
There is also a strong cultural demand in this region for the Amazigh language and culture to be respected, especially since the Berber Spring in 1980.
Provocation and other abuses of authority by the police with respect to the population also seem to be at the root of this positive outburst of anger.
So these were peaceful demonstrations calling for more social progress and greater freedom and democracy.
The marches turned into clashes which were put down by the security forces with a great deal of violence over a period of several days, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
Numerous eye witness accounts printed in the newspapers talk of outright brutality.
President Bouteflika and the national assembly announced that committees of inquiry would be set up.
We can only hope that they will be set up as quickly as possible and will have the means needed to work efficiently - and, more importantly, transparently - so that sanctions can be imposed on those responsible for the repression.
In another indication of the seriousness of the situation, the Rally for Culture and Democracy Party said that it was 'impossible for it to stay in a government which fires on young people' and withdrew from the coalition.
I am positive that the future of Algeria, whose people have courageously resisted barbaric pressure from Muslim fundamentalist terrorist groups, lies not in repression but in heeding the people's social demands and the often very courageous action of the various associations acting to defend women's rights, secure the repeal of the family code, care for traumatised children, keep solidarity alive in the face of serious social difficulties or defend human rights.
Nor does the future reside in the worrying restrictions on the freedom of the press which will result if the planned amendments to the penal code are adopted.
The European Parliament delegation travelling to Algiers tomorrow will certainly help us to gain an insight into the Algerian situation from our various contacts and listen in return to their expectations of the European Union.
In the same spirit, it will inspire the Commission to continue negotiations with a view to an Association Agreement, while taking better account of the opinion of political, trades union and community organisations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed the fate of this crisis-torn country since I was young.
I was a member of the parliamentary delegation which attempted to break the ice in the relations between the European Union and Algeria.
Yet many of our hopes have not been fulfilled.
Even our hopes of the new President Bouteflika, who has undoubtedly shown some signs of courage, and of the RCD's inclusion in the Algerian government have been disappointed.
In my view, the basic problem in Algeria is that the powers-that-be - le pouvoir, as the Algerians say - have failed to make genuine efforts to reach a consensus between the social groups in the country.
Contrary to the frequent accusations made against us, I do not mean a consensus with terrorists and murderers.
There can be no consensus here.
I mean a consensus with all the groups which do not wish to witness the victory of the radical Islamist terrorist forces.
However, the powers-that-be - or at least some sections of the military - have no interest in achieving this consensus. They want to maintain the status quo, and unfortunately, they are heavily implicated in corruption.
This is why there are so many incidents like the recent events in Kabylie, with their shocking death-toll and the resulting alienation between the country's young people and its ruling class.
I hope that the delegation which will be visiting Algeria in the next few days will be able to foster at least some understanding of what is required to give the young people of Algeria fresh opportunities and restore their sense of hope.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission deplores the recent incidents in Kabylie.
The many dead and hundreds of injured bear witness to the fact that the reform process in Algeria has still not achieved the desired results.
Yet it is also clear that there is no alternative to the policy of calling for and consistently supporting this reform process.
The European Union regularly addresses the issues of human rights violations, arbitrary arrests and torture in its political dialogue with Algeria.
At the 57th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March 2001, the EU called upon Algeria to take substantive measures in this area and allow the UN Special Rapporteurs on the question of torture and on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions to visit the country.
The issue of the disappearances of individuals is of particular concern to us.
During the troika's most recent visit to Algiers on 24 April 2001, the Algerian authorities were presented with a consolidated list of thirty old and new cases.
The Commission will continue to pursue this issue vigorously in future.
The Association Agreement currently being negotiated with Algeria contains a clause on democratic principles and human rights.
The speedy conclusion of this Agreement will equip the European Union with an effective instrument with which to engage in more intensive dialogue with Algeria at institutional level.
Since 1996, the Commission has committed EUR 300 million from its MEDA budget lines and under the financial protocols to support economic and social reform in Algeria.
In 2001, our aim is to promote balanced social and economic development, and we are therefore preparing two comprehensive projects for local development in rural areas and for rehabilitation measures in the regions affected by terrorism.
Human rights projects are also being funded through separate dedicated budget lines.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Bosnia/Herzegovina, particularly Banya Luka
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0357/2001 by Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
B5-0362/2001 by Swoboda and Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the attack against the rebuilding of the Mosque(s) in Banja Luka (and Trebinje) (Bosnia);
B5-0369/2001 by Pack and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the attack against the rebuilding of the mosque(s) in Banja Luka (and Trebinje);
B5-0375/2001 by Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the incidents in Banja Luka and Trebinje;
B5-0385/2001 by Morgantini and Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the incidents in Banja Luka and Trebinje;
Mr President, Commissioner, Bosnia-Herzegovina is, in fact, the touchstone of our dream about stability and peace.
So far, the international community has made efforts to support the peace forces in those countries.
Needless to say, there are also opposing forces, and those claim victims.
In addition to the fact that attempts are still being made from different quarters to have the last word, and to threaten Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unit, there are also religious conflicts, of course.
Conflicts which are related to the symbols, and anyone who is politically active appreciates the significance of symbols. That is also very much the case in a country which is torn by war.
It is therefore of key importance for us to join forces in a resolute manner, with all international, and particularly local, forces which strive for peace on the ground.
It is therefore also of key importance for us to be able to offer the guarantee that our presence there is not short-lived, that we persevere in our commitment, and that we can persuade the United States, which, with its new Bush administration, is forming a threat to that lasting stability, to continue its commitment to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the West, or the European Union, became actively involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina because it wanted to promote peaceful relations between the different social, religious and ethnic groups.
We did not want to accept that in today's and tomorrow's Europe, conflict and war could be caused by ethnicity or religion.
Dayton was the result, and led - as we believed - to the founding of a new state. This was and probably remains the only option to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina at this time.
Many of us here in this House are not satisfied with Dayton, but as I said, it was a chance to end the war.
What we cannot accept, however, is that we are now retreating from Dayton again.
There are some forces which actively support this development and want to create new or restore old ethnic divisions within Bosnia-Herzegovina.
First, there were the Croat extremists who, having lost Zagreb's support, have attempted to join forces and create their own new Croat (mini-) state in Bosnia.
Then there are the Serb extremists, who can undoubtedly count on continued support from Belgrade and perhaps even from President Kostunica on occasion, and who also believe that the time has come to settle old scores and prevent some elements of life in a multi-ethnic community from being restored, like the mosque where these incidents took place when the foundation stone was to be laid.
This development has undoubtedly been caused by the fact that refugee return and thus the 'mix' of the various ethnic groups have not taken place on the scale demanded by the international community, and especially by this House.
Moreover, the hindering of refugee return at various levels has undoubtedly also fuelled hopes that the mono-ethnic orientation and focus of the individual entities, especially the Republika Srpska, can be preserved.
We cannot be deterred now, however.
We must call upon everyone in a position of responsibility in this region, and of course in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, to ensure that Dayton at least - which is the very minimum we can or should achieve at this time - and multi-ethnicity are restored on the scale or in the direction which formerly existed.
To this end, it is essential that Croatia also takes measures with regard to its property laws, but also conditions at local level, to encourage refugees to return.
Above all, however, it is vital that Republika Srpska plays its part.
There is the agreement between the Croatian Foreign Minister and the former Prime Minister or President of the Republika Srpska.
The President is no longer in office, but even during his incumbency, little was done to comply with the provisions of this Treaty or these agreements.
This House must call on all sides and groupings in Bosnia finally to fulfil their commitments, and the commitments which were adopted on their behalf by the international community, because we - after all - were the ones who helped them end this dreadful war and the dying.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque.
This mosque was not destroyed in any war.
This mosque stood in Banja Luka, where there was no war.
It was razed to the ground in 1993, its foundations were torn up, and a car park was built on the site.
This mosque was destroyed - like hundreds of other Muslim and Catholic places of worship - on the orders of Karadzic and his henchmen.
Not only were these places of worship destroyed; hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats were forced to flee their homes at a time when there was no war in this region, namely between 1991 and 1995.
As Johannes Swoboda has already pointed out, the Dayton Agreement has now been in place since late 1995.
We never liked this Agreement.
It ended the war, but it has not yet brought peace to the region.
Six years have now passed, and we have to recognise that Dayton contains few promises and has achieved even less.
It has divided the country into two ethnic entities, a mono-ethnic Serb entity, and a Muslim-Croat entity.
This situation has proved highly problematical in practice.
In essence, we have created an artificial product.
Do we really expect Bosnia's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today?
It is extremely difficult.
What's more, we do not always help each entity equally.
The numbers of people returning are still too low.
Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled, and there are still half a million displaced persons in Bosnia who have not returned home.
I think we must appeal to everyone to take action here.
The Republika Srpska lags behind the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina with regard to refugee return, and this is obviously one reason for the situation which we witnessed ten days ago in Banja Luka. At the laying of the foundation stone of this ancient mosque, and eight days earlier at the laying of the foundation stone for another mosque in Trebinje, hardliners from the SDS, the Serb nationalists, were yet again able to drum up supporters who interrupted the ceremonies, set fire to buses, and threatened the lives of participants.
The President of the Republika Srpska and his government and Prime Minister must make serious efforts to condemn this incident and create an atmosphere which fosters peaceful relations between the communities, which were the norm in this region until 1991.
In my view, we should also have no qualms about coupling financial assistance with conditions at last.
We made it quite clear to Milorad Dodik, the previous Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska, that he could count on our financial support if he encouraged refugee return.
We supported his work when he was in office, yet he did not allow any displaced persons to return.
There is now a new government in office, and we really must proceed with caution.
We are talking about taxpayers' money here, and we must be sure that it is used to achieve the goals set by the international community and the European Union.
Refugees wishing to return must be able to do so.
The same naturally applies to the neighbouring region of Croatia as well.
In Croatia, there is a law preventing the restitution of property to Serb owners who fled from the region.
Admittedly, many Serbs no longer want to return, but their property should at least be restored to them, and they should be given support to enable them to return to - or from - Croatia.
We have addressed a number of other issues in our motion as well.
In the Muslim-Croat Federation, hardline Croat separatists are also disrupting peaceful relations between the communities and trying to set up a breakaway mini-state in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
They will never be successful.
The moderates are stronger, and we must give them our support.
However, given that the international community has a certain amount of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should not use it arbitrarily to amend an electoral law in a way which discriminates against a specific ethnic group.
This simply reinforces the hardliners' cause and increases support for them.
I realise that this step is now regretted, but it is important to address this issue so that it does not happen again.
I hope that we will do everything possible within the scope of our CARDS programme to ensure that the refugees are able to return to all parts of the region.
This is the best contribution we can make to promoting peaceful relations between the communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr President, what is the European Union' s task with regard to Bosnia?
That is, of course, not difficult to answer.
We need to lend our support to the principles of multi-ethnic tolerance and cooperation, and support those who advocate these principles.
We also need to underline the importance of building democracy and the role of democratic, political parties in that region.
We also need to call a spade a spade.
This is done in this resolution, and the Republika Srpska is being urged not only to hand over Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic at long last, but also to mount a full enquiry into how the violence has actually been able to take root?
Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission, and particularly the Member States, to implement the recently concluded Stability Pact in its entirety and swiftly, including the pledged funds, since in that area, it seems as if things are not always running as smoothly as we would have liked.
Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina will either be a three-nation state, or it will cease to exist.
The country will only survive if - at least in the medium term - all three communities want to live in this state.
That sounds simplistic, but it is a fact which we very often ignore.
I therefore believe that the time has come not only to take action against the hardliners of all nationalities, but also to ask ourselves self-critically for once what we have done wrong.
In my view, Doris Pack pointed the right way forward here.
Dayton was a step towards the absence of war.
Now it is time to start moving towards genuine peace.
Moving towards peace ultimately means creating a tripartite federation in which all three communities enjoy equal rights.
Believe me, I do not want to justify the actions of the Croat extremists in Mostar, but one reason why they are popular, of course, is that they do not see why the Croats, as an ethnic group, do not enjoy the same rights as the Republika Srpska, for example.
This is an enormous problem which we must address, for in this respect, there is no equality or symmetry within the Federation.
The second point which we must be clear about - as Doris Pack has already mentioned - is refugee return.
In this area too, there must be no double standards, and the same applies to the issue of cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague.
There is a considerable lack of symmetry as regards the extradition of indicted persons to The Hague.
In the long term, the people in this region will only be prepared to cooperate with the Tribunal if they are confident that the perpetrators from all three communities will be extradited and convicted on an even-handed basis.
This means that we cannot always point the finger at others; we must be self-critical for once and admit that for a whole range of reasons, we very often apply double standards.
I should like to thank Mr Swoboda for openly addressing an issue which we must all be clear about: that unfortunately, President Kostunica also appears to be encouraging certain forces in the Republika Srpska to pursue nationalist policies.
I believe that we must make it quite clear to Belgrade that there are conditions attached to the assistance we provide, and that this type of support for the nationalists in the Republika Srpska is unacceptable.
There must be conditionality across the board: not only in our assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina but also to Serbia or Yugoslavia. We made this quite clear in the case of Croatia.
As for Yugoslavia, our euphoria about the ousting of Milosevic - which we naturally welcome - threatens to make us lose our perspective to some extent.
Unfortunately, that distorts our view of what is important in the region.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's horror and revulsion at the incidents in Trebinje and Banja Luka.
My colleague Chris Patten, who is responsible for this area of work, is visiting Bosnia this afternoon.
He has issued a statement condemning the violence and demanding that the Republika Srpska authorities find those responsible and make sure they face justice.
As regards the Croats' 'self-rule' within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission fully supports the High Representative's decision to remove Mr Jelavic from his position as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and his appeal to the Bosnian Croats to support the development of a stable multi-ethnic state.
Let me make one thing quite clear: the recent incidents do not further the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into European structures in any way; nor do they enhance the country's international reputation, especially among donors.
On the contrary, the incidents make it even more difficult to attract the funds which Bosnia so urgently needs, and on which it continues to depend.
The European Union will not withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We will continue our efforts to promote the reconstruction of the country and support the many citizens who yearn to live a life in peace.
However, the country's internal problems cannot be resolved merely by concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement or offering the prospect of closer relations with the European Union.
Instead, a key prerequisite for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union is that the country itself undergoes a profound transformation at domestic level and that in doing so, it respects the fundamental values, such as human and minority rights, on which the European Union is founded.
This transformation process is indispensable if integration into the EU is to bring additional benefits in terms of stability, security and economic development.
In the European Union's view, the progress achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the stabilisation and association process are the test of the country's willingness to complete this transformation.
Above all, we expect progress in implementing the specific measures agreed a year ago as part of the 'Road Map', which include refugee return.
Of the 18 measures in total, just 5 have been fully implemented so far.
A further 9 have been partially implemented, while 4 have still not been addressed at all.
Yet the next phase of the process, that is, the feasibility study, cannot begin until all the measures have been implemented.
As part of the CARDS programme, the Commission will continue to focus its assistance on target groups which promote refugee return and the reconciliation process.
Out of a total of EUR 105.3 million in funding for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2001, EUR 37.3 million - by far the largest individual amount - will be used to support refugee return.
Of this figure, around 16 million are earmarked for the fostering of integration, reconciliation and institution-building, which includes strengthening the constitutional court and three human rights bodies.
In line with the calls voiced here by the honourable Members, the assistance provided within the CARDS framework is linked to conditions.
As there have been more obstacles to refugee return in the Republika Srpska than in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska has received less funding in this area.
When deciding on the restructuring or cancellation of assistance, it must be borne in mind that the CARDS programme provides support for major structural projects - such as refugee return, human rights, judicial reform, and the development of an independent media - which are a priority for the EU.
Abandoning these projects would merely give fresh impetus to the extremists in Bosnia, who are also hostile to projects of this kind.
In contrast to CARDS, the Commission's reciprocal macrofinancial assistance is not linked to specific conditions.
The assistance is provided as part of a coherent macroeconomic package which was agreed by the authorities in the region and is supported by the international financial institutions.
Due to the specific conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the Commission tries to ensure that the overall political environment, that is, the political reality on the ground, is as favourable as possible and that the macroeconomic assistance ties in with other measures taken by the Community.
Commissioner Verheugen, thank you very much for your statement.
Following on from your comments about all the problems faced in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I should just like to ask whether it is true that Bosnia-Herzegovina is scheduled to join the Council of Europe at that body's next or subsequent meeting.
I should like to ask whether this really is true, and whether all 15 of our Member States can shake hands on it before all the conditions which you have described are fulfilled.
Mr President, I am sorry, but my answer is simply that I cannot answer the question.
As you know, the Commission is not a member of the Council of Europe.
I must ask you to address your question to the committee which coordinates the position of the 15 Member States in the Council of Europe.
I would be very happy to assist you, of course.
Ladies and gentlemen, we were all witness to a rare event - a Commissioner not knowing the answer.
He is only human, and we must accept that!
Mr President, apart from the fact that yes, if Bosnia-Herzegovina is admitted, the country as a whole will be admitted, I would like to address the following question to you. Like Mr Posselt and various other honourable Members, I voted for the Friday in Strasbourg.
This was rejected yet again, so we only have the Thursday.
Could you tell us why we will be voting at 6.30 p.m. when the debate is likely to finish at around 5.10 or 5.15 p.m.?
I assume that it is too late for you to change these arrangements for today.
However, I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that when we discuss topical and urgent subjects on Thursday, we vote at the end of each debate, as used to be the practice.
It will make no difference to our views for or against the Friday if we could vote immediately after the individual debates about topical and urgent subjects.
We have already had this problem several times on Thursdays.
We set the agenda and then the debate proceeds faster or slower than expected.
We obviously need more practice!
As far as today's debate is concerned, it is difficult to tell at this stage when we will be finished. If we have a lot of interventions like yours, Mr Swoboda, it is quite likely to be 5.30 p.m.
Then there is the debate about three reports.
No break is scheduled between 5.30 and 6.00 p.m. The debate about the reports will take place during this period.
Human rights
Mr President, Commissioner, until recently, Ethiopia and Eritrea were locked in war.
Fortunately, that is now over, and this proud and wonderful Ethiopian people can once again start deciding on its own fate.
Sadly, we are forced to note that human rights are being violated, that people are being tortured and locked up in prisons at random, and that students are calling for academic freedom, to no avail.
This is painful.
As international community, we have concluded a partnership deal.
We will sign this as 'the Cotonou Agreement' .
In that document, we aim to establish good relations by entering into a dialogue with each other.
This also applies specifically to Ethiopia, a country which time and again appears on the list of countries which quality for emergency aid.
I hope that we, along with Ethiopia, can now finally turn over a new leaf, and that Ethiopia will be prepared - and I believe we should press for this, Commissioner - to free the people who are behind bars at present, because they are human rights activities, namely Messrs Woldemariam, Nega and Lidetu Ayalew, to allow students to return to their campuses in complete freedom and to observe the fundamental freedoms.
Mr President, the resolution is right to condemn a number of matters, and also calls for action on the part of Europe.
This is, in fact, possible within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement.
That is done in a country, Ethiopia, which is occupying an important position in East Africa. It has, under Mengistu, experienced a horrific period, and has, following a fierce civil war, eventually found peace.
Ethiopia is being governed by people originating from the resistance movement. At times, they still display characteristics of a certain 'bush' mentality and find it difficult to share power with others, as it were.
Tigreans play a major role in the government and do so very expertly.
The government also plays a crucial role in a number of peace-promoting initiatives, but is, at the same time, struggling to achieve good relations in Ethiopia, in its interaction with Eritrea, and also within Eritrea.
Attempts are being made to build a regional autonomy within the countries, coupled with a certain level of ethnicity, with respect for minorities.
This is a painstaking process and is also often accompanied by resistance from certain groups within Ethiopia.
We simply have to establish that it is still costing them a great deal of effort in order to build a more powerful, stable democracy.
In a way, I appreciate the efforts that this is costing them.
At the same time, however, we as international community can hardly ask anything else from them here than that they understand that if they do not observe human rights, do not show respect for groups who think differently, react with violence and violate human rights, this will eventually seriously damage their own status and our position, as well as our chance to support them.
I believe we need to operate within that context of understanding and insight, and must also be very clear.
That is why we will give our unqualified support to this resolution.
Mr President, few African leaders have been able to count on so much international goodwill when taking up office as the Ethiopian leader, Meles Zenawi.
The end of the military dictatorship, the peaceful separation of Eritrea and the formation of a government of national unity turned the country at the time into a fine example of a successful transition from dictatorship to democracy.
Unfortunately, this image has been brutally shattered.
The bloody border conflict with Eritrea, the government' s inability to prevent another famine and the repression of the past couple of weeks have seriously compromised Ethiopia' s image.
It is correct that unemployed young people have taken advantage of the student protests earlier this month to start plundering, but that in no way justifies the excessively harsh police action which claimed at least 30 lives.
Neither does it justify the gulf of repression during which students, journalists, human rights activities and opponents were rounded up and accused of inciting violence.
Ethiopia is facing two fundamental problems: firstly, the government' s insubstantial ethnic basis, and secondly, poverty.
As far as the first problem is concerned, an inter-Ethiopian dialogue must be established urgently, representing all political and ethnic groups. Europe can play a crucial role in this.
As for the second problem, the Ethiopian government must pledge its unconditional support to a peace agreement with Eritrea, so that the necessary funds for development are no longer diverted to defence expenditure and weapons.
Cameroon
Mr President, I cannot myself claim intimate familiarity with circumstances in Cameroon, but together with other colleagues in this House I have been approached by friends and acquaintances whom we trust in non-governmental organisations, notably the International Federation for Christian Action Against Torture, drawing to our attention matters of the gravest concern, which merit the attention of the institutions of the Union and in particular of this Parliament.
We have well-attested reports of the discovery of 2000 mass graves, of the arrest of senior officers of the gendarmerie, of inquiries into an organisation known as the Operational Command and generally matters of real concern.
It has been put to us that what is required is: an independent commission of inquiry to shed light on human rights violations, acts of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions, a commitment to protect adequately human rights defenders and local organisations working on this issue and the appointment of some special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary and arbitrary executions, with the working group on forced or involuntary disappearances being invited as soon as possible to inquire into matters in Cameroon.
By coincidence, today's Le Monde has a special supplement on Cameroon, the opening sentence of which tells us that all the evils of Africa are to be found in Cameroon and yet also all the reasons for hope for the better.
What has been revealed to us here suggests that both of these propositions are true: both the reasons for hope and the present evils.
Also, this week in Le Monde in relation to General Aussaresses we have been reminded that torture, disappearance and evil-doing and the use of humans as means and not as ends in themselves have terribly scarred the history of our own continent, both during the war of 1939 to 1945 and afterwards.
We are not in a position to hold ourselves up as being somehow superior but we can, as concerned human beings, share the concern of our fellows in Cameroon who are raising these points and members of international non-governmental human rights organisations who have been drawing it to our attention.
I strongly commend this resolution to the House and hope it will be adopted unanimously this evening.
Mr President, it is not the first time that NGOs and human rights organisations have sounded the alarm with regard to the human rights situation in Cameroon.
They are referring to disappearances, extra-judicial executions, tortures, mass graves and overcrowded prisons.
The special unit that controls banditry, in particular, is reported to indulge in the systematic violation of human rights.
The UN Committee against Tortures called for the swift dissolution of this unit, with good reason, in fact.
However, that is not enough, of course.
Cameroon suffers from an enormously huge problem of lawlessness.
We welcome the fact that the President, Mr Biya, set up an inquiry committee which led to the arrest of a number of suspected officers.
It will take more than that, however, to restore the confidence in the rule of law, such as an independent inquiry into the disappearances and into the mass graves, and especially into punishing the guilty.
Europe could help in this by making resources and expertise available to the legal system in Cameroon.
Without wanting to let the Cameroon leaders off the hook, I would, by the by, like to draw your attention to one of the fundamental problems of Cameroon and, in fact, of large parts of Africa, namely the dramatic slump in the price of raw materials.
Oxfam presented a report today in which it is assumed that the reduction in those prices of raw materials costs the developing countries more than the total amount that they receive in development aid.
I would therefore urge the Council and Commission to take the recommendation of the Oxfam report seriously, and perhaps we can organise a debate on this issue before long.
It is at any rate promising that the Belgian Presidency announced today that it wants to make Africa one of its priorities.
We welcome this, and will give our full cooperation.
Mr President, I am in complete agreement with my fellow members and would even add that the UN Committee against Torture has found that torture is rife in Cameroon and that this has been confirmed in the testimony of a former Cameroon minister who considers that the prison system is inhumane in Cameroon and that physical and mental torture are an everyday occurrence.
All this leads me to believe that the government of Cameroon, and it is perhaps this which worries me most today, no longer has any control over the special forces which it has set up, the special forces which appear to be responsible, among other things, for the disappearance of 9 young people who allegedly stole a cylinder of gas in the Douala sports district.
In order to prove good faith on the part of the government - my colleague said earlier that there were plenty of reasons for hope in Cameroon - I think that we have to go along with the UN proposal to set up a committee, as a matter of urgency, to look into all the extortion, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions identified over recent months.
I think that, today, Parliament cannot make do with adopting texts which are not respected and verified on the ground, especially as Cameroon has signed the Cotonou Convention of 23 June 2000 requiring that the parties undertake to promote and protect fundamental freedoms and all human rights.
We must call on Cameroon to respect this convention and find ways of excluding this country and any other country which violates the conventions which it has signed.
No difficulty, be it economic, social or demographic should or could justify torture.
Mr President, we in the Socialist Group and the European Parliament need to send a clear message to the Cameroon authorities.
In order for the Cotonou Agreement to be effective and credible, the European Union needs all the ACP countries, including Cameroon, of course, to use actions to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to democratic values.
The governments and in particular the State security forces of all the countries associated with the European Union need to have a clear understanding that security and public order cannot come before the exercise of people' s freedoms, not to mention their physical safety.
Cameroon is an important country in the regional context, whose indicators paint a hopeful picture of the economic situation, but we are obliged to look beyond this positive outlook and ask the government of Cameroon to make a greater effort to maintain the rule of law and to respect the rights of its population.
Similarly, we must ask the government of Cameroon to comply with the recommendations of the United Nations, which has already asked it to reform the structure and activity of its security forces, in order to ensure that they are made up of regular members and always act within the limits of the law.
Cameroon must understand that by making this effort, not only will it be satisfying the European Union and the other countries, but it will also be working in the interests of its own people.
Also, it is good for the whole of the African continent that European cooperation with Africa, both under the Cotonou Agreement and under bilateral cooperation with our countries, should be governed by respect for the values of freedom that we all profess to share.
I would like to finish by doing what my colleague Mr MacCormick did and also recognise the work and action of some non-governmental organisations such as FiACAT, which has passed on information and concerns to us in its constant monitoring of the situation in Cameroon.
We want to encourage local organisations even more, such as 'Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture' , which are on permanent alert on the ground and have consequently been victims of injustice.
They deserve and have our solidarity.
Press freedom in the world
Mr President, freedom of the press and freedom of opinion are the cornerstones of democracy.
People who have lived under totalitarian regimes know how important it is to establish and build on this cornerstone to its fullest capacity in every state.
They therefore also understand that manipulation of the press is an assault on democracy. In other words, when the press is compromised and manipulated, or when it loses its political plurality because it is a corporate monopoly, democracy is jeopardised to a high degree.
We must therefore not only put our finger on the wound in third countries, in the reform states, in order to foster democratic development by promoting freedom of the press. We must also look at ourselves.
I think it is especially important to ask ourselves whether an election can genuinely be described as democratic if a large number of the television channels are compromised.
Should we not also consider whether this is an area where we can make a contribution?
I think this applies to Russia as much as the EU Member States.
I therefore believe that it is important to include press freedom as an indicator in the human rights report.
Press freedom must be part of how we judge the clauses in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, how we judge how close the relations with Ukraine and Russia will be, but also how we judge the development of democracy in our own states.
Mr President, press freedom is one of the keystones that underpins real democracy.
This freedom is lacking in many dictatorships due to the fear on the part of those in power of informed citizens, debate, opposition and disclosure.
Europe needs to take a stand in favour of press freedom and those who fight for this, in a consistent manner.
Understandably, our attention turns to the developing countries and the former centrally governed countries which are now in transition.
This is with good reason, for we can often lend these countries real support with our aid and resources to local NGOs, civil society and the different media involved.
As Social-Democrats we consider this topic of press freedom to be a cornerstone of our belief.
However, within Europe, we would draw your attention to a particularly disquieting phenomenon, namely the concentration of ownership and control of media in Europe in a limited number of countries.
That affects diversity in a fundamental way.
This becomes even more serious if economic power and political power are combined.
That is when freedom is at risk.
I do not need to name any names to make myself clear.
The European Parliament' s socialist group will take the initiative for proposals which resist this threat of press freedom.
Unfortunately, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats has announced that, despite the fact that it has taken the initiative for this resolution, it refuses to back this resolution.
In fact, it has threatened to vote against this resolution if this section were to be adopted.
Does the power, or the fear, of the aforementioned person extend so far that he already has the People' s Party in his clutches?
We would ask the People' s Party to consider urgently whether it would like to defend press freedom or the concentration of power.
It will make for an interesting outcome of the vote.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a good time to reply immediately to Mr van den Berg.
The debate is the result of an initiative for a resolution taken by the group of the European People's Party.
When the world day of the freedom of the press was held on 3 May, we were anxious to show our solidarity with the journalists who fell victim to their own dedication during 2000, 36 of whom died and a further 77 of whom were imprisoned while on the job.
As we are all aware here, to scorn the freedom of the press is to attack human dignity, violate man's quest for truth and thwart his full potential and we wanted to express this in the simplest terms possible.
Unfortunately, this very simple idea was hijacked by other political groups, as Mr van den Berg has just told us, who used the occasion to restart a pseudo-political argument with one of our colleagues and a future leader of one of the fifteen Member States of the European Union.
Regrettably, although I instigated the initial project, because the calendar of plenary sessions has been cut and we are all forced to run around like headless chickens here in Strasbourg, I was unable to attend the conciliation meeting which resulted in the joint resolution which is about to be put to the vote.
At the time I was in the House taking part in the very important debate on the future of the Middle East.
A small majority of honourable Members has dictated that we cannot be in two places at once, a fact which I cannot but deplore.
That is why - because I would have opposed the paragraph which has now been included in the joint resolution - I asked our fellow members in the group not to sign this joint resolution and to put the initial text of our resolution to the vote in all its simplicity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, one of the vivid memories that I have of my youth, when I began my career, was a comment from one of my bosses who said that the greatest thing that God had given to humans was freedom of expression.
This comment had such an impact on me that I have always remembered it and applied it to what I do.
I am therefore taking part today in this motion for a resolution on the freedom of the world press, which I am, of course, defending at a time when many of our writers, journalists and photographers are risking their lives right across the globe for a variety of reasons.
I must make a special mention today of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and make a heartfelt mention of a Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, who unfortunately, like some of his colleagues, was the object of an attack by terrorists who wanted to end his life and therefore prevent him from freely expressing his ideas.
I therefore agree with the amendment tabled by my fellow Members, Mr Galeote and Mr Salafranca.
Mr President, I speak as a journalist.
I must say that everything that has happened regarding this resolution has left me somewhat disconcerted and also highly perplexed.
General Morillon has just reminded us that, as the European People' s Party, we had decided on this initiative on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May.
I think it is an excellent initiative because it supports those who commit themselves on a daily basis to the fight for freedom and put their own lives at risk to tell the world what is happening in vast areas of the Least Developed Countries or even - it is worth remembering - in Eastern Europe.
Then something absolutely regrettable happened.
Someone thought of exploiting this excellent initiative for their own ends, bending it to a partisan political position, a political position that has emerged too often in this House, in my opinion.
I do not even want to waste words on this.
Last Sunday, 18 million Italians gave their answer.
I just want to see the result of all this.
The likely result is that a fine, important testimonial will lose much of its importance because of the aloof detachment of the world of the media, which prefers to report conflict rather than the exchange of ideas.
Above all, the role of this institution has been renounced and less and less respect is shown for politics.
We only believe in the politics of values and the exchange of ideas; we do not believe in the politics of venom.
Venom has never produced anything in history, and in general it has never rewarded those who have used it.
We only believe in positive values.
Mr President, it is unlikely that a government that imprisons its own journalists should be democratic to such an extent as to guarantee a fair trial in accordance with international standards, and so I shall have more confidence in monitoring.
To insist on the principle of the freedom of the press is obviously right and proper, but I remember the comments when the first law on the freedom of the press was passed in the Soviet Union.
The journalists then asked: who will give us the money to publish newspapers?
The matter has still not been settled.
I mention this problem since our draft resolution notes the decline imposed on the press in Russia and also deplores the attacks on diversity and freedom.
I should like to add that the problem of the press is part of the struggle for power.
In Russia the press subsidised by millionaires put Mr Yeltsin into the presidency, but the political line of that time is not to the taste of today' s leaders and the same millionaires are now either in the dock or abroad.
Freedom of the press certainly played a part in the event, which, nevertheless, is primarily a stage in the struggle for power.
I should also like to add that media science increasingly points to the so-called editorial routine as something that affects the free press.
Individual journalists accept work where they can find it, and they adapt to the prevailing editorial climate and ideas even when these contrast with their own personal ideas.
Turning conformists into saints, however, is not a job that can be regulated by resolutions.
Here, of course, I should like to remind you of point number 10 in the draft resolution concerning conflict of interests, an issue that, as we all know, has been talked about a lot recently on the occasion of the Italian elections.
It is said that governments should keep a scrupulous eye on conflicts of interest and ambiguous relations between editors and the proprietor.
However, when the president and the proprietor are the same person, what can be done, Mr President?
Mr President, thank you, also for this piece of advice.
Freedom of expression and particularly the independence of the media help guarantee and promote democracy in the world.
The persecution of journalists in their profession is a sign of incapacity to respect a democratic structure, but this is a rule rather than an exception.
Even today, journalists around the world are the subject of censorship, physical sanctions and infringements of personal dignity.
In many cases, the journalists involved get killed.
The problem lies, of course, in Russia where, since Putin took up office, we have seen fresh developments in Russia' s post-Soviet media market.
The trend is clear.
The Kremlin is trying to impose its will on Russia' s national networks ORT, RTR and NTV, and to develop an ideology in which the media will only be able to advertise State interests.
We were able to witness this again recently when on 10 May, the Attorney General burst in on Echo Moscow, a radio station, and confiscated all financial and commercial documents.
Where this will end in Russia, we do not yet know, but it is clear that that country' s democracy is in crisis.
Needless to say, we also need to keep a watchful eye on democracy in Europe.
The President of Italy has been mentioned a moment ago, who owns a company which owns, inter alia, three television channels, as well as the largest national publishing house, which, in turn, publishes magazines that support that politician.
I find the initiative of Mr Van den Berg (PSE) an interesting one to contemplate.
In fact, we should also be aware that this phenomenon not only occurs in Italy, of course.
Maybe in England too, there is a media monopoly, and that is to the advantage of the Social-Democratic government in the light of the pending elections.
There are similar developments in other countries too.
It seems to me to be a good idea for the European Parliament to look into this issue and to see what it can do about it, for it concerns us all.
Mr President, press freedom is undoubtedly one of the bases of any functioning democracy.
I believe - also in my capacity as a journalist - that this is summed up very neatly in the motion.
Yet if we look at freedom of information, we need to go a step further than simply guaranteeing that every journalist can practise his or her occupation without external influence.
The public's freedom of information, however, is restricted to some extent even in some countries which guarantee freedom of the press.
This is due, for example, to the financial relationships between media owners, but also an absence of journalistic responsibility.
For example, it is worrying - even if it does not constitute a direct restriction on press freedom - that some magazines have now set up their various departments, including their political departments, as profit centres, which means that the political editors are now responsible for generating advertising revenue in their sections of the publication.
There are also implications for press freedom if - as in Austria - a daily newspaper changes the political focus of its reporting when it is saved from bankruptcy by a bank with close links to a particular political party.
There is one further problem in particular, namely the growing tendency to separate information from commentary.
The result is a kind of 'readers' letter' journalism, which means that even in supposedly independent newspapers, we are tending to find little else but the opinions of journalists who are influenced by the owners and their interests.
However, in order to guarantee the right to information, it is essential that there is freedom of information for the general public as well as freedom of the press.
As the European Parliament, we have an obligation to monitor compliance with press freedom in all countries of the world.
Perhaps we should respect the public's right to diversity and freedom of opinion to a greater extent in future too.
Mr President, a resolution on the freedom of the world press makes no sense unless it contains, firstly, the solidarity of this Parliament with a Basque, Spanish and European journalist, Mr Gorka Landaburu, the recent victim of an ETA attack immediately following the Basque elections.
Secondly, it should contain a clear call for the protection and guarantee of the freedom to exercise the profession of journalist, threatened as it is - and this is something that Parliament should be aware of - in a part of Europe, the Basque Country.
Mr President, the political wing of ETA was severely punished at the ballot boxes, and what was its response?
The immediate response of this criminal organisation, once again, was to intimidate, threaten and make an attempt on the life of a journalist who was doing nothing more than defending the values on which European society is based, defending peaceful coexistence and defending the freedom of the Basque people.
The enemies of freedom of expression, of democracy and of life do not deserve to be citizens of the Europe that we are building on such strong foundations as freedom, security and justice for those who live and move around in European territory.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the aim of the amendment that my group is tabling and which I hope will receive the support of the political groups in this House, and I also thank Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a for announcing it.
Mr President, I should like to start by making a brief comment on Ethiopia.
The Commission welcomes the fact that this issue has been tabled for debate here.
The Commission took part in a diplomatic representation to the Ethiopian government on behalf of the Union on 26 April, during which it expressed its regret at the loss of life during the riots which took place last month in Adis Abeba and elsewhere in Ethiopia.
It also regretted the violent action on the part of the security forces.
The diplomatic representation called on the government to clarify recent events by carrying out a comprehensive, neutral investigation.
As far as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is concerned, the Commission is still urging both countries to give the peace mission under the patronage of the UN and the OAU their unrestricted support.
It expects both governments to guarantee the UN mission full freedom of movement, actively help with mine clearance, release all prisoners of war and internees and start demobilising a large part of its strike forces.
The EU has supported the efforts of the UN mission by monitoring developments in both countries continuously and maintaining close contacts with the parties involved.
It has made declarations proposing the process and - where necessary - voicing its concerns.
The Commission thinks this is the best way of supporting the efforts of the UN.
The Commission expressly welcomes the initiative of the religious leaders to visit areas on both sides of the border and start a reconciliation process.
This decisive process should, in its view, be promoted and shaped by the people concerned.
At the present time, the Commission considers a formal summit organised by the international community to be premature.
On Cameroon, I should like to say that the Commission is monitoring the human rights situation in Cameroon closely and notes that this country has started democratising its society and institutions.
There have been very positive developments in the area of human rights and civil freedoms.
We also note, however, that the various players still have insufficient knowledge of and fail to respect these new rights properly.
Cameroon has ratified the convention against torture and was the subject of a report by the committee against torture presented in November 2000.
In addition, a national committee on human rights and fundamental freedoms has been set up in Cameroon, albeit with restricted functions, and a regional centre for the promotion of human rights has been set up in collaboration with the United Nations.
The European Community has supported Cameroon within the framework of the LomÃ© Convention with a grant of EUR 6 million for institutional reform in the area of the rule of law, democratisation and respect for human rights.
It has also examined a support programme in the area of the criminal justice system.
We are supporting reform of the justice system and stronger responsible leadership of the institutions in coordination with Bretton Woods, with a special endowment from the preliminary financial framework of the ninth European Development Fund.
Specific funding is also being granted under the ninth European Development Fund in order to support non-state players, especially associations and non-governmental organisations working in the government and to promote human rights and strengthen the rule of law.
As part of the Cotonu agreement, the Commission is pursuing a positive approach based on dialogue and does not feel that there is any justification for starting consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonu agreement.
The situation is being monitored on the ground together with the Member States.
The government has set up a committee of inquiry, the findings of which will be carefully analysed by the Commission and the Member States.
I should like to say on the last topic in this human rights debate that freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press are, without doubt, absolutely vital to a democratic society and that the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion can only be exercised where there are several media.
Where this is not the case, there is either no democracy at all or democracy is under threat.
Threats to the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion throughout the world are one of the most distressing aspects of our international work.
Like Parliament, the Commission also takes rampant persecution and the repression of freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press very seriously.
It starts with conditions in the media, as some members of the House have described in connection with Russia, and ends with terrorist attacks on journalists, as reported yesterday from the Basque country.
However, I am in the happy position of being able to tell the House that the Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, the youngest brother of the Director-General of the Commission responsible for enlargement, has survived the attack.
He is seriously injured but, thank God, he will survive.
This clearly illustrates that journalists are the target of terrorist tactics because all extremist organisations throughout the world rightly perceive freedom of the media and freedom of opinion as their most serious threat.
I should like to report briefly that the Commission took a position on freedom of opinion, freedom of worship and freedom of belief at the 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
The EU not only represents its point of view on the international stage, it also provides practical help from the Community budget.
For example, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights makes provision for considerable sums to support independent media throughout the world.
Assistance ranges from training measures for journalists to media monitoring.
Over EUR 5 million was provided out of the 2000 budget for projects relating to freedom of opinion, freedom of the media and protection and training for journalists.
A major project in Asia and Africa, which is being implemented in collaboration with Reporters sans FrontiÃšres, addresses some of the main risks to which journalists are exposed, as listed in Parliament's resolutions.
The project makes provision for an assessment of the situation of imprisoned journalists, financial support for these journalists and their families and information and public awareness campaigns.
Support under the European initiative should continue.
The call for proposals in January 2001 expressly included the subject of freedom of opinion as one of the priorities.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Forced labour by African children
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5Â­0359/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs Lucas, Mr Rod and Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on trafficking in children;
B5Â­0365/2001 by Mr Van den Berg, Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco and Mrs Carlotti on behalf of the PSE Group, on forced labour of African children;
B5Â­0372/2001 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on trafficking in children (ship from Benin);
B5Â­0379/2001 by Ms Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on child slaves in Africa;
B5Â­0389/2001 by Mr Sylla, Mr Miranda, Mr Herman Schmid, Mrs Morgantini, Mrs Frahm, Mr Alavanos and Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on forced labour of African children;
B5Â­0393/2001 by Mr Andrews, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Segni, on behalf of the UEN Group, on forced labour of African children.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if 43 children are found on board a ship, which is taking them away from home to work in plantations in another country, our hearts bleed, with good reason.
We thought that slavery had been stamped out, but it continues to exist, and the most shocking form of slavery is, of course, the trafficking in children and the trade in child slaves.
Children are being shipped off to work on plantations.
Children are being abducted to be trained as soldiers, to carry weapons, to become a killing machine or to provide sexual services.
Children are orphaned at an early age if their parents die of AIDS, and are then hired as house slaves of those who supposedly take care of them.
In short, children are often slaves.
Nevertheless, Africa is not traditionally considered a continent where it is customary to sell children.
Abject poverty is at the root of child slavery, and child labour contravenes the Treaty on the Rights of the Child.
Echoing what is stipulated in the resolution, I would therefore call on the Commissioner to focus on, and put an end to, the networks which set up the trafficking in children, to launch reintegration programmes for rescued or escaped children, but also for former child soldiers and street children, and above all, I would urge you to help ensure that the products of Africa are sold at a fair price, so that the parents can work, and can let their children go to school, as that is what is supposed to happen.
May I ask the ladies and gentlemen in the galleries not to clap.
It is not customary in a Parliament, although it is, of course, very nice of you to show your support for Mrs Maes' speech.
However, I must ask you to observe the democratic rules of play here in Europe.
After all, we are all Europeans.
Mr President, over the past few months, we have witnessed the sad fate of children, uprooted from their homes, travelling on a slave ship off the coast of West Africa.
As we established when we attended the parliamentary meeting in Gabon within the framework of the ACP-EU, these children are from various neighbouring countries and are taken to elite families in Gabon, for example, where they work in the household. They are farmed out by the 'aunties' - for that is the nice word for it, go-betweens, if you like - among those families.
That means that they end up being slaves in those households, that they do not get any schooling, that they have to work from early in the morning until late at night, and that they are simply being robbed of their freedoms as a child.
That contravenes all kinds of ILO Treaties.
It is also fundamentally at odds with the Cotonou Agreement.
One could at least expect that the elite itself, which often forms part of governments in the relevant ACP countries, would not take part in this practice.
One could at least expect that according to the statutory rules of that country, action would be taken, or that they would take action amongst themselves.
That is not done, however.
I would therefore urge the countries involved not to classify this phenomenon under the heading of poverty, cultural tradition or 'that is how things are around here' , and therefore difficult to stamp out, but to see this to be in conflict with human rights.
Children have human rights, which are fundamental agreements.
I hope that we will be able to take a pro-active stance and penalise those countries, should this appear necessary.
That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated.
I would also like to broaden the topic and include child labour, but I explicitly focused on this well-defined problem in West Africa.
The violation of children' s rights should finally be a thing of the past.
Mr President, according to UNICEF, 200 000 children are traded annually in West and Central Africa.
Poor families in debt give their children on loan to the creditors as deposit, or to pay off their loans.
However, because they cannot get out of the red, the children are often sold and moved to other countries.
There they are used as household helps, unpaid workers on cocoa or cotton plantations, or employed in the sex industry.
Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished.
The discovery of the Nigerian ship Etireno in the port of Cotonou is probably only the thin end of the wedge.
The international labour organisation estimates that there are 250 million child slaves worldwide.
Surely it is unacceptable that practices such as trafficking in children and slavery still exist, and even thrive, in the twenty-first century.
We should therefore put more mechanisms in place to track down and punish the trade in and use of child slaves.
The legal apparatus in situ should be given far more resources and be better equipped to fight malpractices of this kind, and multinational companies must abide by the moral code not to abuse children for commercial purposes.
At the same time, we must have the courage to tackle the underlying causes: poverty and unemployment.
Let us hope that the pledge of debt discharge which was made at the Conference of the Least Developed Countries in Brussels this week is kept, and that our markets will at long last be opened up to agricultural products from those countries, so that we can give those people something to sell other than their children.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, UNICEF estimates that there are 250 million children under the age of 14 in the world who are still working.
In Africa, thousands are in forced labour in the coffee and cocoa plantations, the produce from which is often destined for export.
That makes us indirect accessories to what is happening.
Many of these countries, it should be said, have signed the convention on children's rights or the convention banning child labour.
I think that Parliament cannot simply continue to take note of the multiplicity of legal instruments intended to ensure that children's rights are respected at international level or to issue a sort of good conduct label under the various conventions which these countries have signed unless there is a binding force somewhere.
It is up to us to react rapidly, as has been said, by punishing or even excluding any country which violates these conventions.
I should, however, like to point out that there are different debates, which take place at three different levels.
There is the first level, which is the direct result of misery and unemployment, as we have heard, and it goes without saying that the IMF and the World Bank cannot continue to burden Africa with so-called structural adjustment policies.
We know full well today that this debt hangs over Africa like a sword of Damocles and the IMF in particular needs a clear policy here.
However, there is another debate which I think, as a parliamentarian, involves questioning if it is conceivable nowadays to keep all these conventions, all these different conventions, and accept that these countries are not going to comply with them.
What is the point?
Finally, I think it is important for us to think about much more potent matters.
In particular, I think that we should introduce a European social label which requires products from Africa and Asia to indicate their exact origin, so that we can see if they come from countries which exploit children or violate the labour code.
Finally, I think that, as my fellow Member has said, the summit of Least Developed Countries is being held at this very moment with the European Parliament, including European leaders.
I think that it is important for us to be able to call on them and for them to be able to take urgent measures on this form of modern slavery which affects children, children the same age as our children in Europe.
Mr President, naturally I share what was said by my colleague Mr FodÃ© Sylla in his speech and by the other Members who have spoken here this afternoon.
This problem has come to public attention due to the voyage of a boat, the Etireno, from Benin to Gabon.
However, UNICEF had already clearly said that more than 200 000 children in Western and Central Africa were growing up in this awful way.
When we see how European children grow up, we have to think about these African children.
It is terrible to think that children aged between 7 and 15 are used as modern-day slaves in a wide variety of work, and sometimes for the sexual perversions of certain people.
I completely agree with the measures that are proposed in the resolution: we need to inform consumers not to buy products that are known to be made or produced through the work of these children. We need to ask for a fair price and practice fair trade.
I fully agree with the amendment tabled by my colleagues from the Green Group on the revision, with this in mind, of the World Trade Organisation standards.
The Council and the European institutions need to work together with the countries that these children come from and go to in order to fight this horrific trafficking. Also, at the next sitting of the United Nations, which is devoted to children' s rights, the European institutions need to adopt a belligerent approach to this problem.
As my colleague Mr FodÃ© Sylla was saying, recital G talks clearly about the effects of growing poverty on this problem.
I think that we should ask ourselves if it is ethically acceptable to support a system that has such an awful effect on a sector of the population that is as weak as children are.
Mr President, I think that we need to start thinking about whether we can allow this to happen.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the European Parliament, the Commission is deeply concerned about the problem of trafficking in children in West and Central Africa.
According to UNICEF figures, over 200 000 children are victim to cross-border trafficking in West and Central Africa.
We call on the governments of these countries to do everything in their power to combat and punish the criminal practices of child traffickers.
The Commission's strategy to combat trafficking in children and child labour is based mainly on its measures to reduce poverty in Africa.
This is the primary objective of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement.
I should also like to stress that the Commission is pursuing a strategy to promote food security and rural development in the countries of Africa, focusing mainly on the situation of women and children in its bid to bring about sustainable development in the countryside.
At the same time, the Commission is funding measures which will help directly to resolve this problem.
For example, over EUR 1.2 million have been provided to promote the rights of children and to protect children from violence and exploitation in Gabon, Benin, Togo and Nigeria.
In addition, the Commission is funding a special project in this area in Benin, the objective being to build up a so-called brigade to protect minors, help ensure laws are implemented more efficiently and raise public awareness of this issue.
Protecting and promoting the rights of children is one of the focal points of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2001.
A host of other measures is being implemented by the relevant international organisations, especially UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation.
A positive sign recently is that other countries will probably ratify the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention No 182.
Benin ratified this convention last Monday, on 14 May, and CÃŽte d'Ivoire should follow suit by the end of this month.
The Commission emphatically supports these initiatives.
The communication on human rights which the Commission adopted on 8 May 2001 contains concepts for political dialogue with partner countries.
Most importantly, it states that, during discussions, the parties should examine how basic human rights instruments and other international agreements based on human rights can be ratified and implemented effectively.
As far as the trade agreement is concerned, the European Union is currently enlisting support from its trading partners for these basic labour standards to be applied to child labour.
The Commission feels that consideration should be given to additional trade preferences under the general preference system for countries which implement these standards efficiently.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
I have an announcement to make.
The services are trying to bring the debate on the Di Lello Finuoli report forward to 5.10 p.m., as suggested earlier.
The speakers and rapporteur will be called and informed, so that we can make better use of our time.
Floods in France
The next item is the joint debate of the following motions for resolutions:
B5Â­0381/2001 by Mr Le Pen, Mr de Gaulle, Mr Gollnisch, Mr Lang and Mr Martinez, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the floods in the French dÃ©partement of the Somme;
B5Â­0382/2001 by Mrs BerÃšs and Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the floods in France;
B5Â­0383/2001 by Mrs GrossetÃªte, Mr Morillon, Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on the floods in the Somme (France);
B5Â­0390/2001 by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the floods in France;
B5Â­0391/2001 by Mr Butel, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the floods in the Somme;
B5Â­0392/2001 by Mr Marchiani, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the floods in France.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, France has suffered serious flooding for several months now.
First it was Brittany, now other dÃ©partements have been affected, but it is the dÃ©partement of the Somme, and the town of Abbeville and the surrounding communes in particular, which have been hardest hit.
Hundreds of residents have been forced to leave their homes, have lost all their possessions and are destitute.
Every economic and social sector has been hit: road and rail infrastructures have sustained tremendous damage, shops and businesses have closed and farms are in serious trouble.
There is much uncertainty as to whether they will be able to regain their original production levels.
The persons hit hardest are those who were already the worst off and who have no family to give them financial or moral support.
And just as we thought that things were quickly getting better, another disaster has struck and may last for several more weeks.
The financial consequences are unquantifiable as yet.
There is a great deal of solidarity between the local residents and a great deal of intervention on the part of the government and the French administration, the local authorities, the police, the army, rescue organisations and the community, but it is unable to absorb the effects of this disaster.
That is why I think that Europe needs to do more than just offer words of support and compassion; we need to send out a strong message of our desire to stand by the people suffering the physical and psychological effects of this disaster.
In order to do so, the European Union needs to provide one-off financial aid so that infrastructures can be quickly restored and economic activity can resume.
It is also important for us to reaffirm our concern at the rise in the number of serious natural disasters over recent years both in Europe and across the planet as a whole.
The European Union owes it to itself to do everything to respect and ensure that others respect the Kyoto commitments by the stated deadlines and to implement a policy of sustainable development.
Mr President, having rightly expressed our sympathy and solidarity with the people who have been hard hit, especially in the dÃ©partement of the Somme in France, we should think about the numerous floods which have occurred not just in France, but also in Portugal, Spain and elsewhere, and about the fact that other countries may yet be affected.
First there is the question of urgency; the previous speaker reminded us of the need to take into consideration the financial cost of the crisis in people' s lives.
However, we also urgently need to take the measures needed to prevent the disaster caused by exceptional climatic conditions in France from turning into a crisis which permanently affects the families and enterprises in question.
I obviously welcome the financial efforts already proposed and I hope that Europe will not be absent from them.
We also need to strengthen our means of detection, so that we can react rapidly, and develop the best possible technologies, so that we have means of intervention which can be mobilised at once in any country of Europe.
We have seen how far rapid reaction facilities are lacking.
Parliament therefore looks forward to receiving the text on European civil defence, which could form the basis for transnational monitoring and solidarity.
However, most importantly, we need to study the issue in depth.
These disasters remind us, not that we need reminding, of just how important it is to review our regional planning policies, which will take a great deal of courage, and to implement the commitments made in Kyoto.
Europe should not relax in its efforts to persuade its partners that a lack of respect for nature can have terrible social, environmental and economic consequences.
For months we have heard that incessant rain has caused serious flooding in numerous regions of France.
In the dÃ©partement of the Somme, where there was three times the normal rainfall between October 2000 and April 2001, several dozen communes are still under water.
Thousands of people have been evacuated, often having lost everything.
The damage to infrastructures, houses and crops has been put at several billion francs.
Human and material resources have been deployed at all levels to cope with the crisis which families have been suffering for months now.
This wave of solidarity, however, which many citizens have been involved in, is still not enough.
The European Union should, I think, as others have already said, take an active part in this solidarity by paying emergency aid to the people affected, so that infrastructures can be restored and economic activity restarted.
This is the main demand in the resolution by our group, which also stresses the need to step up action to protect ecosystems and fight the pollution which are partly to blame for increasingly frequent climatic disasters.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying that this debate is of particular interest to me because I myself live in Abbeville, the town at the heart of the area affected.
The floodwaters are abating very slowly, as you have heard and, as I speak, 140 communes are still affected, with nearly 3 500 homes under water.
The floods have caused huge damage - estimated at several hundred million euros.
Houses are subsiding.
Numerous infrastructures have been damaged or destroyed, companies have lost and must replace their means of production, not to mention the damage to the countryside itself.
At local level, solidarity has been in evidence for a long time, providing humanitarian, food and material aid, but what the region needs most now is money.
It is because I really am close to the ground and have been directly affected by this disaster that I called for European solidarity in Brussels on 2 May.
Madam President gave me a positive reply and I thank her for that.
I should also like to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Members who finally rallied to this initiative.
For my part, I have asked the prefect of the region to allow me to help with any changes to the single programming document for the Structural Funds in Picardie, so as to find a suitable response to the problems encountered.
I expect the same on the part of Europe: an urgent and, more importantly, a specific response to this disaster.
This initiative should not - I repeat should not - be a simple declaration of intent.
It should be backed as quickly as possible by practical decisions and tangible action.
Consequently, I am delighted that the Commission, in collaboration with the local authorities, has authorised changes to the zoning of the Structural Funds so that appropriations can be channelled to all sectors of activity and to all the communes flooded.
At the same time, I hope that it will speed up payment of these appropriations, which should normally be staggered up to 2006.
In addition, one-off financial aid should be released by the European Union, to complement local, regional and national aid and meet the most urgent demands.
Finally, measures should also be taken to fight the consequences of climatic change.
The international commitments made in Kyoto should be respected by all countries without exception and I trust that the conference to be held in Bonn in July will be where this happens.
That is the purpose of my amendment.
Mr President, I would, of course, like to join my fellow Members in voicing our deep sorrow and our solidarity with the people who have been seriously affected by this disaster, which is unprecedented in terms of its scale and its duration.
I am from a neighbouring region, and my father was born in Abbeville.
I have regular contact with the dÃ©partement of the Somme.
It is to be expected that we should express our desire for solidarity with this resolution.
We are bound to express our sorrow when confronted with an urgent situation, with a crisis and with suffering.
However, as well as this urgent situation, I think that we really must understand that the European Union will face problems of this kind over the long term, since the fundamental characteristic of this tragedy is, in fact, that it is not exceptional, that these events are no longer exceptional occurrences.
We are faced with a future of sustained, unsettled weather in the same way that we talk about sustainable development.
This crisis is not exceptional because it is going to continue.
This is a disaster that is going to go on and on, and it will not go away.
And this crisis is not an exception in itself, because the Somme has not been the only place in France or in Europe to be affected by the floods.
In our capacity as Europeans responsible for European policies, we directly face the need to take action in the three main areas, namely the common agricultural policy and rural development, structural planning and structural actions, and lastly, international action designed to put into practice the commitments given in Kyoto.
We must take both immediate and long-term action.
The proposed resolution must not be something that we simply consider for ten minutes and which we then forget.
We have given commitments over several years to eliminate this type of danger, to prevent this type of threat and to solve the awful problems that people face.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to join my fellow Members, who have signed this resolution, to express, on behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our unwavering solidarity with all the people affected by the flood, and I am aware that even today, whole families are waiting to be relocated to safe new homes.
Everything must be done in order to assist these people, who have suffered considerably.
We can also support the observation in the resolution, which pinpoints disastrous flooding as the cause of these increasingly common situations and we have to look into the natural character of these happenings.
The exceptional levels of rainfall do not explain everything and it is easy to attribute the repeated disasters to thoughtless planning policies which have disregarded and, all too often, still disregard the important role of the natural environment and the instability of high-risk zones, such as those liable to flooding, in alleviating flooding, for example.
It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this.
It is absolutely imperative, however, that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development, particularly within the framework of the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy.
I therefore appeal today to my fellow Members, who are aware of these dangers, to bear in mind, when they come to vote on the guidelines for the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the ERDF, the consequences of the policies that we are implementing when we provide aid packages.
Mr President, 114 municipalities in the Somme region are flooded, 2 800 homes are affected, more than 1 000 people have been evacuated and placed in temporary accommodation and the local economy has been paralysed. This is the toll inflicted by the floods that have hit the Somme valley.
In addition to the understandable solidarity that has been shown towards the people who have been affected and the businesses that are, to all intents and purposes, out of action, these people are waiting for compensation to be paid out as soon as possible - in other words, as soon as the committee of inquiry into natural disasters has completed its report and issued its conclusions.
Once the water levels have subsided, it will be time to work out who is responsible.
For example, why has the Somme' s maintenance department not maintained the region' s riverbanks and why has the river not been dredged for decades?
Why have the municipalities allowed building in an area at risk from flooding, disregarding the most basic rules of land use planning?
Why have embankments, hedges and ditches been destroyed as part of land consolidation, which has, moreover, been carried out in favour of intensive farming?
Why has a reservoir not been built in the Somme bay and why have no real measures been implemented to prevent rising water levels and flooding?
To cite fate, high tides or exceptional levels of rainfall is not enough.
People who are isolated, re-located in precarious conditions, deserve more than fine-sounding words from the French President or the few million given grudgingly by the French government.
Insurance policies should, of course, pay for the damage caused by natural disasters within a reasonable timeframe, but, for the future, we must learn to respect and take account of the necessary and incontrovertible laws of nature, and prepare ourselves to prevent these natural disasters.
The only way to respond to the suffering of the people is with practical, swift and effective action.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to thank the House for its understanding of the consequences of the floods in France.
The Commission regrets the problems and damage caused by the bad weather, which were particularly severe in the dÃ©partement of the Somme in the region of Picardie.
The Commission has said that it is prepared to use all the measures at its disposal to facilitate the reconstruction of the area affected and the restoration of economic productivity.
I refer here to measures within the framework of regional policy, agricultural policy, rural development policy and state aid policy.
Within regional policy and rural development policy, much of the dÃ©partement affected is eligible under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds for the 2000 to 2006 programming period.
The programme for the region of Picardie, which has a Community contribution of 1.7 billion francs for the period from 2000 to 2006, already contains measures against natural disasters.
The Commission is waiting for suggestions from the French authorities and calls on the French authorities to present these proposals, so that the means provided for in the programme for the economic restoration of the areas affected can be supplied.
As far as agricultural policy is concerned, the Commission has already taken the initiative to give producers a great deal of flexibility as regards the eligibility of aid for large scale arable farming and set aside.
For the rest, the Commission has approved certain interpretations of current legal provisions by the French authorities.
The Commission has also introduced measures to extend the seed time beyond 15 June.
As far as state aid for the areas affected is concerned, the Commission shall do everything in its power within the framework of legal provisions to deal quickly with notifications of and approval for any state aid to remedy the damage caused.
A few members of the House addressed the question of immediate assistance for families in the areas affected.
Unfortunately, the Commission cannot see how it can accommodate this request.
As you know, it is several years since state posts for disasters and immediate aid in the Member States were reported in the budget of the European Union and I do not think that Parliament will call on the Commission to make payments which it is not legally authorised to make.
In view of the fact that there are other ways of providing Community aid for this sort of disaster, the Commission takes the view that it would be premature, given the financial and human resources currently at its disposal, to re-table such a proposal.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
I should just like to thank all the members who took part, especially the rapporteur and the speakers, for being so flexible and attending earlier than the scheduled time of 5.30 p.m., thereby allowing us to make better use of the time available.
Mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0145/2001) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters poses many problems, which we have tried to face and solve in the best way possible, thanks also to the input from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its draftsman, Mr Joachim Wuermeling.
This report has not had any amendments, and this is evidence of the solidarity we felt over the proposal.
I hope the solutions proposed may find a broad consensus in Parliament in order to give greater strength to the arguments of all those in the Council and the Commission of the European Union that share them.
A common area of justice will only make sense if, within it, the court decisions of one Member State are effective in all the other Member States.
In concrete terms the intention is to allow the execution in one Member State of a final decision issued by the competent authority of another Member State.
Until today, the recognition of decisions among the various Member States has been achieved through the request mechanism, a slow, complicated process with an even more uncertain outcome.
In addition to the obvious aim of legal certainty inherent in the rapid and effective implementation of the law throughout the territory of the Union, mutual recognition seeks to achieve not only the social rehabilitation of those sentenced, who are no longer uprooted from the country in which they have chosen to live, but also the protection of victims' rights.
In order to set up a mutual recognition mechanism, two possible solutions could be put forward: either moving towards harmonisation of the legislative and judicial systems in the Member States, or basing the mechanism on mutual trust in the adequacy of the laws of individual states and the proper implementation of those laws in specific proceedings.
We have opted for this latter solution, both because it is more feasible and because we are faced with legal systems which, although diverse, are based on a system of procedural rules that guarantee criminal decisions which are reliable and hence amenable to being enforced throughout the territory of the Union.
We are, however, aware that, at least in the short term, it will be difficult to reach an agreement on a procedure for automatic recognition, since no Member State will ever be willing to associate itself with recognition of any final decision that does not respect certain essential common guarantees.
The question is, precisely, that of the identification of these essential guarantees, such as respect for the principle of ne bis in idem, or respect for the right to an effective and not simply a pro forma defence, or respect for victims' rights.
It will also be necessary to have common rules on jurisdiction and competence in order, above all, to prevent duplicated proceedings, just as there must be common rules for the application of penalties for re-offending or for the accumulation of penalties.
It will, however, be necessary to remove some obstacles that today prevent full recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, and among these obstacles are the requirement of dual criminality, which often allows the competent authority in the enforcing state to re-examine the decision issued by the authority of another Member State in both form and substance.
The dual criminality problem must be put into perspective since, in all Member States of the Union, the acts that arouse the greatest social condemnation are subject to criminal sanctions.
There is still the option - favoured by many of us - not to apply mutual recognition to a limited number of crimes, such as euthanasia, on which it would be difficult to reach an agreement.
This report signals a first step towards the creation of the common area of justice, freedom and security.
The course has been traced out; now we need to find the will and the political strength to press on to the end, elevating the guarantee system to the highest possible level.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for introducing this difficult topic of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters.
The House may be interested to learn that, according to a survey in my country, a large majority of the people are in favour of mutual recognition.
Mr Posselt, as you see, the suggestion which you have made on numerous occasions, namely not to allow any periods to arise during which plenary has to idle, so to speak, has been applied by the parliamentary administration in a flexible manner today.
As a result, it is again your turn to speak.
, deputising for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
(DE) Mr President, first may I say that I am delighted at this decision although, in this case, I am the one to suffer from this decision.
I am standing in today for Mr Wuermeling, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in which he says that it is important to make progress in relation to the recognition of final decisions in criminal matters.
However, he also warns against overhasty and hurried centralism and considers that the Commission needs to define exactly what this means.
Most importantly, the Commission should work out precisely what disadvantages have arisen so far because this system has not yet been developed to the extent called for in the Commission communication.
We must admit that this is a very delicate subject.
Because one thing we do not have in Europe is uniform criminal law.
In my personal view, we never shall have uniform criminal law.
That need not be a bad thing because even the United States of America, which are basically more centralistic than we imagine the European Union will ever be, even in the final stage of its development, have very different criminal laws.
There are states which have the death penalty and there are other states which do not.
In this respect, the EU is far more uniform.
There is no place here for countries with the death penalty.
Even England and Scotland have very different criminal laws and legal traditions.
This means that not only must we be very careful in furthering unification and harmonisation while respecting diversity, we must also be very careful in how we recognise final decisions in criminal matters.
We talk a great deal about a European community of values.
And what complicates matters still further is that this European community of values is in fact drifting apart.
One specific recent example is the euthanasia legislation in the Netherlands, with which the Netherlands have taken leave of the European legal culture hitherto, as has Great Britain on the question of cloning.
So we are drifting apart in fundamental areas which are also relevant to criminal law.
This will make mutual recognition more and more difficult.
This too is a question which has to do with the different systems of values and with the different legal cultures.
So we welcome progress in this area, but are very sceptical and simply see the problem of our drifting apart here, which is why we urgently call on the Commission to proceed carefully here, give precise definitions and simply say exactly what the need for unification consists of or what the disadvantages of the present system are.
Of course we know that there are considerable problems today.
However, the cases which I have quoted - and I could also have cited drugs policy as an example - show that, as far as criminal law is concerned, the European legal systems are drifting apart rather than moving together on particularly sensitive issues subject to intense public debate.
This shows how important it is to continue our work on the area of freedom, security and justice, concentrating on the points which are really important to Europe and on the points where there is also real agreement between the Member States as regards standards in criminal law.
Mr President, I would first like to stress that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, as this is a special report, because of the subject, because of its importance and because of something that the rapporteur highlights: it is a report to which there have been very few amendments in committee and none in the plenary sitting, which is by no means usual, particularly with reports from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and this, Mr President, is due to the rapporteur.
It is your report, rapporteur, but all of us, and of course the Group of the European People' s Party, see ourselves in it, which is why I want to highlight two major issues.
The first is that, if the European Union faces one challenge at the moment, if we really want to move from a market-centred Europe to a Europe of values and of citizens, that challenge is to build this area of justice.
And if this is a big challenge, what can be more important, in this context, than for a rapporteur to take up the great tradition that has built Europe?
This great tradition that has led to men and women from different origins, different political ideologies and different parties, placing this general vision, this European vision, this constructive vision, above their individual interests, and combining their efforts in pursuit of a goal.
We have before us one of those reports, and I think that this House should be proud to have produced a report which will be the point of reference over the months and years, for the work that awaits the institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
It is a report that, like all great reports, combines vision, realism and ambition.
The rapporteur used the word 'vision' , and I am going to do nothing more than repeat what he said, but this is the essence of the report: it firmly backs mutual recognition.
Mutual recognition, which is also based on the principle underpinning the European Union, namely mutual trust between States, which is in turn based on the Member States providing an equivalent level of protection of human rights, and in which they are seen to share the same procedures.
Obviously, there are differences, and there are differences that need to be preserved; and that is where the rapporteur' s experience, realism and knowledge of the field come in.
I could quote many examples.
I have personally learnt a great deal from his thoughts on the scope of dual indictment, which he very rightly extends to dual criminality, and I hope that this will be a subject for discussion in the work that follows.
In particular, the rapporteur mentioned the principle of ne bis in idem or double jeopardy and the solution that it offers to this considerable problem.
I would also cite Paragraph 22, which refers to the need for common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law.
As he said, we cannot expect them to be automatically recognised tomorrow without any controls or filters, but we need to move towards the recognition of some common minimum standards that will allow acceptance by means of a very rapid procedure.
In other words, the rapporteur says 'no' to harmonisation, 'yes' to mutual trust and 'yes' to mutual recognition, but on some points there will have to be harmonisation, if not unification.
I could also quote the comment made by Mr Posselt, that in Europe some conduct needs to be kept outside this context of mutual recognition, because it is based on very different cultural roots, such as euthanasia for example.
I think that we have before us an important report.
I am sure that it will receive overwhelming support in Parliament, and I hope that the two or three institutions take good note of this report, which without a shadow of a doubt, will be a milestone in this area in which we need to make progress.
Mr President, I fully agree with Mrs Palacio.
The excellent report by Mr Di Lello deals thoroughly with all the important aspects of a complex problem which, however, needs to be solved swiftly so that the European Union can become an area of freedom, security and justice.
The problem of mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters arises of course from the irreducible - at least in the short term, and here I agree with Mr Posselt - diversity of the legal and judicial systems of the various countries in the European Union.
It can therefore be solved only if on the one hand we start from precise, shared definitions of the notions of final decision and criminal matters, which can apply to all the various systems - thorough definitions that are fully satisfactory are given in both the Commission communication and the Di Lello Finuoli report - and on the other hand if mutual trust is created among the Member States regarding the adequacy of each other' s systems of laws and the correctness of their procedures.
Now, this trust may be founded on the shared respect for fundamental rights, ensured by, amongst other things, the supervision by the European Court of Human Rights, which may be further guaranteed by common minimum standards that may be adopted on specific aspects of procedural law in matters of respect for the right to a defence or victims' rights.
In addition, to overcome the irreconcilable nature of certain ideas of principle as regards the punishability of controversial acts - the examples of euthanasia or abortion have been given here - one simply needs to exclude mutual recognition in relation to a few limited and exceptional criminal acts.
In this way we can overcome the traditional requirement of dual criminality and avoid the slowness and difficulties of having to decide on recognition for every decision in every country, which, I can personally assure Mr Posselt, is a slow process that really hinders the proper application of penalties, as my former experience as a magistrate can testify.
Well, having thus properly set out the solution to the basic problem, the Di Lello Finuoli report then deals with technical and sensitive issues regarding the various ways of carrying out a sentence, the costs of carrying it out, and the system for calculating penalties in the event of multiple sentences, since they cannot always be simply added together when the crimes are connected, and suggests appropriate solutions, which can all be fully shared.
I too therefore invite Parliament to approve this important and thoroughly well argued report without reservation.
Mr President, in order to avoid repetition, I should like to start by referring and subscribing fully to everything that Mr Posselt has said.
I understand the importance of the objective of the report, but am unwilling to join in the general rejoicing because I see a whole series of inconsistencies.
This applies, for example, to the somewhat blurred use of the terms recognition, which has already been implemented in Europe to a considerable degree, and execution of final decisions.
The discussion of certain definitions appears to be random rather than systematic, as far as I can see.
I fail to understand why, when there are several decisions which violate the ne bis in idem principle because they deal with the same fact, the decision that is most favourable to the offender should be applied.
I also fail to comprehend why the call for the dual criminality rule to be waived is, unfortunately, gaining ground.
A criminal justice system which - hopefully - feels bound by the principle of legality, that is, the nullum crimen sine lege principle, cannot accept the consequences of deeds which are not punishable in its area of jurisdiction.
Otherwise this principle would be broken and procedural convenience would take priority.
And then it would be curtains for the rule of law!
I should like to add my voice to those of Ana Palacio Vallersundi and the speakers in general in their entirely justified praise for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli.
As he knows, despite our political differences, we are pleased to point out the high quality of the work he has produced and the legal rigour of his proposals.
In this debate, as in the one we had this morning, we are taking steps along the path traced out in Tampere to create the area of freedom, security and justice.
In a Union where there is freedom of movement enjoyed by all the citizens, including those who act outside the law, it is important to prevent the possibility of there being penal countries.
In relation to this legal framework on judicial decisions in criminal matters, the report deserves our applause and gives a very balanced view.
Allow me to highlight the precision of the final judgment concept, the register of pending procedures, the idea that nobody can be judged twice for the same crime, but, on the other hand, the fact that a sentence in one Member State should be taken into consideration as a case of recidivism in another Member State, the solution in which the implementation of custodial penalties should be governed by the State that implements the sentence, whereas pardons, amnesties and declarations of the existence of the penalty or of the offence should derive from the law of the State which delivers the judgment.
Mutual recognition, ladies and gentlemen, is only effective if it can be achieved without great administrative obstacles.
A degree of mutual trust is therefore required between Member States concerning their judicial procedures.
We also know that the recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is a matter of great sensitivity that raises delicate questions and reaches to the core of values protected by law in our various societies.
There are differences between our Member States, despite their extremely substantial, noteworthy common cultural and legal heritage.
We must therefore recommend that the Commission should be cautious in this matter and adopt a policy of taking small steps.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by offering Mr Di Lello Finuoli my warmest thanks for and expressly welcoming this remarkable report.
As the European Council in Tampere stressed, the concept of the mutual recognition of decisions by the courts and judicial authorities is an important cornerstone in the area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create in Europe.
The concept originates from the internal market.
It is based on mutual trust in the various systems of the Member States and a number of common, underlying legal principles.
Which is why it cannot be considered in isolation and must be complemented by other measures, such as greater harmonisation of substantive and procedural criminal law in the Member States, better mutual understanding and better training and further training.
The Tampere conclusions called on the Council and the Commission to present a programme by the end of last year.
The most important contribution by the Commission was last summer's communication on the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in which we set out the Commission's approach to this section of the more comprehensive area of mutual recognition.
As this is a new and complicated issue, our communication does not aspire to find final, binding answers to the questions raised, it simply tries to point the way to possible solutions.
What we tried to do was ask the right questions and offer possible options as to how to proceed.
I was delighted that Mr Di Lello Finuoli's report basically shares the Commission's view and calls on the Commission to keep on the same track.
Implementing the principle of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation on criminal matters is an ambitious task which entails a fundamental shift in perspective from traditional forms of cooperation to a cooperative division of tasks.
This new attitude will result in a series of substantive and practical initiatives, as cited in the joint Council and Commission programme of November 2000.
Some of the projects proposed in the programme have already been started.
The Commission undertook in its programme of work to present proposals on facilitating extradition, including the idea of a European arrest warrant, before the summer recess.
We are also considering whether joint standards could be implemented to protect individual rights in criminal proceedings.
I cannot go into all thirty points of the motion for a resolution here and now.
Although the Commission's attitude towards it is very positive overall, I should like to mention one point on which we have our doubts and which was also addressed during the debate.
The resolution calls for full application of the ne bis in idem principle.
The Commission supports this, especially as this principle is included in our new Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, the Commission entertains some doubt as to whether it makes sense, in cases in which there are in fact several decisions in various Member States, only ever to apply the decision that is most favourable to the offender.
The European Council in Tampere adopted ambitions plans in the area of justice and home affairs.
We must face the fact in our daily work that the devil is in the detail.
Numerous details illustrate that mutual trust in the various judicial systems of the Member States has not yet developed to the point needed in order to exercise mutual recognition.
Obviously it would be helpful to push this development forward.
I am sure that we shall achieve the necessary political momentum if Parliament comes out clearly in favour of developing the principle of mutual recognition.
This would perhaps add the political weight which we need, and which is lacking, in order to tip the balance in favour of more comprehensive recognition of decisions.
It is time we put flesh on the bones of the theoretical concept of mutual recognition.
Works councils and redundancies
The next item is the Commission statement on works councils and redundancies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The health and safety rules applicable to me are obviously not being applied today.
I have hardly sat down.
The recent persistent wave of redundancies by numerous large companies as the result of closures or restructuring measures has reached worrying proportions.
Restructuring is often used as a euphemism for redundancies.
These redundancies do not only affect the employees themselves, they also affect their families and sometimes, where they depend on one or two main employers, whole regions.
As much of the recent restructuring announced has taken place at European level, there is urgent need for the Community to act.
A comprehensive Community concept should possibly combine innovative measures with an examination of existing instruments.
I intend at this point to confine myself to the legal aspects.
First a word on quickly adopting new and updating existing legislation.
In relation to the framework directive on informing and hearing workers, may I say that the Commission will complete its amended proposal on a general framework for informing and hearing workers in the next few days, so as to ensure that it can be quickly adopted in the Council.
The Commission will press for the Council to adopt the directive on 11 June.
We hope that a consensus will be reached.
However, if necessary, we shall endeavour to reach political agreement by a qualified majority.
We cannot wait for ever, especially in the present climate of insecurity created by the restructuring plans of numerous companies.
I should like once again to emphasise a decisive aspect of the Commission proposal in this context, namely the question of sanctions.
I know that Parliament emphatically supports this action and shares the Commission's satisfaction with the progress made recently in this sensitive area.
With Parliament's support and the Council's strong political will, we can wrap this process up by the end of the year, which will be a decisive step forward.
Now to the Statute for European Companies.
We also achieved another important, long-awaited result at the end of last year: the Statute for European Companies with provisions for worker participation.
One of the most excellent and positive aspects of the Statute is the fact that it contains joined up provisions on worker participation which reflect the progressive approach taken at national level in the proposal on informing and hearing workers.
This will certainly help ensure that better account is taken of the social dimension when European companies are restructured.
I am positive that the European Parliament will do everything to ensure that this legal act is adopted immediately after the summer recess.
Finally, to the revision of the directive on European works councils.
The Commission will revise the directive on European works councils in 2002 but will continue to examine the practical implementation of the directive in the run up to the revision.
Globalisation and industrial change bring social problems in their wake.
However, they can also be a source of prosperity for people and regions, if the change is designed and controlled appropriately.
The main concern for governments and the Community is to strike a balance between promoting corporate innovation and growth, on the one hand, and preparing people for change and, possibly, the necessary protective measures, on the other.
This was why my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, announced a check list for corporate restructuring last week.
This check list includes political instruments already available, namely legislation, monitoring procedures, financial help and tried and tested procedures. governments and companies must make optimum use of these instruments or devise new instruments.
Dialogue, transparency, suitable participation of workers, anticipation, risk prevention and developing employability are the key elements in a European response to this challenge.
Let us do our very best to develop these legislative and other instruments which will help us to put our ideas into practice.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission on behalf of the PPE-DE for its explanation and also for telling us that the framework directive will soon be ready, as will the Statute for European Companies.
However, I should like first and foremost to refer to the European works council project, which our group has fully supported.
I think the Commission is right to criticise how companies are behaving at present.
The Commission report on European works councils, which we are currently debating in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - we have held a hearing on the subject - is most interesting.
It proves that works councils have, as a rule, fulfilled their duties.
We found out, interestingly, that restructuring, which may be necessary on occasions, can be implemented more efficiently if employees are informed and involved.
In countries with more codetermination, such as Germany, there are fewer disputes and hardly any strikes in connection with structural changes to the economy.
The spirit of cooperation and partnership which Parliament brought to bear at numerous points of the directive is such that closures and relocations cannot take place in the form of commando attacks but must be preceded by timely and comprehensive information for and consultation with the workers.
This is often not the case.
Ensuring there is timely information and consultation, before company decisions are taken, is a very important aspect and must be taken into account when the directive is revised.
I hope that the Commission will introduce an initiative this year which at least ensures that the social partners are informed and involved.
I agree with you, Commissioner, that the current rules must be tightened.
It is not enough for sanctions to be imposed solely at national level; we also need measures at European level.
As you rightly stressed, we need the framework directive, because in numerous cases restructuring takes place solely at national, rather than at transnational level.
The directives on mass redundancies and safeguarding employee rights during takeovers also belong here.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if there are any plans to revise these two directives as well?
I think that the Europe of the future is also a Europe of the workers.
Information, consultation and codetermination rights are in keeping with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, a growing number of sudden decisions has been taken to make mass redundancies or to close down companies' sites. These decisions are usually taken without any consideration of alternative solutions for safeguarding jobs, and are sometimes taken by businesses making large profits, such as Danone, or they may even come about as a result of mergers, which have just been authorised by the Commission, as in the case of ABB Alstom Power.
In several cases, employees learnt that they were to be made redundant on the radio, their representatives were only informed of the decision a few minutes before it was officially announced, and, in the case of Marks & Spencer, the decision was announced ten minutes before the opening of the Stock Exchange. I would like to welcome the Marks & Spencer employees' representatives, who are seated in the public gallery.
These events, like those which happened at Renault-Vilvoorde, have again highlighted the shortcomings of Community legislation, when it exists, and the urgent need to adopt, at long last, a general framework to guarantee workers' rights to information, consultation and collective negotiation, in order to safeguard their rights and to enable solutions to be found, other than those that put their jobs and future at risk.
Employees faced with these decisions must be able to count upon the European Union, on its legislation and on its institutions.
The European Union cannot remain a framework within which the only restrictive rules are those of the internal market, competition and budgetary discipline, whilst social rules remain woolly, can be avoided and have no facility for imposing penalties if the rules are breached.
I shall let Mrs Ghilardotti speak about the general framework on behalf of my group, and I shall focus on the two other aspects, which are the revision of the 1994 Directive on a European Work Council and procedures for mergers and acquisitions.
The definitions of information and consultation given in the Directive on works councils are so vague that they provide no guarantee.
To define consultation as 'the exchange of views and establishment of dialogue' is far too imprecise.
We therefore need another guarantee to ensure that consultation does indeed take place at the right time, in other words, before decisions are taken, during the working-out phase, to ensure that the works council may give an opinion, propose other solutions, and that negotiation can be based not only on the management' s plan, but also on counter-proposals from workers' representatives.
I believe that we must at last ensure the possibility of referral to a competent public authority on a national level, as already laid down in the 1998 directive on collective redundancies and, if required, on a European level, particularly in companies with a Europe-wide presence so that, if the procedure of information and prior consultation is disregarded, or if the decisions are blatantly unfounded and other solutions could be considered both on a social and an employment level, the competent public authority can declare the redundancy plan null and void.
The 1994 Directive must therefore be revised - I share your view, Commissioner - otherwise this text, which was pioneering when it was adopted, will end up being obsolete in the light of the new drafts adopted by Council, on the European limited company, or by Parliament in 1999, at first reading, on the Directive on a general framework for informing and consulting employees.
Genuine consultation obviously requires information to be readily available to workers' representatives and to be of practical value, such as the opportunity to hold meetings, to have access to experts, or to request support from unions.
My second and final point relates to mergers.
I do believe that we should really be able to take the dimension of employment into account, and that is possible without amending the Treaties, simply by adapting legislation, because the Treaties already set the Commission the task of monitoring the effects of these decisions on employment.
I therefore believe that the proposed questionnaire is essential but also that workers' representatives must be able to refer to the Commission if, in their view, the merger plan is putting jobs or industrial plants at risk. I also believe that it is not only the Commissioner for Competition, but also the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs who must, if necessary, be able to question the conditions specified if they do not provide adequate guarantees for job security.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall present the ideas of my colleague, HÃ©lÃšne Flautre, who has had to leave in order to prepare for her visit to Algeria with our delegation.
One year on from Lisbon, the outlook is bleak.
The dream of a Europe in which the words 'new economy' are synonymous with growth and full employment is fading.
The suddenness and the increase in redundancy programmes have made employees think seriously about the delays in building a social Europe.
All companies are affected: market leaders who are long established in their fields and which act as windows onto society, such as Ericsson, Danone and Philips; players that have appeared in the wake of the liberalisation of transport, such as AOM and Air LibertÃ©, who are making their employees pay for their failed merger and companies who carry off all the prizes for showing contempt for their employees, such as Marks & Spencer, whose employees are demonstrating today in London. We offer our support to these employees, and to those that are here in the House.
According to the Commission, a total of over a quarter of a million redundancies have been announced across the world in the last few weeks.
The Commission has just announced its plan to introduce a package to provide effective legal guarantees to workers regarding information and consultation.
This is good news at a time when employees who are up in arms are joined by a public which disapproves of unilateral action by employers.
We have the responsibility of setting this high-speed train in motion.
At the same time, we must quickly adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers, in order to put an end to the scandalous practices of companies that challenge the social legislation of the Member States.
We must revise the 1994 Works Councils Directive, give them real rights to receive advance notice of plans and to receive expert advice, and make them compulsory for all transnational companies of more than 500 employees.
We must adopt the directive on worker involvement in the European company and ensure that their representatives participate in supervisory committees and boards of directors where the decisions are taken.
Lastly, we need to reform our legislation on mergers and acquisitions, which takes no account of their social and geographical impact.
The objective we need to pursue is a European social law that is comprehensible, workable, progressive and on a par with competition law.
Our objective is to have a Europe that works on two fronts: economic dynamism and genuine social democracy.
The Commission has demonstrated its will to make progress on this issue.
All we need to do now is persuade the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I insisted that we should have the opportunity to hold this debate in light of the tidal wave of restructuring programmes announced in countries across the Union.
It is particularly timely today because, following the recent mobilisation of employees from the Danone group in Calais, the employees of Marks & Spencer are now holding a large European demonstration in London.
In the eyes of the public, Marks & Spencer, following its decision to close 38 shops and to make thousands of employees redundant has, like Danone, come to represent one of the most abhorrent symbols of the strategy known as 'shareholder value' , of shareholder law and of the social irresponsibility of major companies.
This is the eighth time since the Michelin affair in October 1999 that I have spoken in Parliament to warn the Council and the Commission of the urgent need to confirm the social responsibility of companies and to establish meaningful rights for employees.
Until now, we have merely received evasive answers extending the due date and the long-awaited revised directive on informing and consulting workers has been our Loch Ness monster: everyone has been talking about it but no one has seen hide nor hair of it.
The European public is now demanding practical and meaningful measures.
I feel that as far as the workers who are affected and many other people are concerned, the Union has staked part of its credibility on this issue.
Therefore, Commissioner, I would like you to give clear answers to three questions.
First of all, a draft, revised directive on informing and consulting workers has existed since 1998.
You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate.
Nevertheless, the Council, to this day, refuses to review it.
If I have understood you properly, Commissioner, you are going to push for the Council of 11 June to override the veto exercised by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and even Germany, whose Chancellor has just tried to pass himself off as a European visionary.
You also intend, if I have understood correctly, to introduce a system of penalties for companies who breach the directive' s provisions.
Have I understood correctly?
My second question is this: the directive on establishing a European works councils dates back to 1995.
To this day, only a minority of companies concerned has implemented the directive.
Incidentally, these bodies are basically talking shops without any real power.
The Nice European Council stipulated that this directive should be revised, and I quote, 'by 2002' , which would require setting the procedure in motion immediately.
I feel that the Commission' s working programme for 2001 ignores this problem.
Why is this the case, Commissioner, and what do you intend to do now?
Do you plan to give this future works council real prerogatives, such as the right to suspend a restructuring plan and the time to examine an alternative project to the one laid down by the management?
Lastly, and with this point I shall conclude, the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of systematic verification that social and employment obligations are being met by every company that benefits from Community aid.
Parliament has also requested that, each time the Commission makes a statement on a company merger plan, it makes its assent conditional on the employees' rights being respected.
What are your plans on this matter?
Mr President, Commissioner, I was pleased to hear that for the next Council the Commission intends to insist that the Council assume its responsibilities with regard to the directive on employees' rights to information and consultation.
As several Members have already pointed out, it is now three years since Parliament gave it its first reading.
In these three years we have several times in this House debated problems of redundancies, mergers and company relocations, but the Council has never assumed any responsibility, has never had the courage to face up to this subject and make a decision, adding something to the laws and other instruments that the Union has and can use to strengthen its own intervention regarding companies' social responsibilities.
Now it seems that some countries have dropped their reservations, and so the conditions are right for the next Council to take up a position.
The information and consultation problem is one that has something to do with the possibility of intervening in a preventive manner so that the consequences of unilateral company decisions are not such that they place jobs, working conditions or the living conditions of workers at risk.
For this to happen, however, it is necessary to reach a precise agreement, and Parliament' s positions from this point of view were highly specific even at first reading on the methods, times and content of consultations and information.
In addition - and I am pleased that the Commission has remembered this - there is a fundamental instrument which, paradoxically, is regarded as a fundamental element in all laws except those concerning workers, i.e. that of penalties.
There is no law on any subject that does not lay down penalties for breach of the law.
Only in the case of workers' rights does this still not happen in Europe.
The directive on the right to information and consultation does lay down sanctions, and I am pleased that the Commission is maintaining this position.
Parliament not only upholds the Commission' s position but supports the Commission in its position and I believe this matter of penalties will not only be confirmed in the Council' s positions on the directive but will extend to other legislation as well - works councils, mass redundancies - otherwise without a penalty instrument all these laws too will be less effective than we would like them to be.
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning, the President of the European Parliament received employees from the Strasbourg branch of Marks & Spencer.
They are seated in the gallery and I should like to welcome them.
My fellow Members and I thought this morning that we would be able to reassure them that the dossier of the works councils and the information of workers was finally back under discussion.
I hope that this evening' s debate clearly demonstrates our will to produce a piece of work that is consistent and which will lead to the directives in this field being updated.
As you pointed out, Commissioner, we can no longer wait a new crisis to be announced to reassure ourselves that the legal instruments from which employees should benefit are at last appropriate, effective and provide for penalties in the event that European-level regulations are not respected.
The Marks & Spencer employees, like those from the other companies mentioned by Harlem DÃ©sir, demand, as European citizens, that Europe establishes frameworks for protection and for organising collective action, which as we all know is the only guarantee of individual rights in the field of employment law.
They are demanding that these frameworks be established, recognised and protected and they are placing great hope in your words, Commissioner.
The Commission and Parliament should also, however, demonstrate their political will by making any further development of economic union and of any new regulations conditional on the implementation of social provisions that stipulate new forms of regulation such as those that we are expecting today with the revision of the directives that has been announced.
The workers of the European Union, Commissioner, must not suffer as a result of European integration.
They must instead be the main beneficiaries of it.
Respect for workers' rights and the building of a social Europe are the pillars which, unless strengthened, could dash all our hopes for building democracy in our Union.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the members who took part in this debate.
The Commission sees this debate as important support for its initiatives.
I have the feeling that a real political tail wind is blowing and that we are in full agreement on the objectives.
For which I also thank you.
I should like to comment on the specific questions asked.
First, Mr Menrad's question as to whether there are any plans to revise the directives on mass redundancies and takeovers as well.
There are no plans to revise them, nor does the Commission consider it necessary, because the scope of the rules planned in the new directives on information and participation is such that the two directives which you mentioned will then be able to demonstrate their real worth.
The requirements of the new directive relate to the subject of the two directives which you mentioned, and we therefore do not believe that these directives need to be revised.
As far as Mr Wurtz's question is concerned, the honourable Member understood me perfectly correctly.
The Commission is firmly resolved to do everything in its power now to advance acceptance of the directive on information and participation and to meet the deadline which I mentioned.
I did indeed say that, if a consensus cannot be achieved, we shall work on getting the directive adopted by a qualified majority.
You also understood correctly that the Commission takes the view that this directive must contain sanctions.
You then asked if the directive on European works councils was to be revised.
Yes, this is planned for 2002 and we have already begun to organise the preparations.
As far as your third question on mergers is concerned, we still have to examine if and to what extent account must be taken of social aspects during mergers.
The results of this examination are not yet ready.
That brings us to the end of that item.
Gas directive
The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0170/01) by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, on implementation by the Member States of the Gas Directive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU gas directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in June 1998, i.e. nearly three years ago, and entered into force on 10 August 1998.
The Member States were required to transpose the directive by 10 August 2000.
Since the directive entered into force, all the Member States have transposed it with the exception of France and Germany.
Germany has transposed parts of the directive and is expected to complete transposition in the next few months.
The Commission is currently examining the situation in Germany in order to ascertain if further measures are needed in this respect.
On 17 May 2000, the French government tabled a bill to transpose the gas directive.
However, this bill has yet to be passed by the French government.
Until then no date for final acceptance has been set.
According to the information received by the Commission from the French administration, no decision has been made to postpone the transposition of the directive until 2002.
However, contrary to expectations, it was decided not to include the bill in the outstanding order of business of the French parliament for this spring.
Even if, as we have been told, this is due to the huge workload of parliament, this delay represents a serious and regrettable development.
The Commission therefore decided on 8 May 2001 to take France to court for failing to transpose the directive.
Given the call by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000 for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets to be speeded up and, given the progress made in transposing the directive in the other Member States, it is regrettable that a legal basis for transposing the directive has yet to be created.
This is seriously obstructing the development of an internal market and the creation of equal conditions of competition in the European Union.
Even if the delays in the transposition of the gas directive in France are extremely regrettable, they are no reason to relax our efforts to speed up the liberalisation of energy in Europe or to delay the creation of an internal energy market.
On the contrary, the delays demonstrate that further steps are needed and that these steps must be selected in a balanced manner in order to safeguard equal terms of competition.
That is why it is especially important for France to get on and transpose the 1998 directive.
The new Commission proposals are still important and urgent with respect to competitiveness, low prices for private consumers and employment.
The Commission is therefore determined to continue to make decisive progress with this file.
Mr President, it is a matter of great sorrow that we have to point the finger at one Member State - one of the founder Member States of this Union - for not fulfilling its solemn undertakings, for being prepared to act against the laws of the European Union and indeed for taking the law into its own hands.
It is with real concern that we also have to point the finger yet again at the Council of Ministers: while it knows full well that Member States are not fulfilling their existing undertakings, it glibly goes on producing communiquÃ©s of fine words, which advocate even further moves to liberalisation, completion of the single market, increased cross-border trade and fair competition.
Only this month, after the Energy Council of 14/15 May, the presidency concluded: "There is broad consensus ..." (does that consensus include France?) "... that the market opening concerning both gas and electricity should be actively pursued and accelerated."
The presidency also declared, on behalf of the energy ministers - did that include the French energy minister? -: "A fully integrated single market for gas and electricity cannot be achieved without efficient cross-border trade."
Regrettably, we hear the hollow echo of those fine but increasingly empty words at Lisbon about making Europe the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world.
And yet in so many critical areas the will is just not there at Member State government level to implement the essentials which have been agreed through all the Union's checks and balances.
Why should France expect the other Member States to fulfil their side of the bargain and let France take over their markets and companies, when it procrastinates repeatedly or refuses to pay its dues to the club?
Why should France, or any other Member State which acts in like manner, expect to reap the benefits of membership when it blatantly disregards its obligations?
The irony is that France is not only disadvantaging its fellow members; it is not just undermining the very essence of the European Union, the single market and fair, open competition, it is also disadvantaging its own energy-using industries.
It is also disadvantaging its own people, especially the less affluent, who are being denied the price and the service benefits which would flow from allowing competition and liberalisation of the gas market.
Worse even than this, however, is the cynicism of the Council's communiquÃ© after the May Energy Council.
It did not dare to mention this impasse caused by one of those members actually sitting at the table, but glibly committed itself, including, I assume, the French energy minister, to further, bigger and faster liberalisation of the energy markets.
Can we believe a word it says?
Where stands the credibility of the Council and the whole European Union?
At the very least, it is the Commission's solemn duty to uphold Community legislation and not to be browbeaten in any way by powerful and intransigent Member States or arrogant political forces.
If Member States cannot be trusted to fulfil their obligations, then, sadly, the only option is to bring to bear the full force of Community law and to exact substantial retribution.
Will the Commissioner please assure us that such steps will be pursued assiduously without any grace or favour?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that was asked directly concerns the French situation and the answers that have been given make this quite clear.
Although it is quite true that the French government has not yet begun, even now, to incorporate the European directive on liberalising the gas sector, it is nonetheless true that in practice, the conditions for exercising free competition have been met.
It is not quite accurate to say today that the French gas market is not open to competition.
The French government has opted to incorporate this directive in a measured and gradual way, which provides a greater opening for the major eligible clients, including the chemical, electrolysis or steel industries, for example.
This position is no different, however, from that of the German government, which expressed its views at the Stockholm European Council and thereby sought to demonstrate its concern to develop an alternative in Europe to what here we would call the British blueprint for totally liberalising the energy sectors.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us make no mistake about this.
What is at stake here is maintaining a public service in its role as a tool for social and territorial cohesion.
We take the view that incorporating the European directive must, therefore, be an opportunity to produce a precise, updated and ambitious definition of what we mean by 'public service' , which is a concept we have often debated in this House.
I would also like to talk about energy policy, environmental protection, sustainable development, security, social and territorial solidarity and also about local development, about developing balance between geographical areas and about everyone' s right to energy.
For all of these reasons, Commissioner, I ask the European Commission to quickly carry out a preliminary assessment, even before the second phase of liberalising the markets begins, so that we can preserve the European energy public service sector.
I have also taken good note of the European lesson given on this matter by my British fellow Member.
Where the dispossessed are concerned, however, Mr Purvis, those who would not benefit, as you say, from the gas sector being liberalised, I can reassure you today that, in my country, no one needs to suffer as a result of the situation in place there.
Mr President, the Commission has decided to haul France up before the Court of Justice because of its delays in liberalising the gas market, as laid down in the 1998 directive.
Opening up the energy sector to competition is indeed vehemently opposed by the unions, which reject the idea that the right to energy should be regulated by the dictates of money.
In 1997 and 1998, our group opposed this directive.
Because we refused to accept the creation of a system based on competition, we proposed guaranteeing a fair supply at the best price, the fair treatment of users and a standardised system of charges.
Energy is of strategic importance to the Member States' economies and should not, therefore, be considered to be a commodity like any other.
If we implement the directive suddenly, we risk putting all gas operations solely in the hands of huge multinational groups, and thereby seeing the conditions of public service deteriorate.
Once again, it has to be said that the Commission appears to be in more of a hurry to see the principles of free competition applied than to worry about the fate of employees.
Instead of contributing to speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation, should the Commission, when presented with any new proposal, not undertake a study of the consequences of plans for liberalisation on employment, on working conditions and regional planning?
I therefore call on the Commission to renounce its dogmatic position and to withdraw its charges at the Court of Justice.
The debate is closed.
The Commission has declined to respond to any of the questions that have been put. Therefore we will adjourn until the vote at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.20 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
VOTE
The next item is the vote
Report (A5-0145/2001) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters (COM(2000) 495 - C5-0631/2000 - 2000/2295(COS))
Mr President, on a point of order.
I am not sure whether it is too late to raise this point, but there is a point concerning translation, given that Italian is the original version of the Di Lello Finuoli report.
Throughout the text, the word 'execution' is used, meaning, of course, execution simply in the sense of carrying out a penalty.
However, in relation to criminal matters, in ordinary English 'execution' has a very particular meaning and one which attracts considerable hostility in this House and goes against our views on human rights.
I think an equally good English translation of the Italian would be 'implementation' rather than 'execution' , and that it would be wise to use the word 'implementation' rather than 'execution' throughout.
You make a very valid point.
We will ask the services to have a look at the original Italian text to make sure there is no misunderstanding on that point.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, my youngest daughter, Cristina, who is studying law, phoned me and said, 'How will you vote on this Di Lello Finuoli report?
I hear it is a first step towards a European code of criminal procedure and a European code of civil procedure.'
'Cristina, I am a Europeanist!' I replied.
'So I will vote for it, even though I know you are very lazy in sitting your exams and you will take another six years before you graduate in case law.'
'Great!
Now all the MEPs know that I am not keen on studying.
What an impression you have given the other MEPs of me!'
'Don' t worry,' I told her. 'You study hard for the next three years, and as soon as you graduate I will tell them so they can all give you a round of applause.'
. (NL) Matters such as conscription, the use of soft drugs, the obligation to carry an identity card, abortion, euthanasia and the recognition of same-sex marriages are regulated very differently in the different Member States of the European Union.
Something which may be against the law in one Member State, is not in another.
This proposal does not alter that, with good reason ; even within the federation of the United States, the penalty for offences and crimes is very different because these matters are decided upon at a lower level.
That does complicate things if judgments from one Member State are to be carried out in another Member States.
Should people be locked up for an action which is not punishable in the relevant country, and should the indignation which inevitably ensues be broken up with police violence?
The proposal creates no problems if the action for which a ruling has taken place is punishable in both Member States and if the same penalty applies.
I regret that precisely this principle of 'dual criminality' has been rejected in the report, even if I can appreciate that this gives major criminals less opportunity, by means of expensive lawyers, to sabotage and delay the course of justice.
Only because recital EE provides for possibilities for exclusion due to differences in national legislation, am I prepared to give this proposal the benefit of the doubt.
I said to you once before that by the end of this Parliament we all expect to know most of the issues that your family has to face.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 17 May 2001.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, on 24 May, Mr Santiago Oleaga, financial director of the Basque daily newspaper, El Diario Vasco, was killed in San Sebastian by seven bullet shots to the back.
The day before, terrorists had again attempted to kill a security officer at the University of the Basque Country, by placing a bomb underneath his car, which fortunately failed to go off.
