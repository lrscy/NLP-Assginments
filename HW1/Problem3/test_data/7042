We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully understand the difficulties it is experiencing.
After its decadeâlong allegiance with China, it has woken up as the least developed country in Europe.
This is why we understand its difficulties.
In particular, there are still echoes today, of the severe economic crises that shocked Albanian society as a result of its pyramid economy.
They continue to be reflected in the difficulties the country is experiencing.
Nonetheless, now that Albania has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, there are new challenges both for Albania and for us. It now has a new neighbour, an independent Montenegro.
It will have a new neighbour, an independent Kosovo.
Another neighbour, Macedonia, has been granted the status of a candidate country and is only awaiting a date to begin negotiations.
These are all changes for the better and the Albanian political elite should take advantage of these changes to boost economic development and, in particular, social development.
The rule of law cannot be based on centuriesâold traditions that have no respect for the values of the European Union.
Blood feuds have to be relegated to the dustbin of history, otherwise Albania will not be able to move towards the European Union.
The Albanian political elite has to make greater efforts to combat corruption and pave the way for economic, political and legal development.
Our greatest concern, however, is their failure to combat crime in a few highly sensitive areas.
Violations of human rights, human trafficking and child abuse are areas that erode the fundamental values of the European Union and our civilisation. Conditions in prisons are unsatisfactory.
Under such circumstances, Albania cannot move forward and should be sharply criticised on our part.
Without freedom of the press and freedom of speech, Albania cannot get a realistic picture of itself.
So a prerequisite for Albaniaâs faster progress is freedom of the press, which should be a mirror for the problems of Albanian society.
Only those who realise their mistakes can remedy them.
So our Albanian friends should not take umbrage if we are candid in our discussions with them as we try to make absolutely clear to them things that they have to see themselves.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done.
Â Â  . â Madam President, our rapporteur, MrÂ Ilves, gets heartfelt thanks from our group too, for the report he has put before us is very balanced and wide-ranging, but we also want to congratulate Albania and the European institutions.
Having lived through decades of a totalitarian regime, Albania really is making great leaps forward, and we see that as the best evidence that the process of integration into the EU really is, after all, a motor and a motivation for the realisation of human rights, the rule of law and for encouraging economic development too.
We all know that this process is far from complete, and various Members, along with Commissioner Rehn, have already drawn attention to the really critical aspects that can all be summed up under the overarching heading of âenforcement of the rule of lawâ.
I would also like to remind you that a European institution such as our own, if it is to do this, needs a process of partnership and support, which will in turn require funding and personnel.
Earlier on, in the debate on Kosovo, we pointed out that our budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 does not exactly inspire confidence.
There is also â as my colleagues have repeatedly emphasised â a need for further support in areas such as the improvement of environmental conditions, sustainable energy and transport infrastructure and in the establishment of truly independent media.
Finally, I have high hopes of Albania, having gained useful experience in the negotiations on a stability and association agreement, really playing a constructive role in the region, and if they pass this experience on to their counterparts in Kosovo, the region as a whole will become more stable.
Â Â  . Madam President, the area occupied by the Albanians is Europeâs most forgotten area.
The Albanians were farmers and shepherds who had been left behind and whom nobody wanted to take into consideration.
When the Ottoman empire collapsed nearly a century ago, both Serbia and Italy tried to establish permanent ownership of Albaniansâ territory.
It is a miracle that, in 1913, in the most inhospitable part of Albanian territory, it proved possible to establish an independent state although it has not been a success to date.
Following right-wing dictatorship, foreign occupation and left-wing dictatorship, what is immediately apparent at the moment is chaos and the intolerance between the political parties.
Especially the north of that country is unsafe and disadvantaged.
Whilst the millions of Albanians who live around Albania along the south edge of Montenegro, in the largest part of Kosovo and in the north-west of Macedonia, fight for language rights and self-government, they expect little in the way of positive developments if they were to join forces with Albania in its current state.
Moreover, public opinion would prefer to keep Albania outside of the European Union.
The country is now mainly renowned for child trafficking, the pyramid schemes, wasting energy, prisoner abuse and international crime.
Its problems appear to be beyond any solution.
During preparatory discussions, it transpired that other groups are more optimistic than my own about the course of affairs in Albania, and that they feel less inclined to invite Albania to change.
Despite this difference of opinion, my group shares their view that continued isolation and exclusion from European cooperation offer no solution to Albaniaâs enormous problems.
The promise of a prospect of EU membership must be kept.
In the intervening period, which is set to last for some time, they need support for democracy, education, the environment and the economy.
I find it lamentable that the proposed decision appears to be better geared for foreign companies than for the environment, food safety and good governance.
In our opinion, the neighbourhood policy and association agreements should not unilaterally serve the interests of the current EU Member States, but should primarily help possible future EU members gain ground.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft resolution on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Albania should be considered extremely carefully and extremely positively.
I should like to announce that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote for the resolution, and it is warmly welcomed by the Italian National Alliance delegation.
It is well known that Italy is watching the progress of the young Republic of Albania closely, favourably and with interest, especially since the clear and reassuring victory of President Berisha.
This agreement will promote increasingly strong and extensive contractual relations between Albania and the European Union; it will certainly promote political, economic and institutional stability in that country; and it will promote Albaniaâs transition both towards a full, pluralist democracy that respects the rule of law, and towards a market economy.
The main benefits of the agreement are the creation of a free trade zone, a serious commitment to cooperation in areas of mutual interest and, above all, the promotion of a more stable legal environment that will reassure foreign investors.
It is well known that, during the previous period from 1997 to 2005, the governmentâs stranglehold on political and economic power stifled the market economy and constrained the fabric of society, in which tolerance and permissiveness went hand in hand with corrupting and sometimes Mafia-like methods.
Much more needs to be done, and Albania has done much more, for instance in stopping and pursuing smugglers and preventing the traffic in human beings between Albania and Italy.
This fight against corruption and organised crime needs to continue.
Albania must invest heavily in infrastructure, transport and tourism, but the Commission must do more as well: it must provide more resources, particularly for transport and corridor 8, since the importance of infrastructure networks should be considered a necessary condition for development and cohesion.
Such networks potentially allow access to all parts of the country, and so each area will be able to make the best use of its resources, process them and sell its products on the market.
Â Â  â Madam President, if an observer from Asia, Africa or South America were here following this debate, we would have created a great many questions for him.
There has not been one spokesman from any of the wings who has not referred to Albania as a country in which crime is flourishing, in which there are numerous smugglers, in which children are trafficked.
At the same time, we hear all the spokesmen saying, yes, Albania must join the European family.
I find this a little strange.
However, these are the facts and we must examine them.
I shall start with what MrÂ Rehn said: that the Commission and the Council are in accord.
They were not always in accord, Commissioner.
In October 2002, the Commission said association negotiations should not commence.
The Council imposed the decision unilaterally and that is what has brought us to the situation we are in today.
I say this in order to restore the truth and set the record straight.
We Greeks are neighbours of the Albanians and, as you know, a neighbour knows more about the person next door than someone who lives elsewhere.
What is the story here?
The story is that Albania imposed the harshest of dictatorships on itself.
When the peoples of eastern Europe were looking upon Stalin as a dictator, Albania thought he was very democratic and followed Mao Tse Tung.
This has left a residue in the DNA of the people and, more importantly, the leadership.
Sixteen years have passed, 16 years of democracy and yet the main church in the city of Premeti has still not been restored to Christianity.
They are still using it as a house of commerce.
Sixteen years later, in a European country, a country, Minister, just 500 kilometres from Austria. A church which was an Orthodox church for centuries has not been restored and they still retain it as a house of commerce.
What answer is there to that?
Is it not a fact that something is not working properly in this country?
We are talking about a country that last year â not before then, just last year â took two months to return the results of the elections.
Can you imagine, Commissioner, Minister, Finland or Austria taking two months to return the results of elections?
Elections were held in Albania on 2Â July and the results came out on 2Â September, meaning that the democratic construct is not working properly, that something is not right in the public administration sector in this country.
There are Greek contractors in Albania who do not recognise the legal government of MrÂ Berisha today, or MrÂ Fatos yesterday as the leadership; they recognise the mafia, because if they do not pay taxes to the mafia, they blow up the building site.
There are Greek companies which have invested several million euros and, precisely because they could not stand the mafia which imposed its own extortionate taxes, they are abandoning their building sites and machinery and moving out.
One in three cars checked at the borders by the Greek police is carrying hashish.
That is the percentage.
How can we have such a country which cannot organise its state?
I agree that we must all try to help this country find its way, but if we believe that it is mature, then I greatly fear that we shall find ourselves in trouble.
The time is not yet right.
We come here, the civilised people of Europe, the representatives of the people of Europe, and decide not to let Serbia into the Union but to let Albania in.
We do not let Serbia in because MrsÂ Ponte was against it; but MrsÂ Ponte did not want Croatia and, if Austria had not imposed a veto on Turkey last year, Croatia would still be outside the Union.
So MrsÂ Ponte comes along and dictates which country will accede and which will not accede to the European Union.
Is that not the truth?
How can we want Albania to accede and to keep out Serbia, which has a better organised state and better rates of development and more culture?
Is that not the truth?
Now, a short while ago, the Commissioner made a stylish but material admission that this is the reason Serbia is not joining the European Union.
We need to face the facts, that this is a country with high levels of crime which the government cannot control.
The government may have the intention of controlling it, but it is not in a position to do so, because it is beyond its capabilities.
Similarly, trafficking in children cannot be controlled.
In 2006 we have trafficking in children, for goodness sake.
There is a great deal of drug trafficking and, of course, apart from anything else, and this is a political issue which I believe, with guidance, will be brought under control, there is rampant chauvinism which is not confined solely to Kosovo or Skopje, where we saw disruptions a few years ago, but is directed against Greece.
The President of the Hellenic Republic went on an official visit and the Albanian Muslims booed him and there were incidents and a terrible hullabaloo.
We must therefore examine the issue of chauvinism which characterises this country and the issue of the freedom of the press.
When a country is deprived of the freedom of the press, it is deprived of basic rights.
We must therefore look very carefully before we leap.
This country needs education and strict schooling before it accedes to the European Union.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, which endorses this draft resolution.
For years, the image of Albania in Italy has been one of barges and motorboats full of desperate men and women who, spurred on by poverty and pain, reach the Adriatic coast exhausted in search of a future that would be impossible in their own country.
In 1995 I took part in an international volunteering and solidarity camp during the most critical and difficult period, and I still have a vivid picture in my mind of the peopleâs dull, spiritless eyes.
Today I can say that Albania is changing.
I had the opportunity to visit the country just a few months ago and found an extraordinary will to be free; I met countless young students at Tirana University who, first and foremost, love their country.
There is also an obvious desire for Europe, especially among the younger generation: they have a need, a desire and a conviction that they want to belong to a wider family, closing once and for all a chapter of history in which Albania was isolated from Europe and the world.
I believe that Albania, the country of eagles, is an organic part of Europe, and not just geographically.
We have a specific duty to continue to encourage the current process of democracy building and, more generally, to implement interactions and tangible cooperation with the Community institutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a good omen that it should be today that we adopt the agreement with Albania, since it was on this day that Franz Josef StrauÃ was born.
It was he who, by travelling there as a private citizen, was the first Western politician to break through Albaniaâs isolation.
Anyone who remembers those days and the things then to be seen in Albania, and who has since revisited that country on many occasions will know what a tremendous journey Albania can look back on.

No other country in Europe has, in modern times, been so oppressed and isolated and endured such persecution, whether for the sake of religion or of intellectual freedom, even though its people played a vital part in the cultural history of medieval Europe, including among their own number Skanderbeg, the last great European to fight for freedom from the Ottomans, and also â with the League of Prizren â in that of the 19th and 20th centuries, only to be betrayed by Europe at the Congress of Berlin â in other words, a country that was among the first victims not only of Fascism but also of Communism, and which is only now beginning to return to its place at the European table.
So, then, no matter how justified our criticisms and irrespective of the need to reinforce democracy and the rule of law, we have to acknowledge that no European people in recent history has had such a tough time of it as it found its way to European structures, and that is why it needs all the solidarity we can offer.
I am not talking here only about the state, but about the infrastructure as well; this is a country that needs massive support from us in building roads, in establishing cross-border links with Kosovo, and in connecting up to energy supplies.
Kosovo will, in the long term, become less one-sidedly dependent on Belgrade if it is able to cooperate and communicate appropriately across the borders with its Albanian and Montenegrin neighbours.
Overcoming the isolation to which this country was brutally subject will be a substantial task for a generation, if not for more than one of them, and I can do no other than marvel at the courage with which the government under Sali Berisha has got to grips with it.
I am quite sure that Prime Minister Berisha has learned much from the mistakes that were made in the past, and that his approach to things is a quite different one.
However necessary criticism might be, we are perfectly justified in taking a somewhat optimistic view of things and giving this country the backwind that it deserves on the grounds not only of its tragic history, but also of its potential, which, economically speaking, is considerable, for it is a young country with a young population, speaking many languages and with a new outlook, who are determined to accept a challenge sadly denied to their ancestors.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that, despite some of the criticisms that we have heard today, the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania is good news; it is good news for Albania, good news for Southeast Asia and of course good news for the whole of the EU.
I am convinced that the Agreement will help strengthen the process of political, economic and institutional stabilisation in Albania and will help strengthen civil society, the process of democratisation and public administration reforms.
Something that I consider very significant is the emphasis placed by the Agreement on developing regional cooperation, and I should like to focus on this point for a couple of minutes.
The main aspects of this cooperation should be to strengthen political dialogue with all of Albaniaâs neighbours and also to create a free trade area in Southeast Asia.
The experience of the Central European countries that joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement demonstrated that it was precisely this free trade area that, to a large extent, helped pave the way for those countries to join the EU.
A further important aspect of this kind of regional cooperation is the gradual introduction of fundamental EU freedoms, including the free movement of capital, services, goods and of course persons.
The introduction of such freedoms should significantly strengthen overall cooperation across the region, including cooperation between Albania and the aforementioned Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
For these reasons, I warmly welcome the fact that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement explicitly states that Albaniaâs readiness to conclude agreements of this nature with its neighbours will be one of the conditions for further developing relations between Albania and the EU.
Â Â  â Perhaps I did not hear correctly but I am sure that Albania is in the Balkans, rather than in Southeast Asia.
I must say that the mind boggles sometimes when I read Parliamentâs motions for resolutions.
Generally, I agree that the most important thing is for all Balkan countries to have the opportunity to conclude agreements with the EU.
Concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step.
It is wonderful that three years ago, in June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council consolidated Europeâs position on Albania.
I am not entirely sure whether the progress achieved is comparable with other countries in the region.
There has been no review of the efficiency of the state, no assessment of economic development, of the situation at the borders or of the building of genuine economic and political structures.
It is clear that, in comparison with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania is a stable country.
Comparison with Macedonia is similarly favourable.
I am of course not sure whether highly porous borders, large-scale migration and problems with law enforcement, together with specific difficulties in foreign trade and a near collapse in energy supplies are even partially acceptable for a country aspiring to sign an EU Association Agreement.
I advocate the provision of more EU aid for developing the legal system, in the broadest sense of the term, including practical action on the customs and finance police, which will contribute to stabilising the legal system.
Given that my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, supports bringing Balkan countries closer to the EU, we shall be supporting the motion, despite the aforementioned reservations regarding Albaniaâs level of preparedness in respect of signing the proposed Agreement.
Â Â  â Mr President, when at a Foreign Affairs Committee session two years ago I mentioned that some Albanians were dreaming of a âGreater Albaniaâ, the majority of politicians at the time had no idea what I was talking about.
However, a couple of months ago, the Albanian foreign minister referred to this idea and at the end of August the political adviser to the Albanian prime minister stated that, by 2013, all Albanians living in the Balkans should integrate within the borders of a ânatural Albaniaâ, as he defined it.
In his view, Macedonia first needs to be partitioned and the parts inhabited by an Albanian majority should be merged with Albania (every fourth Macedonian citizen is Albanian).
Assertions of this kind are impossible to ignore and ultimately beg the question: what will recognising Kosovoâs independence lead to?
Is it not a step towards incorporating the region into that âGreater Albaniaâ?
I was an observer at the most recent parliamentary elections in Albania.
They were not one hundred percent fault-free, but we must acknowledge the progress the Albanians have made towards democracy.
Â Â  I would like to thank MrÂ Toomas Hendrik Ilves for his thorough and detailed report.
The path of Albania towards the European Union is probably the rockiest one in comparison with other countries of the continent.
The 20th century was not kind to the country, which was at the very bottom in terms of many economic and social indicators even before World War II.
Later, the term âAlbanianisationâ emerged as a synonym for the isolationist policy that was enforced by the then regime and that was also associated with under-development.
The scars of Albanian isolation from the world are still much deeper than in any other post-Communist state.
Today, Albania, just as other Western Balkan countries, is attracted by the magnetism of the European Union.
Namely this attraction is accelerating reforms, strengthening democracy and human rights, and thus improving the lives of citizens.
However, during my visit to Albania I noticed the crackling tension between the majority and the opposition, targeted not at competition but rather at the desire to destroy each other.
They easily promise half of the state budget to combat corruption and crime, but no specific results have yet materialised.
Regional cooperation to overcome the ghosts of the past should be the area where Albania demonstrates the flexibility and European character of its foreign policy.
The decisive stages of negotiations concerning the status of Kosovo will become a litmus test revealing Tiranaâs constructive position or the very opposite.
I have no doubt that this will also determine whether Albania is mature enough for EU membership, which in any case is still far off.
The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and sharing the experience of the states which were successful in approaching and joining the European Union, should help Albania reach a decisive turn on the path towards Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have no doubt personally that Albania must have European prospects.
It is positive both for this country and for the area of the Balkans and southeast Europe as a whole.
If we isolate Albania, we condemn it to remain a state in which and from which crime and corruption flourish and are exported.
I do not think that such a policy is to anyone's benefit.
On the contrary, through a policy of rapprochement and through the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, we are giving Albania incentives to move in the direction of respect for human rights, economic reform and stronger rule of law and democratic institutions.
It is true that, over recent years, despite the obstacles and difficulties, Albania has, generally speaking, moved forward.
That is why we are signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in question.
Nonetheless, it is also true that, at the same time, there are a great many problems in this country.
My honourable friends have already referred to corruption, to problems in relation to the freedom of the press and to the way in which electoral rolls and so forth are prepared.
I, for my part, wish to comment on three individual issues which I consider to be of crucial importance and I believe that, with cooperation in particular between the European Commission and Albania, they can be overcome and resolved.
The first is compliance on the part of Albania with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.
Progress has been already been made on setting up a state minorities committee, on granting permission, for example, to set up a private Greco-Albanian school in Himara and so forth. However, other issues remain, Commissioner, such as the translation of legislation into minority languages, the signposting of local traditional names, an increase in personnel dealing with minority issues and so forth.
I believe that the Commission must concern itself directly with these issues and to record them objectively in its annual report published in October.
The second issue concerns the census of the population, an objective census of the population which will adequately record the size of the minorities and not give rise to doubts as to its accuracy.
The third issue that I wish to emphasise is the restoration of and compensation for property because, even though the law on this issue was passed back in 2004, there is a problem of lack of transparency, abuse and procedural irregularities.
In the area of Himara in particular, there is the serious issue of the property of the Greek minority.
Consequently, emphasising again that I believe in the European prospects of Albania and voting for this agreement, I believe that the time has come to move from theory to practice.
It is the responsibility of the European Commission to put what is contained in the text into practice with pressure on and cooperation with the Albanian authorities.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, representatives of the Commission and Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Council decision on the EU-Albania agreement is a highly positive step.
I congratulate MrÂ Ilves and believe that the agreement will allow us to develop more direct political relations with Albania, with a view to achieving a free trade zone; the movement of workers, capital and services; freedom of establishment; and, in future, the lasting stabilisation of southÂ eastern Europe as an area of peace, democracy and security.
With this agreement we are calling on Albania to bring its legislation more into line with that of the European Union, not only in sectors such as the internal market, but also as regards justice, security and respect for rights.
It is precisely because of this agreement that Albania has made significant progress and is now, in my opinion, more likely to overcome the numerous problems that still remain in that country regarding electoral law and media freedom, as well as on the corruption and organised crime front.
For our part, this agreement falls within a broader perspective, relating above all to the launch of a Euro-Adriatic strategy that should include the resumption of infrastructure projects such as corridor 8 and, more generally, the pursuit of the goal and historic mission of EU enlargement.
In strategic terms, the project to unify the continent according to the principles of democracy, peace and development must include Albania and the Balkans as leading players in the new Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, representatives of the Council, I would like to draw your attention to ChapterÂ 7, which deals with justice, freedom and security, since the rule of law, civil liberties and internal security are quite simply essential to a countryâs security, and economic investment â which results in economic development and also social security â is dependent on them being present.
Development in Albania has followed a similar path to that in other states undergoing transformation.
The structures of organised crime were established more speedily and efficiently than those of the state, and the effects of that are being felt all over Europe.
Albania is a country of origin for international criminal organisations dealing in drugs, trafficking in people, laundering money and thereby funding terror, and it is also through Albania that such organisations pass; that being the case, and in view of the fact that we suffer the effects, joint engagement with Albania is in the interests of both parties.
Having seen it for myself, I can tell the House that MrÂ Berishaâs government is getting stuck in by prioritising an internal security programme and making use of its cooperative arrangements with Europe, for example in police projects with PAMECA (Police Assistance Mission of the EU to Albania), in customs and justice projects at parliamentary level, and, in particular, of the support given by the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe under its special coordinator Erhard Busek.
There has been tangible progress, but the problems â and the challenges â are still enormous.
This stabilisation and association agreement is, for Albania, a milestone as it progresses towards European standards; the message it sends out is not only political, but also signifies practical help and cooperation.
It is now for Albania to put into discharge in full the obligations of this agreement.
I hope that it will use this opportunity to improve its legal system, to train judges and prosecutors, to improve law enforcement and the prosecution of crime, the control of borders at sea and on land and cooperation between police forces.
I also hope that there will be enhanced cooperation between the EU and South-Eastern Europe, and I would particularly like to see Albania playing its part in developing the SECI Centre in Bucharest, which is a base for cooperation between police forces that could be the seedbed for something like a South-East European version of Europol and present an opportunity for combating organised crime.
Agreements, and the implementing of agreements, represent both a major challenge and an opportunity, not only to Albania, but also to us, to the European Union as a whole.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Albania is a major achievement by the European Union on the road to the integration of the Western Balkans with the European Union.
Albania, with its population of three-and-a-half million Muslims in the centre of the European continent is an important bridge for building a future Europe based on intermingling of cultures and tolerance for different religious traditions and civilisations.
The EU Agreement gives Albania the opportunity to modernise, to build a lasting democracy, and for economic reform.
A direct benefit will be the creation of a free trade zone, the rule of law and a functioning market economy.
The present stage of relations between the European Union and Albania have set the political elite and Albanian civil society new tasks and perspectives.
There are three problems I would like to draw your attention to:
Firstly there is the question of dealing with nationalism, and the strategic political attempts appealing for a Greater Albania in other countries of the Western Balkans which have been addressed to the Albanian population.
Albania now needs to re-direct its national interests towards European integration and peaceful co-existence within the European community, and to reflect on its own history and its role in the modern world.
It needs to travel the road that other European nations have travelled in the last fifty years.
The second issue is the rule of law, combating organised crime, and increasing the level of democracy.
Albania has to ensure that the rights of national, ethnic and religious minorities are respected.
The third problem is womenâs rights.
There needs to be an effective policy guaranteeing women safety and equality.
There must be an end to violence against women in the family, and to eliminate the negative phenomena which Amnesty International referred to in its report of 30Â March this year.
Â Â  â I too would like to join my colleagues in welcoming with pleasure the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania.
By means of this Agreement, Albania will be sealing its future in Europe.
I am convinced that, following Albaniaâs ending of its political isolation years ago, this agreement will now allow it to make rapid progress, both economically and socially, and that it will do this from a European perspective.
However, the journey will not be an easy one.
As indicated in the European partnership adopted by the Council with Albania earlier this year, Albania has several objectives to meet, both in the short-term and over a number of years.
It must be clear that a global and courageous reform is required in the country, so that these objectives can be achieved; a root and branch reform, so to speak, in several sectors, in particular with regard to the administrative capacity of Albaniaâs public administration.
Greater progress is required with regard to the civil rights of the Albanian people and in the justice sector.
To change a country and a society in this way is certainly not easy, but neither is it impossible.
My country, Malta, also went through a similar change.
Over a period spanning almost twenty years it has undergone a phenomenal transformation.
However, the difficult road we embarked upon enabled us to meet the Copenhagen criteria, thus allowing us to join the European family within the European Union, just as many other countries did.
Albania should look upon this Agreement as an extremely important step which will lead it to its natural home, that is, to membership of the European Union.
Today this Parliament should send a clear message to the Albanian people, the message that the European Parliament is closely following the developments affecting the Albanian people and that they can count on our support and good will.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I welcome the conclusion of this stabilisation and association agreement between Albania and the European Union.
It is without a doubt in the interests of the European Union that it should help countries such as Albania to achieve greater political, social and economic stability, and we must not, while doing this, overlook the fact that, since Albania borders on Greece, which is an EU Member State, any attempt to bring Albania closer to the EU is the most obvious thing in the world.
Despite the reforms already implemented, there are still great challenges ahead for the Albanian economy, in which agriculture and related sectors play a considerable part, still accounting for a significant share â 24% â of the gross domestic product.
Many Albanians live from subsistence farming and only a few products are exported.
Many farms do not produce enough to be competitive.
It is for that reason that it is very important that the standards for veterinary checks, pesticides, labelling and the registration of animals applicable to products intended for export should be improved and complied with.
It follows that anything that can be done to help promote the development of agriculture and of rural areas is to be supported, with particular attention also needing to be given to structural change and the problems posed by people moving away from rural areas.
Finally, I would like to say that I regard the stabilisation and association agreement as an appropriate instrument for drawing countries such as Albania closer to the European Union and to its values.
Â Â  Office. MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am very glad that there is strong and broad commitment within all the Unionâs institutions, including Parliament, to the Western Balkansâ European perspective.
One of the main practical measures connected with strengthening this perspective is obviously visa flexibility, and we support the aim to have the mandates for talks on a visa flexibility agreement adopted by the Council during the last six months of this year and for these talks to be concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans some time next year.
As has been said often in this debate, much has been done in Albania to strengthen its European perspective, but there is still a lot to be done.
It is one thing to draft legislation, but it is quite another to implement it, not to speak of cultural change, which normally takes even longer.
It has to be said once again that the Council is expecting Albania to step up measures, especially with regard to promoting freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, improved administration, the protection of minorities, and ensuring that local elections are held in accordance with international norms.
Change, which Albania has already experienced and will experience again, is not easy, and that means that a lot of work needs to be done.
It is mainly Albania which holds the keys to the solution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that there is broad agreement in this House on how welcome this new step is for Albania and for our policy on the Western Balkans.
It is true that more resolute and determined reform efforts must be undertaken by Albania, as well as efforts to build up properly functioning institutions and a democratic culture.
I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Ilves, that this provides Albania with a golden opportunity to reform the country in line with the rule of law and all democratic principles.
Like Mrs Pack, I also noted the tense situation in the country over the summer and the parliamentary boycott by the opposition.
I am, however, pleased that a new political agreement was reached last week, reflecting a new consensus on media and electoral reform.
I take this as a sign of the increased maturity of Albaniaâs political culture, and this must be pursued further in the future.
I was asked what the Commissionâs position is on the progress in electoral reform in Albania.
The Commission has underlined, both to the Government and to the opposition, the need to restart discussions without delay in the AdÂ Hoc Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reform.
We have reiterated that reform discussions should take into account the recommendations of the OSCEâs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, following last yearâs parliamentary election.
I agree fully with Mr Hatzidakis that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement helps us to coach the country towards European standards as regards electoral reform.
There is also a question about the magnetism of the European Union and what our view is of any possible application for membership from Albania.
On behalf of the Commission and the Union, I have made it clear to Albaniaâs political leadership and to the general public of that country that a sustained track record of successful implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as a tangible track record of reforms and their implementation on the ground, must be established over time before any consideration of further formal steps towards the European Union is possible.
Implementation, implementation and implementation should be the name of the game in Albania now as regards its European aspirations.
This concerns especially the need to fight organised crime and corruption.
The Government of Albania has demonstrated a strong will to make serious progress in that field.
Efforts have to be sustained and in such a way that they do not violate democratic and fundamental rights.
The Commission will report on Albaniaâs progress in the context of this yearâs enlargement package in October or November.
I am very glad that the European Parliament has invested a lot of time and energy in monitoring and pursuing political dialogue with Albania.
I am sure that together we can achieve positive results in terms of coaching Albania towards its European future.
I fully agree with the Members who have underlined the importance of visa facilitation for the countries of the Western Balkans, including Albania.
The Commission made its proposals for the negotiating mandates for the Western Balkans on visa facilitation in July.
I am very glad that the Finnish Presidency intends to secure the adoption of those mandates before the end of this year.
Albania already has a readmission agreement in place, so I sincerely hope that a visa facilitation agreement can be negotiated swiftly and then soon implemented.
It would be good for civil society and business â particularly small and medium-sized enterprises â and for students, researchers and all citizens.
It would contribute to the Europeanisation of Albanian civil society, which is our common goal.
Â Â  â I should like to advise you that written declaration 38/2006 by Carl Schlyter, Paulo Casaca, Karl-Heinz Florenz, Mojca DrÄar Murko and Caroline Lucas on banning seal products in the European Union has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members. Consequently, in accordance with RuleÂ 116 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the minutes of the sitting of 26 September 2006.
Â Â  Mr President, this spring I went with a group of European journalists to follow the seal hunt.
Our car was run off the road, our helicopter was grounded and we were forced to remain in our hotel by an angry mob.
Despite all this we managed to witness the cruel hunting of very young seal pups which left many suffering on the ice.
Climate change and the receding ice threaten their survival because they need ice cover for their nursing.
Europe is the main market for seal products.
I thank with all my heart all the colleagues who signed this resolution.
The last time the EU made a reduction in its market for seal products, in the 1980s, it led to a virtual closing-down of the hunt.
This demand is an extension of the ban and will finally give eco-tourism the chance to replace mass slaughter.
I urge the Commission to propose legislation as quickly as possible in order to scale back next year's hunt, which will start in March.
I thank all of you very much.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can be said that this is genuinely a report that is full of new developments.
I should like to point out to you that all of the amendments in the report were unanimously adopted at our sitting in June, that we consider data protection to be closely connected with the VIS and the SIS II, and that we therefore need this instrument quickly.
We had a moral obligation from the Council.
The Finnish Presidency is calling on us to deal with this issue as part of the debate on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for at the second September part-session.
With data protection being, as it is, a political priority for our Parliament, I should like the Council to make a formal commitment before our Assembly to swiftly adopt the framework decision and to do everything in its power to involve Parliament in the debates.
That is why I am calling on my fellow Members to kindly postpone the vote on this legislative resolution until the next part-session in September.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are not only people with severe psychotic disorders in the European Union, but also people with a number of psychological disorders.
I should therefore like to move the following oral amendment to paragraph 48 so that it would read â... believes that the term âtreatmentâ should be interpreted broadly, including the psychotherapy conducted by fully qualified specialists ...â.
It does not change much but it adds something that reflects what we face in our societies.
Â Â  . â Mr President, that is acceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to move a short oral amendment to Amendments 11 and 12.
In each amendment, before the words âthe new Member Statesâ, the words âsome ofâ should be inserted, so that the text reads: âin some of the new Member Statesâ. The aim is to be factually correct, since what is being referred to in the two amendments does not concern all of the Member States, just some of them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, that is also acceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we face the third vote on the Budget Regulation within the space of six months, and, in order that no time be wasted, I ask you to vote a rapid response from this House to the Council, which I am asking â indeed, urging â to at last enter into dialogue with this House on the subject of the Budget Regulation.
We have left it late enough as it is, and only if we embark upon it now can the Budget enter into force by the required deadline at the end of this year.
Only if it does that will the multiannual programmes and their implementing provisions be able to benefit from the simplified procedures in the new Budget Regulation.
By its delaying tactics, the Council is making it less likely that it will be possible to draw on grant funds promptly and complete grant-making procedures more simply and without delay.
I ask that negotiations be commenced.
Â Â  â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report on the Fisheries Agreement between the EC and the Union of the Comoros.
The last time we voted on this subject some years ago I inserted an amendment asking for joint action between the EC and the Union of the Comoros to protect that âfish out of timeâ, the Coelacanth, which, although thought to have been extinct for tens of millions of years, was rediscovered in deep water off the Comoros in the 1940s.
As far as I am aware, little was done.
I hope this time around real attempts will be made to protect this unique remnant of the worldâs deep time.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report on the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement between the Union of the Comoros and the European Community.
The Agreement forms part of the new partnership approach to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, which the EU is seeking to implement.
The objective of the Agreement is to develop and improve fishing conditions in the Union of the Comoros, which should benefit from part of the funding granted by the EU for the purpose of providing new infrastructure and technology that is better equipped for the sustainable management of the countryâs fisheries resources.
For its part, the EU will guarantee, in another third country, fishing opportunities that will help keep its long-distance fishing fleet operational.
One sour note is the fact that only now is Parliament being called on to deliver its opinion on the legislative proposal on this Agreement, when the annexed protocol relating thereto was adopted by Parliament itself in October 2005 as part of a separate procedure.
Â Â  . In light of the conclusions of the July 2004 Council on the new approach to international fisheries agreements, there is a need to retrieve formulas that have disappeared, such as the inexplicably removed joint enterprise scheme, which enjoyed great success in developing the fishing economies of various countries.
Accordingly, it has become essential to adapt the current agreements to the philosophy adopted and enshrined in the conclusions of the 2004 Fisheries Council.
One of the factors that I believe is vital to the success of these new agreements is greater involvement of the authorities of third countries in more environment-focused monitoring of their resources.
I therefore believe that this report should be adopted.
That way, the principles enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy will be upheld.
Â Â  . Mr President, these fisheries agreements do little more than export our own disastrous policies to the developing world.
They are only justifiable in the looking glass world of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy which has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters.
Accordingly I have voted against this report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted for the Ilves report on the stabilisation agreement between the European Union and Albania and believe that only greater integration, and even the urgent incorporation of Albania into the European Union, will be the best response to the problems of the Balkans and also, of course, those of Albania.
The events that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s should have taught us that the self-interest of nation states is never part of the solution.
After Kosovo, the Cham issue is the last major national issue concerning Albanian-speaking peoples.
On the Cham question, as in the case of Kosovo, we radicals are among the first in this Chamber to denounce the violation of that peopleâs rights.
This agreement lays the foundations for a dialogue about the cultural rights of Chams living in Greece and the return of their property; this dialogue must not be based solely on the idea of a confrontation between opposing national interests, but rather on the involvement of Europe and international institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, corruption, nineteenth-century mafia practices, IslamismÂ ... today, Albania is still suffering the after effects of 50 years of Stalinist dictatorship.
Not in any way is it ready to join the European Union, even though, unlike Turkey for example, it does, of course, historically speaking, belong to the European civilisation community.
Sound neighbourhood policy should, however, be sufficient to cultivate this historical European tie.
This neighbourhood policy should also be sufficient to address the enormous problems which that country is facing and which rule out any prospect of joining the EU.
We should therefore not foster any false expectations among the Albanians.
Accordingly, I have voted against this resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania, on the grounds that it represents a first step â and let us not labour under any misconceptions here â towards Albanian accession, and Europe, as in the case of Turkey, chooses to ignore the opinion of its public.
Â Â  In spite of its sound references to a social economy, this report, which appears to extol growth, unfortunately has a preponderance of negative features.
The public propaganda campaigns it proposes for selling the message that the world community is in need of reform are out of keeping with the times, as are the demands for a more extensive internal market in pursuit of unsustainable growth.
There are references identifying the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe as a means of strengthening social Europe, when the draft Constitution, on the contrary, entailed further steps towards the neo-liberal internal market and military rearmament.
In this way, voters are being lied to.
Â Â  â Mr President, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party have voted against the report on a European social model for the future.
The report correctly points out that there is no genuine European social model, and yet, significantly, it describes a series of values that we jointly recognise and sets out the problems that each country must resolve in its social policy.
The report is a good starting point for future debate, but we do not support the solution that it puts forward.
We do not agree with the reportâs backing for the proposed European Constitution, which has now been rejected.
In our view, the report will lead to restrictions on competition in the social and tax fields, and to a loss of Member State sovereignty over these areas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I voted against the Peneda/De Rossa report on the grounds that the European Social Model is an achievable proposition only if the number of the unemployed and of those living below the poverty line is reduced.
What we need to do, , is to take long-term action to address the problems of dismantled social services and of wage dumping, and, in particular, to become clear in our own minds about the fact that a social model cannot be founded upon part-time working and subsistence wages, which is why we need more people in full-time employment and high minimum standards across Europe.
It is the states in which social security provides a strong safety net â of which Austria is one â that are reaching the limits of their financial viability, and that is why it is vital in terms of the survival of the social model and of any countryâs workforce that the transitional periods for the labour market, for workers from the new eastern Member States, be strictly adhered to.
Â Â  â I voted for the report by my colleagues MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda and MrÂ DeÂ Rossa on the European Social Model, because it is crucial that our fellow citizens understand that European integration provides our ambitions to build a humanist civilisation with a social dimension.
Clearly, work remains to be done on the coherence of our sustainable development model bringing together economic growth, social ambition and respect for the environment.
This report outlines some very promising initiatives which I support, while being satisfied that, in its wisdom, the European Parliament has rejected the proposal to legislate on services of general interest, since at present it is clear that the time is not right for such a step.
I sincerely believe that a fair and balanced social model is a key element of the Unionâs economic performance, while, on the other hand, over-emphasis on social policy will destroy economic growth and will in time be counter-productive, as there will be insufficient means to finance social measures.
In this matter, let us be clear about the use that we will make of the European Union, and let us not hide the reality from our fellow citizens, and from young people in particular.
Â Â  . There are many points Conservative MEPs oppose in this report, such as references to tax coordination and to the Constitution which is why I requested separate roll-calls on these paragraphs to make our position crystal clear.
It would have been easy to vote against the whole report because of these points alone.
However on the plus-side, we had worked hard to include references to the Lisbon Agenda, the completion of the internal market, and the involvement of national parliaments: this is the first time that such points have been accepted within such a social affairs report.
The key to our final vote was the need for reform.
My Amendment 1 spelled this out specifically and was readily embraced by colleagues within the EPP-ED Group.
In return for our agreement to abstain at the end rather than voting against, the Socialists agreed to let this amendment pass.
The prize has been formal recognition for the very first time by the majority of MEPs that the European social model does indeed need to be reformed.
This is a real achievement, led by the UK Conservatives.
The challenge now is for us to work together to make this happen.
Â Â  . We are very disappointed that, once again, those who talk such a great deal about a decent European social model have actually adopted a report that, in reality, gives the go-ahead for, and legitimises, a process already under way in a number of Member States, namely the dismantling of high social standards, the scaling back of the rights of the workers and the people to a public, universal and high-quality social security system, and the erosion of universal access to high-quality public services, in areas such as health, education and housing.
We regret the rejection of the amendments that we tabled, in which we registered our deeply held belief that a State with sound social protection based on high environmental, social and labour standards and characterised by progressive taxation and the redistribution of the income and wealth generated is conducive to good economic performance.
We also regret the rejection of our proposal for a macroeconomic framework to support sustainable development, with stronger internal demand that is environmentally friendly and compatible with full employment, in such a way as to deliver economic and social cohesion.
We therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  In this report, the rapporteurs propose a host of measures that should be taken in order to solve problems relating to employment and social policy.
Parts of these proposals may be commendable in themselves, but we in the June List are emphatic in stressing that, in our view, the political areas dealt with by the report should fall exclusively within the competence of the Member States.
I reject references to the Constitution, perspectives on the Member Statesâ tax systems, views on pension reforms and lectures on the action Member States should take in order to achieve increased prosperity.
I share the view in recital N that the Member States should have competence when it comes to funding services of general interest and to taking decisions in this area, but I was forced to vote against this recital because of the reference to the Constitution.
I have thus voted against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . The Verts/ALE Group supported the final report today on the European social model not because the report is perfect but because it sets down an important marker for Parliament on the importance of the social dimension of EU development.
We regret the continuing emphasis on economic growth without regard to the quality and effect of that growth.
The Lisbon process is, for my Group, not the only way forward as it takes insufficient account of the importance of the social dimension in its widest sense â it is not only about employment but about the voluntary and social part of our lives.
We regret that the Framework Directive for Services of General Interest did not gain majority support: we do need to find a way to differentiate core essential services provided for the public good from the services we choose as individuals.
However, the report recognises the need for any reform of social systems to be non-regressive and to meet essential needs: a core income is essential to that goal.
We hope that this report will be a valuable tool in our discussions with the Council and Commission and that other legislation will protect, not undermine, social Europe.
Â Â  . â For a long time, Western Europe constituted a model of economic and social success, based on thriving agriculture, powerful industry, dynamic and homogeneous peoples, and solid nation-states that guaranteed their nationals both free enterprise and social protection.
For twenty years, the Europe of Brussels without borders, in collusion with our governments, has been abandoning our industries to competition from the Asian economies, which practice social dumping, letting in more than a million non-European immigrants each year, practising a genuine form of Malthusianism against our farmers and dismantling our social protection systems and our family policies.
We are talking here about widespread social regression, with more than 20Â million people unemployed, industrial disintegration, hundreds of thousands of hectares left fallow, European countries in which the death rate is higher than the birth rate and entire regions that are being fragmented.
That is a summary of this Europe that the people of France and the Netherlands rejected last year during the referendums on the European Constitution.
Only a Europe of nations, based on the principles that made our civilisation great â the nation, the family and freedom â will enable our continent once again to constitute a social model.
Â Â  . In voting for the De Rossa and Silva Peneda report on a European social model for the future, Labour MEPs are expressing support for social and economic policies which generate employment, productivity and fairness at work.
Labour MEPs analyse each legislative proposal on a case-by-case basis in relation to their impact on UK business and the workforce.
Nothing in our voting for the De Rossa report runs counter to this approach.
Specifically, Labour MEPs believe firmly that taxation policy is a matter for individual Member States and we have voted accordingly in the De Rossa and Silva Peneda report.
Â Â  . The European social model is in need of reform.
The question, though, is how to reform something that is virtually âemblematicâ of todayâs Europe.
The answer is: without fear.
We must become more competitive and help to improve our citizens' quality of life.
We must not flinch, therefore, when it comes to taking decisions aimed at improving our citizensâ lives.
There is no doubt in my mind that one of the most effective measures will be the completion of the internal market.
We must comply with Lisbon to ensure economic coordination measures and employment and social protection policies, which will, in turn, deliver economic growth, increased competitiveness and the creation of more and better jobs, in a sustainable fashion.
Much remains to be done, both here and in our capital cities.
It is not enough merely to announce reforms and to promise more jobs.
It is not enough merely to talk among ourselves.
We must achieve our targets on employment, education and training.
A new culture is needed, information must be exchanged, the effectiveness of companies and training must be maximised and a qualified workforce must be made available if we are finally to be able to uphold the social values of solidarity and social justice in Europe.
Â Â  . The European social model is unique.
In the EU we can balance the single market with social justice.
We must do all that we can to keep this balance.
Â Â  . â The Greek Communist Party voted against the report on the European social model, the product of the agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the social democrats, reveals in the most cynical manner the nightmarish future being prepared by euro-unifying capital for the workers.
The political and ideological mouthpieces of capital are developing a huge propaganda campaign, using the problem of unemployment and brandishing threats about demographic ageing and the risk of collapse of social insurance systems in order to present the 'reform' of existing social protection systems as an urgent necessity.
The promotion of capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, calls for the complete dismantling of all the rights (which, of course, were also below the level of grassroots needs) won by the workers through the fight of the workers' movement and pressure from the existence of the socialist camp.
Thus, the greatest possible exploitation of the working class is being promoted through the full deconstruction of employment relations and the spread of flexible forms of employment, the dismantling of pension, healthcare, welfare and social protection systems (unemployment protection, maternity protection, housing and so on) and the abolition of free state public services.
The only thing that will remain in place will be the lowest possible level of protection from absolute impoverishment, in order to avoid social uprisings.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I also voted against the Bowis report, my reason for doing so being that we really should not be surprised at the increase in mental illness.
People are under constantly increasing pressure at work and at school, and this stress means that we do not perform at our full capacity.
Improved psychoactive medications can at best address the symptoms but not the causes.
It will be more helpful to build up European peopleâs feelings of self-worth by communicating to them our authentic, real and Christian fundamental values.
That those who have deep roots in family-mindedness, patriotism and their national identity are less prone to mental illness is not a matter of doubt.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report on acknowledging the importance of mental illness in Europe, the rapporteur of which is my friend John Bowis, who alone has ensured that this important topic will be addressed in the best possible manner.
MrÂ Bowisâs fame has spread throughout Europe.
An admirer of his by the name of Silvana Moggi has come from Italy, specifically from the town of Salsomaggiore (the town where Miss Italy was elected), to be here in the gallery because she wanted to be present when her great idol John Bowis presented his extremely important proposal for debate, so that all of us in Europe can be treated in the best possible way even when we have the misfortune of having mental illnesses and not just physical illnesses.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by MrÂ Bowis on the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament â towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union.
One out of every four people will suffer from a mental health problem during their life. Physical and mental weaknesses increase with age, and this is linked to longer life expectancies.
In a world which is becoming more complicated under pressure from enormous, dramatic and rapid changes, we are faced with the collective challenge to understand, prevent and treat mental health problems while avoiding the stigmatisation, rejection or, worse still, contempt, of sufferers.
The European Union must offer an example by guaranteeing its citizens a mentally healthy life.
In this regard, I am proud to belong to a Member State, France, which, under the leadership of President Jacques Chirac, has always implemented the most lucid, ambitious and, ultimately, humane policy on the treatment of mental disabilities.
Â Â  . Mental health is an extremely important issue for each of us, whether we are sufferers, carers or service providers in this field.
The role of legislators in this area is even greater as we in the EU and Member States can with consultation and partnership create a better and brighter future for sufferers, family and carers.
For too long mental illness has not been at centre stage in our legislative process and, as is clear from the Commissionâs Green Paper and its startling findings, public consciousness through more informed communication is slowly coming to realise that mental illness and its consequences affect the core of our population.
25% of the EUâs and Irelandâs population experience at least one significant episode of mental ill health during their lives.
It is time to react!
I warmly welcome this Green Paper as a European debate-launcher on learning disabilities, major depression, suicide, imprisonment of suffers and the affect of inappropriate imprisonment so that Member States can share research and best practice for the benefit of our citizens.
Since the 1980s Ireland has advocated a policy of de-institutionalisation, aiming to develop a modern mental health service via a community-based system, promoting mental health, giving the mentally ill as independent a life as possible and providing comprehensive healthcare, moving away from psychiatric hospitals.
Â Â  The mental health of the population of each Member State is an issue that should be dealt with exclusively at national level.
There are no reasons why the European Parliament should have views on what appropriations should be granted to the mental health world and on what measures should be taken in this area.
The proposal that the Commission should establish a Mental Health Coordinating and Monitoring Group is just one of several unnecessarily detailed and expensive proposals.
I have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  . The report has many strong points with respect to mental health issues concerning women and children.
That is why we give our support to the report.
However we do want to stress that, in principle, measures and decisions with respect to healthcare are within the competence of the individual Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, I warmly congratulate our Rapporteur on this report, which highlights often painful lack of progress in dealing with mental health issues across the Union.
Too often mental health is the Cinderella of our health services, yet the implications of poor mental health are a drain on all resources as well as personally disastrous.
I welcome the conclusions of this report and am very happy to support them.
Â Â  . Mental health has for too long been ignored and neglected.
The report today, although an own-initiative report, allows mental health to be placed on the European political agenda.
I welcome this debate.

Â Â  . â The CFP no longer meets the expectations of Mediterranean fishermen.
That is why I welcome this plan, which includes several positive guidelines: a crucial reduction in costs and constraints for the fishermen; a revision and harmonisation of the control and monitoring provisions, under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency, which is something that Mediterranean fishermen, who all too often feel âharassedâ, have been specifically waiting for; and closer involvement for those working in the sector in the definition of the guidelines (management of fishing efforts, control measures and catch limits), which echoes a strong demand that I am voicing at the European Parliament on behalf of Mediterranean fishermen.
I also support Parliamentâs request to play its full role by denying the European Commission the opportunity to decide on âtechnical measuresâ by itself.
The fishermen know only too well how these âtechnical measuresâ have a direct and immediate impact on their activity.
I will therefore vote in favour of this report, even though I would have liked it to have gone further in terms of demanding a specific plan for Mediterranean fisheries.
I, for my part, will continue to wage this fight at the European Parliament, alongside the fishermen from my region.
Â Â  . I fully endorse the objectives set out by the Commission, namely the action plan in priority areas such as conservation policy and the monitoring of fishing activities.
This proposal is, to my mind, a vital factor in adapting the CFP to the current reality of fisheries in the EU.
Among its key points are the following: the frontloading (prior consultation at an early stage) of the institutions directly or indirectly involved in the assessment of fisheries resources, that is to say consultation with the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture; more frequent use of impact analysis of measures that may be implemented; and the revision of the legal structure of existing provisions with a view to making texts clearer, more consistent, more understandable and easier to read, deleting obsolete provisions.
I should also like to highlight the need for the Commission to extend its process of improving the procedures as regards the partnership agreements, more specifically the process of monitoring and implementing those agreements.
I shall be voting in favour of this proposal.
Â Â  The June List has on numerous occasions made it clear that we oppose the Common Fisheries Policy.
We believe that the EUâs destructive and immoral fisheries agreements should be abolished.
I am highly critical of paragraphÂ 22 of the report, which points out the importance of Community aid for funding technical facilities on fishing vessels.
However, the report emphasises the value of increased flexibility, clearer legislation, simplified rules and the need for increased consultation with parties affected.
These objectives are commendable.
I have thus voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . In view of issues relating to the multiplicity and the readability of Community legislation on the Common Fisheries Policy, it is crucial that this legislation be improved and simplified.
The simplification of procedures, clear and comprehensible wording for all interested parties, the allowance of sufficient time between the adoption and implementation of legislation and, too, the assessment of its economic, social and environmental impact are issues that must be thought through clearly in the interests of transparency and fairness in implementing legislation.
This process must not, however, act as a pretext for trying to undermine what has been regulated, and there must be monitoring on the part of national parliaments, the European Parliament and the sector and its organisations representing the workers.
The fact that we accept that the process must be simplified does not automatically imply that we agree on the content of the Common Fisheries Policy; indeed, we have some serious objections.
For example, the rapporteur advocates a Community inspection system.
We are opposed to this because we feel that it should fall to the Member States, as part of sovereignty over their exclusive economic area.
Furthermore, we fail to understand the rapporteur's concerns as regards extending the principle of the Member States being able to adopt conservation and resource management measures in their waters beyond 12 nautical miles.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the amendment, which would have allowed ACP countries to opt out of fisheries agreements, if they considered such agreements to be harmful to their interests.
Simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy is an attractive notion, given the centralised, cumbersome and often secretive processes under which management decisions are made.
My view, and that of many Scots, is that the CFP should be concerned with the market in fisheries products, but that control and management of the resource and of catching opportunities should be returned to Scotland.
Â Â  . â The plans are coming thick and fast, the European Fisheries Fund is replacing FIFG, the advisory committees are multiplying, and the Community Fisheries Control Agency is developing its activities, but none of that is leading to an improvement in the fishermenâs work situation.
European legislation is in the process of killing off fishing and French fishermen just as agricultural legislation is going to force out our farmers.
Two key problems have been overlooked in this report, even though, in the long term, they will determine whether or not the French fishing fleet stays: the unfair competition from non-EU fishing vessels that do not comply with all of the restrictions imposed on our fishermen in matters concerning legislation, control and monitoring, and the cost of fuel ever since Brussels called on France to do away with the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, or fuel fund.
The legislation certainly needs to be simplified, but that will do nothing to improve the situation of our fishermen.
Once again, the European Commission is taking them for a ride, if I may say so.
There now remain only 5Â 500 fishing vessels.
How many will remain in 2010 with the new Common Fisheries Policy?
Â Â  . It is undeniably important that the rules on the Common Fisheries Policy be simplified.
Accordingly, I welcome the measures put forward in this proposal aimed at addressing the lack of clarity of the existing texts and at making the wording simpler, as this would bring the interested parties closer together and would lead to the fisheries sector identifying more closely with the legislation.
In spite of the numerous calls that have been made, fishermen continue to have difficulty in terms of their awareness and understanding of the Common Fisheries Policy. It needs to become easier both to understand and to implement.
I welcome the gradual adaptation of new technologies on board fishing vessels and the undertaking to grant Community aid for the development of these technologies and the specific training required.
These measures will bring benefits for both the fishing community and consumers.
I also feel it is necessary to clarify the processes for administering fishing authorisations outside Community waters.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Common Fisheries Policy has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters it is incapable of meaningful reform and should be scrapped wholesale.
However, even minimal progress remains progress and this report does contain some useful suggestions, so I have supported the report while protesting that it does not go nearly far enough.
Â Â  . Although I believe more work needs to be conducted on third-party fish agreements, I cannot on this occasion support Amendments 1 and 2.
Both amendments go outside the objective of the Action Plan.
Â Â  . Mr President, these fisheries agreements do little more than export our own disastrous policies to the developing world.
They are only justifiable in the looking glass world of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy which has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters.
Accordingly I have voted against this report.
Â Â  . â The European Parliament is giving its verdict today on two fishing agreements that are of importance in relation to the Indian Ocean: one with the Republic of Seychelles and the other with the Republic of the Comoros.
These agreements, which are scheduled to last for six and seven years respectively, on a renewable basis, have the following objectives: economic, financial, technical and scientific cooperation in the fisheries sector; the laying down of conditions for Community fishing vessels to access the territorial waters of the Seychelles and the Comoros; and the setting up of partnerships between companies with the aim of developing, in the common interest, economic activities coming under the fisheries sector and any activities related thereto.
A financial contribution will be paid to the Seychelles and the Comoros in return for the exploitation of their fishery resources.
As an elected representative from overseas who is aware of the role of fishing in the overseas economy, and particularly that of RÃ©union, I am pleased that Europe is helping to establish both a responsible form of fishing in the Indian Ocean and the sustainable exploitation of its fishery resources.
That is why I voted in favour of these two agreements.
Â Â  Before moving on to the next item, I have a communication for the House.
You will recall that we have occasionally had disagreements over how to interpret RuleÂ 166 of our Rules of Procedure and that certain Members thought that the Presidency was not applying it properly, since it was not giving the floor for points of order that did not refer to the issue that was being debated at that moment.
In fact, RuleÂ 166 does not specify clearly whether the point of order for which the floor is given must refer to the issue being debated or to that dayâs agenda, or whether it can refer to any other issue.
Nevertheless, the Presidentâs view is that common sense should dictate that the floor should only be given on the subject being debated and not any other issue.
Nevertheless, in order to clear up the argument that had arisen on various occasions in the House, I requested the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and, in its reply, it proposes the following interpretation of RuleÂ 166: âRequests for the floor to comment on the application of the Rules of Procedure shall refer to the item being debated at that moment.
The President may give the floor in relation to other issues at the appropriate time; for example, after the debate on an item on the agenda or before the sitting is suspended.â
It is therefore clear that, from now on, RuleÂ 166 should be interpreted as common sense dictates and that it may only be invoked for the purpose of commenting on the application of the Rules of Procedure relating to the item being debated at that moment.
I would point out that the Committee on Constitutional Affairsâ interpretation will be considered adopted unless it is contested before the Minutes of the present sitting are approved.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, the latest Middle East crisis in the summer is the first in which the European Union has become the international actor on which the greatest hopes and expectations have been placed, in particular by the Lebanese people and government but also, more widely, throughout that region.
I am pleased to say that the EU has managed to live up to those expectations and to play an important, and even leading, role in putting a stop to the hostilities, in keeping the ceasefire and in the efforts made to move forward the political process needed to consolidate the peace.
In August, the General Affairs and External Relations Council held two extraordinary meetings.
In our meeting on 1Â August, we managed to reach an agreement on the conclusions.
This was done in a very constructive atmosphere, contrary to some totally misleading press reports.
The substance of those conclusions subsequently became the basis for United Nations Security Council ResolutionÂ 1701 which brought a ceasefire, outlined the political agreement needed to restore the full integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon and created the new UNIFIL Mark 2 force needed to ensure implementation of the resolution.
It was not the EUâs fault that it took so long for the resolution to be passed, while every day the conflict brought more unnecessary civilian casualties, suffering and devastation without anyone coming any nearer to fulfilling either the political or military goals for which they were fighting.
Indeed, the central lesson to be learned from this conflict is that there are neither military nor unilateral solutions to any of the outstanding issues and conflicts in the Middle East.
The role of the EU Member States has remained central since the adoption of ResolutionÂ 1701.
At our second extraordinary Council meeting on 25Â August, in which the United Nations Secretary General KofiÂ Annan also participated, we were able to ensure that UNIFIL can and will be brought up to strength and deployed as the EU Member States responded to the United Nations request by contributing up to 7000 troops.
Also at that meeting it was confirmed that France, and from next February Italy, would have responsibility for leading the operation.
UNIFIL is not an EU operation and it is important that other members of the United Nations, including, in particular, many Islamic countries, are contributing to the operation.
Already, the first Italian and additional French troops have been deployed.
There is a need to move troops into the area quickly in order to avoid a security vacuum while the IDF withdraws and the Lebanese armed forces gradually deploy into southern Lebanon.
In order to restore peace and security, UNIFILâs mission is to ensure the withdrawal from southern Lebanon and to help the Lebanese Government and army to extend their authority to that area and to all of Lebanon.
While the Lebanese Army is to carry out the disarming of Hizbollah, UNIFIL will also have an important task in ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid, monitoring the ceasefire and being ready to respond if anyone tries to break the peace.
The ceasefire has, notwithstanding some deplorable incidents, been respected.
The Lebanese Government remains united and all the political parties, including Hizbollah, have pledged their support for ResolutionÂ 1701 and the political agreement it incorporates.
The role of the European Union in terms of humanitarian aid and the early recovery and reconstruction of Lebanon has been remarkable.
The Donor Conference in Stockholm last week was a major success.
The European Unionâs humanitarian aid response has been swift and significant.
The total humanitarian aid pledged or effectively granted by the European Community and Member States is approximately EURÂ 330 million, i.e. over a third of the total pledges made in Stockholm.
We are already in a position to focus more on early recovery and strengthening local capacities.
All our efforts â the political agreement, reconstruction and support for the integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon with the presence of a strong UNIFILÂ â are vital for peace and stability in that country.
It is also crucial that outside actors and neighbours support this.
For that reason, we must be prepared to engage Syria, which can either be a constructive partner or a spoiler.
That will also determine the future of the EUâs relations with Syria.
In my own contacts with Syria, as in meetings with others, we have welcomed Syriaâs stated intention and readiness to respect ResolutionÂ 1701 and lend support to its implementation and, moreover, also to be constructive in a comprehensive Middle East peace process.
For all of us in the Council, it has always been clear that there cannot be any sustainable stability and peace in Lebanon, or elsewhere in the region, without a return to the peace process between Israel and Palestine that is based on the roadmap and its goal of the two-state solution, with Israel living in peace and security with an independent and viable Palestinian State as its neighbour.
Unfortunately, many aspects of the roadmap have, and continue, to come under attack.
Deadlock has existed since the Palestinian elections in January, which our election observers, led by your colleague, MsÂ DeÂ Keyser, unequivocally assessed as free and fair.
In order for the peace process to continue, it is vital that the people and constituent parties of Palestine remain committed to non-violence, the recognition of Israel and to putting a stop to all terrorist activities.
We have had an uncertain situation in which the international community has had to suspend its direct assistance to the Palestinian Administration while trying to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians are met and their access to education and medical services is maintained.
That has been the difficult task of the Temporary International Mechanism set up by the EU at the request of the Quartet, and it has not been made any easier by Israelâs refusal to the release tax and customs receipts now amounting to over USDÂ 500 million that are due to the Palestinian Administration.
However, as its name suggests, the Temporary International Mechanism is only an interim device.
We need to break the deadlock.
We need to have all the abducted Israeli soldiers, the arrested Palestinian legislators and members of the Government, unconditionally released.
We also need, above all, a broad-based Palestinian Government that is fully committed to respecting all the commitments entered into by the Palestinian Administration and which can act as a credible partner with which no one can refuse to negotiate.
We do not need to reinvent the wheel for the peace process.
All the requisite elements are well known and are to be found in the roadmap and other documents.
But putting these in the right order remains a challenge.
At our discussions at the Gymnich held in Lappeenranta last week we were in full agreement that the EU must now take an active role in initiating a return to the peace process.
However, no matter in how united, cohesive and effective a manner the EU acts, it is obvious that we cannot achieve peace through our efforts alone.
We need to work closely with all our partners in the Quartet, and in particular with the United States, as well as with the Arab league, whose renewed determination to engage in the process is to be welcomed.
Above all, we need, of course, to urge the parties themselves to come to the table and seriously engage in negotiations.
For a long time people in the region have wanted nothing more than peace and security, and they have become increasingly frustrated by their leadersâ inability or even unwillingness to deliver this, thus fostering a climate which has allowed extremism to thrive.
It is therefore necessary for the EU and others to entice, cajole, push and pressure the parties and to be prepared, where and when necessary, to engage on the ground as well.
The EU is already doing that, with the approval of the parties, in the EU BAM Rafah mission and the EUCOPPS mission in the territories.
Unfortunately, the Rafah and Karni border crossing points have effectively been closed for the past few months and Israel has not responded to our repeated approaches to have them re-opened.
In the future, we may also need to take on other new responsibilities as part of the quest for peace.
The need for a new international conference on the Middle East has been put forward by many.
There is much support for that idea in the Council, but there is also recognition that this is not something that can start immediately, before the parties have agreed to come to such a conference and before there is the prospect of such a conference bringing positive results that can further the peace process.
The Council will stay centrally engaged in the Middle East peace process.
We have made it clear that the High Representative, Javier Solana, has the full support and mandate of the Council, working together with the Presidency and the Commission, to do what needs to be done and to meet with whomsoever is appropriate in order to get the Middle East Peace process working and keep it working until we have reached a comprehensive peace settlement.
Â Â  . Mr President, the conflict in Lebanon, the violence in the Palestinian Territories, the suffering of civilians in northern Israel: these past months the prospect of a comprehensive peace has seemed further off than ever, and yet, paradoxically, these conflicts â especially the misery suffered by ordinary Lebanese, ordinary Israelis and ordinary Palestinians â have once more highlighted the need for a negotiated regional solution.
They are a stark and cruel reminder that security and stability cannot be imposed unilaterally without dialogue or diplomacy.
This is a moment of distress and suffering in the Middle East, but I believe it is also one of opportunity, and we have to seize that opportunity.
It is specifically by mobilising the very considerable resources of the European Union, from the political and security to the technical, economic and financial, and by deploying them in close cooperation with the rest of the international community, that we may be able to put the peace process back on its feet.
As the President-in-Office said, the European Union is playing an unprecedented role.
Europe is fully engaged with Lebanon and determined to play a strong role in supporting the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701 and in finding lasting peace for the region.
EU Member States are making a decisive contribution to the expanded UNIFIL peacekeeping force in support of the rapid extension of the Lebanese Governmentâs authority throughout Lebanon.
The European Union is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to remove the continuing air and sea blockades of Lebanon.
From the outset of the conflict, the European Commission has been very active on the ground, supporting our partners and their people when they most needed us.
Over the past six weeks, the Commission has mobilised and coordinated a very important European response to the urgent needs caused by the conflict.
From the second week of the conflict onwards, we provided rapid humanitarian assistance.
I was glad and grateful to learn that Parliament had agreed to our request to mobilise further resources from the emergency reserve.
This will allow ECHO to continue its action in support of essential early recovery, notably for water, sanitation and housing, thus bringing our total humanitarian support to over EUR 50 million.
The Commission also helped to coordinate and support evacuation efforts, providing EUR 11 million in support of the evacuation of third-country nationals caught up in the conflict, in response to a request from the Foreign Minister of Cyprus to provide urgent assistance to help launch this operation quickly.
On the ground, the Commission also played an important role in assessing the situation and setting up the first coordination exercise among donors.
We are already working with the Lebanese Government, as well as with the United Nations and the World Bank, to ensure that in this post-conflict phase this coordination will be led and informed by the Lebanese themselves â it is a question of ownership.
The Commission has also responded to the environmental disaster and has supported the Lebanese Government through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism in order to tackle the huge environmental damage.
Now we are working to assess and to address the needs relating to the reconstruction of Lebanon with a view to restoring its infrastructure, and promoting economic recovery, social development and political cohesion.
Last week at the Stockholm Conference, I announced a package of EUR 42 million to support early recovery until the end of the year.
This brings the Commissionâs contribution so far to just over EUR 100 million.
I believe the European Commission has shown that it is ready to act and to act quickly.
The European Unionâs contribution to meeting specific and immediate needs is crucial in order to support the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701 and to support a lasting settlement to the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah that has for too long destabilised Lebanon and also threatened Israel.
The Middle East needs a strong, sovereign, unified and politically independent Lebanon, able to consolidate the fragile peace that has returned and to contain the very real risk of spill-over of tension that remains.
The Lebanese population must also feel the tangible benefits of the cessation of hostilities.
A Beirut-driven reconstruction process will help to strengthen the role of the Lebanese Government.
For this, and in order to really start the reconstruction phase, the lifting of Israelâs air and sea blockade is crucial.
I join again with Secretary-General Kofi Annan in calling for its immediate removal.
Over the longer term, the international community must remain engaged, with a focus on supporting institutional recovery and promoting Lebanese state-building efforts, including those undertaken via the national dialogue.
That means pursuing the political, social and economic agenda already outlined in the EU Lebanon Action Plan.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the measures we identified together before the conflict are now more important than ever.
We must also work collectively with our Lebanese counterparts to ensure that conditions for long-term stability are met, including removing the ambiguity surrounding the disarming of Hizbollah â which can only realistically be achieved as part of a process of political integration â and clarifying the status of the Shebaa farms.
We must not lose sight of the broader picture across the region.
While international attention was drawn to Lebanon, the violence and suffering continued in the Palestinian territories and Qassam rockets continued to fall on Israeli towns and villages.
I was in Israel with the Finnish President after the Rome Conference.
We went to Haifa, where there was constant danger from rockets.
In the Palestinian territories, in order to avoid further escalation we need a return by the Palestinian militants to the âcalmâ that held for most of 2005, the release of hostages, detainees and prisoners, as well as progress on basic issues of movement and access, which, as we know hold the key to Palestinian economic recovery and to the creation of a viable Palestinian State.
This should start with the rapid re-opening of the Gaza crossings, in particular the Rafah border, supported by the EU border assistance mission.
The Commission is, in principle, ready to take further action to upgrade the infrastructure and strengthen capacity on the basis of the access and movement agreement of last November.
The context must be our long-standing aim of building up the institutions of a future Palestinian State, working with the Palestinian Authority, which in turn means that the EU should be ready to respond pragmatically to the formation of a Palestinian national unity government.
I repeat that we will engage with any government ready to work for peace through peaceful means.
We must not and we do not forget the plight of the Palestinian people.
We have, as you know, via the temporary international mechanism, ensured access to clean water and sanitation in the Gaza Strip.
We kept hospitals and healthcare centres going through the summer and we have now also provided social allowance payments that have benefited more than 600Â 000 Palestinians directly and many more indirectly.
But with the continued political stalemate, closures and also frozen fiscal revenues, the TIM can only provide temporary relief.
We cannot go on much longer like this.
We must seek ways to improve access and movement to get Israel to unblock the withheld Palestinian revenues that now amount to EUR 500 million and to get the Palestinian Authority to ensure public order and security.
We owe it to the parties and they owe it to their own people.
The rapid escalation of violence this summer produced no victory, only victims.
We see once more the failure of military action to resolve the long drawn-out conflicts of the Middle East.
Yet the status quo â which includes the slow chipping away of the credibility of a two-state solution, continued occupation and endemic violence â is itself a recipe for instability.
It is also a recipe for interference by third parties and radicalism, fuelled by injustices, either perceived or real.
There is, then, really only one choice: we need to renew the political perspective upon which the peace process depends, including for example our position on the primacy of the 1967 borders.
We must do everything possible to bring all the parties back to the negotiating table.
By focusing on some concrete and pragmatic measures that can bring about some positive and tangible results, we can help to create the appropriate climate and facilitate a re-engagement between the parties.
Decisive action is needed to get the parties back on track towards a negotiated peace.
I have called for an early meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert.
I hope they can address the issue of hostages and detainees, as well as other pressing questions of violence, access and finances.
It is time for Israel and Lebanon to establish channels for dialogue, and for Syria to be brought back into the equation, as they show readiness to play their part in the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
Iran must also take its responsibility and demonstrate its readiness to contribute to peace and stability in the region.
Many ideas have been floated on a comprehensive approach to peace in the Middle East.
The Arab League initiative in particular deserves our full attention.
At the Gymnich meeting last weekend, many voices called for greater EU leadership in the Middle East.
I believe they are right.
We have to turn the tragic events of this summer into an opportunity for a long-term settlement of the still open conflicts in the region.
Our credibility, and that of the Quartet and the UN, is at stake.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of the worldâs regions has had so much suffering to endure, and over so many decades, as the Middle East, and those who bear the brunt of it are the people who want nothing more than to live in peace.
Terrible consequences ensue from the abduction and killing of soldiers; innumerable civilians fall victim to the bombardment of real and supposed military targets.
For decades, the violence has been spiralling out of control in an unending vicious circle.
I would like to say, Mr President, how grateful I am to you for calling the group presidents to two meetings over the holiday period, and I would like to thank you, MrÂ Tuomioja, and you, Commission Ferrero-Waldner, for what you have done, as well as the High Representative MrÂ Solana for his own.
We, in the European Union, know that a military solution is impossible in the Middle East, that any solution must be political if it is to bring peace, and that peace must first be established in the minds of those who exercise responsibility.
At the same time, though, we affirm that a military presence can help to create the conditions for peace.
Here in this House, we have for many years been debating European security policy, and those who can remember back twenty years can recall wishing â while, at the time, thinking it impossible â that we could, by now, have moved on from asking ourselves whether we would intervene militarily to thinking about how we would do it.
Europeans such as ourselves can derive some encouragement from this, as we proceed down the road of taking on responsibility; it can confirm to us that this is the right way to go, that we must accept this responsibility and that we do want to.
What are we aiming for?
What we are aiming for is a sovereign Lebanon; we see it as unacceptable that Lebanon should be subject to control, be it direct or indirect, from Syria or Iran, and, where the part played by Iran is concerned, its influence has to be considered in the context of its nuclear programme.
Hizbollah is not only a political organisation, but also a military one.
Those who seek democracy in the Middle East must take note of the fact that Hizbollahâs presence in parliament and government is something that has emerged from elections.
It is not, however, acceptable that there should be a state within a state, or that a political party should, by maintaining its own militia, interfere with the effectiveness of the government and armed forces of a sovereign Lebanon.
That is why the peace process must, among other things, resolve the issue of how Hizbollah is to be disarmed.
The primary competence must be political.
Israelâs response has brought it criticism from many quarters, and I admit that I too, at one time described it as disproportionate, but I do also want to say that I very much respect Israel for considering, in a free and democratic debate, the question of where it went wrong, both politically and militarily.
I wish those states that are Israel's neighbours would be as self-critical in a debate of a similar kind. If the other states bordering upon Israel can be as self-critical, then the Middle East will have moved closer to democracy.
Perhaps I â as a European, a German, and one born of the post-war generation â might be permitted to say how deeply moved I was to hear the Israeli Prime Minister say that a German contribution to the peace effort would be welcomed.
That is something quite utterly novel, the like of which was unthinkable before, and so it is right that the Federal Republic of Germany, too, together with its friends in the European Union, should make its own contribution.
I was deeply moved by that.
The people of Palestine are equal in dignity to the Israelis or to Europeans such as ourselves, and they are entitled to live within secured borders.
We appeal to all the interested parties in Palestine, to Fatah and to Hamas, to form a real government of national unity and thereby play their part in making peace.
We Europeans find ourselves â and perhaps for the first time ever â in a new situation in that we are not only providing the humanitarian aid that matters so much to people, but are also, as part of the Quartet, helping to shape their future, which is what I urge all those involved with the Quartet to join with the European Union in doing.
Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, regarding as it does human dignity as the foundation of each and every policy, calls on everyone in the Middle East and in the Arab and Muslim worlds not to exploit young people as so-called martyrs, imperilling their own lives and the lives of others, but instead to enable them to live in their own countries under decent conditions and make their contributions to society, to respect human dignity and the value of human life, and then we can stand alongside these peoples and their governments.

Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the President-in-Office and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for what they have said.
There lies, I believe, in the crisis and in the attempt at a solution â which they have described and which must now be organised â an historic opportunity for Europeans and for the Member States of the European Union, and not for them alone â as MrÂ Tuomioja is right to point out â for others, notably Islamic states â must also make their own contribution, but the opportunity for the Europeans who are involved is a unique one.

I would put it in yet another way: there is not only a unique opportunity, but also a unique obligation, to do something practical, now, to bring about peaceful solutions, for it has to be said â and it has to be said here â that the USAâs solutions for the region have failed utterly, and that their failure is one of the causes of the present crisis.
That is why we Europeans are under an obligation to make the attempt now to help bring about a solution.
Our contribution cannot be merely military but it must have a military dimension to it, among the various others that are necessary in the region.
What is needed is an overall concept, including military action on the basis of international law, humanitarian action and diplomatic activity, which does not overlook the core issue of conflict in the region, that being the need to resolve the Palestinian conflict, which is the cause of instability across the region.
Let me now set out some of the things that we Socialists regard as fundamental and necessary in terms of this overall concept.
This is indeed, above all else, about Israel's right to exist.
We European Social Democrats are in no doubt about the fact that the existence of Israel is at the heart of our policy, and we oppose all those who jeopardise it.
In the present situation, though, we also have to support Lebanon, which, once its civil war was over, was on the right road towards becoming a stable, secular democracy.
Since that has, to a great extent, been brought to nothing, let us help the Lebanese people to get back to where they were before the military conflict, when the whole region had so many reasons for hope.
We also have to build up Palestine, and the primary objective here must be the provision of humanitarian aid in what is a tragic situation.
What I can say, on behalf of us Social Democrats, is that dialogue with all the forces in Palestine can no longer be evaded; it is necessary and indispensable.
We must promote and build up the structures of civil society, for it is with them, and with all the forces that favour dialogue â particularly dialogue between cultures and religions â that we must be partners.
What is needed in the region â as previous speakers, including MrÂ Poettering, have indicated â is not the questioning of one anotherâs right to exist, but respect: respect for other values, values that may be religious in origin, but are nonetheless constructive and respectful of human dignity, respect on the basis of what we stand for, of our Western values.
We should not make Islam into some sort of hate figure; Islam is a religion professed by almost a billion people around the world, and we must not allow them to be seen in the same light as a bunch of crazed terrorists.
That would be a fatal error. That is why dialogue between cultures is so important.
One thing I do think is important is that the prisoners should be released, and that must happen now.
It is now that the parties to the conflict must keep their word, for what is needed is the sort of action that builds trust, and that is not an empty concept.
Right now, in the situation we are in, that sort of action is indispensable â small steps, understandable steps, steps towards trust, and they include the release of prisoners and the involvement of all the forces in the region.
All the states â not least, and including, Syria â need to brought in.
I would not wish to deny that there has, here in this House â and, indeed within our group â been much disappointment about the things that have been said over recent weeks in Syria and elsewhere.
The thing is that Syria is needed if the problem is to be resolved.
If Syria is willing to engage in constructive dialogue with us, then I call upon them to indicate their goodwill by resuming the dialogue that has already tentatively begun, and to make it possible for us to address, albeit perhaps in small ways, with matters such as border issues, and to demonstrate to us their readiness to return to the negotiating table.
Let me point out, with reference to this, that, even when the Cold War was at its height, the two sides, with all their differences, were still able to talk to each other through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which we had set up.
Why should we not resurrect the idea of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in this region, one that would bring all the parties to the table, not only the countries of the road map â by which I mean us Europeans, the United Nations, Russia, and the United States â but also the states in the region, the Arab League, and Syria as well?
This is something it would certainly be worth thinking about.
I do agree with MrÂ Poettering when he says that nothing in the world can justify targeted terrorist acts.
Such terrorism, such blind destructive rage, is no more and no less than the outward face of a contempt for humanity that is always destructive in its effects.
Nothing can justify any kind of terrorism, and that is why it is our common task to fight against it.
Â Â  Mr President, this summerâs conflict has claimed the lives of over 1000 people, the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians.
It has reduced much of Lebanon to rubble.
If the situation teaches us nothing else, it must teach us to look forward, rather than back.
We should waste no time in deploying the 7000 troops that the Union has pledged to UNIFIL to stabilise the situation in southern Lebanon, to cut off the flow of arms and to support the humanitarian effort.
We must, however, clarify UNIFILâs mandate to turn the UN resolutions into reality on the ground.
And of course we must go further.
We must speak with one voice. We must, in the short term, demand the immediate lifting of Israelâs air and sea blockade of Lebanon.
We must demand the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and we must help to establish an effective Palestinian Government.
In the medium term, while condemning terrorist acts we must bring Hizbollah and Hamas in from the cold and engage them in a dialogue for the establishment of a democratic framework.
We must set up an independent inquiry into the civilian deaths caused by all sides in the recent conflict and, as Kofi Annan has pointed out, it will not be through the barrel of a gun, but thanks to dialogue and compromise that Hizbollah will put down their weapons and negotiate a long-term solution.
We have long-term tasks too.
If we are to raise a new generation that is not steeped in fear and intolerance, we must build institutions that will ensure peace in the long term.
When he was President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi talked about setting up a Euro-Arab development bank, jointly financed and managed by both sides.
We must look, too, at a security organisation along the lines of Mr Fogh Rasmussenâs proposed conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, which Mr Schulz has quoted.
We must look at how we can tie in, with a proper immigration policy, all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin.
And we must oversee all of this through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in which you, MrÂ President, have invested so much political â and no little financial â capital.
Let us learn from Einstein when he told us that peace cannot be kept by force, only achieved through understanding.
Mr Tuomioja, you spoke about the European Unionâs remarkable achievement and its major success.
I commend the work you have done, but let us not exaggerate.
It is a crisis that has driven the European Union to the position it is in, though something Michel Barnier has called the .
The Union does not have the European constitution that it needs and which would have equipped it far better to deal with this situation.
We are deploying European forces but this is not an EU force, even if â thank heavens â it is a coalition of the coherent.
In terms of democratic decision-making we are running on a wing and a prayer.
After your meeting in Lappeenranta on 25 August, Mr Solana said that this was the most important decision taken by the EU for many years.
If that is so, then why is MrÂ Solana not here, telling us about it and telling us about the conditions surrounding this conflict?
He has a mandate, but of what kind?
When we asked we were told that the rules of engagement for the forces were: âa matter strictly between the United Nations and the troop contributorsâ.
We were told, therefore, that this was not a European matter.
It is absurd that Mr Solana is not here to talk to us about the rules of engagement for this conflict!
The danger is this: the European public at large believe that Europe has responded to the crisis.
If things go wrong and we have large numbers of young men coming back home in body bags, people will want to know who in Europe is responsible.
Somebody will have to take the political responsibility.
Please, President-in-Office of the Council, get Europeâs common foreign and security policy together so that we are not faced with that kind of situation.
In conclusion, we should give two cheers for Europe: one for Louis Michelâs rapid action and one for Romano Prodiâs courage in coordinating our efforts to deal with this problem.
We should thank the Commission, the Finnish Presidency and Cyprus â a new Member State â for the tremendous help it has given.
We should also thank Turkey for having the courage to help us in committing troops.
However, we still run the risk of insistence on national sovereignty resulting in global anarchy.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ Tuomioja, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin with a self-criticism.
Who, within this Parliament, a year ago, asked about ResolutionÂ 1552?
Who, within this Parliament, asked about the disarmament of Hezbollah?
We need to discuss this problem because it is currently at the heart of the debates in Israel.
For three years, the Israeli Government has not said or done a thing about the disarmament of Hezbollah.
We have all been blind and we ought at least to recognise that we too were mistaken.
It should be noted, firstly, that we had, that the international community had, a UN resolution.
Once adopted, that resolution disappeared into the nirvana of politics without ever being applied on the ground.
Secondly â and this is a real problem â that region, which is a target for all kinds of misfortune, is also a region in which the most political mistakes can be made.
Mistakes are made because people think that they have to be the ambassador of Israel or of Palestine.
What is the European Union's role now?
Certain people within the Union are very attached to Israel â I understand that, and it is justifiable.
Others are very attached to the Palestinians â I understand that, and it is justifiable.
Yet, being in politics does not come down to that; on the contrary, everything must be done to ensure that there is finally a Palestinian State and an Israeli State in which people can live safely.
In order to be in politics, one does not have to be a kind soul or Mother Teresa, one has to be able to succeed in making that region change politically.
That is the problem.
It is for this reason that the European Union is sending troops into the region.
MrÂ Watson is right.
Some European Union Member States are sending troops.
I woke up one morning having dreamt something.
During a meeting, all of the Heads of State or Government had decided that the European contingent would be the largest in number, that it would be the Europeansâ rapid reaction force, that it would no longer be three quarters French, two thirds Italian or a quarter German, but that it would consist of Europeans who, as such, were going to represent Europe in that region.
I know that that is a dream, I know that I am being childish, but why not dream such things?
Insofar as we are bound to fulfil our obligations, MrÂ Fischer recently wrote in an article, âWelcome to the real worldâ: Yes, we are living in the real world; from now on, we have to act politically in that region.
Well, the reality is that the Americans present in the region are in Iraq, where they are stuck; they have no political presence.
No organisation, apart from the European Union, has the ability to change things and to work alongside the Israelis in examining how the Palestinian issue should be negotiated.
Peace will only reign in Israel if there is a Palestinian State that is fit to live in.
The best way in which to combat Hamas is to do so by means of the Palestinian State, because Hamas does not give a damn about the Palestinian State.
It wants an Islamic area!
That is why it is important to stress, firstly, that, if we establish a Palestinian State, then we will weaken Hamasâ influence.
Secondly, we need to settle the problem concerning the borders with Syria and the Golan.
Israel must be guaranteed a water supply and it must be guaranteed protection, but protection that does not mean Israelâs occupying the Golan.
The European Union must use its influence in order to get negotiations under way.
At a time when the European Union is now managing to play a major political role, we will be responsible not only for hardship and failure, but also, in political terms, for a region in which peace is prevailing.
When our children ask us what purpose Europe serves, we will be able to proudly reply: âLook at what we are doing in the Middle Eastâ.
To do that, however, we need to achieve that objective.
We must have the courage to say to all of these governments that it is not Italy â even though Italy has been admirable â that it is not France, and that it is not the United Kingdom, but that it is Europe as a whole that has been effective.
To conclude, I should like to draw your attention to a debate concerning Germany.
I have had enough of these political groups!
MrÂ Watson, as a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, is telling the German ALDE members that it is outrageous that they are rejecting the sending of the task force to the Middle East.
And you, MrÂ Wurtz, are telling the German Communists that what they are in the process of doing is outrageous, that it is a bartering style of politics, when human beings are dying in the Middle East and when the whole world wants to establish this task force.
Have courage as politicians and take action within your political camps!
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ Tuomioja, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, what we have experienced this summer ought to be totally and utterly inconceivable in our time.
Let us recall, firstly, that a State, Israel, is shelling and starving the civilian population of Gaza, is kidnapping ministers and politicians, who are going to join the 8Â 000 Palestinian prisoners already in detention, and has killed more than 200 people in this small region, which has become, according to the expression used by MrÂ Jan Egeland, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, a ticking time-bomb.
Then, the same army has been pounding Lebanon for a full 34 days, making no distinction, according to Human Rights Watch, between civilians and military targets, causing the deaths of 1Â 100 civilians, forcing a quarter of the population to move, imposing a total blockade of the country, deliberately targeting â as MrÂ Annan pointed out â and killing observers from the international peacekeeping force, destroying â according to the UNDP â 15Â 000 houses and 78 bridges, demolishing the countryâs vital infrastructure, ports, airports and power stations, causing a huge oil slick, and using shells that can contain as many as 644 explosive devices, with 100Â 000 of these devices continuing to blindly kill men, women and children.
Secondly, a superpower, the United States, is supporting its allyâs strategy, both in Palestine and Lebanon, in the name of the war against terrorism, which is already underway in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Its Secretary of State compares the suffering of the people of Lebanon to the pain of giving birth to the new Middle East.
In the midst of war, she is delivering increasingly sophisticated weapons to Israel and has been refusing, for more than a month of relentless fighting, to call for a ceasefire, something that the Lebanese Government and the United Nations Secretary-General have nonetheless been passionately calling for.
My third and final point is that an institution that is particularly close to us, the Council, has long proved itself incapable of calling for a ceasefire despite the commendable attempt made by the Finnish Presidency and the unanimous appeal launched along these lines by Parliamentâs Conference of Presidents.
The Council is even finding excuses for the Israeli armyâs behaviour by speaking of the right to self-defence.
Just as it was legitimate to condemn the initial capture of the Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, then above all the latterâs serious decision to respond to the bombing of Lebanese towns by launching missiles on Israeli towns, thus in turn committing crimes against the civilian population, the green light that has been given to Israel for many days now to carry out and pursue this terrifying war is leaving people amazed and is fuelling revolt.
We therefore cannot be content today and in the period to come with only talking about European contributions to UNIFIL and to the reconstruction process, as important as these two issues are.
By adopting a clear-sighted approach and in a spirit of responsibility, we must learn lessons from this painful experience, beginning with the following: at the heart of all the upheavals in the Middle East, which are becoming more tragic for the populations and more dangerous for international security as each day passes, there is the occupation of the territories that were conquered in 1967 and Israelâs persistent refusal to see the relevant United Nationsâ Security Council resolutions applied.
The fact is that the European Union has taken the pressure off with regard to this crucial requirement for peace.
What initiative has it taken to relaunch the Quartetâs road map?
What did it do to promote the Arab Leagueâs plan in 2002, which was proposing the normalisation of relations with Israel in exchange for recognition of the Palestinian State?
What has it done to make the Israeli leaders face up to their historical responsibilities?
Instead of doing anything in those areas, it has suspended aid to the Palestinian institutions, delegitimised a democratically-elected government and parliament, shunned the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to rebuild a national accord and accepted without any difficulty the closure of the only crossing points between Gaza and the outside, which it was officially controlling.
I hope that the joint decisions taken over the last few days will signal a turnaround for Europe with regard to the entire Middle East.
At present, Europe must make the long-term choice between President Bushâs notion of the war against terrorism and a return to the fundamentals of international law.
I believe that a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East comes at that price, as does Europeâs credibility in the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, what a lot of inaccuracies and intellectual dishonesty has been printed in a good many columns on the Middle East crisis in August and uttered by a great many politicians!
The attacker has often been confused with the attacked, and the real motivation behind the provocation unleashed by Hizbollah, with its launching of missiles against Israel and kidnapping of two of their soldiers, has hardly ever been spelt out.
It is in fact the same goal that the President of Iran has declared more than once: âto wipe Israel off the mapâ.
If that is the aim of certain governments and of the terrorist fundamentalism that they maintain, we need to have the courage and the loyalty to say that Europeâs primary task is to support and defend the existence of the State of Israel and its people and to demand its recognition by those who still refuse to grant it out of short-sighted folly.
It is only on these conditions and by returning to the roadmap that we shall be able to have a Palestinian State that is itself recognised, free and safe, as well as peace in the Middle East.
These are the objectives that we must achieve by means of every possible effort and consensus.
They are very different from Hizbollahâs objectives, which are to destroy a democratic state that is recognised by the international community and a member of the United Nations.
Hizbollah is a religious ideological movement represented in the parliament of a neighbouring state, albeit by a minority, but it also has an armed autonomous wing outside the state structure that is supplied with arms and money by two other states in the region, both of which have the destruction of Israel as their primary aim.
How can we maintain equally close relations with these two sides, which are so opposed and different in their objectives?
One side is defending its legitimate survival as a democratic state, while the other is the armed wing of the fight against democracy and the West!
We support the UNIFIL force, which must do everything it can to guarantee disarmament and to support the legitimate Lebanese Government, in the hope that the Lebanese authorities will no longer adopt their ambiguous positions of recent weeks.
UNIFILâs only interlocutors must be the Israeli and Lebanese Governments.
The European Union, which is at last acting in unison, must enforce the UN resolutions and commit all its efforts to providing humanitarian aid, restarting the talks and promoting a culture of mutual respect.
I still believe that, if Israel were part of the European Union, peace in the Middle East would be assured to a greater extent.
Here and now I reiterate my call for the Council to declare that the embassies of EU countries throughout the world will from now on recognise Israeli citizens as European citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, there are reports in the German press today of serious objections being expressed within the to the conditions that the Lebanese Government has prescribed with regard to foreign aid to protect its 225 km-long stretch of coastline from illegal arms transports.
Beirut apparently wants to keep tabs on a strip of six sea miles from the coast, and naval troops from various EU Member States, including my country, the Netherlands, are invited to monitor the area outside of this strip.
The President of the regards these conditions as unacceptable, and so do I, for which EU Member State navy would wish to stand by helplessly while Hezbollah is being re-armed?
The decision on this specific mandate now lies with the United Nations in any case.
I should like to hear from this Council and Commission what the UN, and its Secretary-General MrÂ Annan, intends to do about this, and what their attitude is in this respect, what their position is on this controversial issue, because this has, after all, a direct impact on Europe's involvement in the stabilisation of the situation around Lebanon.
It is in any event significant that even the two Hezbollah representatives in the Lebanese Government have voted against this dangerous compromise proposal.
It is therefore only logical that Israel should, for the time being, maintain its sea blockade against Lebanon.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for the European Unionâs initiative in the Lebanese situation, which means that we are once again playing a central role in Middle Eastern affairs in a way that we have not seen for a long time, and, of course, it also coincides with the failure of the unilateral initiatives adopted by others.


Everything will depend on the outcome, however, and we have to realise that the military mission and aid for reconstruction are not the finishing line but the starting point, not an end but a means and, it must be said, a means that is liable to be totally inadequate if it is not quickly and promptly backed up with a political and diplomatic initiative aimed at restarting the talks between the two sides.
Our debate here in Parliament should focus above all on that: the context will be the United Nations Security Council, but the initiative must inevitably come from here, from Europe, the European Union, in liaison with the United States and with the Arab League, but the central initiative being ours.
We must debate the implications that such an initiative may have.
The experience of recent years and months has shown that unilateralism by itself leads nowhere, that the attempt to solve the problems of the Middle East piece by piece leads nowhere.
We need to go beyond the roadmap, beyond the specific individual Security Council resolutions on Iraq or Lebanon, and realise that the time is ripe right now for an all-encompassing approach that can somehow get all the countries involved in the region to sit down around a table for formal talks on all the unresolved issues, crisis points or areas of cooperation.
We in Europe ought to know something about that because, 30 years ago in Helsinki, we succeeded in laying the foundations for that transformation that then astounded the world a few years later.
A solution of that kind would be a solution for everyone: for the United States, which would get out of a tight corner; for Israel, which would escape from the unilateralism in which it is trapped; for the Arab League; and most of all for us, for Europe, because in that way we could revitalise the Barcelona process and Europeâs own situation at the same time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when during the vacation I watched the news, I felt powerless when I saw the human suffering that went on every day.
We do not need to be powerless, however: we can do quite a lot.
This is a real opportunity, as many here today have said.
The EU has taken some important steps, and one of these was the fact that during the crisis we were able to find consensus â one voice.
This âone voiceâ will be an important factor if we want to have a major international role in international policy in the future.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Finnish Foreign Minister Tuomioja, and to acknowledge the role he has played, because his experience and expertise have played an important role in finding this âone voiceâ.
In the future, we should be a powerful political actor, and we should not be content with a role in which we are just paymasters dealing with post-war destruction.
We need to be actively involved in a vital political process to help try and establish permanent peace in the Middle East region.
Mr President, I am convinced that we will gain fairly unanimous support for this broadly-based conference.
This will be vital for achieving a lasting peace in the region.
It is quite clear, as Minister Tuomioja has said, that the conference should not be held immediately, as it will take time for the parties to be prepared for it.
Now, however, we need the courage and determination to seize this opportunity to genuinely bring lasting peace to the region.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, the fact that we have succeeded in obtaining a ceasefire is already an important result in a war that, in just a few weeks, has caused a great many deaths, destroyed infrastructure and the environment, and was threatening to engulf the whole region.
This initial result is the outcome of a European initiative in close cooperation with the United Nations.
Allow me to mention the active role played by my own country, Italy, and also by the Finnish Presidency and by France, which is to lead UNIFIL during this phase.
The challenge, however, remains much more arduous and requires the whole of Europe to make not just a military effort, but a political and diplomatic one.
For the first time, Europe could demonstrate a united political will and the determination to play a constructive role in the Mediterranean and Middle East by equipping itself with the appropriate tools.
It is a question of supporting Lebanon in the difficult process of independence and sovereignty, helping it to continue along the democratic path that raised so much hope during the âBeirut springâ.
The Lebanese army has to regain control of the whole country, including the south, and it has to exercise a monopoly on military strength to the exclusion of Hizbollah, which in recent times has become a parallel power.
Such an outcome requires everyone to take responsibility, starting with Syria, which has a role in the region, while Israel must be persuaded to abandon the idea of the indiscriminate use of force, because that is not a path that can guarantee its security.
It has already been said that the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the Middle East situation.
Europeâs task is to fully accept the responsibility that all the parties in the conflict now attribute to it: to support the Palestiniansâ difficult internal process of forming a new government that will enable them to come out of isolation and win back the resources that Israel must return to them.
It could be the beginning of a new climate of relations between the two sides, but first of all the spiral of violence needs to stop.
The years of experience that we have acquired show that the two sides cannot do it alone: the international communityâs presence is essential, and so we could deploy the peacekeeping troops that are in Lebanon today to Gaza and the West Bank tomorrow.
It could be a first step towards restoring that agreement, in the run-up to an international conference that may lead to a stable, lasting solution for the entire area, as the President-in-Office mentioned.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon will be strengthened, and the European Union will play an important part in it.
We are right to be pleased about this.
We must also be aware that, in order to be useful in such a difficult situation, the troops deployed will have to be respected, and, in order for that to happen, they will have to be strong, that is to say, they will need to have the resources appropriate to their mission and to have the right and the duty to implement them not only in the case of self-defence, that is to say, when their own soldiers are in danger, but also when the spirit or the letter of the mission may demand it.
We learnt this lesson in the Balkans, with tragic effect.
We must never forget it.
Nor must we forget what all the peacemakers in Lebanon, as in the whole of the Middle East, are waiting for: it is not the UN, which has been present for too long and which has been rendered powerless for too long, it is not France on its own, it is not Italy, it is the European Union.
You rightly said so, MrÂ Tuomioja.
I bear witness, in this regard, to the effectiveness of the action that has been carried out for weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo by the European force that was deployed there to support the UNâs action.
Without its presence, I believe that I can say â as you know, Commissioner â that Kinshasa would now be torn apart.
That is why I am calling on the Council and the Commission to check whether the European forces that are to be deployed in Lebanon could not be organised in a similar way, thus enabling the European Union to do what is expected of it, namely to exercise its own responsibility.
Thus, if we are not merely indecisive, then why, for example, do we not immediately deploy a European fleet off the Lebanese coast?
Euromarfor would give us the means to do this.
No, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, you are not a childish dreamer, and if you are, then I am even more of a child and more of a dreamer than you.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Middle East crisis may teach Europe a very tough lesson, a lesson resulting from disaster, which will force us out of our European crisis.
This contact with the real world of the Middle East through our leadership of a multinational force is very important; it demonstrates that the European Union is no longer just a glorified NGO providing humanitarian aid in the Middle East, but that it has a political commitment to the region.
That is very important, because it represents a genuine strategic commitment to the Middle East, where peace is fundamental to Europeâs security.
There is no question that, with the courage of countries such as France, Italy and Spain, the future of Europeâs foreign policy in the world is going to be at stake, and to a certain degree, the future of the European crisis will depend on that.
It is clear that the unilateralism of the United States has been entirely discredited throughout the Arab world and throughout most of the world in general.
Lebanon could be a successful test of a form of international intervention that would guarantee peace in Gaza and the West Bank and a peace agreement.
We welcome the Commission and the Councilâs position on the Palestinian government of national unity and its pragmatic reaction, and at the same time we are concerned about what is happening on the ground: the maintenance of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the announcement the day before yesterday that 700 new homes are to be built in those territories, which goes against the roadmap.
Â Â  â If there has been a shift in Europeâs position, it is because a people has managed to resist.
My respect and admiration goes out to Lebanon.
ResolutionÂ 1701 arrived late and failed to make a distinction between the aggressor and the victim, but it did achieve a cease-fire and is providing an opportunity for peace.
The UN mission is purely and simply the right way forward.
Reconstruction must be supported, it must be made difficult to restart the war and time must be allowed for dialogue among the Lebanese, because this is the only way in which the problems of defending the country will be resolved.
There are other priorities, too.
The European blockade in Palestine sent out the wrong message to Washington and to TelÂ Aviv and is punishing an entire people for believing in democracy.
In Tehran, ultimatums and threats only serve to speed up the nuclear arms race.
The time has come to relaunch peace in the Middle East.
Only the weapon of politics can beat the politics of weapons.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their contributions so far.
Obviously this most recent war has brought home to us the horrors of conflict and the toll that it takes on human populations and human infrastructure.
Rather than reinventing the wheel and coming up with new ideas, we should reinvigorate the whole idea of the roadmap that was agreed between the EU, the United Nations, the US and Russia.
That charted the way forward in terms of bringing about peace and stability not only between Israel and Palestine, but also amongst their neighbours, including Syria, Jordan, Iran, Egypt and Lebanon.
If we have seen anything over the last few months, it is the inability of the European Union to speak with a single voice; it is the failure by certain Member State governments within the European Union to agree with the majority of other Member States that has allowed this problem to continue and to get worse.
At least now, late in the day, we have agreed to head the UN peacekeeping force that is going to Lebanon.
However, now is a time for us to be braver, to look at new ideas and new ways of engagement.
If our own history in Europe has taught us anything, if our own experience of conflict resolution within the European Union or indeed in the wider world has taught us anything, it is that only through negotiation and dialogue can we actually achieve a lasting and just settlement.
There is now perhaps an opportunity for us to re-engage with the elected representatives of the Palestinian people â Hamas, with the Lebanese Government, with Israel and with the Governments of Syria and Iran to try to come forward with a deal.
With regard to the Middle East, the most important lesson for us of the last six months has been our failure to speak properly, with a single voice, and to give a clear message to all those countries â whatever they try â that if they do something wrong, action will be taken by the European Union against them.
By action I do not mean offensive action by the military, but with the strongest weapon we have, which is moral persuasion and the economic support that we give to those areas.
Commissioner and President-in-Office, now is the time to be brave.
Now is the time to chart the new way forward and to dust down the roadmap, invigorate it and make it new for the 21st century.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, since he has returned to the Chamber, I shall congratulate MrÂ Cohn-Bendit on his rather passionate speech, which we heard a moment ago.
At the risk of surprising and upsetting him, I agree with him on almost all points or, at any rate, on the main ones.
It is patently obvious: there is no solution other than a political one.
What is more, that political solution is possible, over and above the despair of the different sides, the despair of the extremists from both camps.
There is despair in Israeli politics right now, and the State of Israel needs to be protected from itself.
I believe that this âshow of strengthâ policy being conducted by Israel is an all or nothing policy that is jeopardising the countryâs long-term existence and worrying all those who want it to be secure, as we ourselves do.
We simply differ on two points: no, it is not Europe that will impose this political solution because not everyone in Europe wants it; it took more than three weeks â as you know, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit â for the Foreign Affairs ministers to meet after the start of the bombings, and that was to voice their disagreements.
Let us stop dreaming of a policy based on yet another European army, on a European navy, or on goodness knows what else.
We do not agree politically; there will therefore be no true European political choice as such, at least, not as long as we follow Washingtonâs policy â and that is the other point on which I differ from you â as it basically consists in promoting the extremes of both camps and in destroying the geopolitical balance in the region.
By destroying Iraq, by condemning Syria, by forcing Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, an act that weakens Lebanon â the Christians themselves realise this, including even MrÂ Aoun â we have created the conditions for an imbalance and we are still reaping the rewards of that imbalance, which is war, which is giving a voice to the extremists - from both camps, I might add, from the dominant and the dominated side.
Unfortunately, I believe that it is not Europe that can impose this political solution; I can see no political power other than France that can do so.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, woe betide the country in which an emphasis on minorities and ethnic communities prevails over the authority of the State, and woe betide disarmed States.
Lebanon, the poor martyr that it is, has just experienced misfortune once again, by providing the motive, albeit reluctantly, for a devastating and disproportionate intervention.
The right to self-defence and the right to take follow-up action do of course exist, but not the right to launch an all-out war without negotiating, without issuing an ultimatum, without declaring war and without first referring the matter to the Security Council.
I fear, too, that this operation will be counter-productive for Israel, which has not achieved its political objectives and which is now incurring the hostility of the entire Lebanese population.
MrÂ Tuomioja told us that there would be a cordial atmosphere at the meetings held among the European ministers; what a relief!
Those warm meetings did not, however, prevent the devastation of Lebanon.
We are being told today about a European peacekeeping force, but curiously enough, that force involves only seven out of twenty-five Member States.
Must I point out that there has been a peacekeeping force in Lebanon for 28 years now?
My country, France, has paid a heavy cost there, but that force was totally incapable of preventing the tragic events that we have experienced and, contrary to what the Commissioner told us, it was totally powerless in the recent tragedy and merely supplied a few extra targets for the Israeli bombs.
The settlement is based solely on the recognition of sovereign States with secure and recognised borders.
A free and independent Palestinian State is required, something that has not existed for decades â a state of affairs to which most of you seem pretty much resigned.
There can be no peace without that.
The State of Lebanon, which has recently been freed from Syriaâs control, must extend its authority over the whole of its territory.
It is only under those conditions that Israel will also be able to experience lasting peace.
Finally, as regards our fellow citizensâ helping in the reconstruction process, we are tired of paying to rebuild what others have demolished.
Let each side help repair the damage it has caused; the State of Lebanon for the damage caused by Hezbollah in Israel, and the State of Israel for the damage caused in Lebanon.
Let each side shoulder its responsibilities, the rule of law also hinges on that.
Â Â  â Whether one likes it or not, the EUâs time on the international stage has arrived.
We must first thank the Finnish Presidency, the Commissioner and the Commission for succeeding in this regard, or for at least enabling this to happen.
This is both an opportunity and a responsibility.
We need to be aware that all the ingredients are in place for something to go wrong.
The mandate is full of ambiguities, Hezbollah is not disarming, Israel continues to retaliate, there is a lack of security on the Israeli-Palestinian border and Syria and Iran cannot be relied upon.
Nevertheless, I feel that it was a good decision for us to take on these responsibilities.
As regards peace-keeping, we must also make sure that the mission is successful.
We must ensure there is no discord in the EU and must act quickly if the situation changes.
I feel that an informal cell made up of the Commission, the Council and Parliament might be helpful.
The most important thing, however, is to develop a parallel political framework.
The proposal of an international conference seems very appropriate, given that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon is an essential prerequisite, albeit insufficient on its own.
Lastly, we need to mobilise more human and financial resources because the process will take time.
We have a duty to ensure that our representatives will be successful.
This is our responsibility.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like, in this speech, to focus on the security of Israel and Europeâs interest in it, it being something that we, by reason of our history â terrible, tragic, and full of disasters as it has been â are under an obligation to defend.
What, though, is meant by security for Israel?
Firstly, Israel needs neighbours that are themselves secure, that can concentrate on their own economic and social development, that are not dependent on their neighbours, that are not themselves under occupation or suffering from blockades.
Lebanon, then, needs to be independent, not least from Syria, without military forces occupying it and not under threat of a blockade.
Secondly, if Israel is to be secure â which is the end we have in view â then there are UN resolutions that must be implemented, first among them the first UN resolution which, while bringing about the foundation of Israel, also envisaged the establishment of a Palestinian state.
If such a state is to exist and be independent, it follows that withdrawal from the occupied territories will be necessary.
Let me now quote the view expressed by Gideon Levy of the Israeli newspaper , who said, as do many other Israelis today, âThe cancer that threatens us more than any terrorism is the occupation of a foreign country and of its peopleâ, and so you, Mr President-in-Office, have been quite right to make it clear, as you have over recent days and weeks, that we have to get negotiations to a point where Israelâs long-term security is guaranteed.
As was shown by the last war in Lebanon, what we seek will be achieved neither by war and violence â which brings forth only more of the same â nor by unilateral withdrawal, particularly when not accompanied by a guarantee from the armed forces or a peace policy that there will be no more atrocities.
Negotiation means engaging in dialogue, and if people are to engage in dialogue with one another, they have to accord each other recognition, so we should not talk too much about conditions, particularly if they are one-sided.
We demand, and rightly, of Hamas that it should recognise Israel within the 1967 borders, but then we must also demand that Israel should accept those borders as well, or we can tell them, from the outset, to sit down and talk among themselves, taking as their starting point the relevant UN resolution, after which we can talk about corrections and so on.
That being so, there can be only one peace process â one that is based on negotiations.
Mr President-in-Office, I would like to correct you on one point, in that we are not going âback to a peace processâ, but rather, in fact, âforward to a peace processâ, since there has not yet been a peace process that was really effective and promised to be successful.
I would like to thank you both â Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office â for having, through what you have done and what you have said over the last few weeks, helped us to get a more realistic picture, so that Europe can now really begin to play a major part in setting in motion a lasting peace process of the kind that is needed for the security not only of Israel but also of the region as a whole.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in the Middle East has a direct effect on Europe, and it is unfortunate that it took a war to remind us of this fact, which has become the central focus of diplomatic efforts.
We all know that what the Middle East needs is a comprehensive political solution: two states, Israel and Palestine; peace in the region where the three countries Israel, Syria and Lebanon meet; assistance from non-radical Arab states; the pushing back of Iran and of its lackey Hizbollah.
We know what has to happen.
It is time to put the pieces of the puzzle together, because people are suffering from the violence.
I am very pleased that you, MrÂ Schulz, brought up the FDPâs idea for a CSCME (Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Middle East), as Kurt Beck has also already done.
You have our support in this, and it would be good if this were actually to come about.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher will be delighted by this.
Numerous Member States are involved in UNIFIL, the military operation in Lebanon, and units from them form the backbone of this force, but are, unfortunately, national units and not truly European ones.
This is not good, since we Liberals share in this dream of an ESDP, which MrÂ Cohn-Bendit so eloquently shared with us.
However, I want to say one thing, my dear Mr Cohn-Bendit: for a party which for a long time wanted to disband Germanyâs armed forces and leave NATO, I find it quite remarkable that you now attack poor Graham Watson just because the FDP has, after long discussion, adopted a well-founded position on this matter and for once is not in favour of it.
Someone in your position would be well advised to be a little more considerate.
If we had followed your security policy in those days, then MrÂ Onyskiewicz would not be President of this House today.
Just as it is clear that we can be grateful to the soldiers who will do their duty in this difficult region, it is also clear that we as politicians must finally create a Common Foreign and Security Policy, one which proves to be worthy of the name when things get really serious.
The difficulties in the Council have already been mentioned.
We need to rework existing structures, we need a genuine common decision-making process, in short: we need a big step forward, towards the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
This is what we must work towards; Europe has this responsibility and Europe must discharge it.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, eyes have understandably been on the slaughter in Lebanon.
However, we must not allow the world to forget the crimes that are being committed in Gaza, which has effectively been turned into a prison for Palestinians.
Let us not forget that since the end of June, over 200 Palestinians â at least 44 of them children â have been killed; nor forget that thousands more have been forced to flee their homes; nor forget that when we talk about the Israeli prisoners, who must indeed be freed, there are also 9Â 000 Palestinian prisoners who remain in Israeli prisons, over half of whom are detained without trial; nor forget that elected Hamas parliamentarians remain under arrest.
It is clear that no long-term peace in the Middle East is possible until we see an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
There has been much hand-wringing in this Chamber today, saying, âif only there were something more we could do as the EUâ.
We beg the Israeli authorities to unblock the Palestinian revenues that are being withheld; we plead with them to open the border crossings; we beg for an end to the air and sea blockade; we plead with them not to start building yet more illegal settlements; yet nothing really changes.
I believe that the time is long overdue to echo the recommendation of the heads of the EU mission in Jerusalem and call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the grounds of human rights abuses, as provided for by ArticleÂ 2 of that Agreement.
If we, as the EU, do not take ourselves and our agreements seriously, then we cannot be surprised if others do not either.
Madam Commissioner, you said our credibility is at stake.
Yes, it is.
As the EU, we have serious influence in the Middle East and we should be using it to greater effect.
Â Â  â Mr President, the invasion by Israel and the flattening of southern Lebanon, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom received the hospitality of the people of Cyprus, the massacre of victims, all this proves the failure of the doctrine of the so-called war against terrorism.
It shows that they mean the technical construction of the new Middle East which the peoples of the region reject and both these objectives are based on the power of weapons and the infringement of international law.
The slaughter in the region will only stop if the policy of violence on the part of the strong is replaced by fair peaceful dialogue with full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, especially in Palestine and more especially in Gaza, where 70% of the people are hungry and suffering.
The European Union also bears serious responsibilities.
President Abbas and efforts to form a government of national unity must be given political support.
The Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians must be released, the economic isolation of the occupied territories must be lifted immediately and talks must resume.
Nor must we forget that the core problem is the Palestinian question and whether we want lasting peace in the region.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the resolute language heard here confirms the fact that it is necessary to make CFSP decision-making more effective.
The resolution here, which we are to adopt, contains many good points, including the requirement concerning the disarmament of Hizbollah.
It is strange, however, that this organisation is not on the European Union list of terrorist organisations. That list includes Iranâs opposition movement, the Mujahedin, which we have on several occasions asked to be removed, without success.
Why is Hizbollah not included on the list of terrorists?
Is it because Hizbollah is represented in Lebanonâs government?
Is the provocation of this conflict, involving huge losses, not a reason for speaking openly about these issues?
I would like to call on those who are currently responsible for Europeâs leadership not only to devote their energies to the ability to focus resources on reconstruction work and the deployment of peace forces, but also to offer accurate, solid and honest responses concerning the reasons for the conflict.
Â Â  Mr President, we have heard several times during this debate of the need for a negotiated settlement and a peace process.
But with whom do we negotiate and on what basis?
The war in Lebanon was caused by Hizbollah kidnapping Israeli soldiers which, unsurprisingly, triggered retaliation by the Israelis and the escalating conflict we have witnessed.
The leader of Hizbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said that he would not have ordered the troopsâ capture and kidnapping if he had known that it would lead to full-scale war.
What did he expect?
Those are not the words of a political leader but of a political gangster and terrorist.
He ordered the kidnappings because he thought he might get away with it.
He did not, but he got a war that he could blame on the Israelis anyway.
The Palestinians have elected a terrorist government under Hamas and the Lebanese have two Hizbollah terrorist representatives in their government.
These decisions have consequences for the Palestinians and the Lebanese, as we have seen.
How does the European Union react to this?
By sending the protagonists more money: EUR 435Â million so far this year to Palestine and EUR 42 million to Lebanon.
We should let the Hamas and Hizbollah ministers in question renounce their intentions to drive the Israelis into the sea before we consider sending their governments aid.
Otherwise such payments amount to nothing more than financing terrorism.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the message given out when a foreign minister of a founding Member State of the European Union â the foreign minister of my country â walks arm in arm with a top-ranking Hizbollah representative is not a positive message for Europe to send out to its citizens, to people who seriously want peace and want to help solve the dire problems in which that area is floundering, particularly a tormented country like poor Lebanon.
France has the unquestionable merit of having laid the most important issue on the table right from the start, by calling for the UN mandate to include an embargo on arms entering Lebanon across any of its borders, primarily from Syria.
In that respect, however, even after Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnerâs speech â although I appreciate the fact that she was very clear that Lebanon needs and has the right to go back to being independent and thus not dependent on Syria â we should be critical of the fact that she did not address such basic issues at all clearly.
We want to know, and Europe needs to know, what this force is supposed to do, what its duties are and what resources we shall have.
If anyone says, for instance, that disarming Hizbollah means transferring these noble guerrillas to the Lebanese army, we shall reply that that is not the solution to the problem and, above all, it does not correspond to the objectives that Europe, and with it the Member States taking part in UNIFIL, should be pursuing.
Furthermore, many military experts point to the dangers of intervening without a mandate that has been accurately and properly drawn up.
On this fundamental point we need to have the courage to speak out plainly and to demand suitable guarantees â this is something that Europe must do â because our soldiers are out there and it is, of course, Europeâs role.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Europe was needed, and it was the nation states that went in at the stumble, albeit in the right direction.
This is further evidence that the present structure is getting us nowhere, and it is further evidence that without the Constitution we cannot fulfil our duties to our citizens, because we lack the appropriate structures.
Moving on to the matter in hand, what we are dealing with here is a dispute that must surely be seen in the context of the wider conflict in the Middle East.
I can see that there is conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, but Hizbollah is not the affected party; the Sheba farms are just a token.
What we are dealing with here is a group not directly concerned in the conflict which, spurred on and supported by Iran and Syria, carries out attacks intended to destroy the State of Israel.
If we want to arrive at a fair assessment of the situation, we must be clear in our own minds that this is how it started.
Of course it is possible to debate about whether Israelâs reaction to the current situation was exaggerated.
I believe it was, but in my opinion we must not forget the basic situation.
For this reason there must now be clear commitments from Syria and Iran not to supply any more weapons.
It must be made clear that until now Hizbollah has resisted ResolutionÂ 1559, and that militias must not be allowed to have weapons.
The sovereignty of Lebanon can only be achieved if the government alone has a monopoly on the use of force in its own country and if Hizbollah is not allowed to have weapons.
For this reason there must also be a clear mandate.
I understand that nobody today has the power to disarm Hizbollah immediately, but all this beating about the bush â for instance, this current debate about whether inspections at sea should be carried out within the seven mile zone and suchlike - makes me suspect that they are trying continually to create new loopholes in order to make a new rearmament possible, which could then lead us once again into a war.
This UNIFIL force must have more opportunities to achieve better results, so that 15Â 000 men are not reduced to the position of bystanders in the same way that 2Â 000 soldiers have been until now, who have seen where things have been hidden but who have been unable to do anything against this concealing of weapons.
It is obvious that this must happen in cooperation with the Lebanese Government, but we must face up to this situation clearly.
We must therefore genuinely demand â not just using phrases of superficial compromise - the implementation of resolutions 1701 and 1559. This is surely the relevant point if we are to restore peace in an essential region, a peace that gives us a better chance of tackling the real problems of the Middle Eastern conflict.
I think it is at last high time that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and that it occupies the area with the greatest possible number of Quartet troops in order to ensure that its written demands are carried out.
Only together can they offer the necessary credibility to back up guarantees of security and to assist in constructing both a secure State of Israel and a viable Palestinian State.
No one can achieve this alone; it can only happen if we work together, and this must happen.
We must return to a type of Madrid Conference in order to find a new beginning for the region.
I also hope that the terror ceases in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, that President Abbas finds a way to stop it, and that the Israeli actions are halted at the same time.
Israel must recognise that its own existence depends upon there being peace now that new weapons with a longer range are available.
The situation has changed: this is what we have learned from the conflict in Lebanon.
I hope that this is recognised in Jerusalem and that it is recognised in Ramallah.
