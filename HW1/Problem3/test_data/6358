The Belgian Presidency has probably been the best presidency I have witnessed in the 18 years I have been a Member of this House.
It is making an impact with the citizens.
My question does not just refer to the Mobotu funds that are spread throughout Europe and lying dormant in banks or are perhaps being used by undesirable types.
It also deals with the law in Belgium which apparently allows the arrest of people suspected of war crimes.
There was the recent case of the Israeli Prime Minister being threatened with legal action.
My question also relates to the historical responsibility of the European Union, including the presidency, for colonialism and for the atrocities committed in various states.
For instance, would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu, which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo?
I would like to tell the honourable Member that, when I told him his questions concerned matters not within the competence of the Council, I was referring to his questions as a whole.
Questions concerning the Belgian government should be addressed to the latter.
I am here to represent the Presidency of the Council of the entire European Union, as you very well know.
(Protests from Mr Andrews)
The reply of the President-in-Office is clear.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor if you wish.
That is rather a personal point.
I am not afraid to answer but this morning Minister Michel was here.
He spoke at length about the way the Durban Conference went.
If you had questions about your and my and other people's colonial past, then that was the moment to ask them, to make your remarks and to formulate your criticisms.
Question No 11 by (H-0720/01):
Subject: Freedom of movement for EU citizens and legality of the Italian government's actions In the wake of the discussions on the incidents which took place before and after the G8 Summit in Genoa, some questions remain as to how the Council characterises and assesses the Italian government's actions from a strictly legal point of view.
The Italian government suspended the Schengen Agreement.
Does the Council believe that this suspension was sufficiently justified and complied with the provisions of the Schengen Agreement itself?
If the Schengen Agreement has been suspended, what legal regime applies, in the Council's view, with regard to travel by citizens of EU Member States to another Member State which has suspended application of the Schengen Agreement?
Do the provisions of the EU Treaty concerning freedom of movement also cease to apply?
In other words, does the Italian government have the right to ban hundreds of Greek citizens who travelled to Italy (in order to demonstrate in Genoa) from disembarking from their ship at the port of Ancona without even checking their passports and without any explanation?
Question No 12 by (H-0724/01):
Subject: Registration in the SIS Large-scale demonstrations and major clashes between certain groups of demonstrators and the police occurred in connection with the European Council meeting in Gothenburg and the G8 meeting in Genoa.
In both Gothenburg and Genoa, the police used excessive force and abusive tactics, including assaults on and the arbitrary arrest and improper treatment of non-violent demonstrators.
Most of those arrested during the two demonstrations have since not been charged with any offence.
Can the Council guarantee that demonstrators who were arrested and identified, but are not suspected of any criminal offence, will not be registered in the SIS?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Messrs Papayannakis and SjÃ¶stedt concern, on the one hand, the conditions surrounding the reinstatement of internal border controls in a Member State which applies the Schengen acquis and, on the other hand, the conditions for the entry of an alert in the 'Schengen Information System' in relation to the events at the G8 meeting in Genoa.
As regards the first point, this situation does not in fact correspond to what the two Members have referred to in their question as, and I quote, "an abolition of the validity of the Schengen Convention" .
The reinstatement of border controls is a measure which is explicitly laid down in Article 2 item 2 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.
And this article, along with the method of applying this article adopted in 1995 by the governments of those Member States applying the Schengen acquis, is part of the Schengen acquis, incorporated into European Union law.
The Italian authorities felt that public order or national security required that national border checks appropriate to the situation be carried out at internal borders for the duration of the G8 Summit in Genoa, more specifically from 14 to 21 July 2001.
This was admittedly an exceptional measure, but a measure that other Member States have used in the past during political or sporting events or during events which could have involved a threat to public order.
Turning now to the second point, I refer the two Members to the answer that we gave on the same subject at the June 2001 part-session, namely that the Council is not qualified to answer the question as to whether an alert was issued in the 'Schengen Information System' for certain individuals involved in these events.
Entry of an alert in the SIS actually falls within the competence of the Member States.
Let me point out that, according to Article 94 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and I quote: 'The Schengen Information System shall contain only the categories of data which are supplied by each of the Contracting Parties, as required for the purposes laid down in Articles 95 to 100.
The Contracting Party issuing an alert shall determine whether the case is important enough to warrant entry of the alert in the Schengen Information System.
Furthermore, Article 104 stipulates that, and I quote: 'Alerts shall be governed by the national law of the Contracting Party issuing the alert unless more stringent conditions are laid down in this Convention' .
Finally, may I remind Mr SjÃ¶stedt that the Schengen acquis was published in Official Gazette L 239 on 22 September 2000.
Mr President, I would like to speak in French, if I may, so that I can make myself understood more easily.
Thank you for your answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, and for the information that you gave.
I knew the details regarding the Schengen Agreement but it is useful to have confirmation of them.
My first point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that I am not talking about abolition.
Your translation services have made a mistake - I am talking about suspension.
This is a different concept altogether and this is the correct word.
I sincerely apologise for writing in Greek.
My second point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that you spoke of the reinstatement of checks.
In the case that I mention in my question, however, involving the 150 young people from Greece who were banned before they even left their ship in the port of Ancona, they did not undergo any checks at all.
That is why I put to you the following question - when the Schengen Agreement is suspended, which legal status is applicable?
I would guess that it is the status laid down generally by the treaty, in other words, free movement with passport control.
The passports of the Greek citizens were not checked, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
This, forgive me for saying so, is totally illegal, it is deplorable and what is more, this is a matter for the European courts.
And, in my view, it is a matter for you, the Council or the Commission.
Once again, Mr Papayannakis, I can only repeat what I said.
I apologise if there has been a mistake in translation.
You have rectified the situation.
As for your other points, I have taken note of the comments that you made and I shall pass these on.
I think it is incredibly serious that the Council of Ministers is unable to answer the question of whether people who are neither suspected of a crime nor have committed a crime are registered in the EU data system, SIS.
The issue is that of whether the SIS can fulfil the most fundamental requirements of the rule of law.
I nonetheless interpret the Council' s reply as indicating that it is possible for a Member State, unsupervised, to choose to place a person on the SIS register without the person in question being suspected of, or convicted of, a crime, but with him or her having simply taken part in a demonstration and been identified by the police.
This is entirely unacceptable in such cases and in breach of normal legal practice.
Perhaps you can confirm that if a state registers someone who has not committed a crime, then that person will remain on the SIS register, and it will be possible to obtain information about the fact when the person concerned passes external border controls and when an internal Schengen check is carried out.
The only thing I can confirm is that it is the responsibility of the Member States to enter personal data into the Schengen Information System.
Under the Convention they are obliged to see to it that the importance of the situation justifies any such input into the system.
This is, then, the responsibility of the Member States.
This is a genuine point of order, Mr President.
In her answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated that she has taken my question into account and that she will pass it on.
Does that mean that I will, at a later date, at some point receive a reply?
What I said was that we shall look into your questions in greater detail beforehand, and if it appears that they refer to matters that fall within the Council' s remit, we will be able to give you an answer.
If it appears, however, that one or more Member States are solely responsible for the issue as a whole, I shall be unable to give you an answer on behalf of the Council.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
The President-in-Office has replied and, depending on what happens, Mr Papayannakis will have the appropriate mechanisms to address the Council.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 13 and 14 will be taken together.
Question No 13 by (H-0721/01):
Subject: Priorities for the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children On 5 July 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the European Union's positions in the UNGA Special Session on Children, which is being held at the end of September.
In its resolution, Parliament called on the Council to report to it on EU efforts and priorities for the Special Session and on EU actions during the Special Session.
Where is that report?
In what way has the Council taken account of Parliament's call for support for the view that the family is the fundamental unit of society and that the theme of the Session 'A World Fit for Children' has to be at the same time 'A World Fit for Families'?
Question No 14 by (H-0722/01):
Subject: EU position on the UN World Summit for Children As it was voted on 5 July 2001, the resolution on the EU position for the UNGASS for Children states that 'the Family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children'. Can the Council inform us why the EU delegation at the UN promotes the term, 'the Family in its various forms' as the fundamental unit of society, and who agreed this re-interpretation since the July vote?
Also, in the light of the fact that the term 'reproductive health services' has been publicly defined at the UN as including abortion, can the Council explain why the EU delegation at the UN supports 'universally accessible health care and services, including sexual and reproductive health' and how this can be reconciled with the Council's answer of 14 March 2001 in which it states that 'on the specific issue of abortion, the Council recalls that national abortion legislation does not fall under Community competence'.
First of all, I would remind you that the European Union as such has no official status with, nor is it accredited to the United Nations.
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences and that they shall uphold the EU' s common positions.
The EU' s common positions, also on matters which concern the questions put by the honourable Members, are coordinated and agreed upon in the framework of the common foreign and security policy and require unanimity from all EU Member States.
As soon as an EU position has been adopted by the Member States, it is included in the negotiating process with other members of the United Nations community.
Since it is the international community' s wish to reach consensus on the draft documents for the United Nations Special Assembly on children, the respective positions and wordings pertaining to the draft documents are the subject of constant negotiation and adaptation with a view to reaching agreement on the draft action plan which might receive full UN backing.
In addition, reference is once again made to Article 152(5) of the Treaty which stipulates that "Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
With regard to the concepts 'family' and 'reproductive health care' , the Member States have drawn on the language that was agreed upon during several previous UN world conferences, namely those of Cairo, Beijing and Copenhagen.
The Special Session on Children has, as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States, been put on the back-burner.
The presidency will report to the European Parliament on the European Union' s efforts and priorities within the context of regular information on the development of the common foreign and security policy, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty.
However, I can inform you now that the European Union, during preparations of this special session, has expressed the resolve to do everything in its power to bring about a world which really pays attention to children.
Our actions in this field must be based on the International Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It remains the reference instrument par excellence.
The countries that have ratified the Convention - and I am referring to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child - must implement it in full, and those countries that have not yet ratified it, should do so as a matter of urgency.
The document that will be approved by the special General Assembly must be geared towards action and must pursue the following objectives.
First of all, we must invest in our children.
Forgive me for using an economic term.
A great deal of attention and care must be devoted to sound upbringing, one that is worthy of children, to their health, their well-being and their development, and resources must be set aside for that purpose.
In addition, children must be protected.
They must be protected from the effects of conflicts, abuse, violence and all forms of discrimination, exploitation, conscription into the armed forces, as well as from anti-personnel mines, epidemics and HIV/AIDS, in particular.
These are all scourges which affect them particularly cruelly.
Finally, children must also be heard, and they must be able to take part in the decisions that affect them.
Children must indeed be considered key figures in the mapping out of the course of their own development.
I would like to express my thanks for the reply, but I should nonetheless like to say that, in all the important comments made towards the end of your reply, you did not actually mention the family among those initiatives you emphasised as being in the best interests of the child.
Was this pure coincidence?
In Paragraph 1 of the European Parliament resolution of 5 July 2001 on the EU positions at the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children, we state the following: 'family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children' .
In other words, it says 'family' , not 'family in its various forms' .
How do you interpret the position of the European Parliament, and how do you value a mother and a father supporting their children in their development?
Why has the EU acted in a way which means that the concept of family has in fact been changed?
That is a very philosophical question, Mr SacrÃ©deus. I am not going to interpret what you have said, but that is the impression I have as President.
We must ask specific questions, but I accept your question and the President-in-Office will answer it.
If you wish to add anything, you have the floor.
That is your own assessment, Mr President.
You are Vice-President for me and all the other Members too.
I asked specific questions about the concept of family.
The last time I asked a question too, you also chose to believe that I was presenting philosophical questions and comments.
I asked the Belgian Presidency specific questions.
I request that you, as a competent Vice-President, show respect for all Members, including Swedish Christian Democrats.
I am assuming that this will be the last time you offend a Member in this way.
Philosophy and ethics are important issues even for you.
Mr SacrÃ©deus, I have enormous respect for all Members.
I have accepted your question.
But as legal administrator for this Question Time, sometimes I can and must express the opinion that they are very general.
Your question is in order and I have not criticised it at all.
I have said that it seems very general, but the President-in-Office will reply to it.
There is no problem.
Please be assured that the Christian Democrats warrant my absolute respect.
Mr President, if I may, I shall answer all three at the same time.
Two other Members also wanted to speak.
I can answer all three together, or do I have to answer each question individually?
We usually reply question by question.
Furthermore, for Mr SacrÃ©deus' s benefit, it is better that you reply to him directly.
Unless the interpreters have omitted some of what I said, which would surprise me, I think that I have given a general answer.
My personal views on the family are of no relevance at all to the debate that we are having.
I have the greatest respect for the family, but that has no relevance to the debate underway here.
The question is what is the position of Member States, since it is the Member States who must unanimously adopt and define their position regarding the work of the United Nations General Assembly on Children.
I have given you some information on this issue.
I stated that Member States are using the same terminology as that used at the United Nations global conferences, in other words at the conferences in Cairo, Peking and Copenhagen.
This is a political indication of the way in which Member States are working to define a unanimous position concerning the United Nations conference on Children.
I thank the President-in-Office for her answer.
It took a great deal of time to establish how Parliament's position would be presented at the UN Special Session.
A general meeting was held where candidate countries and, indeed, the Commissioner were present.
He made the very concrete statement that the child cannot be dealt with in isolation but in the context of the family and community.
We took a general vote and there was an overwhelming desire to make a special reference to the child in the context of the family.
We then debated a proposed position for Parliament, which was voted on in this Chamber.
It is our responsibility therefore to ensure that the wishes, not just of Parliament but also of the candidate countries who had travelled here and of the Member State representatives who came, concerning the position on the family are accurately presented, otherwise our time has been wasted.
As the UN definition of reproductive health services is so much in conflict with our position as stated in the Treaties - in particular with the protocol of my country - does the Council intend to challenge this publicly stated definition or to change the definition of reproductive health services within the institutions of the EU?
Whatever our personal feelings on this or other subjects, we need to work within the existing legal frameworks.
I started my answer by reminding you that the European Union as such is not a member of the United Nations and enjoys no special status in its relations with the United Nations.
I reminded you further that the Member States have undertaken to coordinate their positions in the international organisations of which they are members or the international fora in which they act or participate.
This is the legal framework in which such conferences are prepared.
Thus the European Parliament resolution is certainly of interest to the different Member States, but cannot possibly - with all due respect - be considered binding on them.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you gave the issue of public health a special mention.
I would be interested to know how you see the division of responsibilities between the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.
What are your priorities here?
I apologise for not being able to speak German well enough to be able to give you an answer in German, especially using specialised vocabulary, but I do understand it.
The questions regarding the structure of the various international - even world-wide - institutions are all very interesting, but will lead us nowhere.
Moreover, the Council, as it stands, has no position on this subject that I could communicate to you on its behalf.
I can express my personal views, which may be of interest to you, but they will not make the slightest difference because they do not convey the position of the Council.
My personal view is that it is high time for all the international institutions, wherever they are based, to cooperate more closely and to coordinate their respective policies more effectively than they have done so far.
I am not going to make any judgment. I am simply going to ask you, when you have time, to reread Annex II (point A: Guidelines) in relation to the procedure for Question Time laid down in Rule 43.
Simply that: we should all read it when we have time.
Question No 16 by (H-0727/01):
Subject: Further judgments of the European Court of Human Rights against Turkey in the case of Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament Ruling on 17 July 2001 in cases 29900/96 - 29903/96, the European Court of Human Rights fined Turkey 110 000 dollars for continuing to detain the Sacharov prize-winner Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament in Turkish prisons.
In view of the fact that Turkey systematically ignores the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, can the Council provide evidence that Turkey intends to comply with the above judgments of the Court?
Can the Council provide a list of ECHR judgments which Turkey continues to ignore?
What measures does it intend to take?
The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that the judgments quoted by him have been passed by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
In other words, the Court established by the Council of Europe and not by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg.
At the moment, the European Union has no specific reason to believe that Turkey will not be falling in with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in this instance.
On a wider scale, neither does the European Union have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights with which Turkey is said to have failed to conform.
The Council of the European Union would remind you that it has no authority whatsoever to implement the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.
However, on behalf of the Council, I would like to emphasise that the Union, particularly within the framework of the strengthened dialogue with Turkey, seizes every opportunity to stress the obligation resting on that country to observe all international agreements it has entered into; particularly in the field of human rights, obviously including the decisions by the European Court of Human Rights.
Within the framework of the partnership for the accession of Turkey, the European Union has stipulated that Turkey must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee that it will ensure that these are also translated into practice.
The Council will follow Turkey' s progress from close range once the Commission has submitted its report on this matter.
I can therefore only reiterate that the Council does not have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which are said to have been ignored by Turkey.
I understand how tired the representative of the Council must be, she has been here since this morning, she has intervened on numerous issues, and I can only ascribe her disdain for the European Court of Human Rights to that.
Why else would a representative of the Council of Ministers of the European Union say that we have no knowledge of the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, especially here in Strasbourg?
It is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!
Besides, the European Parliament, in its recent resolutions on Turkey, has called on Turkey, among other things, to respect the rulings and to obey the rulings of the European Court.
But that is by the by.
My question concerns Leyla Zanna.
A Sacharov prizewinner, one of us.
You are a member of the Belgian Parliament.
She is a member of the Turkish national assembly.
She is a woman, she is your age and she is in prison. Can we just ignore this issue in a candidate country, is this our response?
Perhaps simultaneous interpretation problems are to blame here.
I did not say that we do not have the list of European Court rulings; I said that we do not have a list of the rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe.
That is what I said, and it is different.
I was in the former Chamber when the prize was awarded to Mrs Zana and as a Member of this Parliament I associated myself with many of the positions taken by this Parliament in respect of Turkey.
You are well aware that the Council's position on Turkey is very clear.
We have made that position clear to Turkey repeatedly and will continue to do so.
The Minister has pointed out that this is a court of the Council of Europe, not a court of the European Union.
However, we are all well aware of the relations between the European Parliament and the supreme court of the Council of Europe.
Secondly, she said, and she repeated, that she does not have a list of the Court rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe.
Apart from the rulings on Leyla Zana and the other three Members of Parliament in prison, there is the famous ruling on Titina Loizidou, the Greek Cypriot still waiting for Turkey to pay the compensation awarded to her in a ruling by the supreme court, which Turkey has provocatively said it has no intention of observing.
I repeat I am surprised because the Minister has served as a Member of the European Parliament and as a member of her national parliament and she should at least have thought about it and if she did not have a list, she had all the time in the world to ask for one rather than coming here today, if I may say so, without having done her homework.
I sometimes wonder whether the tone adopted by some of the Members has anything to do with my sex, age or something else.
I have been very clear in my answers.
There is a distinction between the Court of Human Rights and our own Court of Justice in Luxembourg, as you very well know.
We hold Turkey to its responsibility of respecting all the international obligations that country has undertaken and among them, of course, is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights.
This is one of the permanent elements of the political dialogue we are having with Turkey.
We are doing our homework.
It might not always produce the results that you would like to see or produce them as quickly as you would like, but we are doing our homework.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of Parliament, I thank you for your dedication this evening and all the answers you have given us.
We like some of your answers more than others, but we are grateful for your dedication.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 17 to 23, 25 and 26 will be replied to in writing.
Question No 24 by Mr Van Lancker is not admissible since it refers to an item included on the agenda for the present part-session.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area - Contribution of public finances to growth and employment
Mr President, before I give my comments as rapporteur, I would like to make an objection and ask you to refer it to the Conference of Presidents.
In my view, it is absurd to have this debate now, when we had the debate on the Stability Pact this afternoon, and in the meantime, the Conference of Presidents thought it would be worthwhile to find time for a debate on television without frontiers.
This does not help to make our work more coherent.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are about to debate has come at a crucial moment.
On 21 September 2001, the European Council acknowledged the importance of the subjects we discuss and assisted us by requesting, for the first time, that the Commission prepare a recommendation on the economic situation of the euro area following the events of 11 September.
Some people might believe that it has been easier to organise economic policy coordination during a period of growth.
This was not intentional, even though there have been many fortunate coincidences, such as tax cuts in various Member States, which we can now welcome.
Today, however, we are faced with genuine external shocks, even though the consequences of the slowdown in the United States were already challenging us on the basis of our growth, economic policy coordination is becoming even more difficult, and even more necessary, because, at the other end of the spectrum, European policy now amounts to monetary policy and also because Mr Duisenberg, in the wake of the events of 11 September, made a commitment with his US counterpart to coordinate economic areas.
As the changeover to euro notes and coins draws near, we must make economic and monetary union manage on its own two feet.
This is what we invited the Commission to do with its communication, which we welcome.
A great deal has already been done and there is still a great deal to do.
Member States must conduct their policy in a responsible and autonomous manner.
Coordination, however, must help to make this policy as consistent as possible and mutually beneficial.
This is what the changeover to the euro represents.
The report that I am commending to Parliament echoes the Commission communication and indicates a number of options, which we believe are essential.
First of all, this coordination depends on the Eurogroup and its president, who, we must be able to believe, speaks on behalf of the whole group.
Next, the Commission must have an essential role but it cannot approach this as if it were one of its, say, conventional areas of competence.
In some ways, this role is more political, in which the Commission must display its ability to make innovative proposals, to develop medium-term prospects.
And the European Parliament must be the public forum for debate on economic policy coordination.
In order to achieve this, three courses of action are needed.
First of all, we need indicators, harmonised statistics and barometers for the euro area.
An economic policy for the euro area is impossible unless we have good instruments to navigate by.
I am also aware that some Member States are having a debate on the cost-effectiveness of the indicators.
We are clearly in favour of spending a small amount of money so that the indicators can be more effective.
In our view, the second crucial point is the exchange of information, on which Eurogroup members have made a start.
We believe it is essential to go further, to take advantage of everything that could enable peer evaluation, with the option of asking the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of measures proposed by a Member State as part of its budgetary, fiscal or structural policy.
Lastly, Mr President, we must improve the quality and the coherence of all aspects of the debate.
Economic policy coordination in the national parliaments must be integrated.
This means integrating the broad economic policy guidelines into the debate on national budgets.
It also means that a national debate must be based on the stability programmes.
This also means that before we discuss the broad economic policy guidelines in the European Parliament, we want to hear the views of our colleagues in the national parliaments.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that this also means we hope to see the President of the Eurogroup come before the relevant parliamentary committee as often as is necessary.
Mr President, the Commission Communication on public finances is now, some time after its publication, particularly topical.
The economy is slowing down, partly of its own accord, partly through laxity on the part of major Member States, and on top of this there are the after-effects of the tragic events of 11 September. These things have again, for the first time in a while, put pressure on the public finances of the Member States.
History has taught us that considerable public expenditure can lead to major inefficiency, to too high a claim on the capital market and to excessive taxation, and very rarely to higher employment.
All these aspects can seriously hinder the healthy development of the private sector and consequently hamper growth in employment grounded in supply and demand.
Almost ten years ago, the European Heads of State and Government acknowledged this development, and agreed in Maastricht to work on a sustainable budgetary position.
If Member States join together in a large monetary zone, albeit with coordination of economic policy, but without real political union, they must adhere to their agreements.
Thanks to instruments made available to the ECB, the latter can influence the stability of prices and, along with this, the living conditions of people in the Euro area.
Further to a discussion in the Preparatory Committee, I would once again like to underline that price stability, along with controlled inflation, contributes to a sustained purchasing power at the bottom of the wage structure and to an incentive to return to work.
Price stability prevents the purchasing power of those of pensionable age from being eroded.
It also ensures that wage increases within the labour market actually translate into more financial scope for families in Europe, and do not merely enable people to keep up with price increases, as is the case in my own country.
Some countries give tax cuts with one hand and take them back, in the form of VAT hikes and higher local taxes, with the other. This instils in the public a sense of distrust in politics.
And the instruction to the Central Bank to monitor prices is the most effective social measure I can remember for a good few years.
In addition to the Central Bank' s pursuit of stability, the Member States' investment and budgetary policy is critical to the living and working conditions of Europeans and to confidence in the single currency.
According to President Duisenberg, the watering down of the budgetary objectives is of huge concern.
You yourself, Commissioner, called key countries including Germany, France, Italy and Portugal to account and reminded them of their duties.
And in those same countries, the idea of extending the Stability Pact is being mooted.
Let one thing be clear, however: the financial markets are closely watching the Member States in terms of how they are dealing with their budgets in a declining economy.
The countries which did nothing when it was economically possible, are now, of course, struggling the most to observe the Stability Pact.
Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect that they will now increase taxes or curb spending, but I consider an increase in spending to be an irresponsible burden in the face of an uncertain future.
Our generation must pay for its own bills, rather than pass them on to the next.
The current situation is a test of how sound the euro system actually is, and it is patently clear to the financial market that the public budgets are the weak link in the entire euro cycle.
Governments must not be allowed to think that the euro belongs to all of us but that their budgets are purely a national matter.
Furthermore, nobody has managed to explain to me what the use is of a Stability Pact which only applies to buoyant times.
It is precisely in an economy that is slowing down that it is important to translate agreements into practice.
The European Commission devotes an important proportion of its communication to future demographic developments.
It is a crucial component, because an ageing population will have a great impact on future budgetary positions.
And an ageing population is another reason to look after the Stability Pact.
It will also mean that we will be obliged to work much more on lifelong learning in order to sustain our own professional profile.
What is more, people will probably need to work well beyond the age of fifty-seven and a half, as is now mostly the case, for example in the Netherlands.
In my report, I am asking for an individual path to be sketched for every Member State, so that the political tendency to indulge in short-term thinking will not prejudice the just pension and care expectations of people.
Mr President, in my report, it is certainly not my intention to create the impression that public investments should not be allowed, but in the Stability Pact, 60% of the GDP has already been earmarked to meet the needs for public investments.
That offers ample scope for in-depth investment in education, R&D and healthcare.
Finally, I would like to note that I am pleased that constructive consultation with the Group of the Party of European Socialists was possible in order to come to an acceptable compromise.
Tomorrow, I will ask you whether it is possible to table an oral compromise amendment during the vote.
Mr President, given that this is a joint debate, I will point out that my mandate is restricted to the report by Mrs Peijs.
Mr President, it is customary for draftspeople of the opinion to congratulate the rapporteur of the committee responsible, to express their agreement and satisfaction, and to try to highlight their contributions and/or to at least expand on a few points.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to continue that practice today.
On behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which I have the honour of representing institutionally, I must express the profound disappointment of my committee at the treatment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our amendments, and please do not interpret this as in any way a personal opinion.
The Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion unanimously while I was absent through illness.
I was not even there at the final moment to defend my proposals and the opinion was therefore adopted without interference.
There was not a single vote against and there was therefore no distinction of a party political nature.
This is in no way a party political issue for us.
The majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, has rejected our amendments en masse.
Unless I am mistaken, not a single one of our amendments has warranted the approval of that majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
And we in the Committee on Budgets have the feeling, Mr President, that constructive and purely institutional contributions have been thoroughly spurned and scorned.
To be frank, we can find no explanation for this systematic negative vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Commission document which is the basis of our discussion focused, shall we say, on national budgets.
But when the Committee on Budgets added the Community dimension, the Commission, in particular the Commissioner present, thanked us for it and expressed its appreciation of this widening of the perspective of the Communication.
Well, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has refused to open its eyes to this additional dimension.
Why?
Why does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs deny that the European Union' s meagre budget, 1.07% of Community GDP, has been applied just as rigorously as that of the Member States?
By rejecting Amendment No 7, this is what they have done.
It is also difficult for we budgeteers in this House to understand why, two days from the first reading of the 2001 budget, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs denies, by rejecting Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the multiplier effect of Community expenditure and the fact that it frequently acts as an example for national, regional and local authorities.
If that is the economic thinking of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the coherent thing for it to do would be to withdraw all the amendments it has presented to the draft budget.
That would be the most logical thing for it to do.
Ladies and gentlemen, 90 days from the physical introduction of the euro, any inkling of fiscal policy in relation to the Community budget is being sidestepped.
From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the obvious thing to do would be to gradually strengthen the European budget and go beyond mere - necessary, but mere - coordination of the economic policies of the Member States.
Some day, just as we now have a 'Mr' CFSP, we are convinced that we will need a 'Mrs' Euro, perhaps Mrs Peijs herself, and a greater European budget, in exchange for a reduction of national budgets.
And in the Committee on Budgets we wonder how the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thinks economic cycles, symmetrical and asymmetrical shocks, should be confronted, each one as it comes or all of them in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, to a certain extent using the Community budget to this end.
We in the Committee on Budgets, which I would remind you approved the opinion unanimously, have the impression that for the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ideological prejudices carried more weight than the objective assessment of the economic options available.
Please allow me to remind you, as a teacher of public economy, Milton Freedman, said, that we are all Post-Keynesians.
He forgot about that majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament.
The motion for a resolution is only Post-Keynesian in a chronological sense, but the basis of its thinking is pre-Keynesian.
It takes up elements of the monetarism of the 80s and 90s without taking account of its background.
When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, perhaps all politicians, and certainly the economists, knew that we should get rid of the systematic deficit, that we needed a policy of financial rationalisation, but we also knew, since the 60s, that budgetary balance is only advisable in certain circumstances and conditions and that, in general, strict budgetary balance tends to be procyclic, that is to say that it tends to aggravate the cyclic tendency of the economy.
Kennedy' s advisers, if I may go back that far, illustrated, by means of the so-called budget surplus of full employment, how a balanced budget, even in certain cases of deficit, can create recession.
I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my committee, to take a more open perspective, as contained in our amendments, and to include them tomorrow in the text of the resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs BerÃšs, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about each of the reports, and also something about the previous speaker's comments of course.
No matter what political group he or she might belong to, I would never insinuate that a fellow Member had let himself or herself be guided by anything but objective policy considerations in reaching a decision or deciding how to vote.
The majorities that prevail may vary, but since I have been following its activities, the hallmark of the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been a very objective atmosphere and one very much geared to the Community's economic and monetary policy, so that the suggestion that has been made here is one that I cannot agree with and would like to refute.
Nevertheless, I agree with you of course that within the euro area and also as regards our common foreign and security policy we need to speak with one voice, both internally and externally.
However, and this point concerns both reports, competition is becoming an increasingly global matter.
The euro will come into circulation in 89 days, and it is already the second most important currency in the world.
The euro coins and notes will make the importance of this single European currency on the world market very clear.
This is a very important aspect, and we must at all times be very disciplined about keeping Europe's presence on the world financial stage in mind.
Global competition does of course require that in addition to the single market and economic and monetary union the necessary coordination needs to take place within the euro area and within the European Union as a whole.
What does this mean?
On the one hand it means coordination so that a strong internal market is created in the euro area and Europe becomes more competitive.
On the other hand, you need to understand that it also involves maintaining freedom as the basis of competition within the framework agreed between the Member States.
We are, of course, not all convinced that coordination in itself is a panacea, because we also need to consider where coordination starts.
What mechanisms does coordination involve, and what are the limits of coordination?
Does coordination inhibit the functioning of the market or support it?
This is undisputedly a debate that we need to hold, as decisions cannot simply be taken under the heading of coordination.
That is why we are in favour of more debates on European issues in national parliaments, in favour of coordination by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and enhanced links with national statistical bodies, and in favour of mutual exchange of information as a means of achieving joint tasks.
However, we naturally oppose increased bureaucracy, the setting up of new bodies and higher expenditure on bureaucracy masquerading as coordination.
We need more efficiency and professionalism in the structures that already exist in order to improve what we do jointly.
That does not mean reducing freedom of action and freedom of decision making in the Member States.
And we also oppose the information that has leaked out about tax collection or the use of tax income, because we believe that there is no legal basis for that either.
I have simply highlighted two issues that we need to debate further.
We will be voting for the report, but not all the details about what is meant and what mechanisms are necessary have been clarified.
I would like to say one more thing to Mrs BerÃšs: it is important that you have tackled the issue of the link between public finances and reducing inflation, and thus touched on the subject of assessing the financial markets.
We need to give public finances a clean bill of health again, so that we increase the investment capital at our disposal, and I therefore call on everyone mentioned in the report to do their homework properly and not just take cosmetic measures!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karas, I cannot resist commenting on your speech.
In all instances where we already have sensible coordination of our economic policies in the European Union, we have chalked up enormous successes.
Government budgets over the last year have for the first time in decades shown a surplus, and that still holds good, Mrs Peijs, if we exclude exceptional income from the sale of mobile telephone licences.
I do not think that we should play this down in today's debate.
The success stories in the current year will not be so great.
That is because growth in the European Union has slowed down, but that is no reason to start harping on about inflation.
Nor is it any reason to start panicking.
No one can calm down our friends in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
No one - not in this House anyway - wants to print money.
No one wants to print money as a way of solving finance policy problems.
We only want to print money to provide the public with our new currency, the euro, on time, but nobody here is talking about an inadequate budgetary policy.
However, you know that too. That is not what is at stake here!
Essentially, it is about something quite different.
You know very well that, in the past, these budget consolidation successes that I have been talking about were not achieved by increasing income but by cutting expenditure.
Those expenditure cuts led to a positive result, but also had negative affects.
In many areas, public infrastructure is in a state of decay.
In many places social networks are under great pressure and our investment patterns both in the private sector and in the public sector have led to key strategic deficiencies in comparison with our competitors on the world scene.
We now find ourselves in a situation in which government receipts will decline for cyclical reasons.
So the vital question is this: what should we do in that situation?
Are you really seriously envisaging further global cuts in public sector income and expenditure?
Do you really want to freeze budgets so that we fail to make the investment necessary for our future?
Do you want the European Union to enter a further procyclical phase which will prevent us from benefiting from long-term growth overall?
I cannot imagine that that is what you want.
Mr von Wogau asked me at lunchtime today what the Socialists really want.
I can give him an answer: we want to stop these scare tactics!
We want to put an end to talk that recovery in Europe is always just short-term, because if the central banks or governments are running scared, we will lose long-term opportunities.
We have tabled amendments that we think are sensible.
If you can agree to compromise with us, then we can find a common path.
And if that is not possible, we will go our separate ways!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my intervention by agreeing with Mrs BerÃšs' s complaint, because it really makes no sense to have held a debate, which is otherwise very interesting, on the Growth and Stability Pact and on the conclusions of the ECOFIN in LiÃšge, to have debated 'television without frontiers' in the middle and now to hold what I believe to be a logical continuation of the first debate, the reports by Mrs BerÃšs and Mrs Peijs, to whom I would like to say, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that they have our support and favourable vote.
I feel compelled to relate this afternoon' s debate to the subjects of these reports, above all by referring to the current economic situation.
It is clear that over the first few months of this year, the slow-down of the American economy has had more influence than was initially expected, and that the terrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have further worsened these prospects through needs for economic intervention which are truly new, urgent and no doubt justified.
The strain of the situation, however, should not lead us to justify greater public intervention or, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said very correctly, to abandon or lose sight of the need to continue with the structural reforms which the European economy still needs if it is really going to be competitive on an international level.
I trust that confidence will be recovered in the economic field as soon as possible and that the current special situation will be overcome, and we will shortly find that we have the same requirements that we had three months ago, that is, to consolidate the European economy, to make it more competitive in accordance with the Lisbon criteria, to strengthen coordination and, as we have often said to Commissioner Solbes, to have a genuine economic and monetary approach and policy, as the existence of the euro and monetary union demands.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is my basic point, although there are other detailed matters which are sufficiently well-expressed in the respective reports by Mrs BerÃšs and Mrs Peijs.
Mr President, I want to deal particularly with the issue of public expenditure, quality and employment.
The explanatory statement of Mrs Peijs' report is very interesting because it explains the background.
We have to beware of chasing the American economic model.
One of the things that has made many people within the European Union hostile to the euro is that they have seen its introduction as linked to cuts in public expenditure.
We have seen, with the American economic model, the prioritising of the private and the cutting of the public.
The result has been a tremendous disparity between rich and poor and high levels of child poverty - unlike in countries which invest in social expenditure and reduce the wealth gap.
We know that child poverty is linked to poorer educational attainment, poorer job prospects and so on.
We have also seen in that economy a reduction of job security and longer working hours, with the introduction of a flexible contract culture.
In the UK, contracting out at lower cost quite often means compensatory tax measures at the lower end of pay, a public subsidy to poor wages from poor employers.
The American model also represents an unsustainable pattern of consumption, which will have an economic impact in the longer term.
My group believes that Mrs Peijs' report does not look sufficiently at the quality of the contribution of public finances.
So we cannot support the report in its current form.
Hence the amendments we have tabled.
I know that it is very difficult to measure the benefits of public expenditure in the same way we look at the balance sheet of a private health care company for example.
Public expenditure is an investment in social cohesion and we are gradually coming to recognise the costs of not investing in that.
Indeed, a priority for the European Union now is combating social exclusion.
We count as an economic success private spending to compensate for the lack of public expenditure.
Every burglar alarm bought, for example, is because we feel we are not safe.
We agree that we need to reduce the cost of employing people and to focus on lifting taxation costs for the poorer paid, many of whom are women.
But we also need to reduce working hours as part of increasing employment opportunities.
It is clear to us that a knowledge-based society which tackles social exclusion - we have to remember that Lisbon also said that - needs greater investment.
And where will that come from if there is no significant public expenditure?
Employers increasingly want ready-trained employees as part of the flexible contract culture.
We consider that public investments can have a very positive value and can help to shift the direction of our economy, as we recognise our ecological responsibilities.
Mr President, the Peijs report states that, over 20 years, government expenditure has increased from 35% to 50% of the GNP.
What has caused this increase in government expenditure?
Is it because public services have been improved, the number of hospitals has increased, additional hospital staff have been hired, public transport and national education have been developed, sufficient social housing has been built?
No, it certainly is not!
Over the past 20 years, many governments have, on the contrary, privatised services that used to be public.
All these governments have pursued money-saving policies with regard to essential public services, have got rid of railway lines, local post offices or hospitals, which are not considered to be profitable.
The reason that government expenditure has increased is because of the extravagant sums of money given to employers on a multitude of pretexts, ranging from direct subsidies for reducing taxes and social contributions to giving all types of support - all government authorities seem to excel at making these up.
Mrs Peijs cynically proposes making this policy worse by further reducing employers' social burdens and increasing VAT.
The poorest people are being made to pay in order to give money to the richest - if this is not brutal and direct class politics then it is hard to imagine what else it can be.
I shall of course be voting against this report.
Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports.
In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern.
We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States.
The tragic events that took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence.
In Ireland, as in all Member States, we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels.
The reaffirmation of this commitment at LiÃšge will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations.
I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth.
Indeed, in Ireland, we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre.
The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland.
It is discussed in DaÃ­l Ãireann and is a key component of our annual budget.
The primary objective of the Irish budget and stability programme is the continuation of sustainable economic growth, supported by moderate inflation and competitive wage developments, reflecting our national agreement with the social partners known as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.
As the House knows, the Ecofin Council this year, on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes, issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy.
The Irish government contends that its budgetary policy seeks to achieve economic stability by securing the continuation of social partnership and also by taking action to reduce price inflation, including indirect tax reductions.
We must look to the future.
Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January.
But the single currency is not an end in itself.
It is conceived to facilitate a true single market for goods and services.
The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination.
National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time.
Mr President, as usual, I am in full agreement with Mrs Peijs.
That is why I shall mainly confine myself to the report by Mrs BerÃšs.
The European Monetary Union is accompanied by a certain level of coordination in the field of budgets.
However, coordination which goes beyond what is necessary for the EMU deserves to be questioned.
Further coordination can only be justified through sound reasoning, but this is lacking in both the Commission communication and in the BerÃšs report.
There are, however, situations which require coordination.
The Commission mentions resistance to shocks as an example.
A recent illustration is the granting of subsidies to airline companies following the attack in the United States. This is an excellent example of decisive action on the part of the Council of Ministers.
Coordination which goes beyond what is required will even prove counterproductive.
Labour participation, company policy, taxes - these are all matters which should fall within the remit of the Member States.
In substance, they give little reason for more coordination at European level.
Coordination of economic policy should not be used as a red herring.
After all, it is evident that times of economic adversity make it more difficult for the Member States to adhere to the EMU' s underlying principle: the Stability Pact.
The much-needed structural reforms should help meet the budgetary criteria.
Member States cannot afford to postpone using this instrument in order to obtain more permanent and responsible growth.
This growth is vital in order to secure the Stability Pact.
The need for reform is therefore all the more pressing.
It is, therefore, with good reason that the report does not nominate many concrete matters for coordination.
It is always useful to exchange information on economic policy decisions.
More important, however, is the quality of the decisions per se.
The report does not comment on the motives for closer cooperation. This does nothing to help the case for coordination.
With the EMU, the European economies should not lose their own economic policies, tailored to their specific dynamics and character.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to thank my friend, Karla Peijs, for her excellent report, in which she aptly describes the vital importance structural reform measures have for the prosperity of our societies.
Rarely does one see such excellent reports.
I wish to focus on two matters.
The public finances of a State in the euro area are no longer the private affairs of that State.
Any budgetary imbalances in an individual State, particularly a large one, may have an impact on the stability of the entire euro area.
For this reason, recent attempts to water down measures to reform state economies are worrying.
Many governments in recent years have relaxed their budgetary efforts, relying mainly on cyclical receipts, such as the proceeds from mobile telecommunications system auctions.
The consolidation process is still far from being complete, however.
The future objective is for a 'close to balance' or 'in surplus' budgetary position.
Member States must honour the commitments of the stability and convergence programmes unconditionally.
It will take perseverance and determination to balance public finances.
It will make us susceptible to populist criticisms of thinking of the economy like an accountant or balancing the economy one-sidedly.
Nevertheless, this is what we have to focus on.
Politicians have to take a few blows after all, but our economy will not be able to take a left hook.
Secondly, the rise in public expenditure in the last few decades has caused the governments of several of the Member States to increase taxation and social welfare contributions, which were already at an unendurably high level in Europe.
Simultaneously, the potential for economic growth has been weakening throughout this period.
That Last Mohican of orthodox communism, my colleague Mrs Bordes, could also stop talking about class war in this, the third millennium, and admit that the contribution of each and every European to the economy is important.
For that reason, work must be financially motivating and the benefits of different social welfare schemes at such a level that they safeguard the basic necessities of a normal, decent life, but provide an incentive for becoming active in all situations.
Only in this way can we achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon.
Mr President, the challenges of globalisation make it clear to us just how important coordination of economic policies is for Europe, and also the integration of financial, employment and social policies, because little Europe is demonstrating to the world that it is possible to make progress in a region if regional cooperation does not just mean intergovernmental cooperation and is not just a free trade area.
I believe that the combination of the single market on the one hand and certain possibilities for giving political direction on the other is what makes the European Union what it is.
I therefore very much welcome the Commission communication and Mrs BerÃšs's report, as they make it very clear that we need to make further progress with the coordination process.
We all know that the challenges and demands on us are now even greater than ever.
ECOFIN has quite rightly made sure that more integrated approaches are now being adopted, especially in the field of capital movements.
It is certainly important that we should not just act in unison and improve the quality of coordination, but that we should also agree on guidelines.
Fortunately, the Lisbon process, which was taken further in Stockholm, has given us both quantitative and qualitative objectives.
Of course these still need to be extended and refined, but it enables us to demonstrate to the public that the coordination process can lead to positive outcomes.
If you could not say that, who would be interested in checking if all the Member States have actually met the requirements to which they have committed themselves?
One aspect of the commitments that they have entered into is the consolidation of their budgets.
Mr Bullmann was quite right to point out the progress made in this area.
It is certainly true that there is still more to be done in reducing debt in some Member States, but we should not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact exists as an instrument to prevent us ever exceeding a deficit of 3% of GNP.
That is at the heart of the convergence criteria and this deficit is intended to help us to achieve a favourable monetary policy that promotes development.
I believe that coordination can be enhanced still further, and that all those policies which can mutually or reciprocally support each other should be brought into this coordination process.
I also think that it is a particularly good thing that the European Parliament can call on the national parliaments to take part in the coordination process and I really wish to emphasise that point.
We, as a committee, have attempted to constantly highlight this cooperation with national parliaments.
Mr President, I would like to make one final comment. We should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself.
We, in Europe, have missed out on growth because over the last few decades coordination has been lacking.
We lost out because we did not adopt a coordinated approach to the UMTS auction.
We could have achieved a totally different outcome.
Nor did we react jointly when the OPEC countries raised oil prices.
There is no doubt that we could have achieved a more favourable starting point for economic development if we had acted in a more coordinated way.
Mr President, Commissioner, in recent decades the per capita GDP in Europe has been reduced in comparison with that of America, increasing the gap or distance between our prosperity and development and that of the United States, while our levels of employment are also worsening.
The conclusion is drawn from this that the Americans do not hinder the activities of private companies through taxation as much as Europeans do and, in accordance with low levels of public expenditure, they have not, like us, promoted action plans, introduced bureaucratic systems or tried to guide their economic operators, who have therefore been able to dedicate themselves purely to working and generating wealth.
It seems to me that this analysis does not take account of the very important fact that, over the last 30 years, levels of public investment in the European Union have been reduced to 2% of our GDP in 2000, while in the United States they have maintained a sustainable level and represent 3% of their GDP.
If we add to this the fact that our per capita GDP stands at 65% of American GDP, it turns out that their average investment per citizen each year is 2.3 times greater than ours, and this is a more than notable difference which explains the differing developments of our respective economies.
I believe that the short-term solution for Europe is not to reduce taxes, but rather, while achieving balanced budgets and no deficit, we must adjust our current public expenditure and increase public investment in viable projects, modernising our infrastructures, supporting technological research and development, involving research institutes and universities in private initiative and promoting training and knowledge in our society.
What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar, which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue, with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system, which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions, and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement.
This is unacceptable and must be condemned.
Mr President, two weeks ago, I was in the Netherlands on 'Prince' s Day' , the opening of the new parliamentary year, when the government budget is presented.
Not only because of the events in the US did I sit that day with mixed feelings, but also with a feeling of: what is this all about?
With the ever growing internationalisation of the economy, certainly in a country like the Netherlands, it is noticeable that at national level, there is, in fact, little room for economic manoeuvre.
It is, of course, possible to place accents, and I welcome the Dutch government' s proposal to step up investment in the public sector.
However, the scope remaining to make a real difference is relatively limited and is determined at entirely different levels. One feels far closer to this in Brussels.
On the other hand, I felt completely at home as regards the way in which such a budget is prepared in the Netherlands. It is based on sound analyses and prognoses issued by what we still term the Central Planning Bureau, and broad, medium-term recommendations by the Socio-Economic Council in which independent experts, social partners and the Dutch Bank work in harmony.
In this way, a government can make plans which receive broad support and which can be effective.
The paradox of the phase which we are at with European cooperation, is that, although the political control of the socio-economic policy has been moved onto a European plane, the instruments and procedures for this are still located at national level.
Neither the European political structure, nor the European actors are prepared for this.
Unfortunately, for I am convinced that Europe is in need of such sound and broad socio-economic coordination.
I am therefore pleased with Mrs BerÃšs' report.
She makes proposals for improved coordination within the euro countries, for greater involvement of national policy-makers and parliaments and for better harmonisation among the various actors at European level.
I would particularly like to underline the role of the macro-economic dialogue which must be afforded a far higher profile, also in the preparation of the broad economic guidelines.
A broader debate thereafter, also involving national parliaments, is important.
This concludes my comments on the BerÃšs report.
I would once again invite Mrs Peijs to deal with the amendments which we tabled so as to reach a compromise after all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the report by Mrs BerÃšs on the Commission communication on the prospects for monetary union.
I think, however, that after the tragic events of 11 September the proposed measures and experiments should be implemented much sooner if we want the monetary union to fully perform the role that awaits it in fighting terrorism, maintaining economic growth and the competitiveness of Europe, and affirming a policy of peace and international cooperation that will isolate terrorism in developing countries.
I refer first of all to the need to face the slow-down in economic growth by means of coordination of our economic and social policies, countering the economic cycle.
This can be achieved through enhanced cooperation measures between Eurogroup members, resulting in a real government by agreement of the monetary union, able to question decisions by the European Central Bank with an authority at least as great as that shown a few weeks ago by the United States Federal Reserve.
I also refer to the urgent need within the monetary union above all to achieve the greatest transparency and a reciprocal information system on movements of capital, overcoming the restrictions of bank secrecy so as to be able, Mr Karas, to strike at the transfer of resources linked to terrorist funding, the laundering of dirty money from organised crime, and the offence of tax evasion.
I shall close, Mr President, by also mentioning an international cooperation policy which will allow long-term contracts for supplying Europe with raw materials to be drawn up also in euro.
Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs very much.
There is no doubt that what has been said this evening is going to help us in our subsequent work.
I will begin by commenting on the BÃšres report and I would like to express my satisfaction with Parliament' s motion for a resolution which supports the strengthening of economic policy coordination within the euro area.
We must not forget that economic policy coordination is an obligation laid down in the Treaty.
The Treaty makes it very clear that our model is based on a single monetary policy and on national, but coordinated, economic policies.
This is a key element of our model.
It is true that coordination is still going through a learning phase. It is also true that we have increasingly greater interdependence - especially in the euro area but also in the Union in general - and this requires that the content, the systems and the instruments we use are constantly being reviewed.
That is why I must especially welcome the report which Parliament has produced and salute Mrs BÃšres and all of those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have participated in her magnificent work.
I believe that this work, in many respects, goes further than the Commission' s proposal, particularly with regard to one fundamental aspect, the increase in national participation in economic policy coordination.
I would like to highlight two essential elements of the report - and I will comment on the various interventions in relation to them.
The first is the need to strengthen coordination, the second the need to increase the democratic debate and national participation.
With regard to the content of the coordination, I think it is worth expanding on certain points.
The report supports the Commission' s proposals on the production of periodic reports on the economy of the euro area.
Today I can tell you that our idea - we have continued to work on this issue - is that we must have detailed economic analyses but also relevant proposals on economic policy.
We must go further than specific analysis.
In her speech, Mrs BÃšres raised the need to improve statistics and the assessment of policies.
It is true that we have made progress with the statistical plans for the Union' s monetary area, however, we must go further.
It is partly a problem of bringing national statistics into line with new realities, it is partly a problem of money, but, in some cases, it is neither of these problems, but rather the problem of acquiring the data necessary for a good definition of economic policy more quickly.
This perhaps means that in the future we will have to consider the need for our own statistical information which is not an aggregate of national statistics.
This would certainly be a key element if we are to be able to act within a time frame similar to that available to other economic authorities.
She makes a reference in her report which I believe to be fundamental in relation to trying to achieve a common vision of the impact of economic cycles on public finances.
We have held part of this debate today - I will comment later when I talk about the report by Mrs Peijs - but we believe it is essential for the ECOFIN Council to produce a methodology as soon as possible, allowing us to examine the concept of structural deficit by means of the same criteria.
And we are working on this, which seems to us essential, precisely to allow these automatic stabilisers to come into play depending on the extent to which the budgetary situation of each of the Member States allow it, but applying the same criteria in all cases.
A further point relating to the first element I mentioned, the content of coordination, is that of prior information.
This is a point which always gives rise to a degree of debate and discussion.
When we talk about prior information, we are talking about two different things.
We are talking firstly about the other partners of the Eurogroup knowing the broad guidelines for those essential elements of a national economic policy which may eventually have an affect on the rest.
Let us take one case: the tax reduction measures adopted last year as a result of the oil crisis.
There is no doubt that if we had acted as we have acted this year on the issue of insurance cover for airlines, we would have achieved a better result and a better approach from the point of view of the Union' s position.
The same can be said of the UMTSs.
If we had debated, before taking the decision, how to deal with the possibilities and difficulties which one or other option with regard to licences for third-generation mobiles could pose, there is no doubt that we could have prevented some of the subsequent problems.
We are not saying that we should all do the same. We are saying that we can hold discussions together in order to try to decide on a framework, which includes the different national decisions and allows us to take a more coherent position.
I said that there is a second aspect to prior information and that is that ministers should take Community elements into consideration when defining their national policy.
And I relate this reference to the one made by Mrs BÃšres in relation to increasing national participation in the broad guidelines for economic policy.
Until now, it has more or less been considered that we had two processes which did not necessarily converge.
On the one hand, reaching an agreement on the broad guidelines for economic policy in Brussels, in Luxembourg; on the other, defining our national economic and budgetary policies.
And each process took a different route.
It was also believed that compliance with the Stability Pact was sufficient to satisfy the coherence and consistency of the system which we have implemented for economic policy coordination.
It is becoming increasingly clear to us that the two instruments we have, the Stability Pact and the broad guidelines for economic policy, are key elements.
And the broad guidelines for economic policy, if they are actually approved by the ministers as a real commitment to be applied in each of the Member States, must reflect the budgetary policy which each minister wants and must present to their national Parliament.
I believe that this would help us enormously in terms of a better interrelationship between the decisions adopted at Community level and the decisions adopted by national Parliaments.
In this respect, the Commission believes that this idea of the debate is essential and we will fully support it.
However - and this is a point which I also wanted to comment on - it is true that we should not overly complicate the procedures.
Therefore, we are more cautious about certain ideas considered on the issue of macroeconomic dialogue.
It is absolutely clear that we have to improve its efficiency on the level of political dialogue, but we believe that we also have to maintain its character of frank and confidential exchange and, in this respect, it is essential to maintain this informal framework for debate and not formalise its process too much by complicating it and making the whole process of debate relating to this point less productive.
I would therefore like to end my comments on this first report by pointing out that the services of the Commission are currently looking into the implementation of some of the proposals included in the resolution, I have taken note of a series of suggestions that have been made this evening and we are naturally going to pay particular attention to them when producing our final proposal.
In relation to the report by Mrs Peijs, I would firstly also like to thank her for her suggestions and comments, but I would like to focus on just three or four points that I think are important.
Firstly, I fully agree with the idea that, in the context of the introduction of the euro, the credibility of a healthy public finance policy which is compatible with the euro is essential.
It is true that, in our view, public finances - we have said this clearly this evening - must be adequate for both crisis situations and for good economic situations.
In your report you refer to automatic stabilisers - and I do not believe that there is any great divergence between us on the analysis of this point.
We believe, like you, that they must play a fundamental role, both at times of growth and at times of slow-down of the economy.
We are grateful for your reference to tax reductions.
The Commission has been arguing that all tax reductions must respond to certain criteria, which are contained in your report, and which we believe are essential to maintaining the idea of quality of public finances.
No doubt if we were to debate tax reductions now, elements such as the promotion of consumption would be of more importance than would have been the case a few months ago, given that that is one of the issues we are concerned about.
But the idea of tax reductions can certainly be included in practice, in all cases, in the criteria contained in the document and which you support.
Finally, a comment on the sustainability of public finances in the long term.
There have been other comments on the labour market, on how we must move ahead, on coherence in relation to work, pensions, etc.
In my opinion, all these elements will be dealt with within a broader vision of the labour market, while the finance ministers must pay particular attention to public finances and, in this respect, to the difficulties which may arise in the funding of social security given the global budgetary deficits of all public administrations.
The idea we are working with at the moment - and on the basis of your report, as you know, progress has already been made on some points - is not that reference be made by means of a short paragraph on the stability programmes, but that the stability programmes annually take up the necessary data to carry out an adequate evaluation of the evolution of public finances in relation to problems of ageing.
Nevertheless, in our view, the idea of including this information in the stability programmes is not because we believe they are problems which must be resolved through annual decisions - they need more long-term decisions - but because we felt it was appropriate to introduce new processes for approaching, analysing and monitoring the evolution of public finances.
Our idea is that, every four or five years, in each country, a more in-depth analysis should be carried out - it may be a supplement to the documents from the stability programme - on long-term public finances with the obvious fundamental problem of the ageing of the population and from which, nevertheless, when updating the annual programmes we only take the most necessary basic information.
I would like to end by thanking you all once again for your cooperation and the useful ideas you have offered us, which we will take into account as far as possible.
Mr President, I owe Mrs Van den Burg an explanation with regard to the amendments.
I did not bring the amendment numbers, so I will have to quote from memory, but Mr Bullmann will undoubtedly correct me if he thinks I am quoting the incorrect numbers.
Mrs Van den Burg, in order to reach a workable compromise, we will agree on Amendment Nos 4 and 5. Amendment No 7 will be based on the text by Mr Bullmann to which a sentence will be added.
That is the oral amendment I was referring to. We will also agree on the second part of Amendment No 9 which starts with 'calls on the Member States' , Amendment No 10 by way of supplement and Amendment No 12.
I believe that is the complete list.
I would now like to respond to Mr Colom i Naval. He has probably been waiting for this all evening.
Mr Colom i Naval, I would like to make this quite clear: content was not the issue.
The reason why we were unable to talk about this before we voted on the amendments is that I was firstly in the United States with the delegation - you will have noticed my absence in the committee at the time - and then I was in Rome with my group.
It was a slightly hectic month.
It was not a matter of content.
The fact is that the European Commission took the Member States as its point of departure in its communication. I did the same in my report.
If, in your report, you were to write about the effects of the European budgetary policy on employment, then I would gladly vote in favour of all your amendments, but they did not feature in the framework of my report.
I apologise for the fact that we did not have an opportunity to talk about this.
That was a personal statement and was helpfully reconciliatory.
I would like to thank you too, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Competition policy (2000)
The next item is the report (A5-0299/2001) by Mr Agag Longo on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission's XXXth Report on competition policy 2000 (SEC(2001) 694 - C5-0312/2001 - 2001/2130(COS)).
Mr President, I am honoured to have been asked by my colleague, Mr Agag Longo, to present his excellent and detailed report to Parliament on the Commission's XXXth report on competition policy.
The report draws together several important areas of competition policy.
The rapporteur restates Parliament's strong support for Commissioner Monti in spelling out that effective competition is not only an important engine of economic growth but also works to the advantage of consumers, through greater variety, better quality and lower prices for both goods and services.
We congratulate the Commissioner on the success of European competition policy, but we recognise that such success can only be maintained by constant and rigorous monitoring.
Our rapporteur has highlighted further measures to which Parliament will be giving its attention in the coming months.
The future of car distribution is one area where we eagerly await the Commission's proposals.
I believe that our initial evaluations suggest that consumers are missing out under the current exemption, with unjustifiable price variations between Member States.
We also await the consultation on Merger Regulation No 4064/89.
We welcome Commissioner Monti's positive approach to consultation with our committee, but we repeat our call for major constitutional change which gives Parliament real codecision power with the Commission.
Commissioner Monti has played the central role in fostering a global approach to competition policy and enforcement issues.
Our committee supports efforts to build an international competition system in the framework of the WTO, whilst recognising that Europe's credibility in this area will depend on efficient and effective cooperation between the EU's own national competition authorities.
We are also looking to the outcome of negotiations between the Commission and the Council on the Commission's proposals for reform of the enforcement regime under Articles 81 and 82 which we approved last month.
Mr Agag Longo draws attention in his report to other important elements of Parliament's position on the reform, our strong support for Article 3 and our real concern over issues of legal certainty, as well as separation of powers.
I know that Commissioner Monti is aware of this, but we have consistently argued that the Commission must guard against the danger that the reform may lead to inconsistent application or even to a renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market.
In continuing to raise these issues we reflect the concerns of many in the business community in Europe.
Our committee has also underlined other competition concerns.
We look to further market liberalisation, but we want effective enforcement of already agreed policy areas in the gas and the electricity sectors.
The Commissioner is aware of the complaints which have been made about some acquisitions by companies which do not appear to operate in a liberalised home market and we look to the Commission to investigate whether state-aid rules have been breached in such cases.
Mr Agag Longo also urges further progress on liberalisation in areas such as energy, transport and the postal services.
We welcome the progress which the Commissioner has made on state aid control.
We also support his work in ensuring that candidate countries for membership fully understand the requirements of EU competition policy, particularly the application and relevance of such rules in terms of market distortion.
Our committee will shortly respond in fuller detail to the Commission's ninth state aid survey, but this report also touches on this area.
We applaud progress on implementation of a public register of state aid and a scoreboard as important tools for promoting transparency and democratic control, even if I embarrass Commissioner Monti by saying that his practical demonstration of the scoreboard to our committee was frustrated by technical problems.
We view such widespread public access to information as essential.
In the same light we welcome the continuing commitment to hold competition day seminars under each Council presidency, although we are keen to see wider public knowledge of, and participation in, such events.
Finally, on an entirely personal note, I would like to express my concern that the Commission has made particularly slow progress over complaints concerning the Spanish government's treatment of Gibraltar citizens in relation to telecoms matters.
These complaints have been outstanding with the Commission for over five years, whilst the Commission has itself recently initiated a state aids investigation of Gibraltar's investment schemes, ordering it to cease forthwith until the Commission investigation is concluded.
I am bound to say that this hardly seems to me to be an even-handed approach and I hope Commissioner Monti will agree to look into this.
Otherwise I commend Mr Agag Longo's excellent report to the House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent times, especially since the Stockholm European Council, the European Union has reached a turning point in competition policy.
That can be seen in the increasing conservation of structures.
The Agag Longo report rightly mentions this.
Following the successful liberalisations of the 1990s, postal services, electricity and gas are now trying to escape the annoyance of competition again.
First liberalisation, then regulation again, and the heading for this scenario is self-preservation.
The agenda for the Heads of State and Government in Laeken expressly provides for a discussion of the tension between competition and the preservation of existing interests.
We are all anxious to see whether competition can win through there.
If we ask about the difference between our modern, open society and another society marked by classes and castes, the answer is clear: in our open society competition has become the order, the principle on which our culture is based.
General acceptance of the principle of competition is therefore a tremendous cultural achievement.
But the state has never submitted itself to this principle.
It has always sheltered its education system, its banks, its railway, its airlines, its postal service, its telephone networks and its housing associations from the cold wind of competition.
Many sectors of the economy, too, claim that competition cannot work for them or that exposure to competition could be detrimental to the objectives they pursue..
There are plenty of examples.
Coal is valued because supplies are secure.
The market is said to be harmful to the health service because patients would be unable to assess the services provided.
In agriculture, the market is said to be inappropriate because farmers allegedly produce even more if prices are lower.
The postal service cannot be set free to compete - not completely, at any rate - because it has social functions to fulfil.
So we could go on.
But all these paltry excuses have one thing in common: they all recognise competition in principle, but simply claim that the principle is not applicable in their most particular case.
The situation in Europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy.
That is why it is important - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for this - that EU competition policy should now finally be extended to energy, transport and pharmaceuticals.
Let us therefore continue together to plan, campaign and argue for freedom.
Mr President, I must say firstly that I am truly perplexed.
I am perplexed by the fact that a British Member, though talking in place of a Spanish Member, has raised an issue that in no way relates to the rules on competition, that in no way relates to the reports on competition, but which relates to the unacceptable existence of the only territory in the European Union still to be decolonised.
It seems to me that to use the speaking time of a Spanish Member to raise these issues is, to say the very least, a discourtesy.
Anyway, leaving that aside, I believe that the discussion of the annual report on competition policy is a good opportunity to consider a debate on the progress and guidelines relating to this important European policy.
If we are to be self-critical, I would like to ask you whether we are really holding this debate or whether we are simply restricting ourselves to voting on a resolution which, if we are going to be honest, is more a cause for pity than for glory.
Please do not interpret this as a criticism of the Commissioner, Mr Monti, since I am more than happy to acknowledge his work in the area of competition and he has always been prepared to hold any necessary debates with this Parliament and has always been in favour of informing us promptly of the positions of his department.
Neither do I have any intention of criticising the rapporteur, who has produced a report of high quality and has also done so with flexibility and tolerance, accepting the positions of various political groups.
I therefore believe that my comments relate more to the behaviour of this Parliament and, fundamentally, to the vestiges of an era when its was simply a consultative assembly and did not have the co-legislative role which it has now.
We therefore have a tendency to issue documents, this document on the annual report on competition, and then go back to considering other issues on which we have already contributed as legislators, although unfortunately competition rules are excluded from the codecision procedure.
Furthermore, there is not always coherence between what we say at one moment and what we say at another.
Returning to the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Agag once again on its content, most of which we agree with, and to make a comment.
Once the Commission has taken its decision, I believe that there is no need for, and we should remove, the section relating to the prohibition of public companies investing capital in companies from the liberalised sectors - think of the conflict between ElectricitÃ© de France and HidrocantÃ¡brico - which Mr Agag introduces in his desire to stick up for and assist certain positions of the Spanish government.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur - who is now represented by Mr Evans - for a really sound report.
I should like to express my gratitude for the cooperation I have received from Mr Longo in preparing the report.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his strong commitment to competition policy in the EU.
I should also like to take the opportunity to emphasise that the fight for free competition is a fight that must be engaged in ceaselessly.
There are at present quite a few good examples of free competition' s being threatened as soon as the opportunity arises for disrupting it.
The first, very telling example is the proposal tabled by the Commission to introduce an interim subsidy arrangement for certain types of shipbuilding.
The background to the proposal is that we in Europe believe we are exposed to unfair competition from South Korea.
Obviously, many interested parties try to exploit the situation in order to introduce a much higher level of subsidy than is justified by the realities of the situation.
Where this matter is concerned, I therefore wish to call upon the European Parliament and my fellow MEPs here in the House to stand by the Council' s resolution from last year to abolish all direct subsidies for shipbuilding.
The next example of an attempt to exploit the situation is provided by the aviation industry which is experiencing a lot of turbulence in these very days and weeks.
This has led many to campaign for the introduction of subsidies.
I should like to remind you that the problems experienced by a number of carriers are not primarily due to the tragic events of 11 September, but rather to the fact that the airline companies are now facing the harsh realities earlier than expected.
The whole sector has for a long time been in need of radical restructuring and, as politicians, we must ensure that the present frenzied and tumultuous situation is not used to introduce a mass of subsidies that are to be paid for by ourselves as taxpayers and that are designed to bail out a host of unprofitable companies and routes for which, as consumers, we shall have to pay the excess price over and above what we have paid in tax.
To conclude, I should like to return to a couple of specific points in the report.
I think it important that we should hold the Commission to its assurance that the new competition rules do not mean a renationalisation of competition policy.
It is also important that the Commission should continue to produce its annual report on State subsidies, even though it has now introduced the scoreboard for which I myself, for example, have for a long time been pressing and which I am very pleased about.
It is also my hope that the Commission will be attentive to the desire for a start to be made as soon as possible on looking into the rules for the repayment of unlawfully allocated State subsidies - an area which leaves a lot to be desired.
Finally, I hope that the Commission will follow up the request to look more closely into the possibility of improving the legal position of companies hit by losses and of involving third parties more extensively whenever the Commission deals with practical matters.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Agag Longo, and to Mr Evans for his speech.
I admire the quality of Mr Agag Longo' s report and appreciate the many constructive observations that have been made.
It does not escape me that the report also contains critical notes, and I assure you that, although it is impossible in this House to take a definite stand on all the observations made in the report, I can guarantee that all of them will be very carefully examined.
I am also grateful to the other speakers in this sitting - Messrs Konrad and Berenguer Fuster and Ms Riis-JÃžrgensen - for their political and, I must add, their cultural support for the European Union' s competition policy.
The thirtieth annual report summarises the developments that have occurred during 2000. A quick glance is enough to realise that the competition sector has continued to show intense activity, with a total of 1206 new files, 564 cases of State aid, 345 mergers and acquisitions and 297 cases of monopolies.
Work in the legislative field has focused on reform of our basic rules and regulations.
This activity has led to approval of new regulations on block exemptions in horizontal agreement issues.
New guidelines on vertical restraints have been adopted, in addition to the new 1999 block exemption regulation.
You will know that these new formulations give greater weight to economic guidance.
The fact that the number of cases of monopolies has fallen may be due to these new rules on vertical restraints, which have substantially reduced the obligation to notify this kind of agreement, and this gives the offices more room to concentrate on the more serious and difficult cases.
Considerable progress has been made towards a reform of the competition rules, to which Parliament gave decisive support a month ago, adopting Mr Evans' s report by such a large majority.
On the issue of mergers, a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted, as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation, so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way.
On the issue of controlling State aid, the Commission has introduced, for the first time, three groups of exemption regulations: on the application of the de minimis rule, on aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on aid for training.
I accept Ms Riis-JÃžrgensen' s point about recovering illegal State aid, because I too believe it to be very important for overall credibility.
As regards aid levels, the general trend that they are falling is confirmed, although this does not alter the fact that they remain very high.
Allow me, Mr President, to highlight the fact that, in relation to State aid and contrary to what paragraph 2 of your motion for a resolution would suggest, the Commission has effectively already instigated proceedings against State aid in the form of tax facilities and, on 11 July, the number of them had risen to 15.
We are also intensifying our efforts to recover the sums wrongly paid out in the form of State aid.
Let me now point out three aspects to which we are devoting special attention, not only in the last annual report but also in our everyday operations.
The first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers.
I know that Parliament shares our opinion that the consumer should be the final beneficiary of competition policy.
It is certainly necessary to make consumers more aware of the benefits of competition policy and to inform citizens about our activity and the effects it has for them.
As you will have noticed, the report gives examples of certain decisions, showing the benefits resulting from them for consumers.
A good example is the decision against OPEL Nederland to defend the right of consumers to buy a car without hindrance in a Member State in which prices are lower; other, more recent examples are an analogous decision against Volkswagen and the setting-up of an enquiry into mobile telecommunications prices charged by roaming operators.
On the subject of cars, I accept what Mr Evans said: the Commission is working hard to draw up a proposal for the period subsequent to 30 September 2002, when the regulation for block exemption from the motor vehicle distribution agreement comes to an end.
I intend to present a new draft regulation by the end of the year, and I am sure you will be glad to express your opinion on it, given the extreme interest Parliament has so far shown in this subject.
With regard to consumer information, may I remind you of the initiative of the European Competition Days, which grew out of discussions in this Parliament.
After Lisbon, Paris and Stockholm, the next will be held under the Belgian Presidency in Antwerp on 11 October, and will focus on competition in the pharmaceutical sector.
A second priority we are working on - one which several people have mentioned this evening - concerns State aid, not only to make control stricter but also to make this subject more transparent through initiatives like the public register and the scoreboard, which is, in fact, readily available on the Internet.
The third priority area of work concerns globalisation: how competition policy, by seeking greater coordination among the various parts of the world, can make its contribution to the governance of globalisation.
In this respect - apart, of course, from the highly intense relationships within the European Union with the national competition authorities - outside the European Union we have set up close bilateral working relationships and begun most welcome and far-reaching cooperation in particular with the competition authorities of the United States, and last week we held an intense session of work in Washington, at which we planned further development of such bilateral cooperation.
I think, however, that the bilateral dimension is not enough, and we are proceeding, with all the weight of conviction that the European Union has in this area, to develop two forms of multilateral cooperation.
One is the proposal to introduce some basic, binding competition standards within the World Trade Organisation. The other is the recent initiative to launch a global competition forum to provide a venue for world-level discussions among competition authorities.
Among our short-term priorities is the work now under way of modernising the competition rules, which we have been carrying out with even greater conviction - if that is possible - ever since Parliament gave us that vote by such a decisive majority.
Within the year we intend to conclude the revision of the de minimis communication, which, by specifying which agreements between companies are not forbidden under Article 81, Paragraph 1, will reduce the burden on companies, especially smaller ones, of conforming to the rules.
Having already mentioned the exemption regulation on cars, I should also like to refer to the policy against cartels, which is a basic pillar of any competition authority. By the end of this year we shall have further developed and updated the policy of indulgence, based on non-prosecution or reduced fines for those who collaborate in disclosing cartels.
This is yet another area of convergence between the American and European approaches.
In the matter of controlling mergers, the Commission' s priority for 2001 will be to continue to re-examine the mergers regulation.
In this respect, during the year I intend to draw up a formal consultation document on this subject.
As for the way new cases are dealt with, our work is focusing particularly on the recently liberalised markets, which were mentioned particularly by Messrs Konrad, Evans and others, such as energy, air transport, telecommunications and postal services, in an attempt to prevent the former monopoly holders from abusing the positions of strength that they traditionally enjoyed.
I thank you all once again for the expressions of support and encouragement you have given to the Commission in matters of competition: you know how important it is for the Commission and for me personally to have the support of Parliament in our everyday work, and how seriously we take your critical comments, which we value highly.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
E-commerce and financial services
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0301/2001) by Mr Huhne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the
communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: 'E-commerce and financial services' [COM(2001) 66 - C5-0257/2001 - 2001/2119(COS)]
Mr President, financial services should be the big winner from e-commerce, because the sector does not have the problems of physical delivery, unlike booksellers or grocery supermarkets.
A financial service, whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account, is by its nature ethereal and intangible.
Many transactions in banking and stockbrokerage are already taking place online.
UNICE, the EU employers' organisation, estimates that nearly one-fifth of banking transactions in Europe are now executed through the Internet, direct dial, mobile phone, or digital television, nearly double the proportion in the US.
In the Nordic countries of the Union, the overall proportion is more than a third.
However, the vast majority of those transactions happen within an EU Member State.
Cross-border e-commerce in financial services is in its infancy and it has not chased prices down to the level of the cheapest Member State.
Indeed, the most recent survey suggests that bank charges vary more widely around the average than they did in the mid-80s at the beginning of the single market programme.
There is a lot still to do.
The e-commerce directive past last year was designed to encourage cross-border trade by enshrining the country-of-origin principle.
This is one of the essential market-opening principles of the internal market.
If harmonising rules is too difficult, at least recognise the right of any company to do business anywhere in the Union once authorised by one Member State.
The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier.
That is simply because the country-of-origin principle ensures the maximum amount of extra competition and extra competition is ultimately the consumer's best friend.
True, the e-commerce directive allows exceptions still subject to national regulation of incoming services, notably insurance in unit trusts.
In general, most of the liberally-minded market-opening fraternity were pleased to get it on the statute book.
As its full implications have sunk in, some Member States have been quietly attempting to restrict the scope of its application and backpedal on its implications.
This is the real significance of the Commission's White Paper on e-commerce and financial services.
It is designed to clear up the bits left out of the e-commerce directive and the report we are debating tonight is designed to support the Commission's resolve to open up the single market; if necessary, by insisting on the provisions of the e-commerce directive despite the reservations of some Member States.
We must maintain the liberal thrust of the e-commerce directive.
That means also setting a clear timetable to include both insurance and advertising of unit trusts in the general country-of-origin approach.
Insurance services, for example, are particularly suited to e-commerce provision.
It also means basing any guidance from the Commission to Member States about consumer protection on real documented problems, not on imagined ones.
Of course, there are real difficulties.
The Commission needs to look at these difficulties carefully and attempt to set out a clear road map to allow e-commerce and financial services to flourish.
Consumers are concerned about security, particularly with cross-border transactions.
Soft law provisions, alternative dispute procedures, should be made effective so that they can deal with the vast majority of problematic cases and we have asked for a regular report on that.
Some convergence of national rules on consumer contracts is clearly desirable, though this should not be used as an excuse to delay the single market.
Some standard features of terrestrial banking, like applying the money-laundering provisions by looking your depositor in the eye to ask where her or his money came from, require fresh thought in an e-depositing world.
It is also the case that financial services transactions are rarely entirely online without any offline elements, so we need to work as far as possible to ensure coherence.
The prize for getting this framework right is very great.
E-commerce and the euro can make a reality of cross-border financial services, not just for business but also for savers and the extra competition will, as it always does, bring long-lasting and real benefits.
So, I urge the House to stick to the line that we have set in the past in asking for opening up of this market.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure this evening, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to give our opinion on what is an excellent report.
We started work having the benefit of the full text of the rapporteur, Mr Huhne's report, and so our role was very much to improve on what we felt was already an excellent text.
From the perspective of the legal Affairs Committee, which was responsible for the E-commerce directive, we feel that the rapporteur's thrust - as he emphasised just now and in relation to the country-of-origin principle - is in line with our own opinion.
We would add our voice very strongly to that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in encouraging the Commission to move down this line.
I want to pick up a couple of points on our amendments.
We are very grateful to the rapporteur for accepting all of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee and to the committee for voting them into the final report.
We lay particular emphasis on the question of a payment and payment systems.
It is quite clear from recent studies across the European Union that one of the things that is deterring consumers from shopping in the electronic age is worry about the security of their payments.
This will be absolutely crucial if financial services are to move forward.
So we have suggested a number of methods for improving the security of electronic payments.
We have encouraged the Commission, particularly, to take a look at emerging forms of electronic payment.
While at the moment a very high level of consumer transactions are made by credit cards, we think that new formats will emerge and that the Commission needs to take that into account.
In conclusion, legislation has to enable contracts to be concluded by means of electronic signatures in financial services transactions.
We pointed that out as a specific area to be addressed.
This is a very good report.
I encourage the House to give it its full support when we vote on it tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Huhne, I, too, would like to add my congratulations to those of the previous speaker, Mr Harbour.
This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you.
I can already say that tomorrow we shall be fully supporting the line taken by this report.
There are at present two developments running in parallel that are very important for this field.
The Internet is growing in importance.
Trade over the Internet is growing more and more.
And on the other hand we are in the process of completing the internal market for financial services in Europe.
Our target is the year 2005.
Financial services in particular, because they are not material, are pre-eminently suitable to be offered internationally on the Internet.
I believe we will in the foreseeable future have a situation where customers buy insurance or banking services over the Internet not from a local bank but across the border in a neighbouring country and that the Internet is an excellent way of making comparisons in this field.
It is also important, however, that we win consumers over for this kind of commerce.
It is consumer protection that I am addressing here; competition has already been discussed.
But consumers will make e-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it, if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business.
I support the Commission' s initiative here of setting up extra-judicial arbitration procedures such as FIN-NET.
Only if consumers are convinced that any problems they have in future will be sorted out will they make use of the net in future.
The third thing was mentioned by the previous speaker: technical systems.
Many people are still afraid and have misgivings about using the Internet.
I still have myself.
I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that.
There are still reservations and inhibitions about that sort of thing.
Online and offline commerce are moving closer and closer together and we therefore need to harmonise the legal provisions here, too.
I can only back what the previous speaker has said, that we must abide firmly by the country-of-origin principle, that the Commission must stand firm.
Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow.
In smaller areas, too, however, like the abolition of national marketing and competition rules that stand in the way of the development of the Internet - fortunately, this was included in the report - we need to move forwards in order not to hinder development.
I would like to say in conclusion that e-commerce in this area will take a turn for the better, even if we may have gained a different impression from the stock markets in the last few months, but it will take off, it will continue to develop positively.
We need to make Europe fit for global competition, ensuring that in Europe, too, financial services can be offered in this way.
I therefore believe that this report shows the way and is a good step forwards, as is the Commission's support for it.
Mr President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on the report which he will present to us tomorrow.
We know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success.
Clearly the changing industry of financial services lends itself very well to the new technologies which have emerged and continue to emerge across the world.
The ability of consumers, confusing as it can be, to pick such technologies, to choose a variety of financial services within the individual Member States, has been with us now for some little time.
But the choice of financial products across borders inside Europe is even more recent an affair.
This means that services, rather than physical products - and the rights of consumers to have confidence in the performance of those services - is as vital here as it is for manufactured products.
The marketing and advertising of services, the claims and boasts of providers, must be checked against the need to allay the fears of risk to consumers, to safeguard their purchases and exchanges by electronic means.
This is why my group has so high a regard for the element of consumer safety.
The country-of-origin principle is simply the best agreed way of approaching the process of harmonising the standards for attaining an EU-wide application of the guidance for those standards which are to be expected in those nations.
At the same time Brussels, too, is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the Commission in this process.
The amendments before the House allow for the flexibility required to pursue the exciting new medium of technology, as does the text.
In particular I would like to recognise Mr Herzog's concerns, where he rightly points out in his amendments that we need to keep pace with technological change in order to reduce the possibility of criminality, of fraud and of money laundering.
My group believes that so long as consumer interests can be asserted and maintained as an essential element of the provisions of this report, then it is obviously going to be willing to withdraw any amendments that might suggest derogations or deletions to the country- of-origin principle.
The liberation of e-commerce is the element of any dynamic European economy of the future; the counterbalance that has to be struck and which has to be fully realised is the effects it has on those who would use it as consumers.
I commend this report to the House.
Mr President, the country-of-origin principle should meet the challenge of offering financial services electronically.
I have one comment to make.
First of all the scope for national policy.
The country-of-origin principle respects national legislation.
In addition, it is possible for Member States to deviate from the country-of-origin principle, but only on the basis of well-defined reasons.
That is why, in the report, the rapporteur might have provided more extensive reasoning with regard to the effect the principle has on national policy.
This would probably have prevented a number of unfortunate, socialist amendments from being tabled.
Furthermore, the report is based on the assumption that more competition can only benefit the consumer.
He should know the rules with which the supplier complies.
Otherwise, confidence in e-trade will not grow.
That is why the rapporteur might have been more specific in explaining consumer protection at European level.
If bottlenecks occur, it can become difficult to allow for exceptions because not all Member States will agree that there is a need for these to be made.
It is therefore useful to continue to monitor closely whether e-trade will be satisfactory to suppliers and consumers alike.
Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur very warmly on his report.
My colleague Mr Skinner has already indicated that our group will be able to withdraw most of our amendments if we can get clarification on one point that is very important for us and which is also concerned with consumer protection - and the rapporteur has already indicated a willingness to accommodate.
I am also willing to accept that members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have a responsibility for financial services in particular, naturally have a slightly different focus than so many members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
As a lawyer specialising in European law I do still often consult the EU Treaties.
Perhaps we should no longer do that so often.
Because when I turn to Article 50, which is about services that have not been harmonised, I read something about a market location principle, not a country-of-origin principle.
We are all aware that these provisions are creating a lot of problems today.
That is why Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has introduced the proposal to amend the Treaty.
If we are lucky, we will be able to do that by 2006 at the earliest.
But until then we shall have to come up with something to cope with this problem.
I think we have found the e-commerce directive to be very well balanced in its conception.
I was myself shadow rapporteur for my group at the time and I hold fast to the belief that by combining harmonisation, country-of-origin principle and a few exceptions, we have found a very well balanced solution that we should probably try to use in other areas, too.
I am not a believer in magic formulas or cure-alls.
We are now at last getting the Council' s Common Position on the distance marketing of financial services.
We shall all have to put our thinking caps on to find a sensible solution for dealing with the problems that the Member States have also seen.
I think we will make it easier for ourselves if we go for pragmatic legislation rather than fight over principles and stay high and dry.
The Commission takes heart from the broad support for the Commission's objectives in the field of e-commerce and financial services - support evidenced by the report of your Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
I welcome that report as being most balanced and constructive.
I draw strength from Parliament's clear commitment to the country-of-origin approach which, if I am not mistaken, has been supported by all who spoke on this subject this evening.
In particular I welcome the report's rejection of any attempt to roll-back the e-commerce directive in the area of financial services.
That is a position very much shared by the Commission and strongly defended during the negotiations on the distance marketing directive which, as Members may or may not know, resulted in a political agreement at last Thursday's Internal Market Council.
We will follow that line in future proposals and negotiations.
I should like to pick up on a few key points made in the report.
They are points which were also raised by various Members in the debate.
On the need for a road map setting out what needs to be done and when, in May the Commission published a financial services policy group report to the Ecofin Council.
That contains just such a road map and hopefully brings greater clarity about the way forward.
Amongst other things that road map sets out the concrete steps that must now be taken to enable the country-of-origin approach to apply across the board to cover those financial services currently derogated and to be applied to other traditional distance training modes.
In broad terms, that would involve further convergence in national consumer protection rules, in particular by updating EU legislation which predates the e-commerce directive.
On the Commission's guidance, where it is our aim to add transparency to situations under which Article 3(4) might be invoked, I should like to inform Parliament that this exercise was launched in July.
We are now in the process of receiving the first replies from Member States.
I should like to assure Parliament that it is not the Commission's intention for the guidance to represent a de facto additional derogation to the country-of-origin approach and that the guidance will be reviewed to take account of progress and further harmonisation of consumer protection rules, with the aim that it should become redundant by the 2005 Lisbon deadline for an integrated European market in financial services.
In respect of this point I would particularly like to say to Mr Radwan that earlier this year the Commission helped to put in place a network for the handling of cross-border complaints in financial services which ought to serve to raise still further the level of confidence of consumers who venture onto the Internet.
I hope that is to the liking of Mr Radwan.
May I further welcome Parliament's call for a single payments area in which it would be easy and cheap to transfer money across borders.
I should like to recall that in July the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation to align the costs of cross-border payments with those made at national level.
I can also inform Parliament that with a view to making payments more secure, the Commission in February adopted a communication on the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, which set out a three-year action plan.
This point was also raised by Mr Harbour and I should like to add that the Commission is looking into the possibility of refunds.
I will inform Mr Harbour later of the progress in this respect.
Finally, I take note of Parliament's interesting suggestions that the Commission should seek to negotiate mutual recognition agreements with third countries, at least with those third countries that provide similar levels of prudential supervision and investor protection.
The Commission finds that a very valuable suggestion and we should like to consider it further.
In conclusion, I very much welcome the draft report as its stands.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, for his strong support for the country-of-origin principle.
Indeed all speakers this evening have echoed this strong support.
I nonetheless express concern about a number of the amendments which were recently tabled by some honourable Members.
Several of the amendments, unfortunately, are not acceptable to the Commission.
They would shift the balance of this report unfavourably and undermine the strong support which Parliament has shown for the Commission's e-commerce strategy in the past.
That support was so manifest and so vital at the time of the adoption of the electronic commerce directive last year, when Members voted unanimously in favour of the directive and the underlying country-of-origin approach.
That is precisely the approach which the Commission, with the support of Parliament, would like to continue.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Internal market strategy for services
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0310/2001) by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the
communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: An Internal Market Strategy for Services [COM(2000) 888 - C5-0103/2001 - 2001/2052(COS)]
Mr President, I would like to begin by taking the opportunity to reassure Commissioner Bolkestein.
We have already said in the two interventions on the Huhne Report that most of our amendments have already been withdrawn.
Both of us have emphasised that here.
So far as I know, there are two amendments remaining.
The Commission can easily live with that and I hope the rapporteur can, too.
A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow.
Now to my own report, however.
We know from experience in this House that the agenda is very often changed. We are often glad about that to a greater or lesser extent.
This time there is a real point to it - my report was deferred so that the debate on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan could be held yesterday.
That is certainly more important than the further refinements we want to make to the internal market.
It also allows us to hold a kind of joint debate today.
The field of financial services, services generally and also Mr Radwan' s report, which will be debated next, go together very well.
I am sure we all agree that services generally as well as financial services and information services deserve our special attention.
They are rightly described as the key area of the European economy today.
Two thirds of Europe' s workforce are already employed in the service sector.
Above all, the dynamism and innovation that make this sector so important will enable us to achieve the objective set in Lisbon.
If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective.
I am sure we can support the Commission' s approach of identifying all the barriers in a first phase, listing all the obstacles encountered by service providers, and then in a second phase proposing suitable remedies.
But we have no time to lose.
We now have the remedy of treaty infringement proceedings.
In many cases, better information from authorities, professional bodies and similar institutions about the law as it currently stands could perhaps help to remove some unjustified obstacles.
In all but one of the urgent legislative measures listed by the Commission - I have to admit it is the reform of public contracting - Parliament has not been responsible for any undue delay on any other points.
The call for certain legislative measures to be speeded up should therefore be addressed primarily to the Council.
I have already mentioned that we have now at last received the common position on the distance marketing of financial services.
Discussions in the Council took a very long time.
I hope we can make up some of the lost ground in Parliament and make rapid progress.
Something else that has already been before the Council for a very long time is the two directives on the situation of third country citizens when it comes to providing services - employees on the one hand and self-employed on the other, where the introduction of a service provision card could make a major contribution to achieving freedom in the provision of services.
I am also sorry that the Commission itself no longer lists these measures as priority measures in this communication today.
Essentially, our differences of opinion are over which legal instruments will be suitable.
We should not rule any instrument out.
We will need further harmonisation.
I am sure we will be able to implement the country-of-origin principle on the basis of harmonised, coordinated, largely approximated laws in our Member States.
Article 50 of the EC Treaty will probably also continue to be used in a number of remaining areas.
I do, of course have a problem when harmonisation is automatically described as over-regulation and when the country-of-origin principle is to be used as a magic bullet, the cure all to solve every problem at a stroke.
Unfortunately, things are not like that.
We have to go this laborious way of finding the appropriate instrument for every problem that arises.
I would again like to point out that even in the e-commerce directive - important as the role of the country-of-origin principle is there, and I fully support the content of that directive - the regulating principle is not the only one to apply.
The amendments that have been tabled for tomorrow follow two principles: preserving freedom of choice of legal instruments, not confining ourselves to one instrument, and not making any sector-specific changes.
That is also in line with the Commission' s wishes, since it deliberately wanted to present a document applicable to all sectors.
Mr President, I would first like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and my colleagues Messrs Harbour and Beysen who, in the responsible committee, have done an excellent job of including and taking into account the views expressed by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on this matter.
I am very glad that the European Parliament is now about to take a decision on supporting the Commission' s proposed strategy for creating an internal market for services.
The need for this is enormous - for economic growth, for the advancement of companies, for employment and for consumers.
An internal market for services has for a long time been a missing element in a European growth policy, a policy which must also be supplemented by measures to speed up the liberalisation process in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy - something which cannot be said too often.
The Commission' s overall course of action is good.
We cannot continue with sectoral regulation of services, something which has so far proved to hinder, rather than facilitate, the creation of an internal market.
Ninety-nine per cent of European companies are small and medium-sized.
These employ 66 per cent of workers and generate 55 per cent of turnover.
Bearing in mind the significance of these companies for the European economy, it is necessary for them to be able to benefit fully from the internal market for services - a market which quite simply cannot function well without them.
It is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible.
What is known as the enlarged internal market for services must also be well prepared.
Finally, in order for this work to be a success, the Commission must not be left alone.
We have a major responsibility here in Parliament, but the Member States too have a great responsibility to involve themselves in the process and to work at political, legislative and administrative levels to remove obstacles to the exchange of services.
Without political will at all levels, the goal cannot be achieved.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Berger very much for her clear statement of support for this proposal this evening.
Those of you who have looked at the report will know that she withdrew her original explanatory statement.
I was delighted to hear this evening that she had confirmed her full support.
This report, with the support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and my colleague, Mr Beysen, and with Mrs Berger's assistance also, now strikes the right balance by giving the Commission a clear indication of the support of our committee and others for this important initiative.
I am delighted that Mrs Berger is going with the flow of that for many of us felt that her initial report really did not do full justice to what we regard as an imaginative proposal, a wide-ranging proposal, and one that is of crucial economic importance to the future of the European Union.
We must not ignore the continual structural change in the world economies, in particular in developed economies like the European Union.
We are seeing services and manufacturing business starting to converge.
We are seeing more integration of traditional service providers, with their manufacturing arms looking to focus on customers in a very different way.
Therefore, opening up the single market for services is going to be of great importance.
One thing I particularly welcome from the Commission's analysis - something it has indicated in the report that it will now do more work on - is that it highlights the importance of a highly competitive service infrastructure in the overall competitiveness of European industry.
So many businesses depend on high-quality, effective, low-cost, efficient services to deliver their businesses.
Indeed the whole of the electronic commerce area, which we talked about in financial services earlier on, is facilitating and opening up these sorts of markets.
Therefore, this communication is extremely welcome.
We look forward, in the Legal Affairs Committee as well as in the Industry Committee, to working with the Commission and to moving forward with the necessary legal framework and the other actions that will be necessary to achieve it.
I want to reinforce what Mrs GrÃ¶nfeldt Bergman said about the role of the small- and medium-sized enterprises in this sector.
Again we are seeing the combination of increasing importance of services combined with electronic commerce and the electronic means of delivering those services.
That is an area, particularly crucial in the business-to-business sector, where small- and medium-sized enterprises have a crucial role to play in the European economy.
Again, these provisions will help.
I refer back to the country-of-origin principle.
I share Mrs Berger's view that by a happy coincidence we have a set of reports tonight with a common thread running through them.
I do not regard the country-of-origin principle as a magic bullet to achieve market integration at a single stroke.
Clearly there is a lot of work to be done.
Yet, by operating the country-of-origin principle vigorously and consistently we will actually achieve competition and higher standards for consumers more quickly than by any other means.
Consumers are going to be well-informed and intelligent enough to know where the best standards of consumer protection are.
They are going to demand them from other countries.
This is not a question of harmonising down.
It is an effective means of making the market operate in the interests of consumers, which is exactly what Commissioner Monti told us in addressing the competition report earlier on.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attainment of a real internal market for services will afford the small and medium-sized enterprises added incentive for innovation - as was already underlined in the debate, in fact. It will also improve the competitiveness of European industry and will provide more benefits to the consumers who will be offered a whole series of high-quality competitive services.
I am therefore of the opinion that it is of crucial importance for the internal market strategy to build on the strength of the e-commerce directive and the principle of mutual recognition.
Mutual recognition forms the keystone of the European Union and the European internal market, in particular.
Mutual recognition is only possible if the consumer enjoys equivalent protection right across the Union.
This means that harmonisation is only required if this equivalent protection does not exist.
Furthermore, a business based in the Union is guaranteed completely free cross-border trade in services.
I therefore believe that the report, as it has now been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after inserting, inter alia, a number of amendments which I myself tabled, reflects and supports the Commission' s balanced approach.
Finally, I am delighted to find out that the Commission adopted a regulation on sales stimulation yesterday.
This shows that the Commission is really serious about further developing the internal market.
In the current economic climate, we cannot afford to lose momentum in the direction of a real internal market.
Mr President, firstly the Commission would like to emphasise the economic and political importance of its communication on a new internal market strategy for services, which I hope, will henceforth enjoy the European Parliament's full support.
A functioning internal market in services, far from being a reality, remains an objective to be achieved.
It is an objective which ought to be considered a priority if we really want the European economy to become the most competitive in the world by the end of this decade - the ambition we set ourselves in March 2000 in Lisbon.
Just to quote a single fact, services account for two-thirds of the European economy and, therefore, any progress we make on that front will greatly benefit the citizens of this continent.
Achieving that goal is rendered all the important by the growing dynamic of the information society, with all its potential for cross-border trade, and by the imminent introduction of the euro, which will increase the transparency of costs and encourage businesses and consumers to look beyond national boundaries for the provision of services.
Unfortunately, at present there are still too many legal and administrative obstacles preventing our businesses and consumers from considering the whole of the European Community as their true domestic market.
That means that we are failing to realise the enormous potential for growth and establish a framework in which millions of new jobs can be created.
At no other time in our recent history has it been more important to encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and opportunity.
Just as the 1992 campaign enabled us to focus on - and to a large extent achieve - an internal market in goods, it is now crucial for us to concentrate on dismantling the barriers to trade and services.
This new strategy seeks, above all to enable two groups - namely small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers - to reap the full benefits of the internal market.
In many instances, small and medium-sized enterprises - which Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen have mentioned also evening - will not have the means to establish themselves in all or several Member States.
If they try to do so, they will be faced with the need to expand their infrastructure and with extra financial and administrative burdens.
Therefore, they must be allowed to offer their services freely throughout the Community from their establishment.
As far as consumers are concerned, this strategy is designed above all for them.
We shall not have succeeded until European consumers have greater access to and a wider choice of, safe and reliable services at more competitive prices, and that means there must be more competition between service providers.
The strategy is the first attempt to apply, at Community level, a horizontal approach to trade and services since the General Programme for the removal of barriers to services of 1962 was introduced almost forty years ago.
It calls for the cooperation and support of national authorities, the participation of all interested parties and the active engagement of the Community institutions.
The report by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has highlighted many of the difficult issues preventing an effective internal market in services from functioning.
I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market shares the Commission's philosophy and supports its ambitious approach.
I also hope to be able to count on the full support of the European Parliament in implementing both the first and second phases of the strategy.
The first phase is now being carried out.
This means that existing restrictions to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment are being identified and evaluated.
In the second phase, legal and operational instruments for the elimination of barriers will be put in place and our approach will be based on harmonisation, assuring a high level of consumer protection combined with the principles of country of origin and mutual recognition enshrined in the Treaty.
Accordingly, the Commission would not welcome the newly tabled amendments.
Those amendments appear to run counter to the principles of mutual recognition and country of origin and, in the Commission's view, would undermine the positive and well-balanced approach of the report, for which the Commission is duly grateful.
