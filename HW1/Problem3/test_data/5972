It is vital that the holders of rights should enjoy equal protection throughout the Community.
Problems of consumer protection also arise in connection with health and safety issues.
The Internet helps counterfeiters, who can use it to market faked or imitation products around the world without any loss of time; it is evident that their schemes are increasingly tied in with organised crime, and I have to say that the number of products that have had to be taken off the internal market has recently increased to a disturbing degree, being, as a rule, faked versions of other products, so action to address the problem of counterfeit goods is of the utmost importance to the Community, and the vote here in your House is an important step in getting it underway.
The Commission is glad that your House accepts and endorses the general principle underlying this amended proposal for a directive, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Zingaretti.
As long ago as 2006, when - on 7 September that year - it adopted a resolution on the need for immediate action against counterfeit medical products, your House has been supportive of the Commission in its view that the sanctions available under criminal law need to be standardised as soon as possible.
The Commission is also glad to note that the committee's report envisages the same level of penalties as are already applied to serious crimes.
The Commission is, however, unhappy about a number of points that have emerged from the debate, firstly about Parliament's desire to limit the scope of the directive solely to the ambit of the Community's powers, and I have to say that that will result in serious difficulties when it comes to transposing the directive.
It also has to be said that the definition of the concept of 'right to intellectual property' does not appear to be adequate, since a whole array of aspects of it have been left unclear.
The definitions of the terms 'infringement on a commercial scale' and 'deliberate infringement of a right to intellectual property' do not ultimately bring any additional benefit; they are capable of being misunderstood and of undermining legal certainty.
In the interests of consumer safety and of our economy's competitiveness, I urge you to vote in favour of the Commission's proposal.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his kind words about this report.
This important directive is at last coming to the end of its legislative process, and I should first of all like to thank all those who have devoted their energies in recent months to a passionate and, in my view, extremely useful debate, starting with the shadow rapporteurs and all the staff, without whom it would not have been possible to address such complex subjects.
Much has been said about this directive; some of the comments have been well founded while others have missed the point, not least because these are highly complex subjects.
I believe, therefore, that it is important to make it clear what we are talking about.
This is a directive against organised crime and in the end, I must emphasise, against organised crime in both its traditional form and the form that it has recently been adopting.
It is, then, a directive against the damage that crime does to Europe through the counterfeiting of goods and the infringement of intellectual property rights.
During these months, many Members have asked me why we have to harmonise.
My answer is that organised crime has long been a global activity that knows no borders and that can count on vast resources. The law, in contrast, is fragmented into many, sometimes contradictory legal systems, and is therefore the weaker for it.
It has been calculated that over the last 10 years the volume of counterfeit goods has risen by 1 600%, and I believe that Europe needs to do something, because we are talking about a vast market and very real, material things, such as toys, clothes, shoes, food, cosmetics, chemicals, gastronomic products with false designations of origin, spectacles, compact discs, DVDs and other things, in other words all goods that European consumers buy every day.
As I have said, this activity causes enormous damage.
It damages Europe's industries, because of course counterfeiting changes all the most basic rules of the market and competition, and it harms workers, because of course those who produce counterfeit goods do so with complete disregard for the laws that protect the rights of the people making them, and because the counterfeit markets resulting from these criminal activities cause recession and unemployment.
Counterfeiting is said to have put 125 000 people out of work in Europe over the last ten years.
As a result, it damages the economy because of tax evasion, and it harms consumers, because here in Parliament we spend many hours writing regulations to protect European citizens but not fighting effectively against counterfeiting, and we have no means of enforcing these regulations.
One form that I regard as particularly serious is the counterfeiting of brands of generic medicines, which are often marketed in developing countries, and I am delighted that the executive secretary of the World Health Organization's anti-counterfeiting task force has spoken out in favour of the report, since it specifically refers to the health risks and rates the counterfeiting of medicines as being extremely serious.
I therefore believe that we have to go ahead with this.
I think the text of the directive introduces some important new points even compared with the Commission's text, and that we have reached a positive compromise.
I think it is important that the scope of the directive has been made clearer and also restricted, by excluding patents, for example, for which civil law remains the most suitable instrument for resolving disputes.
Although this is a highly controversial text, my view is that we must not stop and that we cannot escape from the reality of these arguments.
By harmonising our criminal measures we are taking a leap forwards in really developing the European single market, which is certainly helped by rules, but also by provisions like these which prevent the rules from being disregarded all the time.
Acting at this level therefore aids and strengthens Europe as a political entity, but most of all it strengthens the idea of a Europe that is useful to its citizens.
We are coming to this parliamentary vote in the comforting position of having received very substantial support for the directive at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
That is why I hope that a large majority will support this compromise, because powerful interests and lobbies are now hoping that the European Parliament will not do anything.
I believe, however, that it would harm our image and damage us politically if Parliament were to throw up its hands at such a devastating crime as counterfeiting and say that Europe could not do anything to fight it.
In the past, Parliament has been in the forefront in developing the single market and political Europe, and I am convinced that it will be there again this time.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) The text on which we are going to vote, the Commission's text, bears no relation to the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and bears no relation to the legitimate fight against the fraud and piracy that affects the health and safety of persons.
That is something on which we all agree.
However, this amended proposal on intellectual property rights is intended to criminalise the exchange of information and culture.
By voting in favour of the amended proposal on intellectual property rights, Parliament would be treating mafias in the same way as ordinary citizens.
Neither the issue of the intention to make profits nor the degree of criminality are clarified.
The scope of this Directive is indiscriminate and it lumps everything in the criminal field, though the civil is generally working well.
Furthermore, great legal uncertainty is created, leading to a hysterical witch hunt which flies off in all directions, frightens the citizens and paralyses the innovation of thousands of small and large businesses which should not be living in fear of going to prison, and we have already seen a massive negative reaction to this Directive on the Internet.
We cannot act in that way, contrary to the flow of information and culture.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, the lead committee on this report is that on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to which I in fact belong, and which concerns itself primarily with the rights to intellectual property, but I am now the draftsman of the opinion on this matter of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and propose to limit myself to considering it from that angle.
Commissioner Verheugen discussed our need for this piece of legislation, and it is indeed true that we do, but we should be doing more than merely constantly tinkering with the minimum penalty.
At the end of the day, adding or subtracting a whole year or six months to or from the minimum or maximum penalty helps nobody.
I am firmly persuaded - and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has come round to this view - that we have to make a start on working on the principle of precision.
We have put the case for this directive ultimately to include - irrespective of whether patents are included, which is, in the first instance, irrelevant - a positive list of its scope, so that the public - for whom the legislation is intended - do not get to read of some vague concept, but can see a list showing where and in what ways they can expose themselves to penalties.
In so doing, we are - as the Commissioner said - entering the realm of definitions.
If we now start, in civil law, to put together what is termed a toolbox, then we are also on the threshold of laying down similar definitions in the sphere of criminal law too.
There is no use fiddling with the legal consequences unless we also work on the definitions; that is what we must do, that is why this directive is a first step, and that is why I do not quite see the point of the criticism.
One starting point is the attempt at defining what is meant by 'commercial'.
We are trying to define the term 'intention', but please can we do this not only with reference to this area of applicability, but ...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as a shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to thank Mr Zingaretti for his successful report, and, above all, for his outstanding cooperation.
I should like to emphasise that our intention with this report should not be to make criminals of the EU's citizens when what we want to do is to punish the criminal gangs, organised criminals, and professional counterfeiters.
I myself see it as being of the utmost importance that there should be a derogation for private users motivated by personal reasons rather than by the desire for profit.
The compromise achieved in the Committee on Legal Affairs on definitions is, quite simply, a practicable solution, and, like my colleague Mr Wieland, I welcome the definition of 'infringement on a commercial scale' and of 'deliberate infringement of a right to intellectual property', as well as the positive list from which patents are excluded.
It also proved possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution to Article 3's description of the characteristics of offences, so that, firstly, every deliberate infringement on a commercial scale, thirdly, any attempt at such infringement of the law, and thirdly, aiding and inciting the committal of the act are considered as offences.
Since the oral amendment relating to incitement to the act originated from me, I should like once more to make it clear that the translations are problematic and that some of them are positively wrong.
It is intended that the fines should avoid causing disruption to national criminal law systems in their applicability to bodies with legal personality, and it is for the Member States themselves to decide whether they want to make such bodies liable to the sanctions of the criminal law or only to fines.
These are European rules, and every Member State may tighten them up, as some indeed already do, and we want to leave responsibility for that with the Member States.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the report by Mr Zingaretti on the amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights is a very balanced proposal that has obtained broad support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and also, to a certain extent, in the other committees that have dealt with the issue.
As Mr Zingaretti has pointed out, intellectual property deserves protection and I believe that what the Committee on Legal Affairs has done by means of the various amendments that it has presented is perhaps to tone down some of the terms favoured by Mr Mayer, who has just spoken on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Specifically, for example, it makes no sense to extend criminal protection to patents - to intellectual property - which in reality is protected in the civil field, given the complications that that may cause.
Neither does it make sense to criminalise a series of activities - those of critics, journalists, intellectuals or teachers, who, as a result of simple meeting, may end up 'behind bars' - or that of an innocent user of the broadcast media that Internet technology provides us with these days, as a result of which, by pressing a key at a particular time, one may find oneself accused of a criminal infringement.
I believe that it is important that we strengthen the criminal protection of intellectual property but that it should be done in accordance with certain principles so that criminal protection is not taken any further than is strictly necessary.
Criminal protection is always protection of an exceptional nature, since there are other legislative means for achieving that protection.
I believe that Mr Zingaretti's proposals - the proposal taken up in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the amendments that in the end have been presented jointly with Mr Mayer - enable us to restrict the scope of this criminal protection and that this plenary should therefore approve this report and support the appropriate amendments in the corresponding vote.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Zingaretti for his cooperation.
We have spent many hours discussing this issue, which is, after all, a sensitive one.
According to the OECD, counterfeit goods account for an annual amount of approximately EUR 600 billion worldwide, and it is mainly criminal organisations, operating on a worldwide scale, who are responsible for this.
Counterfeiting represents a major drain on tax revenue in government tax departments, because legitimate businesses do, after all, among other things, pay taxes and employ staff, and governments put those taxes to very good use.
Levels of employment are good, and we seem to lack the courage to intervene sufficiently in imposing real criminal sanctions and tackling the problem head on.
These criminal sanctions, however, should also, of course, be backed up by the raising of public awareness.
Customs should be able, in future, to put better and more effective controls in place, thus preventing sea-going vessels, such as the one in Hamburg that was loaded with three million pairs of shoes - all counterfeits from China - from slipping through customs without anyone noticing.
I think we should do something about this.
By the same token, the consumer must gain considerably more awareness, and this is why I have tabled an amendment to introduce the concept of the intentional handling of counterfeit products, which means that if a consumer deliberately buys products that are too cheap, they should know that they are buying counterfeit products and by doing so, prevent our society from working properly, and also hamper our economy.
It is unfortunate that we wish to spare consumers too much, because the funny thing is that in France and Italy, handling and buying counterfeit goods is a punishable offence and is counselled against on huge billboards.
Regrettably, we did not dare go this far.
It is also unfortunate, to my mind, that intellectual property in Europe is still being insufficiently protected, that there is insufficient awareness, because at this rate, we will never achieve the Lisbon objectives to become the world's most competitive, knowledge-based economy; I hope that we will carry on supporting customs and improving legislation.
In this respect, I would argue in favour of identical definitions worldwide.
If this is achieved, I will be satisfied; if it is not, we in Europe will become isolated, to the detriment of our economy and employment.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the mass importation of counterfeit products does a great deal of damage to the European economy, particularly to the production of quality goods, and I am indeed in favour of doing something to address this.
What is needed most of all is that it should be made possible for the big criminal organisations to which reference was made earlier to be better punished or brought to justice by means of European law.
On that much we all agree; it is on how this is to be accomplished that we have our differences.
I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Zingaretti for having worked very hard to bring about agreement, but we all need to bring particular precision to bear on this question, not least because we are standing, legally speaking, on really thin ice.
Further progress on this point was achieved by drawing on an environmental protection provision in criminal law, but that means that we bear a responsibility for approaching the matter with particular care and precision.
The idea behind European law is that through it we should deal with matters that the Member States cannot accomplish on their own, particularly in relation to criminal law, which means in this case the handling of the big criminal organisations.
For that we need a precise definition of what the scope of this regulation is.
If we leave it open - which is what some of us want - or if we include the consumers in it, we will end up taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut without being able to have any real impact on the big organisations that are doing European businesses so much serious damage, for the fact is that, in the absence of any precise definition, small-time entrepreneurs - who often do not know whose goods they are selling or from whence those goods come - can end up being clobbered by criminal sanctions.
It will be young people who are most affected by this.
Most young people in Europe cannot tell the difference between what may be downloaded from the Internet and what may not, and we certainly do not want to criminalise the end users.
We want to concentrate on those things that European law is meant to address, with everything else being left to national law.
To Mr Manders, who wants to raise consumers' awareness, I should like to say that, if you get your hands on a Gucci bag for ten euros, any consumer might realise what is going on, but that does not apply in the case of many other products.
I do not want European law to be over-zealously applied where it does not make sense to apply it at all; particularly in the commercial sphere, the areas of application must ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Zingaretti, for his cooperation and for somehow having tried to mediate on this directive, which applies criminal law to counterfeiting.
What it lacks, however, is a frame of reference consisting of the rules defining what counterfeiting is, and so it actually lumps together trademark, patent and copyright infringements.
Confusing counterfeiting and piracy with infringements of intellectual property is likely to make the fight against criminal falsification less effective.
Instead, it would have been more useful to limit the scope of the directive just to copyright infringements concerning the commercial production of counterfeit multimedia products, an area in which organised crime operates.
Extending it unduly to all copyright issues, however, may have a serious impact on the privacy of consumers of multimedia products.
Moreover, on copyright matters the directive abandons the concept of commercial scale and is liable to criminalise private, not-for-profit use by people who use the Internet for peer-to-peer file sharing, video streaming and so forth.
The directive forces Member States to start criminal proceedings even without a complaint by the injured party and actually gives private individuals a direct role in the investigations, which goes beyond providing the authorities with technical support and ends up becoming a driving, guiding role.
Lastly, the directive lacks any economic or social analysis.
Imposing tougher penalties in Italy has not had any effect.
That is why our group proposes that this directive be rejected.
Mr President, I speak to record my opposition to the EU's meddling in the criminal law of Member States to the monstrous extent of demanding new offences and dictating the level of penalties to be enforced in the United Kingdom and other states.
The nefarious Court of Justice decision of September 2005 gives rise to this intolerable infringement of national sovereignty.
Now we are seeing a programme of rampant expansionism of power by the Commission.
This directive is even more objectionable from the UK perspective because, for the first time, it would make breach of patent a criminal offence punishable by four years' imprisonment or more; not because the elected House of Commons thinks that it is necessary or wise but because the unelected EU Commission dictates it.
I object, I reject this intolerable EU interference and I therefore reject this directive.
(FR) Mr President, we all want to make progress and successfully clamp down on counterfeiting, which is economically, socially and culturally unacceptable, and Mr Zingaretti has worked hard to come up with this compromise proposal.
However, I am struck, in this debate, by the great confusion among those who, in defending consumers, scorn the rights of creators and performers and those who, at the same time, defend Community competence and want the national judiciaries to remain sovereign entities.
I believe that there are some real problems there that deserve to be looked at in more depth.
I have clear ideas about one point, anyway, and that is the cultural impact of this text.
I am referring to the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 that were adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
They propose definitions of intellectual property rights.
That is not the aim of the directive.
They propose a restrictive wording of intentional infringement and commercial scale.
This goes against the discretion of the national courts and, above all, in fact, it falls short of making peer-to-peer file sharing a criminal act.
The result is that the provisions, on the one hand, go against the acquis communautaire, particularly the 2001 Directive on copyright, and, on the other hand, present a considerable risk for creation and cultural diversity, by undermining the national laws that curb such behaviour, prejudicing as it does the rights of authors and performers.
That is why, in this instance, I support the wording of the original proposal by the Commission and, in any case, in our debate, Amendment 30 tabled by Mrs Bowles.
We are on very serious ground as far as cultural diversity is concerned.
(PL) Mr President, the directive on criminal measures to be applied in order to protect intellectual property represents a change to the Commission's stance to date on criminal law.
The proposed document reflects the interpretation of the European Court of Justice's ruling of 12 September 2005 adopted by the European Commission, and allowing the use of criminal measures at Community level, if they are necessary for the successful implementation of Union provisions.
In view of the increasing problem of infringement of intellectual property rights the world over, the Commission's proposed approach seems not only appropriate but also necessary.
Every year, the European Union's GDP loses approximately EUR 8 billion because of counterfeit goods.
Individual companies lose approximately EUR 45 to 65 billion each year for the same reason.
The scale of the problem is so great that it is estimated that about 40% of computer software in the world originates from illegal sources, along with 36% of the music on compact discs and cassettes.
Accordingly, we should welcome the fact that the maximum penalty for serious crimes committed as part of criminal organisations may be as high as EUR 300 000 and/or a 4-year custodial sentence.
It should be noted, however, that pursuant to Parliament's proposal criminal measures will only be applied to individuals and entities who knowingly infringe the law for commercial purposes.
The exclusion whereby the directive does not apply to infringement of the aforementioned intellectual property rights by private users who are not motivated by commercial gain is very important.
In addition, it seems justified to exclude patent rights from the scope of the proposed directive, as this will make it possible to avoid determining the content of future provisions in this regard and will restrict the scope of the directive in question to intellectual property only.
As I conclude, I should like to thank Mr Zingaretti, the rapporteur, for a very well-prepared document.
Mr President, I understand the purpose of this directive and the message that you wish to send out to other countries.
However, extension of criminality beyond that envisaged in TRIPS, that is significantly beyond counterfeiting and piracy, is a step too far, at least at this stage, and not one that any speaker has justified.
Many colleagues appreciate that infringement of a patent that has been assessed as invalid is a normal commercial activity.
However, this is not unique to patents: it applies to designs and trademarks as well.
I say this as someone who accumulated over 25 years as a patent and trademark attorney before becoming an MEP.
There are amendments that attempt to address this problem.
My own Amendment 31 restricts the scope to the TRIPS criteria - counterfeiting and piracy - or to when there is organised crime or a risk to health and safety.
Amendment 33 takes account of assessment of invalidity.
I can tell Mr Toubon that there will be separate votes on the individual parts of Amendment 30, which is there for a purpose other than the one for which it perhaps appears to be there.
To the Commission, I say that this is an issue that is too serious to get wrong.
I am afraid it is too serious to settle with 'there or thereabouts' compromises.
Therefore, I cannot vote for the proposal without the restrictions I have mentioned.
(SV) Mr President, there is a parallel proposal concerning serious environmental crimes - clearly defined crimes that do serious harm to people and cause death.
In spite of the clear objective, the proposal is controversial because the EU is entering the area of criminal law.
What we have here is a legislative proposal aimed at protecting commercial interests without risk to consumers and the environment.
In spite of that, this definition is much broader and creates legal uncertainty.
In its present form, the proposal is not about combating organised crime.
On the contrary, this law is in itself organised crime.
It is a crime against human freedoms and human rights and an attack on ordinary communication between consumers and companies.
Take the example of Betamax.
MP3 players can now be used for copying.
Is it, then, necessary to prove, before they go on sale, that MP3 players cannot be used to break the law?
Once the players are sold, will consumers be hit by technical restrictions and technical obstacles when they want to use the products, music and films they have bought?
The proposal is an absurd attack on consumers' rights and should be rejected in its entirety.
- (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am among those MEPs who fundamentally disagree with the report on the proposed directive concerning the use of criminal measures to enforce intellectual property rights.
I have three fundamental objections.
The first is the fact that the legal basis of this directive has not been clearly defined.
As everybody knows, we are still missing the long-awaited opinion of the Court of Justice, which should clarify the judgment of 13 September 2005.
The second serious problem concerns the fact that in its definition of intellectual property for the purposes of the directive, the report does not include patents and types, which are an essential component of intellectual property law, and without which the directive would not incorporate the systematic approach that is required for this issue.
The third reason is closely linked to the previous one.
The criminal justice aspects of the directive ought to complement existing Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, which deals with civil liability and administrative matters, and which applies to the entire body of intellectual property law, including patents and types.
There is room for wide-ranging discussion on the factors that led to the proposal to exclude technical solutions from criminal protection.
I fear, however, that pressure from influential interest groups unfortunately played a part in this.
Thank you for your attention.
(PL) Mr President, despite what has been said by other Members in this House, the proposed directive came about as a response to the increasingly widespread theft of intellectual property.
We know full well that current Union legislation does not provide for a Community policy on penalties to combat piracy and counterfeiting of goods.
In addition, there are considerable differences between the systems applied by the various Member States, as the Commission has rightly pointed out. This obviously hinders effective protection of intellectual property, which in turn has a direct negative effect on the value of investment in innovation.
I firmly believe that it is essential to counter these practices at the Community level.
If we also take into account that the counterfeiting of completely new products such as medicines or toys can be dangerous to life and health, the problem becomes even graver.
Clearly, counterfeiting products of all kinds also involves producing packaging and employing a range of individuals such as graphic artists and distributors.
There is too much for a single person to handle.
Well-organised criminal gangs are involved, and it is precisely their activity that the directive aims to hit hard.
The measures proposed in the proposed directive should be deemed beneficial.
Infringement of intellectual property rights is a crime that must be punished.
There is, however, scope for argument about the limits of responsibility, and especially about who is to be held responsible.
Those who produce counterfeit goods and place them on the market must certainly be punished.
On the other hand, it would be unacceptable to punish those who purchased or used goods or services unaware of their illegal origin.
The Commission's proposal does not define deliberate action in the context of infringement of intellectual property rights sufficiently clearly, and that should be remedied.
To summarise, adoption of the text of this directive is essential, and we must only regret that we are not in a position today to take the next vital step forward.
After all, it is possible to identify groups of crimes that it is particularly difficult to combat in today's globalised world, on the basis of dozens of different legal systems.
I believe that greater harmonisation of criminal law in the European Union would go a long way towards improving effectiveness, as today's debate confirms.
Mr President, it is 2007, so you can address me as 'Miss'!
I would also like to congratulate my colleague Mr Zingaretti, although he knows that we agree to disagree on this issue.
The legal base of the proposal derives from the Court of Justice.
The Commission interprets this ruling to be applicable beyond the case, and sees this ruling as a legal base for the harmonisation of certain criminal sanctions in measures aimed at protecting the internal market.
The reason I consider rejection of this directive as a whole is not because I do not believe in expanding the powers of the EU to include criminal sanctions.
I do believe in that.
However, I have serious doubts about the process leading to this increase of power, because a legal base is not the same as a political mandate.
Fundamental steps like this demand a thorough political debate and a clear choice on the matter in question.
Instead, we are about to take a great leap forward as a by-product of a single policy measure in a highly specialised and limited field.
I do not think this is the best way of pushing integration forward.
It also enforces the popular opinion held by many who see the European Union as an organisation which caters mainly for the interests of big businesses, which is not the case.
(ES) Commissioner, we should not play around with criminal law.
The Union can now exercise - and it is right that it should exercise - a new power that has been recognised by the Court of Justice: to take on the criminal dimension of competences that it has the right to exercise.
I believe that that makes complete sense and we should all support it.
But it must be done prudently, wisely and with legal skill.
And the text that we are discussing here has none of those three qualities.
It lacks prudence, it lacks wisdom and it lacks legal quality.
I say that with the greatest of respect for all of those who have been directly involved in drawing it up.
There is very little of it in this report.
The scope is excessive.
In an area as crucial as criminal law, the scope is entirely confused.
Notions of scopes are used that are not harmonised in the European Union.
Combating piracy, yes, of course, and under criminal law.
In that regard, we can support it.
Combating piracy in the criminal field.
To extend that to issues that have never been outside of the civil field in the Member States, however, makes no sense, especially when concepts are not harmonised and words do not mean the same thing, not even in the field of piracy.
It makes no sense to send out the message that the citizen is the criminal even when they are not acting for commercial purposes and their activities are not of any scale.
We must press forward, otherwise we will be guilty of fine words but no actions, Commissioner.
(ES) Following a long process, the European Parliament will finally approve its position on the adoption of criminal measures intended to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights, measures that I believe to be entirely necessary.
I would like to make a few comments from a cultural perspective.
With a view to promoting the development of knowledge in general and of culture in particular, we must recognise the dual economic and cultural value of creativity as a motor for the development of the arts, of science, of cultural diversity and of research.
Furthermore, in this era of increasing digitalisation and commercial liberalisation - of cultural goods and services as well - it is important to achieve an appropriate and fair balance between the rights of authors and the rights of users or consumers with a view to ensuring effective access to this progress in the field of culture and knowledge, at the same time combating piracy and counterfeiting within a context of greater Community harmonisation.
In this regard, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, particularly on the compromise reached on excluding violations for personal and non-profit-making reasons, since they do not deserve to be treated in the same way as a deliberate infringement of an intellectual property right committed on a commercial scale, which I do believe should be punishable in the appropriate manner.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful to you for the many valuable and important comments and suggestions made in this debate, and I would like to say something about a few of them.
The Commission's view on the limitation of the directive's scope solely to matters over which the Community has power is that this is essential if cases are to be covered both by Community law and by the laws of the Member States, for, if that were not to happen, the transposition of the directive could well meet with considerable difficulties in this area in which Community and domestic law are closely enmeshed, and the danger might arise of the public not knowing which law actually applied, thus compromising the rule of law.
The Commission takes the view that all types of intellectual property rights merit the protection of the criminal law, and so it is in favour of patents being included, without, however, any intention that this should present any political obstacle to the transposition of the directive.
While the Commission can accept the removal of patents from the scope of the directive, it does reject any amendment along the lines of Amendment 1 that might revive the debate about Community power over criminal law measures relating to patents.
With the exception of that of legal personality, the Commission has dispensed with definitions on the grounds of their superfluity or of their potential for legal uncertainty, and therefore prefers to give the Member States a free hand, allowing them to take decisions in accordance with their own laws and in the light of the measures they have already taken.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(FR) Faced with the increase in piracy and counterfeiting, it is essential that we work effectively to ensure that intellectual property rights are complied with.
Such protection must be accompanied by sanctions, because counterfeiting is unacceptable as much from an economic as from a social or cultural point of view.
Thus, by introducing criminal sanctions for all intentional infringements of an intellectual property right committed on a commercial scale, the European Commission proposal is in line with the recommendations voted for in 2005 on the future of the textile and clothing sector after 2005.
We can only pay tribute to the desire shown to fight to enforce intellectual property rights, which safeguard the competitiveness of our economies and the growth of industry and which drive the creative world.
Nevertheless, by proposing definitions of intellectual property rights, and by introducing a restrictive definition of 'commercial scale' and 'intentional infringement', the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs is undermining the principle of subsidiarity in criminal matters and is challenging the acquis communautaire on this matter.
The act of strengthening intellectual property rights within the European Union must preserve the national courts' freedom to interpret the two aforementioned elements.
We should therefore support the wording proposed by the European Commission.
(HU) The protection of intellectual property rights is a pre-eminent goal, especially since this sector contributes 5-7% of Europe's GDP.
Counterfeiting, piracy and infringements of intellectual property in general are part of an increasing phenomenon today, one that has taken on an international dimension and represents a serious threat to states and to national economies.
Differences between the various penal systems of different countries render the struggle against counterfeiting and piracy more difficult.
Beyond the latter's economic and social consequences, counterfeiting and piracy also cause problems with regard to consumer protection, especially where health and safety are concerned.
The growth in the use of the Internet makes it possible to see the immediate and global spread of pirated products.
Finally, this phenomenon is increasingly linked to organised crime.
The struggle against these violations is therefore of key importance for the Community.
There does indeed seem, therefore, to be grounds for a joint response at European level in the area of criminal law, so that perpetrators should not be able to take advantage of differences among the different national legal systems.
Generally and fundamentally I agree that the fight against the ever increasing and ever more serious acts in violation of intellectual property should make use of the instruments of criminal law.
I also agree that a possible harmonisation of these criminal law instruments, which are to be used as a last resort, is an especially important application of the principle of subsidiarity.
I consider it absolutely essential, however, that harmonisation at Community level of the criminal measures which may be used as a very last resort should be underpinned by thorough impact studies carried out by the Commission.
The Commission's annual strategic priorities (Budget 2008) (debate)
The next item is the report by KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Commission's annual policy strategy for the 2008 budget procedure, Section III - Commission.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, firstly I wish to thank the German Presidency and in particular Dalia Grybauskaitfor their excellent levels of cooperation, as well as the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and all the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs from the political groups.
The Commission communication on the annual policy strategy is the first step in drafting the new budget.
Parliament's response will be its initial position.
Firstly I want to speak about the communication's structure.
The Commission employs its own system of classification to define policy areas: prosperity, solidarity, security, freedom and the strengthening of Europe's position in global policy.
This division is difficult to follow because it does not correspond to the structure of the multiannual financial framework strategy any more than it does the budget.
For the sake of transparency this classification should be reconsidered in the future.
The Commission presents a strategy which concerns, for example, climate change and action in the energy sector.
The Lisbon Strategy is still important, as are the control of immigration and measures which make the Union a stronger global actor, but these are just some of Parliament's priorities.
Parliament's main objectives also include the successful completion of approved programmes, less bureaucracy and better, more effective and appropriate administration.
In connection with this year's budget it was agreed to review the deployment of staff.
This screening operation is supposed to be completed this month.
Parliament thinks it is very important.
Activity-based budgeting and management is the key to better administration.
It began to be developed after the resignation of the Santer Commission.
Parliament wants to emphasise how important it is to continue this development.
Only in that way can we boost efficiency, lessen bureaucracy and clarify responsibilities.
The annual reports submitted by the Directors-General are an important part of this.
Administration became central to this report because the Commission once again proposed several decentralised agencies: two executive agencies and another, the European Institute of Technology, for research.
In addition, the intention is to increase the funding of several agencies at the expense of operational appropriations.
Decentralised agencies are problematic because they are funded out of different budget headings and even programmes.
Their administrative expenditure therefore does not normally come under heading 5, which makes for a lack of clarity.
Secondly, the staff employed in such agencies will not necessarily show up in the EU budget.
For this reason, it is important to monitor total staff numbers in the EU.
Thirdly, the agencies' areas of responsibility may be unclear.
It needs to be made fully clear to the public who is responsible for what decisions. It is this very facelessness of decision-making which emerges as an enormous barrier when it comes to evaluating the confidence the public has in the European Union.
Fourthly, we have to ask how a hierarchical administration can benefit execution, if it does at all.
Thus, Parliament will be examining very closely the establishment of the new decentralised agencies and other administrative expenditure.
For all these reasons, Parliament and the Council in the trilogue agreed on a resolution to give attention to these matters and urge the Commission to introduce certain further measures.
Another problem is delays in programmes that have already been agreed upon.
The Commission has built a policy strategy for next year largely to delay programmes that have already been decided upon.
This kind of frontloading and backloading are uncalled-for, as the multiannual financial framework has only been in effect for a few months.
Programmes which have been decided must go ahead according to plan.
Moreover, taking funding from margins is a way to reduce further Parliament's opportunities, for example, to invest in pilot projects and preparatory actions, especially under headings 1a and 3.
Another danger is the continued growth in unspent commitments, RALs, which makes it harder later on to achieve policy objectives.
Parliament's policy objectives concern, as I mentioned before, the Lisbon Strategy, sustainable climate and energy policy, the swift implementation of structural and cohesion policy, firm immigration control, a proper information and communication policy, and a jointly agreed foreign and security policy.
We hope that the Preliminary Draft Budget will establish a fruitful basis for drafting next year's budget.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Annual Policy Strategy is structured according to the four strategic priorities of the Barroso Commission, which we agreed at the very beginning.
However, the changes compared to the previous financial year are presented by policy area in accordance with activity-based budgeting.
The Annual Policy Strategy serves as a consistent reference framework in the preparation of our preliminary draft budget and our legislative and work programme.
Of course it does not prejudge the final outcome, which will take into account the priorities of the European Parliament and Council.
The second element we would like to reflect is our screening exercise, which, at the request of Parliament, the Commission has just finalised.
It will be adopted in the Commission's meeting tomorrow.
However, I can already announce that the outcome of this profound and serious exercise is quite satisfactory, especially because we confirmed the needs for enlargement, which correlate exactly to the same amounts we and Parliament agreed in 2002.
The additional 1600 posts needed for new priorities of the Council, Parliament and the Commission will be covered only by internal redeployment.
That is a very good result of the exercise which we performed at the request of Parliament.
We will also take into account the concerns of both Parliament and the Council regarding the financing of the 25 decentralised agencies and, accordingly, we will adapt our approach in that PDB, which I will present to you next week.
Concerning the executive agencies - of which we have four and are proposing two more - the Commission, as always, will fulfil the conditions of cost-effectiveness and transparency before creating any such agency.
The Commission is open to discussing the issue with the European Parliament, including, as we said during the trialogue, any further improvements in the arrangements between Commission and the European Parliament concerning those executive agencies.
The rapporteur's report calls for a 'budget for results', and I fully share this opinion and approach of Mr Virrankoski.
Therefore, next Wednesday, as agreed at the Committee of Budgetary Control meeting, I will present the Preliminary Draft Budget, in which I will try to pursue and take into account and reflect as much as possible the views expressed in today's discussions.
I hope we have a successful start for our new procedure for the new budget year.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, one of the headings of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs states that we need to provide sufficient funding for the increasing number of common foreign and security policy (CFSP) activities.
I am hopeful that the Commissioner will apply the plans she has just announced for the coming week to the CFSP, too.
We have emphasised a number of policies in particular, for example the neighbourhood policy towards eastern and southern countries, a policy that must also serve to promote democracy and human rights there.
We have said that we regard the policy towards the Western Balkans as a priority.
In Kosovo, in that region, we are likely to have to make a significant financial effort in 2008 to support the civilian ESDP mission and the office of the International Civilian Representative.
We call for a clarification, as soon as possible, of the implications of that mission for the sustainability of the present CFSP budget.
A further topic is external energy policy.
We call for the gradual building of a common external energy policy.
On the subject of Afghanistan, parallel to improving the security situation, we need to provide adequate funding for the civilian reconstruction effort - this is the only way to win the hearts and minds of the people there in the long term.
Regarding Africa, the major EU-Africa Summit is due to be held in Lisbon in December 2007, and it is likely that the decisions we take there will have to be followed by action - which is very important also in terms of helping African forces settle African conflicts using African means.
We must also send out political signals in this spirit.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, this report on the Commission's annual policy statements gives the members of this House the opportunity to remind the Commission of a number of points which we set out in the financial perspective.
Firstly, we remind the Commission that achieving Lisbon Strategy objectives is, and must remain, the major priority.
I believe that by stimulating job creation, by supporting economic growth and by encouraging global competitiveness, the European Union has the potential to make itself most relevant to the lives of the European citizens of today.
Secondly, we must impress on the Commission the importance of ensuring that the budget delivers value for money.
I stress our anxieties regarding the establishment of agencies: we have great concerns regarding the accountability of those bodies, as we do over the efficient and effective deployment of human resources throughout the institutions.
Thirdly, in my view, as a matter of utmost importance, the Commission must apply far greater urgency in its efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance.
In this report, Parliament is calling for greater transparency and the Commission needs to do far more to strengthen the link between its legislative work programme and the budget procedure.
Finally, regarding the European Institute of Technology, I welcome the Commission's determination to achieve its Lisbon goals and I admire its vision and initiative.
However, there are two major anxieties which I wish to express.
Firstly, this proposal was introduced after the Commission had set out its spending plans in the financial perspective and therefore, inevitably, the introduction of such a major project will have a significant knock-on effect on other priorities.
Also, while I acknowledge that proposals are evolving all the time, it seems to me that as a coordinating body for best practice, there is a danger of duplicating the efforts of other coordinating bodies and thereby failing to make a sufficiently positive contribution.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to congratulate our rapporteur on his work and on the content of his report on the annual strategic priorities.
This report is the start of our budgetary procedure, and we share the bulk of the concerns and, often, the priorities, expressed therein.
I am going to dwell on two specific points.
This year, like every year, Parliament is outlining the priorities that it would like the European Commission to execute.
Among the objectives that Parliament plans to assign to the budgetary procedure this year is the idea of a budget focused on results, which in our view means clear objectives to enable these priorities to be executed meticulously.
I subscribe to this idea.
It is important that we show our desire for the Union's expenditure programmes to help achieve the political objectives that they are supposed to achieve, and this for several reasons: the achievement of these political objectives is crucial in terms of making the Union appear legitimate in the eyes of the citizens; we must support the Commission's plan to develop the 'Better Lawmaking' principle in its new initiatives and working methods; and lastly, I am firmly convinced that an effective administrative system for the Union must be provided with the necessary resources.
I must, however, express some doubts about the way in which the results of this exercise are used, and here I am addressing the Council, which is sadly absent.
I agree that more attention should be paid to the objectives and to assessing the results of the policies carried out.
I also believe that this assessment must go beyond the stage of simply providing information on the administrative process as it was previously, when part of the PDB.
Nevertheless, my group will strongly oppose the possibility of this assessment being used to underpin budget cuts in administrative decisions or human resources.
Personal accountability for the Union's operations is an important element of the activity-based budget approach.
However, if this accountability is to be transformed into initiative, the European Commission must be given the resources to act.
Finally, I should like to remind you of the importance that my group attaches to communication problems.
It should be remembered that the key aspect of the communication and information policy is to inform every EU citizen about the work of the institutions.
I therefore endorse the Commission proposal, which aims at launching campaigns on the Union's political priorities.
These campaigns will be able to be launched as soon as Parliament has voted on these priorities.
Nevertheless, we expect many things to come out of the hearing organised by the Committee on Budgets.
Its conclusions must underpin the drafting of a new communication policy.
Democracy is a difficult exercise, and information is one pillar of it.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I too should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, for a report that outlines very clearly some of the problems that we, in this House, see in the run-up to the Commission's presentation of the draft budget for 2008.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe agree that, via the budget, the EU should maintain its focus on the Lisbon Process in order also to be able to respond quickly when new topics such as energy and climate change crop up.
However, we must, of course, all flatly acknowledge that the budget framework is very narrow and inflexible. That makes it difficult to have all our wishes fulfilled.
That is why I would most sincerely call on the Commission to take an interest in Parliament's priorities.
The Commission is happy to lean quite heavily on Parliament when it is short of employees and money.
When, however, it is Parliament's priorities that are in question, matters immediately become more difficult. That applies in the case of both large and small matters.
A few years ago, for example, Parliament undertook a pilot project designed to prevent attacks on professional drivers and to guarantee them decent conditions when they take rests.
What is the Commission doing about this matter, the progress of which is being followed carefully by hauliers and professional drivers and their families?
The answer is: very little, indeed too little.
It is insufficiently responsive to the public and it is too arrogant.
If I have to go out and explain to my electorate that the Commission needs more employees, it will help quite a lot if I can also say that these employees will be genuinely interested in voters' concerns and wishes.
Tell that to your colleagues, Commissioner, when you come and ask for more employees.
I look forward to the forthcoming survey of staff needs.
We should also look into whether personnel policy is sufficiently flexible to allow political priorities to be implemented.
May I address one last matter?
The Commission has now already proposed a change to the financial programming for the period 2007-2013.
Appropriations designed to stimulate growth - and relating, for example, to buildings, bridges and railways - are to be channelled to agency personnel.
Legal policy appropriations are also to go to agencies.
The framework is tight, and a mid-term review of the financial perspective is needed.
That is already clear.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on the Annual Policy Strategy for budgeting for 2008, I should like to highlight three points.
Firstly, the rapporteur has adopted the right approach.
He suggests that the European Commission should prepare a 'budget for results' for 2008, thus ensuring optimum use of the limited financial resources available.
Secondly, the rapporteur is also right to draw attention to the fact that doing away with decentralised agencies and setting up new ones is certain to reduce the available margins in certain chapters of the multi-annual financial frameworks, thus reducing the operational funds in the framework of resources for individual programmes. As a result, the budget could become less flexible and implementation of certain operational programmes could be restricted.
My third and final point is that it seems the rapporteur's expectations of the planned review of budgetary expenditure between 2008 and 2009 are rather too high.
The idea that it will be possible to query the effectiveness of expenditure on the common agricultural policy on the basis of the review is quite unacceptable.
After all, the common agricultural policy guarantees food security for individual Member States of the European Union and for the Community as a whole. It therefore ensures the most important form of security from each individual's point of view.
It would be difficult to query expenditure for this purpose, because one cannot put a price tag on the provision of this kind of security.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the annual strategy proposed by the European Commission for the 2008 budgetary procedure must strictly execute the decisions of the legislature.
It must not tone them down.
Despite current events being dominated by climate change - I am referring to the Stern report and the IPCC conclusions - the Commission proposal waters down the concept of sustainable development.
It merely mentions the prosperity, solidarity, security and external influence headings, the content of which remains arbitrary.
One may recall at this point, Commissioner, our struggle to obtain, at the time of the financial perspective, a EUR 100 million boost for the protection of the environment, which the Commission immediately halved.
Whereas it was so difficult to obtain funds for the environmental programme, I note how easy it was to release additional resources to fund the Frontex agency as an instrument for combating illegal immigration.
These budget signals illustrate the extent to which our flexibility is limited by the financial perspective and demonstrate, once again, that the environment budget is being whittled away.
Despite the urgency and importance of the environment for our fellow citizens, this is a cruelly limited budget for tackling the challenges of the fight against climate change and the erosion of biodiversity.
Let us not forget that the Natura 2000 network should receive EUR 6 billion each year in order to function properly.
Despite these shortcomings, I should like to express my interest in the new European Commission initiatives under the 'external influence' heading.
The fund for renewable energy and energy efficiency and the global alliance on climate change must help the ACP countries, and Africa in particular, to embark on a form of development that integrates the environmental pillar and the social pillar more boldly than we have done, and thus to promote the concept of sustainable development.
Turning to a different subject, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is looking forward to the Commission report on medium-term staffing requirements.
Commissioner, our group has always been in favour of having a satisfactory and steady supply of human resources.
In the case of the executive agencies, we need to examine on a case-by-case basis whether programmes are carried out better with an executive agency, or whether we need to keep a centralised approach, as the European Parliament has demanded for LIFE+.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, says that next year's budget should produce good results.
It is a hard task to measure results, however; in practice it is impossible.
In evaluating results one needs to work on the basis of what would have happened if the EU had not used its budget funds for those purposes it uses them in accordance with budgetary procedure, and of which we are unaware.
Measuring results might succeed in some individual policy areas with regard to one single programme, but in terms of the budget as a whole it is a very ambitious task.
In fact this became clear during the time of the previous general rapporteur, when Parliament's demands for results gradually became less stringent the closer the date of the final drafting of the budget got.
A good start to improving results is the fact that last year there were fewer budget funds left unspent by the Commission than there had been for years.
The Commission seems to have improved the way it implements programmes.
It is to be hoped that this was not just a temporary improvement in the final year of the previous financial framework.
On behalf of my group I wish the draftsmen of a budget which is to focus on results the best of luck.
At the same time I would say that the grand total for the budget will probably be so small that the Union will not be able to take any significant steps forward as a new priority in energy policy as determined at the March summit.
Instead, money will be spent on the militarisation of the Union and europropaganda in the name of information and communications as before.
(DE) Mr President, when so few people gather together so late in the evening and everyone actually knows everyone else's arguments quite well already, I think one of us could take the liberty of giving a word of encouragement.
I believe that things are already starting to happen in the Commission's quarters - although we should like to see a little more.
I agree with the previous speaker that result orientation is a nice idea, but it is possible to be much more modest and yet almost revolutionary as far as you are concerned.
More specifically: it is still very hard for citizens to understand who in the Commission is doing what with how much money.
Which bodies are actually working for whom?
Just try to do a quick search on the Internet for the net contribution made by Germany last year or in 2005, for example.
It will take you a long time to find any information on this anywhere.
This also goes for information on, for example, what projects where are receiving what support.
I click on the country in an attempt to see what is receiving support in my region, but find no information.
This is unthinkable!
I am convinced that, if the relevant transparency were already a reality, whether good or bad, we would see a significantly better, higher-quality debate than we are seeing now.
I hope, of course, that we succeed in making a start, if this is prescribed at European level in the field of agricultural subsidies, for example.
There, too, however, there will be problems with practical implementation.
For the rest, I would refer to those after me who are going to speak about the agencies - this is another area in which we could show by example how to put transparency into practice.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to pay tribute to the mastery of financial management that the Directorate-General for Budgets has achieved at this stage in 2007.
Year after year, financial perspective after financial perspective, the Council puts the European Commission in a position that is very difficult to overcome.
Every year, the European Commission is obliged to cover increasingly ambitious objectives with fewer and fewer resources.
It seems that the Member States see the European Union as a perfect stage from which to satisfy their national public opinion, very cheaply, of course.
When the Member States discover concern amongst the citizens - about growth or about employment - they launch the Lisbon Strategy and tell the European Commission to look for the funding.
When they discover that the European public is worried about immigration or energy or global warming, they ask the Commission to look for funding for these spectacular measures.
The problem is that commitments remain and yesterday's priorities do not disappear just because other priorities are put before them.
At some point, sooner rather than later, the European Commission - despite its General Committee on Budgets - will stretch itself too far and all of this wonderful financial engineering involving 'back-loading' and 'front-loading' will not be sufficient to deal with so many priorities.
That will perhaps be the time for big financial decisions and let us hope that, when that day comes, the European Commission's political skill is a match for the financial skill it has shown today.
(SV) Commissioner, Mr President, the Commission's annual political strategy shows that we face major, and to some extent new, challenges.
I am thinking of the climate issue, which demands efforts in the fields of research, the environment and energy.
I am thinking of research and innovation, in which it is a question of creating a Europe that, in the spirit of Lisbon, can become as attractive to researchers as the United States and offer equally big opportunities for converting research results into jobs and production.
Creating the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) and a top-class European Institute of Technology are key issues.
I am thinking of the Balkans.
We have a candidate country, Croatia, which wishes to join the EU soon and which still has major security needs in Bosnia, and we have completely new countries, including Montenegro and perhaps Kosovo, which will require considerable efforts on the part of the EU.
I am thinking of democracy and communication, which require broader democratic cooperation between individuals, parties and non-governmental organisations.
In view of, for example, the elections to the European Parliament and the debate on a new treaty, 2008 must become a breakthrough year in terms of resources for the EU's new communication strategy.
The picture of what the EU does and wants must become clearer, especially in the Member States.
These challenges require the EU to be able to take political decisions, allocate budget resources and engage in activity whereby we can make advances.
To be honest, we still have a fair way to go, however.
The EU's budget is still inflexible.
It is difficult to change priorities and, above all, to implement new priorities, even if the principle of reassigning personnel to new political priorities is in the process of having an effect.
In the long run - and perhaps by no later than the mid-term review - we need greater opportunities vigorously to invest in new areas and correspondingly to cut back on others.
In today's world, there are increasing demands on everyone to adapt - and not only on companies, individuals and regions, but also on the EU.
Seven years, which is the period covered by our long-term budget, is plenty of time.
We must obtain better links between legislative work and the budget.
I believe that the European Institute of Technology (EIT) would be an example of such a link.
The institute is an excellent idea, but one that will become problematic if other research efforts have to be reduced.
I think that the regulations are still often both bureaucratic and cumbersome.
The obsession with form-filling and the degree of detail required for audits cannot be characterised as modern management, and the same applies to the administration.
There were many who took a keen ongoing interest in Commissioner Kinnock's ambitions in terms of flatter organisation, better personnel policy and increased gender equality.
We must now continue the reforms in the same spirit.
The Commission's annual political strategy pinpoints the right areas, but it is now a question of being proactive and implementing changes in these areas.
We must, then, dare to do more, and that is a role that Parliament might perhaps be allowed to take on.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to support the speech by our rapporteur on the budget, Mr Virrankoski, and also sincerely to thank him for the quality of his work and for the unwavering commitment to dialogue that he has demonstrated.
I shall confine myself, this evening, to four brief remarks.
Firstly, I should like the Commission to pay even greater attention to the budget reform rules in order to create an annual budget by activities that gives greater responsibility to each directorate and division in charge of its implementation.
Secondly, with regard to the agencies, the European Commission cannot, in its current state, plan to create new decentralised bodies without first assessing the budgetary impact on the Union's financial resources.
Thirdly, staff expenditure needs to be even more transparent and plans need to be made to deploy staff, with even greater attention focused on the legislative priorities of our Parliament.
I have a fourth and final remark with which to conclude.
If we want to rise to the challenges of globalisation and turn it to the advantage of our economy where employment is concerned, we need to work even harder to promote research and innovation.
However, until the European Union has access to more substantial resources, the European Commission will have to focus its efforts on the political and budgetary priorities decided on by Parliament.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur.
The Commissioner will have seen that the great majority of group spokespeople supports the course proposed by our general rapporteur for the 2008 budgetary procedure.
Besides the budgetary procedure, which starts with the preliminary draft budget of the Commission, we have indeed created many accompanying measures and complementary structures in recent years, such as the Annual Policy Strategy and the screening report that is to be presented next week.
We are also particularly obliged to the Commission for taking the initiative to present a biannual account of the actual implementation of the budget in public, including to this House, so that we all know where shortcomings lie, where improvements can be made and what the consequences are, including for the subsequent budgetary procedure.
This is extremely useful, and we should all make use of it.
Nevertheless, given the multitude of instruments, we must consider the possibility of further optimising their timing and interlinking with a view to making the best use of them.
We should work on this with great care.
I should have liked to see the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy not only setting out the issue of the old and new priorities mostly correctly in advance, but also giving precedence to the issue of better lawmaking, in particular, as the core of day-to-day work.
Mr President, if I may reiterate, with particular regard to budgetary aspects, we have just held two trialogues - on 7 March and 18 April - further to which we shall hopefully be able to give the issue of the agencies, the executive agencies, the joint undertakings and all the new administration that has been created a common basis in legislation, agreements, financing, cost-benefit analyses and discharge over the coming months. After all, there are various contradictions here that should not be tolerated in the long term in the interest of good governance.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Virrankoski, ladies and gentlemen, we are coming to the end of a debate that has, in my view, been highly informative. I should like to highlight a few of the most important points raised in the debate.
The first of these is the message that under no circumstances should we allow ourselves to be tempted to renationalise Europe by cutting human resources and the staff needed for the Commission to function.
This key concern, which was voiced here by Mrs Guy-Quint, is, to my mind, the most important consideration in the execution of the 2008 budget.
In this report, on which I should commend our rapporteur Mr Virrankoski, I wish to highlight point 8, namely the importance given to clarity, consistency and transparency in the presentation of the budget, on the one hand, and the fact that, on the other, we have an activity-based budget (ABB), which, with its financial nomenclature, is difficult for the reader to understand.
The EU's budget must be presented in a way that is perfectly clear and coordinated, and in which all headings can be read in different ways without the reader losing track of the overall picture.
This is a vital task, highlighted very well in point 8.
As regards the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should like to highlight point 12 on Iraq, which, rightly in my view, points out that European investment in the country lacks visibility.
It must become more visible by means of a development policy in places where it is possible to put such a policy into practice, namely in Iraqi Kurdistan.
Moreover, in relation to the rest of Iraq and in relation to the great mass of Iraqi refugees, Europe must take immediate action, as AntÃ³nio Guterres, High Commissioner for Refugees, said last week in Geneva.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the good, in-depth start to our annual procedure.
I agree with the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, especially on the strategic approach.
One thing is the annual budget procedure, which we are starting now for 2008, but at the same time we can also take more strategic approaches, for example looking at how to improve the annual budget procedure in general as well as relations between both institutions, because there are things which deserve improvement.
We need to make it faster and less bureaucratic, and we need to be more realistic as regards time constraints and the number of papers we produce.
Between the lines of today's discussions on the APS, as people involved in the budget we more or less have the same opinion, but we cannot rely solely on ourselves - things also depend on the environments in which we work together.
So we can improve, and I think we will achieve a great deal of mutual understanding, as we have in recent years.
I hope we obtain the best possible outcome for our 2008 budgetary procedures, but we can also try to attain some more strategy goals together.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch C6-0046/2007.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, and members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the work that has been carried out on this report.
I shall start by placing this proposal in its context.
Since the potato starch production quotas were introduced back in 1995, we have been trying to define a strategy that could secure, enhance and promote the development of this important sector.
However, over the last decade the European Union's agricultural policies have changed dramatically, becoming more market-oriented with the decoupling of most aid payments, and reforms of the market organisations in almost all sectors.
In spite of the existence of quotas, potato starch production exceeds demand on the European market with the result that we have to export about 40% of our production into the world market, usually with the benefit of export refunds.
Concerning the proposals that we are discussing today, it is of vital importance to preserve the stability of this very fragile sector while at the same time taking the fundamental changes due to the reform of the common agricultural policy into account.
The main objectives of the proposals are firstly to roll over the quotas for another two years, which will allow us to review the potato starch system in the framework of the health check.
An extension of four years, as you propose in your report, would not allow us to take the opportunity to go into details with this important sector in the health check, and therefore you will understand that we cannot accept this amendment.
The second main objective is to roll over the existing quotas, which have actually provided a relatively stable market for potato starch in the European Union.
I am aware that there have been repeated requests from some Member States for an increase in their quotas, and I have not forgotten the declaration made by the Council.
However, an analysis of the current market situation has shown that an increase of the potato starch production quotas should be avoided at the moment.
If we increase the quotas in a situation where we have over-production within the European Union, this would put even heavier pressure on the prices.
We should take the opportunity to take another two years as suggested, and then, in the health check, go into details to see what a viable future for our potato starch production could look like.
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, this is the fifth time the European Parliament is considering the regulation on potato starch production quotas.
I am proud to present the report on this regulation for the second time.
It was my pleasure to do so previously in 2005.
In practice, decisions are called for on two issues.
Firstly, on how long the system of limiting the production of potato starch should be extended for, and secondly on whether the production quotas allocated to individual countries should remain unchanged or be amended.
The European Commission has proposed maintaining the quota system for a further two years, leaving the quotas unchanged.
Many members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development pointed out, however, that two years is far too short a time period to allow for sensible planning. As a result, the Commission agreed to a four-year period.
As rapporteur, I supported that proposal.
It is a sensible one, because farmers and starch manufacturers should not have swift and immediate changes imposed on them at short notice.
Starch production quota amounts are a more difficult matter.
Two new Member States, Poland and Lithuania, pointed out as they already had them two years earlier, that the quotas allocated to them are too low in relation to their potential and needs.
Lithuania's quota is approximately 1 200 tonnes.
This is not enough to maintain even one plant, and as a result Lithuania has ceased to manufacture starch, although it needs to manufacture around 4 700 thousand tonnes and wishes to do so.
Poland is the largest producer of potatoes in Europe, or more precisely, in the European Union, but it has been allocated a quota of 144 000 tonnes.
This is several times less that the highest French, German and Dutch quotas.
In my capacity as rapporteur, I proposed increasing the quota for Poland and Lithuania.
Taken together, the proposed increase amounted to just under 40 000 tonnes, which is less than 2% of the total quota amount of 1 948 000 tonnes.
By a small majority the committee voted against this proposal, however.
Twenty members voted against it and 17 in favour.
As rapporteur, I am required to present the arguments of the majority, even though it is only a small one.
I am also bound to mention the arguments adduced by the minority that tabled its amendments.
There was widespread concern in the committee that increasing quotas could destabilise the market.
I believe these concerns are unfounded, for the following reasons.
Firstly, this is not a large increase, as it amounts to barely 2% of the total quota.
Secondly, the market has changed.
Although the quality of potato starch is higher, it is being supplanted by poorer quality cereal starch.
The share of potato starch in total production has decreased from 25% to 20% over the last three years.
This means there is actually a shortage of potato starch.
Thirdly, there is an imbalance in the relationship between the old and new Member States.
Ninety per cent of the quota goes to the old Member States, and only 10% to the new ones, even though the latter account for over 25% of the Union's human capital.
Fourthly, the quotas allocated are often underused.
As much as several dozen percentage points are not taken up at times.
If the crop fails, a shortage of starch on the market ensues.
This is not compensated for in subsequent years, at least not beyond the permitted compensation of approximately 5% of the quota.
Fifthly, the Commission itself has recognised the damage inflicted on Poland and Lithuania by the quota system.
Commissioner Fisher Boel is present in the House today, and two years ago she herself promised that account would be taken of the special circumstances of those two countries, but this did not happen.
Lastly, Europe must demonstrate solidarity not selfishness in response to the perceived needs of these two Member States that have suffered so obviously under the current system.
Certain issues were closed five years ago during accession negotiations, but this does not mean that we should remain bound by those agreements forever and ignore the economic changes that have taken place since then.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I conclude, I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 8, which could be the basis of a good compromise.
What it proposes is that if certain quotas are not used in a particular year, then the next year interested Member States, but only new ones, would be able to apply to the Commission asking to be allocated additional quotas up to the amount unused the previous year.
In this way, actual manufacture computed over several years would not exceed the maximum limit of 1 948 000 tonnes, and the new Member States would be able to request higher quotas.
I urge you to consider adopting this amendment, as it could lead to a sensible compromise.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, having taken the oath this afternoon, I intend, in my maiden speech, to address the issue of potatoes, starch potatoes to be precise.
This might almost have been foreordained, since I grew up with a father who used to like to read German children's books to me - something which might be to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's liking - and there would always be a story about 'Die Bedeuting der Kartoffel' - the meaning of the potato.
I have no idea who the author was, but my father enjoyed reading it to me, and the fact that my maiden speech is about potatoes cannot be a coincidence.
Joking aside, this Commission proposal is, of course, of major importance to a number of regions in Europe, including the north-east of my own country where the potato starch industry has generated considerable employment and production.
This sector, and therefore the producers and their regions, stand to benefit from clarity and certainty where planning and management in their individual businesses is concerned, certainly following the sweeping CAP reforms in 2003 and given the uncertainties associated with WTO negotiations, which are still in progress.
As somebody has already pointed out, when the current potato starch system was last extended, this House would have preferred it to have been for a longer period.
Whilst the Commission is now suggesting once again to extend by two years, the rapporteur turned this into three years and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was the last one to pipe in with its suggestion of four years.
This is, as I see it, a clear message in the direction of the Commission and Council.
In principle, there is support for the proposed extension, but ideally for a slightly longer period of time, so that those involved know where they stand in the next few years.
Knowing where you stand also means, in my view, sticking with the existing quota for that period of time.
In this light, proposals to extend quotas in individual Member States do not in any event enjoy our support.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, this is the second debate in the House this term on the issue of potato starch production quotas.
The matter was debated previously in May 2005.
Unfortunately, little progress has been made during these last two years with regard to increasing the potato starch production quotas for two new Member States, Poland and Lithuania.
Despite the European Commission's statement in 2005 that the quotas would be checked and requests for increasing the quotas allocated to those countries considered, nothing has been achieved in that regard.
I shall therefore repeat what I said in my statement two years ago, namely that the potato starch production quotas allocated by the Commission are not in line with the production capacities of Polish and Lithuanian plants, their supply of raw material and the increasing demand for starch.
Concern has been expressed that increasing production quotas amounts to opening Pandora's box, so that if Poland and Lithuania's quotas were increased this would lead to similar requests by the remaining Member States regarding other agricultural products.
It is important, however, to bear in mind the fact that the market for starch products is constantly developing, and that demand for these products is rising.
In addition, it has been noted that ever since Poland joined the European Union imports of starch and starch products have been steadily increasing.
There has been a notable worsening of the trade deficit for starch, and this is due precisely to the restrictions on production.
The European Commission's stance is that the World Trade Organisation negotiations are likely to lead to a reduction in the level of export refunds and a reduction of tariff protection for the import of tapioca starch, thus increasing the availability of starch on the Community market.
The Commission has not taken into account, however, that during the period when the quotas apply, that is to say for the next two marketing years, there is practically no chance of any of the provisions of a future agreement on agriculture within the World Trade Organisation being implemented.
The impact of multilateral agreements on the supply of imported starch on the Community market will therefore be negligible.
I trust Members of this House will endorse Mr Wojciechowski's report and that the European Commission will grant the requests made by the governments of Poland and Lithuania to increase their quotas.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, for an excellent report.
I would say that the potato is quite a tricky crop to cultivate.
Its annual harvest varies quite considerably and its price also fluctuates greatly.
The potato is also very well suited to more challenging regions, including the northernmost part of the European Union, and in that sense it is a very valuable crop.
On many farms it is clearly a cash crop.
For example, in my country around a third of potato starch is produced domestically and two thirds is imported, because the forest industry uses the lion's share of it.
Thus, when we examine quotas we would hope that this non-food use of the product will be taken better account of.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, this debate gives a pretty clear indication of the nature of the solidarity demonstrated by the old Fifteen in the context of enabling the new Member States to secure the production of potato starch, if only for domestic purposes.
Despite being a traditional producer of potato starch, Poland now has to import it.
A similar situation has arisen with regard to milk quotas for which the limits set by the European Commission are also less than domestic consumption.
The House recently debated the issue of soft fruits.
It became obvious in the Chamber how little the Commission cares about helping the new Member States to protect their markets.
The Commission is forever referring back to the accession treaties, which were negotiated under immense pressure and weighted against the new Member States where many quotas are concerned.
This makes it impossible for the new Members to compete on equal terms on the Community's markets.
Much is said in this House about the need for the new Member States to catch up in terms of development.
Action such as the Commission's insistence on maintaining production quotas which results in the closure of production facilities and in farms going out of business demonstrates that new Member States are not being treated as equal partners within the Union.
If Parliament rejects this symbolic amendment once again, it will prove that there are really two Unions.
All this also puts a question mark over the process of further enlargement of the European Union.
Perhaps it should be slowed down dramatically?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the quotas for potato starch were not laid down arbitrarily by the Commission, but were negotiated and undersigned by the Polish Government in the course of its accession - so there is an agreement that must be kept to.
I believe that, just as other nations have their sensitivities, the Polish soul likes to complain.
In my estimation, this amendment and the balancing-out arrangement will be adopted tomorrow.
As you will remember, the amendment has been adopted once before, but the Commission invoked technical difficulties with implementation.
That was the case again just now in committee.
I would ask that, when it comes to tomorrow's vote on the amendment - which does not concern an increase in the overall quota, but instead a balancing-out - you tell the people you have dealing with it not how it will not work but how it will work, and thus take a rather more positive approach.
This does not necessarily mean that the whole quantity to be balanced out will be made available; but showing goodwill on this - and possibly doing so within an appropriate timeframe - would still represent a reasonable offer on the part of the Commission.
(PL) Mr President, as we debate the potato starch production quota system we would do well to recall a couple of key factors concerning this market.
The arguments adduced by those opposed to increasing quotas, alleging potential difficulties for the market and the emergence of significant surpluses of potato starch bear no relation to reality.
In addition, the arguments relating to WTO negotiations are not very relevant.
One of the results of these negotiations is supposed to be the end of export refunds, probably after 2013, whereas we are discussing quotas for the next two years 2007-2009.
It seems to me that not everyone is aware of the wide and varied applications of potato starch.
I would remind the House that this starch is used in the food, feed, paper, pharmaceutical and textile industries.
It is even used in the steel industry too.
As the starch product market is growing, and the demand for many starch products increasing, I see no reason why the damaging low Polish and Lithuanian quotas should not be increased.
Incidentally, there are over 600 starch products
Mrs Fisher Boel, the quality of Polish starch products is high, and they can therefore compete on the external market.
Your declared aim is to make the Union's agriculture competitive at global level, Commissioner, but how is this to be achieved if production is restricted through low quotas?
If the signals from the market are that there is a growing need for this product, it would be appropriate to allow higher quotas for the countries requesting an increase.
In view of the fact that the 2003 reforms aimed to make the Union's agricultural sector more market orientated, the quotas should be increased.
. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to my fellow Member, Mr Wojciechowski, for his work as rapporteur on the quota system in relation to the production of potato starch.
I should like simply to focus my speech on the amendments aimed at increasing the production quotas for Lithuania and Poland.
Indeed, while I understand the basic principle of Amendments 5 and 6 and of Amendment 7 - which is the sum of the first two, since it concerns small producers - in terms of proposing to increase Lithuania's quota from 1 211 to 4 855 tonnes - that is, to quadruple it - and Poland's quota from 144 985 to 180 000 tonnes, I feel that, if adopted, these amendments would open up a can of worms and give other Member States the opportunity to ask for the quotas on their produce to be revised at the highest level.
I am thinking here of olive oil, milk, and an abundance of other products.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I shall do as I did in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and advocate the adoption of this excellent report, but without the amendments proposed for the part-session.
The way the schedule falls means that we are debating this evening, 23 April, in plenary, that we are voting tomorrow at 12 noon and that, between the two, we shall be holding a working group meeting within my group, on the subject of agriculture.
We shall discuss this issue further with our fellow Members in the meeting, because opinions are, all the same, relatively divided on these amendments - the shadow rapporteur, Mr Golik, would not contradict me on that.
No doubt, then, we will adopt our definitive position on these amendments tomorrow morning, before the vote.
(NL) Mr President, I, too, should like to compliment the rapporteur, and, at the same time, congratulate my new Dutch fellow Member, Mrs de Lange, on her maiden speech.
I did not know that the topic of potatoes was so pertinent.
I would recommend a period of four years to the Commission.
Why four?
I think that everyone wants some level of certainty, including farmers.
Four years is also a good block of time for assessing the sugar reforms, which at the moment, is anything but clear; there is an unmistakable connection between isoglucose and potato starch.
I think we will not know where we stand until four years from now, and this is why I am very much in favour of these four years.
While a few speakers before me said that they regarded Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's amendment as ideal, I am not so sure about that.
How can you predict this year's harvest on the basis of last year's?
Quotas cannot be transferred from one year to the next.
If this is done anyway, even if the quota is too low one year and too high the next, it is of limited use, because a farmer can never predict production.
In this light, I do not know if the amendment is technically viable.
(PL) Mr President, the potato starch issue is being debated by Parliament once again, and it will go on appearing on our agenda until fair and responsible decisions are taken.
Potato starch will remain a problem as long as the largest producer of potatoes in the European Union, namely Poland, continues to suffer as a result of starch production quotas and as long as the Commission continues to disregard Parliament.
I would remind the House that two years ago the European Parliament almost unanimously supported the idea of reallocating quotas unused by the old Member States to the new Member States.
The Commission has failed to act on that recommendation.
Now it is saying no again.
This comes as no surprise to Polish Members of the House.
Commissioner Fisher Boel always says no when Poland is involved.
Her aversion to Poland and Polish farmers is pretty well common knowledge.
She does not show any mercy to little Lithuania either.
The refusal to grant Lithuania an additional allocation of barely 3.5 thousand tonnes of starch goes to show how the strong can get everything they want in this Union of ours whilst the weak are reduced to begging.
Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's words today testify to the fact that some Members of this House are capable of thinking in terms of society as a whole and of understanding the underdog.
I am very grateful indeed to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for that.
(LT) A situation has developed that I would call paradoxical.
Such things should not occur among partners.
Because of low starch quotas, factories in Lithuania are standing idle, and people are out of work.
The quota allotted to Lithuania is ten times smaller than what is needed in the country.
Therefore, starch has to be imported, while Lithuania's production lines stand idle.
At the same time, there are countries where the starch quotas are excessive, and are not being used.
Should this be tolerated in a common domestic market?
In relation to the time period under discussion, the quota of 1200 t of starch production allotted to Lithuania means that factories are only working at 9% of their production capacity.
Therefore, EU institutions were asked to increase the production quota, which would have created conditions for economically worthwhile operation of the factories and a continuation of the potato-growing tradition in Lithuania.
A negative reply was received.
An increase in the quotas for Lithuania and Poland would in no way harm other Member States, and it would be very important for Lithuania's economy.
It would also be a display of solidarity and shared interests.
(PL) Mr President, today's debate on the potato starch production quota system is a splendid example of the truth of the saying according to which the rich never understand the poor.
It is hard to understand why when production quotas remain unused in certain Member States they may not be reallocated to others states whose quota allocation is too small.
It is even harder to explain this to farmers.
Why should the misgivings of Union bureaucrats take precedence over the logic, needs, and solidarity of the Member States of the European Union?
If farmers in Denmark, France, Italy or Germany were to be badly treated, their Polish colleagues would stand shoulder to shoulder with them.
The quota increase proposed by the rapporteur will not harm anyone and will not result in budgetary changes either.
Failure to implement it will make it abundantly clear, however, that the Union is governed by the principle according to which 'what is yours is mine and what is mine is untouchable'.
Is this really what we all want?
(PL) Polish MEPs have been raising the issue of an increase in the potato starch production quotas for Poland and Lithuania with the Commissioner ever since Poland joined the European Union.
At the Council held on 30 May 2005 the Commission actually stated that it was prepared to consider Poland and Lithuania's submission in this regard, but only after the two-year period of validity of the present production quotas.
This period is almost over.
We are now debating the Council regulation on the matter but neither the Council nor the Commission has any intention of abiding by earlier statements.
There are at least three reasons why starch production limits should be increased for the new Member States, notably Poland and Lithuania.
Firstly, in the framework of the current potato starch production quotas as much as 90% of the quota is allocated to the Fifteen, and less than 10% to the ten new Member States.
By contrast, where potato production is concerned, the old Member States account for only 70% of production, and the new Member States for as much as 30%.
Secondly, starch production in the new Member States takes place in small processing plants, which play an important role in the local economy and the development of rural areas.
Increasing production quotas would therefore make a significant contribution to reducing unemployment in those areas.
Thirdly, there have been major cutbacks in agricultural production in the new Member States, affecting both the plant and animal sectors.
These cutbacks impact negatively on the development of rural areas.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, this has been a very interesting debate, clearly showing that there are huge differences between different Members of the European Parliament as regards the possibility of modifying the starch quotas for two Member States: Poland and Lithuania.
It has already been mentioned today that these quotas were allocated to the new Member States on the basis of historical production.
They were accepted by all of the new Member States, including Poland and Lithuania.
We have to bear in mind that we have to be very careful to keep the market balanced.
I would not want to upset this balance, and nor would other starch-producing Member States.
I think that the proposal of a two year rollover allows us, as I said previously, to include the discussion on the future of quotas for starch in our health check.
It will also allow us to analyse the first effects of our sugar reform, where sweeteners, also based on cereal starch, will now face fierce competition from out-of-quota sugar in the chemical and fermentation industries.
I am quite sure that this might have a knock-on effect on the starch market, leading to additional pressure on the potato starch market.
Finally, I want to react briefly to the point raised by the rapporteur about the reallocation of unused quotas.
This has also been included in a new amendment.
It is obvious that this proposal will lead to an increase in overall potato starch production.
Therefore it has to be seen in connection with the supply situation of the potato starch market, where, as I said before, currently 40% of production has to be exported.
It also raises the question of equal treatment, as quotas are fixed by the same method for all Member States.
I think that the Member States that have generated this shortfall want to benefit from the carry-over.
So the Commission will not support the idea of a four-year rollover.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Written statement (Article 142)
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, can one expect to sort out the world's problems without first putting one's own house in order?
In the European Union's case this thought springs readily to mind, if we consider how the problems of the new Member States are dealt with.
We are today debating yet another problem experienced by the new Member States.
In this instance the difficulty relates to the potato starch market and only two countries are affected.
The figures clearly indicate that the current organisation of this market is artificial, unfair and fails to take account of the real situation.
Poland is the leading potato producer in the Union, yet it has become an importer of potato starch.
This is not because it is unable to manufacture starch, or that its starch is too expensive or of poor quality.
Poland is importing starch as a result of political decisions on the size of quota allocations.
We should be ashamed of these decisions, because they are irrational and nonsensical.
They have led to a situation in which poorer quality cereal starch is replacing better quality potato starch.
Should we really be making the Union a laughing stock and losing credibility at global level?
It has been said that clever people correct their mistakes whilst the stupid thrive on them.
The current starch quota allocation most certainly classes as a mistake.
I am confident that the Union is capable of correcting it.
The construction of the enlarged Europe is often reminiscent of building a house from the roof down, instead of up from the foundations.
Damages actions for breach of competition rules (debate)
The next item is the report, by Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Green Paper on Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, the existence of economic freedom, the functioning of the internal market and the sustainability of European development are inextricably linked to the competition policy.
Since the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago, its importance has continued to grow.
Competition is an indicator of European vitality and excellence, a key policy in terms of fulfilling the Lisbon Strategy and achieving the Union's objectives.
Anti-competitive infringements make the game unfair, impact on flows of exchanges amongst Member States and damage confidence in the rules.
They reduce the Union's dynamism and results.
It is important that we have dissuasive and reactive mechanisms.
Infringements have been dealt with principally by means of public actions of an administrative nature.
The centralisation of the application of Article 81(3) - through a priori control by the Commission, toned down by means of the exemption regulations from the 1980s onwards - was a victim of its own success; the demand for more and better competition revealed its economic inefficiency and its legal shortcomings.
The role of private actions was stressed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities when the 2001 Courage v. Crehan judgment recognised that anybody could have recourse to national judicial bodies in order to claim damages resulting from the actions of the infringer.
The modernisation of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of the Council put an end to the Commission's monopoly and recognised a more open system, applicable in a decentralised manner by the administrative authorities making up the network of Community competition authorities and also directly by the national judicial authorities.
The possibility of private actions is nothing exotic, but rather a return to the classic jurisprudence according to which Community law imposes obligations on the States and on private individuals, and has vertical and horizontal effects that require judicial protection.
Their use in the Member States - according to a study ordered by the Commission - is extremely diverse and entirely underdeveloped - unlike in the United States, where nine out of every ten application procedures are judicial.
The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Commission's publication of a Green Paper to identify the obstacles standing in the way of private actions and to find ways to remove them.
In an advanced system of competition, public action against the impunity of infringer undertakings should be backed with private actions against immunity and indemnity in relation to the damages suffered by the victims of their actions.
Facilitating private actions will make the competition rules more effective.
The arguments for it include both efficiency and justice.
The imposition of fines is insufficient unless accompanied by private actions to prevent the infringer from gaining advantage compared to competitors as a result of the infringement and to compensate the victims of the damages caused.
The report takes the view that public and private actions form two pillars with the complementary aim of safeguarding market discipline in the public interest and protecting the private interests of players on that market.
The application of Community competition law by administrative and judicial authorities must not lead to any lack of uniformity in its application.
Judgments must not be allowed to vary according to the authority making it.
This is a crucial point.
The Community acquis and the effectiveness of leniency programmes must be maintained, public and private actions must be coordinated and cooperation amongst all of the competent authorities must be intensified.
The report proposes a Community model in line with the Union's legal culture, which takes account of the Member States' legal traditions.
It opposes a slide towards the US model, since it is not in favour of introducing that model's peculiar characteristics, such as judicial bodies consisting of non-professionals, 'class actions', punitive damage payments of three times the damage occasioned, strict requirements on the disclosure of documents and the system of lawyer's fees and litigation costs.
We must compensate for imbalances and ensure that liabilities are met, without violating the principle of equality of arms or artificially stimulating litigiousness.
The aim is to encourage the rational use of legal actions and not judicial activism, and above all to promote the amicable and early settlement of disputes.
Community competition is an exclusive competence of the European Union.
National administrative and judicial procedures do not alter that and they must not prevent the existence of common guidelines for penalties, in accordance with the principles of better legislation.
I shall end by thanking the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Doorn, for his valuable cooperation, the shadow rapporteurs for their help and the Members who have tabled amendments for their contributions.
I appreciate the constant and exemplary dialogue maintained with the Commission during the drawing up of the report and I would urge the Commissioner to carry on demonstrating her commitment in the next White Paper.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, Honourable Members, we are here tonight to debate an issue of fundamental importance: rights.
The Court has been clear: the right to damages is necessary to guarantee the effectiveness of Community competition rules.
But consumers and business customers do not use their rights.
Injuries are left uncompensated, while society and the economy absorb the loss: that is just reality.
That is clearly unjust, incompatible with our Community of law and at odds with our shared competitiveness objectives.
The European Commission and, I believe, most Members of this House will not tolerate this situation.
Our Green Paper set out the problems.
Finding appropriate solutions requires a very careful, measured approach, grounded in European legal traditions and developed through dialogue with stakeholders and, in particular, with Parliament.
That is why the Commission will present a White Paper, accompanied by an impact assessment, for further discussion around the New Year.
Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo's report provides a wealth of pertinent input into this process.
I congratulate the rapporteur wholeheartedly and thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for all their work.
I also thank Mr Doorn and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs for their contribution.
We will give most careful consideration to all Parliament's recommendations in preparing the White Paper.
I am aware that some are concerned that fostering private damage actions might lead to a US-style litigation culture.
We will certainly take this into account in drafting the White Paper.
But the scales are currently tipped against the victims.
Carefully balanced European solutions need to be found.
Common solutions that meet the strict tests of proportionality and subsidiarity should only be developed where national rules do not guarantee the right to damages effectively.
I have also heard it said that more private actions will create additional costs for business.
We heard similar arguments years ago as regards the 'polluter pays' principle for the environment.
The fact is that today cartels and other abuses cause huge but hidden costs.
Empirical research shows that international cartels raise prices by over 20%.
Recent cartel decisions by the Commission covered synthetic rubber, gas-insulated switch gear and acrylic glass.
All these cartels increased input costs for business and harmed European competitiveness.
The time has come to introduce the 'competition-infringer pays' principle.
Let us not forget that, whilst some industries have to create some pollution to do business, in the competition environment there is no need and no excuse for infringements.
Infringers may not like having to repair the damage they cause, but they should simply not break the rules in the first place.
It is their choice.
I believe that making sure businesses and consumers do not lose out because of the illegal behaviour of some companies is worth fighting for.
I sincerely hope that this week Parliament will send a strong message of support for this objective.
We will discuss the detail together later, on the basis of a White Paper that will be balanced and measured and subject to the vigorous and very valuable scrutiny of this House.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (NL) Mr President, I think it is now the third time that I am addressing this House on the topic of competition law around midnight.
I am not sure what the reason for this could be, but it is uncanny that it should evidently be regarded as, in some sense, a nocturnal topic.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I should like to make a few observations.
The fundamental question is as to whether citizens and businesses that have sustained damage as a result of infringements of cartel law be entitled to damages I think they should, and so does the Committee on Legal Affairs.
We think that in such cases, there should be a right to damages in the Member States, which should provide for procedures of this kind, although how they organise them is up to them.
In some Member States, the government will need to establish first that an infringement has taken place.
In other Member States, this will be done differently, but everything in accordance with the Member States' procedures.
After all, there is also the question of whether procedures of this kind can be imposed from Brussels on Member States in the first place.
You may be able to persuade them that these need to be introduced, but whether they can be imposed is, to our mind, a different matter altogether.
This is not, after all, about cartel law, but civil law, which, like criminal law, is a preserve of Member States, something in which the European Union cannot intervene.
This is why we have serious doubts as to the possible legal basis that should underlie European legal measures in order to introduce procedures of this kind.
The same applies, in fact, to all those other questions and observations in the Green Paper that pertain to the furnishing of proof, for example the hiring of experts or group activities.
These are all examples that fall within the scope of national civil law, in respect of which the European Union cannot prescribe any legislation.
These are the principal observations that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs have made.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner indicated during her address that she was looking for Parliament to give a strong measure of support to action in this area.
I want to make it clear, on behalf of my group, that we welcome the publication of the Green Paper and we are looking forward to the publication of the White Paper.
We think that people's rights in this area are not properly applied and, certainly, we want to ensure that more is done than is currently being done.
However, as the Commissioner herself has indicated, that is going to require a delicate balance, not least for the reasons that Mr Doorn has outlined, and because of the hearing organised by Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo, in which we devoted half a day to considering these difficult issues.
For my own part, I am very committed to regarding progress in this area as an integral part of the whole of the Commission's agenda in terms of modernisation of competition policy, so let nobody be in any doubt about our encouragement of further action by the Commission.
However, as the Commissioner has made clear, both within Member State governments and amongst the business community, there is real concern to avoid the experiences of the United States.
It is not good enough just to say 'we are not going to do what the United States did', especially when, it must be said, after giving a considerable amount of detailed consideration to the issue, Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo's report goes into seeking to resolve, as it were, all these difficulties by changing the burden of proof, introducing punitive damages - at least in relation to cartels - and cost-free litigation, confusing EU and national competences, changing the rules in relation to disclosure, and cutting out of the assessment of the costs of this litigation any principles in relation to subsidiarity, proportionality or whether there is a proper legal base.
Therefore, when people ask why we are concerned about this report, it is because it has become a Christmas tree with too many bells hanging on it.
We are in favour of opening the door, we are certainly not in favour of encouraging a process which may lead us down the US route, against the wishes of the Commission and against the wishes of all of those who have worked on this report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is happy to embrace the initiative taken by the Commissioner in this Green Paper.
This is the very reason why we would argue that it is wise not to specify at this stage that the scope of a number of points should not be looked into further.
We want the Commission to be given ample opportunity to examine a number of things properly and to follow them up with impact assessments to study their effects.
After all, I can imagine that with regard to the Green Paper, we too will reach the conclusion that that is not the most obvious route to take and that indeed, a number of things need not be further elaborated or fleshed out; we do not wish to take a decision on this at this moment though.
This is why we are calling on the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to reconsider a number of those points or possibly to provide a formula which leaves slightly more room for what the conclusion should be, so as to in any event give the Commission the opportunity to look into this further.
We will then also look at our own amendments in a critical light.
I would hereby like to invite you to take another closer look at this tomorrow.
As for me, I should also like to address this point from a Dutch angle as we in the Netherlands are having a heated debate on this very topic at the moment; finally, people are experiencing what competition policy at European level means and how we fight these cartels, because in a recent Dutch case, the Commissioner has charged high fines to beer brewers.
This is, of course, a topic on which the whole of the Netherlands assumes to be an authority.
It was a very telling example, because this beer cartel involved price agreements among beer brewers, who also have enormous influence on the hotel and catering industry and as a result of which people, the eventual customers, paid over the odds for their beers, something which was already subject of discussion in the Netherlands ever since the introduction of the euro.
This example, though, demonstrated once again that the fines that are then levied are first fed to the European Commission before they are channelled back to the Member States, and do not end up directly with these consumers.
Hotel and catering entrepreneurs are likely to take legal action against these beer brewers to see if they can recover any of the damage, but this is of no use to the consumer, the end user.
In that sense, it is very interesting as an example to see how headway can be made; after all, the eventual end user is being conned by cartels of this kind.
This example also proves my point, and so I should like to call on this House to keep the door open and to find out how we can let the consumer, the end user, benefit more from this cartel policy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, when we first discussed the Commission's Green Paper, I felt like a kind of latter-day Cassandra forecasting all kinds of woes.
Perhaps I fared better than Cassandra in that you, Commissioner, and the rapporteur took some of my concerns seriously - I hesitate to call them 'predictions'.
My concerns, though perhaps only gently - maybe too gently for some of my colleagues - are embedded in the report that we are debating.
So I can support giving you scope to explore the options of both follow-on actions and stand-alone actions.
I can share a vision of mutual recognition of decisions, but I make it clear that that lies in the future, not right now.
My main remaining reservations concern the question of how much of a carrot has to be offered to get the system to take off, particularly for stand-alone actions.
And you may note the report on that subject that has just come out in the UK.
If the carrot is too large, whether for the consumer, the lawyers or competing companies, I fear that, however we craft our rules, we are at risk of being pushed towards some of the worst aspects of damages actions that we hear about from the United States.
I say 'pushed' because that is how it happens.
Nobody goes there voluntarily.
With the whole of the EU as the territory for the victor, a very fine balance has to be struck.
Another of my priorities would be to ensure that actions are well founded and that we do not end up with the kind of blackmail actions that happen in the United States.
I agree it will be difficult to get it right and account will have to be taken of national differences in legal practice and tradition, but if we can succeed it will be a very useful tool and well worth having.
I look forward to the White Paper too, but I warn you that I may not have put my Cassandra's robes away yet.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, you have a difficult task ahead of you because I can see that opinions will differ greatly on both sides.
On the one side, you will have the support of a number of consumer associations, which will welcome your proposal.
On the other side, you will have many interest groups, which will denounce the risks of such an approach in the field of competition law.
Nevertheless, since you are proposing an initiative in an area of yours relating to anti-trust, you are operating at a level at which the Commission's inaction will no doubt be challenged less than it would elsewhere.
I am thinking in particular of the way in which the Commission assesses a given merger proposal.
In the area of anti-trust, there is, in a way, more scope for a broader agreement between the Member States and the public players.
The basic idea, then, is to supplement public action with private action.
We are still only at the preliminary stage, and we can clearly see that the path will be full of pitfalls.
There are those, like Mr Doorn, who imagine that the Commission does not have to give its opinion on initiatives in this area, because all of that is meant to come under the civil law of the Member States.
Then, there are those - I believe that all of this evening's speakers have voiced opinions along these lines - who are worried about the potential for such an initiative to be abused and, when we think about abuses in this area, everyone has in mind the abuse of the US system, where the victims whom the defence claims to help are in reality - if I dare say so - the cash cow of the legal professions.
Clearly, no one in this Chamber wants to see European competition law engage in such a scheme.
You have announced to us a White Paper, and you have announced to us an impact study: once again, we shall examine your proposals with the aim of helping you, with the desire to make competition law better able, by way of these proposals, to address Europeans' concerns and to fulfil what they might normally expect from a just application of competition law.
Once again, however - and I am not the first person this evening to have said this - anything that is liable to involve us in an abuse of procedures that helps put money into professions which, incidentally, find many other ways of guaranteeing turnover, would not have our support.
It is in this spirit of openness and with the concern, often demonstrated in this Chamber, to protect consumers' rights, that we shall support and examine your proposals.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her initiative, and the rapporteur for his report.
I want to concentrate on possible consumer actions, so-called collective or representative actions.
These should not be the big bogeyman for business that they are often portrayed as.
If we want informed and responsible consumers who do not need over-nannying by the state, then the companion of that approach of treating consumers like grown-ups is that we must allow them to take action together to get redress.
After all, why should the state alone be the enforcer in anti-competitive matters?
It is the consumer who loses as a result of anti-competitive behaviour, but often gets no redress or compensation.
There is nothing astounding in proposing this: the right to take action is already acknowledged by the ECJ.
What we have to do is to facilitate this, make justice accessible to those who lose and ensure that compensation is distributed in an equitable manner, not just to the privileged few.
This has to be the complementary approach to having informed consumers, giving them real power through increasing justice and redress.
Indeed, this should assist the better functioning of our internal market.
Consumers are often the best judges of what is anti-competitive.
We should have no fears about harnessing this force for the general good.
Everyone is absolutely clear that we do not want US-style class actions, so now is our unique opportunity to design something European which respects European values of our society and justice.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, over 40 years ago in van Gend [amp] Loos, the Court gave EU market players and citizens the rights they need to play a central role in our European project.
The legal environment in which the victims of antitrust infringements currently find themselves is not acceptable.
I got the message that everybody agrees on that.
I would like to thank you for the stimulating debate here this evening on how we might gradually improve this legal environment, and I look forward to Parliament's vote on the report.
So far, so good.
I would now like to respond to a few issues raised in our debate this evening.
Mr Doorn raised the question of legal base.
That is important and quite clear.
At the stage of a Green Paper, and in the absence of any Commission proposal, it is rather premature, if you will allow me to say so, to discuss the question of legal base at this stage.
The Treaty offers appropriate, specific and general legal bases for measures in this area and I imagine that we could agree upon that.
However, a pertinent base, and hence the applicable procedure, can only be identified in line with the nature, objectives and scope of any individual measure possibly envisaged after the White Paper.
I will, however, consider the extent to which it may be appropriate to say something about legal bases in the forthcoming White Paper.
So, there is still something to look at there.
I am aware of the need to be sensitive as regards national procedural rules.
There is no doubt about that.
That is quite a clear warning.
On substance, we already have one uniform European competition law, and by their very nature, breaches of the antitrust rules have a cross-border impact because they affect our internal market, and that is what we are protecting.
It makes sense to me that the right to compensation should also be equally enforceable throughout our internal market.
It is only to the extent that the procedural rules of the Member States do not guarantee effectively the substantive rights conferred by the Treaty that the Commission may seek some approximation of these rules.
Any measures proposed would have to meet the strict tests of subsidiarity, proportionality and necessity.
The White Paper will be accompanied by an impact assessment, as I have already said.
Mr Evans mentioned the need to avoid encouraging a litigation culture and the risk of unmerited claims being brought.
The Commission is encouraging a competition culture compatible with our existing European legal cultures.
We will pursue a measured and balanced approach, because like you, we are determined to avoid opening the door to the excesses which some other jurisdictions have experienced.
But fear is a very bad adviser.
None of the key characteristics of US antitrust litigation is suggested as an option in the Green Paper.
Many of those of support facilitating damage actions, like Mrs Bowles, stressed the need to avoid tilting the scales too much in favour of claimants.
However, these same commentators also recognised that the scales are currently tipped against the victims of antitrust damages, and hence that something should be done.
The Commission is striving for a proportionate and measured approach developed in consultation with stakeholders.
Mrs Wallis mentioned collective actions for damages claims.
Given the costs of litigation, it is unlikely that individual consumers will bring small-value damages claims against the perpetrators of competition law infringements.
So it is worth looking at options for collective redress, as she rightly mentioned.
The Green Paper looks at representative actions brought by consumer organisations.
So let us be clear - and I repeat - US-style opt-out class actions are not on the agenda and will not be on my agenda.
In opt-out class actions, lawyers act on behalf of an unidentified class of persons and mainly pursue their own interests.
In representative actions, the latter have no separate interest different from that of the injured parties they represent.
The Commission thus believes that the interests of consumers are better served by a representative action than by an opt-out class action, and I hope this will also reassure Mrs BerÃšs.
Your involvement signals the importance of the debate launched by the Green Paper, and is a reason for hope, as we are all aware that there is something to be done.
There is no doubt about it: the devil is in the detail.
I should like to leave you with two key messages.
First, I hope that this House will send out a strong signal that the current situation is not acceptable and that is what I have got from you.
This is all about rights, and this House has been a consistent supporter of rights across all policies and all areas of European cooperation.
We have to give European citizens and European businesses the ability to exercise their rights under European competition laws.
This is an area in which the Community can show its relevance to the daily life of citizens and to business.
Second, it is by working together in dialogue, through ideas and constructive criticism, that we will be able to make improvements, at the same time avoiding the known pitfalls.
I look forward to taking this process forward with the White Paper at the turn of the year.
Thank you for the interesting debate and thank you especially, rapporteur, for your hard work on this important file.

The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.

Decision on urgent procedure
Proposal for a Council regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products - C6-0032/2006 -.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, very quickly, I call on all of the groups to reject this request for application of the urgent procedure, which is totally unnecessary.
On the one hand, we are talking about a regulation that will only come into force on 1 January 2009, and, on the other hand, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is doing its job perfectly well.
It addressed this issue during its last meeting and it will address it again on 7 and 8 May with the aim of making progress in our discussions with the Council.
There are still two plenary sessions to be held right here in Strasbourg before the end of the German Presidency, and we have taken things well in hand.
We are continuing our discussions.
There is therefore no need to vote in favour of this request by the Council to have the urgent procedure applied.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)

rapporteur. - (ES) Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kallas, we are finally reaching the end of the budgetary procedure for 2005, which was preceded by its drawing up, its approval, its execution and, subsequently, its discharge.
I must say that, from a budgetary point of view, 2005 has not been a bad year.
It has been a difficult year, with the European Commission and the College of Commissioners having to face rather difficult circumstances, since this was the first full budget of the enlarged Union and, furthermore, the first budget entirely executed by this new College of Commissioners.
I must therefore begin by saying that the European Commission has not done a bad job.
I therefore propose that we grant discharge for implementation of the Community budget for the financial year 2005, and that is what will be put to the honourable Members in the vote.
That does not mean, of course, that there is no strong and well-founded criticism, both of certain directorates-general and of a structural nature, and with regard to some of the issues of financial control which should be improved by the Commission over the coming years, which may be very difficult to resolve.
I would also like to point out that the Commission has reacted well to the report by the Court of Auditors and has moved forward several lines of its new action plan which I hope will allow for positive control over the coming years.
I have essentially based my resolution on the issue of national declarations.
National declarations on the management of Community funding are very important to this Parliament.
They were created in 2003 and they are intended to offer a guarantee that Member States have effective auditing systems for Community spending.
Furthermore, they should be signed by someone with a degree of authority at national level and, though the Treaty states that the European Commission is responsible for managing the budget, we must not forget that 80% of it is managed in the Member States.
We therefore believed that it was necessary to launch a new initiative on national declarations.
We support what we believe to be the courageous initiatives of certain Member States - and I point in particular to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom - which have launched, within the Council, these ideas on national control declarations which may not be followed by other Member States, since their territorial distribution and organisation is different.
It is a step forward, however.
What we propose in the report is that the form that future declarations may take be left open so that they can reflect the realities of the political systems of each Member State.
As a fundamental idea, however, we in the European Parliament want these national declarations to go ahead, because that will be the only way to provide the Member States with some genuine responsibility for control of Community funds, which is the true basis for this statement of discharge.
Furthermore, there is a very important issue relating to national declarations.
The DAS, as we MEPs see it, is a road that leads nowhere, and those of us who have followed the statements of assurance very closely have known that for twelve years.
It is impossible today to establish the legality of underlying operations in the Member States, particularly in the Structural Funds.
We must therefore do something to improve the quality of auditing and the involvement of the Member States and we are therefore asking the Council for a national declaration of management that covers all co-managed funds, based on the declarations of the different national bodies responsible for the management of spending.
Finally, Mr President, although my report covers other things, I believe that we could achieve a positive DAS over the coming years, which is necessary for the Community institutions and, in particular, crucial for public opinion, which wants to see reliability, transparency and control right down to the last euro of the public funds managed both by the Commission and by the Member States.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report is about the discharge of the Parliament budget, about which there are four points I should like to make.
First of all, I should like to share something that we have been articulating for years in different discharge resolutions, namely that Parliament's discharge does not only involve the management of the Secretary-General or that of the administration, but also policy and the decisions made by administrative bodies in our House, such as decisions taken by the President, the Bureau and also the Conference of Presidents.
Moreover, we do not grant discharge to Parliament's Secretary-General, but to its President.
In this sense, the paragraph according to which the President of Parliament should actually be available to the Committee on Budgetary Control during the discharge procedure to talk about the discharge in a public and formal debate, is, to my mind, of huge importance.
In this respect, I prefer my wording to the amendment tabled by Mrs GrÃ€ssle and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
In fact, I think that Mrs GrÃ€ssle's amendment is at odds with what we approved last year with the Ferber report.
Secondly, buildings policy is important.
A huge sum of money is at stake, and I would draw your attention to the dispute between Parliament and the Belgian Government in this respect.
Years ago, the Belgian Government guaranteed, as did other governments in countries where Parliament has buildings at its disposal, that the land and the land development costs would be reimbursed to Parliament.
There is now a dispute about this very point in Brussels, and the sum involved is around EUR 15 million.
This is a huge amount of money.
The Belgian Government has failed to deliver in this respect, and this is why I, in this resolution, would urge them to make amends, because this would be a shot in the arm for our negotiators, the President of Parliament and the Vice-President responsible for buildings policy.
In the resolution, I have also drawn specific attention to the impact Parliament has on the neighbourhood in which we stay in Brussels.
The residents experience a great deal of nuisance in terms of traffic, work and living conditions, and I think that consultation between Parliament and the local residents is of vital importance.
I think we should be good neighbours, and consultation is important in that sense.
I would like to see a report issued on this subject by next year's budgetary discharge.
My third point - a very thorny issue - is the voluntary pension fund, which, at the moment, suffers an actuarial shortage of EUR 28.8 million. This is a huge amount of money.
I have to say that the shortage is dropping, because last year, it was EUR 43.7 million.
This voluntary pension fund, as it stands, contains the total sum of EUR 202 million, which has been invested in the stock market.
We all know that the stock market can be a risky business and that results on the stock market are not always positive.
A stock market can be fickle.
There is every chance, therefore, that great losses will be incurred with this money.
Hence the request for low-risk investments and for implementing what we already decided on in a huge number of resolutions, namely promoting ethical investments.
In the 2005 Budget, Parliament boosted this voluntary pension fund by EUR 11.4 million.
That too, is a large sum of money, and it strikes me as normal for the list of end beneficiaries to be made public.
We would ask for the list of end beneficiaries in the agricultural world, which makes huge inroads into the European budget, to be made public.
Everyone is in favour of this.
This is what will be done, as is evident from a website.
So why do we stand on the brakes when our own MEPs are involved?
Surely this has to stop?
From the nominal list, I noticed that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats submitted four amendments to have certain things deleted and I also noticed that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament applied for a number of split votes.
That is their democratic right.
I suspect that it is the intention to vote all these paragraphs out.
Well, for the sake of transparency, I should like to announce at this stage that I have applied for nominal votes, because that way, the Members who vote against will have the opportunity to justify themselves before their electorates.
I at any rate find it unacceptable that, at the end of the journey, Parliament will need to foot the entire bill.
This is unacceptable and smacks of poor management of money and public funds.
Finally, I should like to draw your attention to a Kyoto-plus Plan.
In the fight against climate change, the European Union and this House are unchallenged leaders.
We have approved sound and important resolutions in this area.
Well, what we ask of the citizen, the consumer, households, industry, the world of transport we should also impose on ourselves; accordingly, my resolution, my report contains a host of concrete proposals to reduce the environmental impact of our House, of our European Parliament in a much more ambitious manner than was hitherto the case.
I should like to finish off by saying that the two amendments tabled by Mr Fjellner and others enjoy my full support.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions for whose budget discharge I have been responsible in the past include the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Ombudsman, and I currently see no reason to raise any queries about the last two of these.
If, though, I may start with the Council, what is termed a gentlemen's agreement has been in place in respect of certain budget matters since 1970, but, since that time, the European Community has developed to an enormous degree.
A number of things - none of them entirely lacking in relevance - have happened, and they make the gentlemen's agreement seem inappropriate in today's world; for example, the European Parliament is now directly elected in free elections with a secret ballot, and, being firmly persuaded that this agreement needs, as a matter of urgency, to be adapted to the present situation, I propose that the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Control of Budgets should, during the coming months, hold a joint meeting in order to discuss this important topic and, by means of a common position, demand that the Council make the changes that are so urgently needed.
While I am on the subject of the Council, I am pleased to see that the Common Foreign and Security Policy is carrying more and more weight, and rightly too, although it is intolerable that the Council is not keeping its side of the agreement and drawing clear distinctions between the operational costs that need to be entered in the Commission budget and the purely administrative expenditure, and so I urge it to play by these rules in future.
At both the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, there is still room for improvement; for example, the publication of the business and financial interests of the judges and the auditors has yet to be clarified.
This is something that we in this House have raised time and time again already, and so we, in our resolution, are setting a deadline of 30 September this year for the two institutions to indicate how they propose to comply with this House's demand for the publication of those business and financial interests; we have already been waiting for far too long for such statements.
Even before the latest enlargement round, the question was being raised within the Court as to whether the number of auditors should remain as it was, and various models for the Court's reform have been on the table for some time; for example, its former President, Professor Bernhard Friedmann, drafted a very sensible proposal with a rotation system similar to that used for the Council of the ECB.
It might also make sense to replace the present collegiate arrangement by creating the position of Chief Auditor, and so the Court ought not to pray in aid the existing position under the Treaties in justifying its refusal to consider reform, for reforms are due in the short or long term, and it would be good if the Court were, off its own bat, to come up with a sensible, practical and well-thought-out proposal for it.
The future of the Joint Services is under discussion not only in the Committee of the Regions, but also in the Economic and Social Committee, for there is something wrong with the way those services are organised when even the Committee of the Regions gets the idea that it is being put at a disadvantage, so both committees should set in train a neutral analysis, based on suitable reference values, of the costs, benefits and savings involved and, where necessary for this purpose, seek the advice of the Court of Auditors or of some other advisory body.
The objective of the debate must be to get the Joint Services, future, doing the work that needs to be done and doing it with good coordination and at reasonable cost.
This year's discharge focussed particularly on the question of the questionable use of weighting, not only by the Committee of the Regions, but also in other institutions.
