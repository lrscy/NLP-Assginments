I hope that I have got the wrong end of the stick here.
Indeed, although a distinction based on nationality may be completely understandable, it would, of course, be quite improper to let the colour of someone' s skin be a deciding factor in their request for asylum or to treat the asylum request of a black person in distress differently from that of a white person.
These days, asylum and migration policy falls within the scope of the first pillar. The deliberate exclusion of this area could not therefore be justified.
A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof.
Every Member State is by now familiar with this concept, whereby both the defendant and plaintiff have a role to play.
Indeed, the burden of proof has already shifted in cases where men and women are treated equally.
In this procedure, the plaintiff has to supply actual facts on the basis of which direct or indirect discrimination can be presumed, and the defendant subsequently needs to refute the charges.
This arrangement works well and has caused few problems.
Maybe those opposing this procedure could explain to me sometime during this debate why we nonetheless have to review it and, more specifically, why there is less protection against racial discrimination than against sex discrimination.
At the same time, I recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential.
I hope therefore that the House, in its wisdom, will decide tomorrow to adhere as far as possible to the Commission' s original text.
Unfortunately, statutory measures against racism are necessary.
They provide victims with protection and a right to redress.
But it is also important in the forming of attitudes.
It makes it clear that Europe will not stand for racism.
It is this message which this Parliament needs to broadcast.
Everyone is different, everyone is equal.
I note what you have said, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
I do not think it was strictly speaking a point of order, but I have taken note of it.
Mr President, I want to add my voice to those Members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through Parliament.
This is a Parliament with a proud record.
Since the 1980s we have led on action and on initiatives to combat racism, xenophobia and discrimination.
We now have, in the Buitenweg report, a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan.
I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism.
We, too, believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism.
Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region, in the North-West of England, are eagerly awaiting this legislation.
For some of them, victims of racism, action cannot come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears in my region' s organisations.
Racism is on the rise again.
We all have our local examples.
For example, in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked, his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike.
So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference.
The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism, their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse.
This has to stop.
This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU.
In voting through this report and its recommendations, this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism.
Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box, and we have examples in many countries, should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions.
Firstly, I want to congratulate the Commission on this text.
It is a good text.
Many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it.
I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency because they have pushed this through and given it their political clout to make sure we get it on the statute book because, as Mrs McCarthy has just said, people who are victims of racism cannot wait until all the procedures are sorted out.
They want this legislation quickly and they want it now.
That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon.
It is important legislation.
In the context of what has happened in Austria, it becomes even more important.
There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text.
Two things I would like to highlight: Amendment No 29, which tries to make sure that there is no hiding place for racism, no hiding place behind considerations of religion, considerations of belief and considerations of nationality.
We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism.
The second amendment, which is important, is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself, and I hope the Commission will take it on board.
My own committee, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, thought it particularly important that we make sure that the applicant states are aware of the legislation and are in a position to implement it as soon as possible.
I hope the Commission will make sure in the Action Programme, proposed to accompany this package, that we have a lot of projects from the applicant states.
This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire, people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe.
It is very important that we get it through today.
I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans, no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency.
Mr President, first and foremost, I would like to warmly congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on the fact that she managed to finish the entire report, ready for discussion and vote, at the eleventh hour today.
That is the first point.
When I read the report and hear the discussions, I get a strong feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu.
Some 15 or 20 years ago in the Netherlands, I worked together with a Christian-Democrat member of government, Mrs Jeltien Kraaieveld, who was also involved in this anti-discrimination legislation in the field of discrimination based on sex.
All the points raised then, together with the hesitation and conflicts, have come up again now.
The hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report.
Then, too, we realised that it is better to address the types of discrimination one by one than to try to cram them all into one act or even one directive.
In addition, the rapporteur has persuaded me that it is preferable to leave out religion for that reason, because it merits a separate chapter.
What would really cap it all for me is if we could withdraw Amendments Nos 15 and 29, in which religion is portrayed in a bad light.
This would then render my Amendment No 63 redundant, where religion is seen in a positive light, as we would thus redress the balance and have a clean report.
Mr President, I think it is important in this context to bring up the issue of the 'distribution of the burden of proof' , also erroneously referred to as 'reversal of burden of proof' .
In the past, we have had huge arguments in the Netherlands about how this should be done and whether this could be done.
We finally concluded that it was necessary and that it should also be tied in with the establishment of an independent council or independent committee for equal treatment - in fact, one of my best former collaborators currently forms part of such a committee. This would then be able to look into the extent to which particular complaints should be taken seriously, whereupon we would go to court and, if appropriate, support the plaintiff.
It is then up to the party which is indicted to prove that we are wrong.
That is the type of distribution of the burden of proof which is not only already operational in most Member States in the case of men and women and, as from 2001, will have to be extended to include everybody, but which also already exists in legislation on the environment, for example.
There, too, a reversal of the burden of proof applies, if necessary, or so I was told by an expert in the field a moment ago.
Indeed, these are phenomena which are extremely difficult to prove and which, using the traditional method, an interested party can try to wriggle out of, usually successfully, even if this is completely unjustified.
It is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect.
The distribution of the burden of proof is an important point which should be looked into by a committee such as the one mentioned above.
As such, on behalf of those in my Group who welcome this, I am strongly in favour of the parts of the report which pertain to this point.
It is, of course, the case that in the traditional forms of administration of justice, some employers or people playing important roles used to be in a strong position, or those forming part of a majority always took exception to anti-discrimination.
Distribution of the burden of proof will affect their position.
As a Christian-Democrat, I think we have to side with those who are most under threat, those in the weakest position. As such, this is a positive development, in my view.
Also, I very much applaud the rapporteur' s compromise to the effect that she is possibly prepared to reinstate in their original form those regulations which have been tightened up in ways not required by statute.
I consider this to be an important gesture, also vis-Ã -vis the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and this I very much appreciate.
Regarding the other points of the report, I do have to say that the nature of a directive is such that you do not need to be too specific.
A directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation.
Naturally, one could say, what if some EU government or other lost its faculties, you would need to specify all the steps one by one.
I assume, Mr President, pursuant to the principles of subsidiarity, that this kind of mental breakdown will not affect Member States and that they will transpose this directive into national legislation in a proper and reasonable manner, so as to meet the objective.
This is, after all, the nature of the directive.
This does imply for our Group - and I am speaking on behalf of the entire group - that a number of points are redundant, something which, in fact, the rapporteur has already hinted at. Let us weed them out and exclude them from the directive.
In addition, we do not need to include a number of bureaucratic procedures of how everything needs to be done step by step.
We will not be voting in favour of this, or rather, we will be voting against this.
But this does not affect the core of the report, Mr President, which is what this is all about.
Needless to say, there are a number of points which we do want included, such as, for example, the right to perusal of confidential information, or whether it is, for example, necessary to establish whether a business administration is not secretly committing systematic discrimination.
On behalf of part of my Group, I also find it extremely important that elections of employees representatives are clearly provided for.
Naturally, these too should be held free from discrimination based on race or ethnic origin.
We must strike up a social dialogue where this type of issue can be discussed.
This very much strengthens the concept of subsidiarity because, where anti-discrimination is concerned, we should start at the basis, the very place where social dialogue is extremely pertinent.
Mr President, discrimination, especially based on ethnicity and race, is of great concern to me because it touches the very core of the European Union and European integration.
This is what it is all about.
We are gathered here, people from different nations and of different origins, and we are working together.
This is what the pioneers of the European Union once did and we must translate this now into legislation such as is before us today.
As a Dutch person, I have to say that I am also moved by the discrimination issue involving generations of Dutch speakers, often fellow believers, who kept the apartheid regime in South Africa alive.
This has made us particularly alert and, in my opinion, we should take the warning we received from this historic learning process seriously.
I am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a Member of the group which has joined forces with the two rapporteurs, Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg and Mr Richard Howitt, with a great deal of conviction in order to enable Parliament to deliver the parliamentary opinion on this Commission proposal this week, and I would like to thank the rapporteurs very explicitly and with all my heart for the extremely constructive spirit in which we have been able to work.
The Social Democrats in Parliament have fought doggedly to keep this item on the agenda and I am pleased that we managed to achieve this thanks to a sound proposal for compromise from the Liberals.
With all due sympathy and respect for the work which Mr Arie Oostlander and a number of delegates in the PPE-DE Group have put into this in order to win that group over too, I have to say that the continuous attempts at sabotage and procedural games which we have experienced here this week are, as far as I am concerned, proof that a hard core of conservative PPE-DE Members want nothing more than to undermine this report and the directive.
I am pleased, however, that we managed to stop them in their tracks.
We all know that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to bring this debate in the Council to a successful conclusion.
This will not be easy.
The majority of MEPs know very well why this directive is important.
By implementing the Treaty' s non-discrimination principle swiftly and forcefully, Europe wants to give out an unambiguous message to the citizens in our own countries and those in the candidate countries.
This is to prove that Europe is serious about the fight for equal opportunities, irrespective of people' s race or ethnic origin and also because it is a well-known fact that discrimination is still rife in our countries, and that there is still racism and extreme nationalism which, in fact, is more prominent than before because racist political parties are cashing in on the 'own nation first' ideas.
I know that the debate in the Council is also a difficult one.
It is precisely for this reason that it is important that the European Parliament strengthens and supports the Commission's position, because we will soon need a sound and efficient directive which fights any type of discrimination on the basis of racial and ethnic origin.
To finish off, I would like to highlight a number of my Group' s priorities in terms of content.
Firstly, it is extremely important for the non-discrimination directive to have a wide and efficient scope.
This is why we are very much in favour of extending the directive to groups of people who are discriminated against and also to areas such as housing, education, public service operations and attitudes within the police force.
We are also pleased with the solution which we finally reached regarding discrimination on the basis of religion which should not be a covert reason for discriminating on the basis of ethnic origin.
Secondly, in our opinion, the strength of this directive will stand or fall with its enforceability, the extent to which it monitors discrimination, the efficiency of the measures taken against discrimination and, as such, the importance we attach to the possibility of organising collective actions to tie sanctions in with the directive.
With all due respect and sympathy, Mr Oostlander, but since you refer to the cleaning-up operation, I notice that this is precisely one of those cornerstones of our reinforcement plan which is being removed. I do not agree with this.
This is taking it much too far.
Moreover, my Group also supports the reinforcement of, and support for, the operation of, those independent monitoring bodies.
I am convinced that the centre for equal opportunities in my own country will be encouraged in its activities by this directive.
I should like to finish off with one last consideration regarding the shared burden of proof because I am really at a loss to understand the resistance on the part of some people.
Surely it should be clear to everybody that it is impossible for a migrant who is discriminated against to prove that he is being discriminated against at work or by house owners, unless the defendant too is at least asked to prove that the facts brought by the plaintiff are unfounded.
We women are already familiar with this procedure.
This is why we have fought for such a long time for a directive which distributes this burden of proof, and all we men and women of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are asking for is for migrants to be treated in the same way as women.
This is why we will also support the Commission' s proposal and will not permit any amendments in this area.
Welcome
I have just been told that we have a delegation from the City Council of Munich, the capital of the Land of Bavaria, in the public gallery.
It is my great pleasure to welcome our colleagues from local government, and I am delighted that you are so interested in our work!
Equal treatment (continuation)
I am delighted to have been able to work with Mrs Buitenweg.
She has done an excellent and inclusive job producing a balanced text, which usefully strengthens the Commission' s hand.
This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe.
It is right that Europe should be legislating to guarantee the fundamental right to dignity, irrespective of ethnicity, and not to suffer discrimination.
It is also timely for Europe to legislate now with the alarming rise in the Far Right and racist violence.
I want to highlight a few aspects of the text.
Firstly, the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism, and amendments have strengthened that aspect.
Secondly, the specific inclusion of housing, health and other public authority functions, including policing.
This is not interference in national responsibilities, but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern.
Thirdly, the inclusion via Amendments Nos 15 and 29 of disguised race discrimination.
My Group is not favourable to the inclusion of religion or belief in the scope of this directive because that needs much more thought.
However, we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is, in fact, race discrimination pure and simple.
Fourthly, the inclusion, as has already been mentioned, of incitement or pressure to discriminate - that is very important.
Fifthly, the role of the European Union Monitoring Centre in assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of this directive - and I hope the Commission will welcome that.
Sixthly, although my Group understands the thinking behind Amendment No 38, the fact that it includes private clubs or associations is rather problematical.
To give you an example: I represent London and it could mean a problem for Caribbean people getting together to reminisce about life in the Caribbean in the 1950s if some white people were excluded.
I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted.
Lastly, on the adjustment of the burden of proof, and I am borrowing Mr Oostlander' s phrase here, because he is quite correct to refer to it as 'sharing' or a 'distribution' of the burden of proof.
I am rather sorry that the Socialist Group insist on calling it a l of the burden of proof because that is slightly misleading.
It applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law.
My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information, it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a case.
Finally, there will be more heat than light from some speakers today and I am afraid I might include Mr Helmer of whose remarks I had a foretaste last night on the way back from the delightful asparagus dinner.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years after the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and the famous and much-debated Article 13 was introduced, the Council is proposing two directives to implement the principles of this Treaty.
We can only congratulate the Council' s willingness to make progress on this issue, particularly at a time when certain parties of the traditional right are starting to sign agreements with extreme-right movements. This has already happened in France, is now occurring in Austria and may soon happen in Italy.
The definition of a minimum European framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required.
The directive on the fight against racial and ethnic discrimination is heading in the right direction. In particular, it provides for the reversal of the burden of proof, the gradual establishment of positive discrimination - more effective than simple theoretical equality - and the recognition of indirect discrimination.
All these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead.
However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted.
Some of these have been raised by our rapporteur, such as the issue of legal proceedings being free of charge for plaintiffs and the necessary extension of the right to take part in court proceedings to groups and associations.
There are also two other problems which I must raise.
The first is of a general nature.
How can the Council consider the issue of racial and ethnic discrimination without being committed to the creation of a comprehensive legislative framework for all discrimination?
Singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others.
This is unacceptable.
A second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly.
The Council must therefore make haste and propose a draft directive encompassing all types of discrimination.
This is absolutely vital as the most excluded are those who suffer several types of discrimination.
Protecting them from just one type will only go part-way towards helping them.
The second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive.
It is extremely regrettable that religious discrimination was not included with racial and ethnic discrimination as these different types of discrimination are closely linked.
For example, how do you define the Jewish identity?
Surely the hatred for Jews which remains significant in many countries is due as much to anti-Semitism, and therefore to ethnic origin, as to religious aspects.
Discrimination against North African communities in Europe is also two-sided.
It may even often be said that the fear of Islam acts as a catalyst for racism towards these communities.
Therefore, limiting this directive to racial and ethnic discrimination risks leaving the door open to ambiguities in interpretation with which the courts might struggle to deal.
To conclude, it is essential that the Council adopts an integrated approach towards the legal tools to be established in order to apply Article 13 in our daily life.
Dividing the fight against discrimination among a number of texts is dangerous for the overall coherence of the anti-discrimination mechanism and therefore weakens it.
Mr President, thank you for welcoming the members of local government who are the very people who will have to implement what we decide here.
But first of all, we have to do our work.
I would like to point out that the amendments mentioned by Baroness Ludford are still not available in all languages this afternoon.
Before we proceed to the vote, would you please get the Sittings Service to establish whether the 24-hour deadline applies here and whether or not we have to defer this until tomorrow?
I am not trying to start a debate on this subject now, but I would like you to clarify this once and for all, because there has been a lot of confusion here today.
Mr Posselt, we are used to confusion reigning in this House, but I will have this checked.
Mr President, this motion is positive and we will vote for it. However, its credibility will only be ensured if the Member States start by cleaning up their own acts.
For example, what credibility does Belgium have in this area when it is expelling large numbers of gypsy asylum-seekers to Slovakia and Bulgaria, despite Parliament' s recommendations and the express request of the European Court of Human Rights?
What credibility do the Member States have when they are discriminating in their civil services against the recruitment of third country nationals, thus condemning the immigrants who they do employ to constant uncertainty?
What credibility does France have when a draft constitutional act recommending that immigrants from third countries be given the right to vote in local elections, adopted in the National Assembly on 3 May, is now being blocked by the hostility of the Senate and the President and the unwillingness of the government?
How can we claim to be protecting from discrimination those to whom we refuse any citizenship?
Discrimination will only be effectively combated when governments stop using double talk.
However, this text is a step forward on which we must build.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would have been a good thing if the European Parliament had made a positive, informative and decisive contribution to the proposal for a Council directive, in line with the impetus given by the Portuguese Presidency.
Unfortunately, it is not evident that that has happened.
On some points, the amendments involve precise improvements to the text in question.
In addition to details, I myself wish to refer to the right of collective action, legal assistance and other aspects which are already covered by Portuguese law.
However, in key areas, the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything.
It seems that the rapporteurs and others who support them have wanted to go too far, and in their desire to do so they may seriously affect the entire proposal.
There are three points that particularly worry us: the reversal of the burden of proof, which has not been clarified, and the issues of nationality and religion.
Reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right.
Even so, there are areas in which it is clearly justified, but it is unacceptable that instead of applying the classic principle of in dubio pro reo, this is to be replaced by a principle of in dubio pro auctore, especially when there is no explanation as to whether this reversal is to apply to criminal justice cases, and we know that there are cases in this area that can come under the criminal justice system.
This would amount to a violation of the fundamental principles of our legal system and of basic rights of trial formulated in Latin, that is to say based on Roman law.
Secondly, there is the issue of nationality.
We Portuguese can perhaps boast the richest mix of blood and ethnic origins in the course of history.
I myself and my circle of friends have not the faintest idea of our ethnic background.
We would be a real puzzle for a Nazi investigator or for the chart of ethnic origins which Baroness Ludford admired so much a few weeks ago in another report.
We are familiar with the concept of racism, which has no impact on us, although we must combat it. Above all, we must firmly combat racist violence.
But it is important not to confuse separate issues.
In other words, ethnicity is one issue and nationality is another.
If there is discrimination between a black person and a white person, or vice versa, for example if someone discriminates against a white Portuguese in favour of a black Portuguese, or against a black Portuguese in favour of a white Portuguese, this is clearly unlawful racism and should result in prosecution.
However, when it comes to applying for a particular post, if a Portuguese, be he Asian, black or white, is suitable for that job, in a way that does not apply to a Zimbabwean, be he Asian, black or white, then this is not a question of racism, it is about citizenship, and this can be legitimate.
The problem is that in many of the amendments these two concepts are confused, with potentially disastrous effects, particularly in areas such as public service, and even in other, unexpected areas.
The other vital area is religion.
We wish to make it clear that freedom of religious organisation is a fundamental civil right, which cannot be undermined, curbed or jeopardised, which would be the effect of some of the amendments before us.
Mr President, first of all, we would like to thank the rapporteur for improving upon the Commission' s proposal, but we also feel that particular thanks should go to Commissioner Diamantopoulou for grasping the significance of the inclusion of Article 13 in the Treaties and her skill in converting an abstract norm into a package of directives.
With each passing day, Europe is becoming a continent which, as the United Nations' reports on the European population trend illustrate, is host to citizens of third States but which, above all, needs their contribution, their culture, their potential and their initiatives.
In a context such as this, the Union must reaffirm the fundamental principles of democracy and ensure that all citizens and residents have the same rights and the same duties.
Having said that, we are sceptical about three points in the report and the directive: we are completely against the principle of the reversal of the burden of proof, which is contrary to fundamental legal principles.
We do not believe that the end justifies the means but that the means prefigure the end.
Moreover, we do not support the creation of independent bodies in the Member States, which would be responsible for monitoring racial and ethnic discrimination.
This is because, in general terms, we do not have confidence in institutions which, in violation of the democratic principle of the separation of powers, interfere with other institutions, with the result that they either upset the balance between the legislative, executive and judicial authorities or they find themselves without a specific function because everything is already being done by other institutions.
Finally, we do not agree with the references to positive discrimination.
We are opposed to positive discrimination in general when it is State-imposed, for we feel that merit should take precedence over the quota policy which, when all is said and done, discriminates between individuals who want to fight that very discrimination.
With these reservations, the Members of the Bonino List will support the report and the directive, in the hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will reflect upon the points we have raised and make the appropriate amendments.
Mr President, it is with mixed feelings that I am making my contribution to this debate.
This is largely to do with the way in which the discussion of this report has been forced upon us, against normal procedures.
Needless to say, I subscribe to the importance of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin.
But it is precisely because this is such an important topic that Parliament, and especially the Portuguese Presidency, would have done well to have set more time aside for it.
The enactment of the general act on equal treatment cost the Netherlands blood, sweat and tears at the time.
I am sure that other Member States have had similar experiences and these experiences should remind us to exercise caution and do our homework before discussing this draft directive.
This will require the necessary time, not least because the implementation of the current proposal will have a ripple effect within existing legislation and systems within the different Member States.
The change in the burden of proof is just one example of this.
Parliament' s amendment takes the Commission' s proposal one step further.
The Commission specifies that the principle of subsidiarity is still being enforced, but I question that.
The directive is said to have a supplementary function with regard to the political signal it sends out.
But this type of signal is being emitted with just as much power by long-standing national legislation, which is a great deal closer to the citizen, and by the widely known ECHR.
An in-depth discussion would have been desirable, certainly given the far-reaching consequences which this legislation can have on legislation and legal systems within the Member States and the fact that it will infringe on the Member States' sovereignty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dismayed as I am about the way the 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I particularly welcome the Commission proposal.
It goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied.
There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society.
However, it is possible to overshoot the mark, even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue.
The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the Commission would mean imposing an intolerable burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular, as they would in future have to keep a record of every job interview, so that in serious cases they would be able to provide proof.
Arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination.
Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause.
The precision of the impact assessment form annexed to the Commission proposal is totally dependent on the use of the phrase "without apparent difficulty" .
The wording is as follows: "identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty" .
Mr President, I think that it is important and that it will simplify the debate if the honourable members know how the Commission has dealt with Parliament' s proposal, as far as the acceptance of amendments is concerned.
As the House knows, I - as the Commissioner responsible - presented an anti-discrimination package a few months ago, containing two directives and a programme.
Today we are discussing one of these two directives and, allow me to say that this is only possible thanks to the brilliant collaboration and highly efficient work of the two parliamentary committees, the endeavours of which, I think, surpass all expectations.
This particularly complicated directive, which has multiple repercussions, involves national peculiarities and different views, and to which all the committees involved have made various contributions, has evolved into a report and a consensus has been found.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt and everyone else involved, as well as the Portuguese Presidency.
I believe that this conference is of historic importance for two reasons: first, because the demand for this sort of legislative act was tabled over twenty years ago.
Social groups, political parties, parliaments, MEPs and international conferences have proposed and have insisted that we legislate against the huge issue of racism and the conduct of organised society.
Twenty years on, it is now coming true.
We are here discussing this directive.
The second reason is that, because of the current political climate, because of the political problems which have arisen within the Union over recent months in connection with racist clashes at political and social level, today' s piece of work is the first to go beyond words, to go beyond resolutions and general political expression to specific policy making.
The European Commission has worked quickly following the presentation of your committee' s report, with the collaboration of all the services involved, and I am pleased to say that over half the amendments have been accepted either in spirit or in part.
I must stress that the amendments which have not been accepted have mainly been rejected for administrative or legal reasons or because we know from our experience and from our collaboration over the years that the Council is sure to reject them.
As you know, our basis is Article 13 and it is an article which limits our room for manoeuvre.
I should like to comment on a number of amendments.
I am pleased to say that we agree with the amendments to incorporate the sexual dimension (Amendments Nos 7 and 59), the amendments to the material and personal scope (Amendments Nos 5, 30, 31, 34, 36 and 37) and the amendment on taking positive action (Amendment No 40).
We also agree with the idea of conciliation procedures in Amendment No 42, consultation with governmental organisations (Amendments Nos 21, 50 and 51) and with the amendments relating to previous acts of the European Parliament and the Council (Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9 and 12).
I also agree with your proposal to define the role of the European Monitoring Centre - as contained in Amendment No 59 - although I should point out that our experience at the Commission tells us that the submission of reports by Member States every two years is a particularly demanding task and will not enable us to correctly assess the impact of the policies developed.
You also propose to amend the definition of indirect discrimination and one of the speakers also mentioned this.
I agree with the points made in the amendments and you may be sure that we shall use them to help formulate the definition in line with the interpretation of the European Court of Justice in the O' Flynn case.
I should like to say a few words to clarify the article on balancing the burden of proof proposed in amendment 43, even though the debate and the Council have made it clear that there will be problems in getting it accepted.
However, I should like to point out - because the Commission agrees with this approach - that a similar discussion was held several years ago along the same lines on the subject of discrimination between the sexes.
At that time, too, there was a great deal of concern about the repercussions which this would also have in the courts, where it was feared that a large number of cases would be filed, and in companies.
After many years in application, we have seen that these fears were unfounded and that there were no problems.
I think, therefore, that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach.
I agree - and I welcome your persistence - that the directive should apply to all persons present on the territory of the Member States and not only to Community citizens.
I also agree with the proposal to make it clear that the directive will apply to natural and legal persons, but I must point out that your reference to non-formalised groups of persons cannot be incorporated because this concept is not legally recognised.
The content of the concept is understandable on merit, but it has not yet been legally recognised and will cause numerous problems.
I should also like to refer to an issue which appears to be of particular importance to the House; I refer to the distinction between racial and ethnic origin on the one hand and religious conviction on the other.
Long discussions were held in the Commission when the proposal was drawn up as to whether a ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion should be included in this directive.
We understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction.
This frequently applies in the workplace, mainly because there are problems in relation to prayer facilities, obtaining permission for religious events and special dietary requirements in the workplace, which is why the second directive in the package, which relates to employment issues and discrimination in the workplace, makes clearer mention of discrimination on the grounds of religion.
But we do understand how difficult and how complicated the issue will become if we have an extensive ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion, for example in education.
And how difficult it will be to negotiate the directive with the Member States, where there are diametrically opposed approaches.
However, we welcome the approach which you have taken, i.e. the fact that Amendments Nos 15 and 29 point out that some people will probably try to interpret discrimination on the grounds of racial origin as discrimination on the grounds of religion and I agree that the directive must be strengthened on this point and that the Member States must also clearly draw the attention of the courts and other competent authorities to this danger when dealing with the issue of the right to take legal action against discrimination.
I should also like to comment briefly on independent agencies. I agree with some of the ideas for their role which you put forward, especially the need for them to be independent, but we cannot specify how they are to be organised or how they are to operate because that is a question for the Member States themselves.
The number of amendments which has actually been accepted is very large and I imagine that we agree that we need to examine how these ideas can be incorporated into an amended proposal so that we retain the structure and balance in the text and the proposal has some chance of being approved by the Council, because I think that, for all of us, the best balance is between what we want and what is feasible.
I should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept.
The first concerns your reservations on the exclusion from the draft of a detailed reference to specific services, such as the police or the judicial authorities.
As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the directive may only intervene where there is Community jurisdiction.
This does not apply in the case of judicial assistance in criminal matters and in the case of police cooperation, both of which come within the scope of the Treaty on the European Union.
We therefore agree with the reference in Amendment No 37 to public bodies in general but cannot agree to the specific reference to the police and judicial authorities.
A few words now on the huge issue of special problems in the area of immigration policies and asylum policies. The Commission prefers to follow a gradual approach due to the complexity of the issue and, when processing specific legislative measures on admission policies in these two areas, i.e. asylum and immigration, the Commission will evaluate the situation and decide to what extent the inclusion of an ad hoc clause against discrimination would be the most suitable response.
There are other points, such as public procurement, where the framework prohibits such criteria from creeping in, the issue of statistics, where I acknowledge and support your fear of a shortage of statistics - one of the basic objectives of the action programme is to create databases at European level - and finally, our obligation, as European institutions, to apply the same rules as those which we propose for the Member States.
The reforms which we are presently endeavouring to implement within the Commission have taken account of the entire framework of this directive.
Mr President, I should like to thank you for allowing me to run over time, but I needed to comment on a whole series of particularly complicated amendments and articles in order to give the House the best possible understanding of the points which can be accepted and, as you can see, they are numerous.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that if we show the joint political will and continue our excellent collaboration, we can make the small vision of Europe' s fundamental commitment on the issue of racism come true.
Mr President, the report we are debating here is, in my view, an extremely important one, and I would thank the Commissioner for her explanatory comments on the amendments.
The international community sets great store by the fight against racism and it is also high on the agenda of the Member States, but a great deal still needs to be done in order to protect human rights and fight racism, xenophobia and intolerance.
It is also becoming increasingly evident that cooperation within the EU is indispensable.
Certainly within an open, internal market which enjoys the free movement of goods, people and services, further harmonisation with regard to the scope, content and options for enforcement is vitally important.
It is with pleasure that I compliment Mrs Buitenweg on her report.
It is an excellent report which deals with the equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin, in general.
I would like to point out, however, that women, in particular, are being disproportionately affected by discrimination and, among women as a group, it is especially women and girls who are often doubly discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnic origin.
I have another four points I would like to make, Mr President.
It would be beneficial if organisations or other legal entities which intend to fight discrimination were to have the right to initiate the procedure to promote the observation or application of this directive or to support victims in the procedure.
I am also of the opinion that it is advisable that each of the Member States should have an independent body, such as we have in the Netherlands, to assess the complaints.
This body is called the Committee on equal treatment. It is an independent body which works extremely well and efficiently.
I am pleased with the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE delegate, Mrs Smet, who advocates that the directive should also apply to elections of employees' representatives in works councils, for example.
This would be a gain, in my view.
Finally, I would like to say a few words on the already mentioned problem of sharing the burden of proof.
This is popularly termed the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of possible discrimination and already applies with regard to women.
The same system is now also being proposed with regard to this directive.
In order to actually tackle discrimination head on, it is extremely important - if not imperative - that this shared burden of proof enter into force.
As the Commissioner said, in practice, this has never led to any difficulties in other spheres before.
All the more reason to accept a swift implementation here.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, without doubt, the extremely important "historic directive" , as you called it, and the corresponding European Parliament proposals have come at the right time.
And on time!
The need to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin or religious conviction is taking on a sense of urgency on the continent of Europe.
The revival of fanaticism and Mediaeval attitudes, the emergence of parties based on racial perceptions and the increase in violence bear witness to the fact that respect for others who are different, which is a feature of advanced societies, has not yet been fully achieved.
Clearly, in the 21st century, ideological and political convictions will meet somewhere between the progressive, cosmopolitan perception which accepts a multicultural society, and fundamentalism, which approaches those who are different with fear and enmity and promotes racism and xenophobia.
This is why the European Union needs to be given legal armour and to speed up the procedures to complete a common area of freedom, security and justice for everyone living on the territory of the European Union.
Once the directive has been adopted by the Council, we hope that the Member States will quickly give immediate priority: first, to judicial cooperation and harmonisation of their criminal legislation; secondly, to instructing state agencies and employers on how to apply the directive to all natural and legal persons; thirdly, to applying the 1997 Charter of the European Political Parties on the defence of fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of racial violence; fourthly, to the right of individual victims of discrimination to take collective action; fifthly, to guaranteeing the access of minorities to vocational training, employment, health services and national insurance and pension schemes and their participation in economic, social, political and cultural life.
We still need public awareness campaigns on direct and indirect discrimination, to monitor the application of the Community institutional framework and to formulate our immigration policy on the basis of the principles which govern this extremely important directive.
This is the first directive that we are debating under Article 13 and it is a very good start in our fight against all discrimination across the EU.
MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty.
I look forward to seeing further directives, perhaps starting with disability.
Initially, I was against racism being taken separately.
I would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the Action Programme.
I was persuaded of the urgency, because of the current rise of racism across the EU.
A number of Members have cited individual cases today.
I hope the Portuguese Presidency can work very hard to push this through and make sure that we do get this racism legislation.
We have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the EU.
I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today.
May I turn specifically to some of the amendments.
I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people.
This is the reason I wanted Amendment No 48 on simple language to go in.
Amendment No 43: people have talked already about the burden of proof.
This is working towards a shared burden of proof.
The plaintiff does have to provide facts and it has already been said that equal opportunities for men and women cover this in European legislation as well.
Amendment No 51: I am delighted that charities and non-governmental organisations are going to be consulted.
They are at the sharp end; they know what they are talking about.
Finally, I would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Buitenweg and to Mr Howitt in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for working so closely together to put forward an excellent report.
Mr President, since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Justice and Home Affairs Summit, things have really got moving in Europe.
It is very pleasing to see this.
The action programme against discrimination, the Commission' s two proposals for directives, the opening of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and lastly the adoption of Article 13 of the Treaty all give an irrevocable signal.
There was no anti-discrimination provision of this kind in the treaties before.
The European institutions can now, on the basis of Article 13, take appropriate steps to fight certain kinds of discrimination.
The European Parliament has also made its own contribution.
My colleague, Mrs Buitenweg, has, under considerable time pressure, prepared a well considered report on this anti-discrimination package on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are now voting on that report.
In general, Mrs Buitenweg' s 55 or so amendments make the Commission proposal much more substantial.
She has achieved a great deal.
The proposal before us is the first implementation of Article 13.
It concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people' s skin or their ethnic origin.
It does not only tackle the most important areas of life, such as access to employment and equal treatment at the workplace, education, social protection and social security.
The Commission is also attempting to build on experience gained in the Member States.
The reversal of the burden of proof will make the directive a very important instrument.
The defendant will now have to provide convincing proof that there is no discrimination.
The scope of the directive has also been widened, with protection against discrimination being extended to associations and groups of persons.
A large majority of the committee went along with the rapporteur, and the vote today allows us to take that decision further in a consistent way.
I would like to expressly thank Mrs Buitenweg for her excellent work and I assume that we will adopt this report by a clear majority today, even if the Commissioner responsible has let it be known here today that she cannot accept half the amendments.
Nevertheless, a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal.
Mr President, I too congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent work.
Taking these concrete steps against discrimination shows a willingness to tackle the invisible side of racism which is more underhand and which has insidiously penetrated to the heart of our countries.
This daily humiliation and harassment can have serious consequences and, in any case, calls into question the logic of integration.
Mr President, Commissioner, I must mention once again the case of the young Strasbourg man who tricked a company in this city two months ago by sending in two exactly identical CVs, one under a French name and the other under a foreign name.
You will remember that the author of these CVs was offered an interview for the French-sounding name but received a rejection for the foreign-sounding name.
I must also mention the young people who are refused entry to discos solely because they are dark-skinned. It is not difficult to imagine why they then withdraw to their estates and districts where they end up getting together with other socially excluded or ethnic groups in order to have some fun.
This discrimination encourages them to withdraw into their identities and further reinforces their marginalisation.
This situation becomes even more complicated when you then go to speak to these young people about public-spiritedness and citizenship. This is regarded as an insult because they are affected by discrimination in all areas and at all stages of their lives.
It is their little brothers and sisters who are refused places in schools. It is they who are refused access to training courses.
It is their families who are refused access to housing and healthcare. As a result, it has always been, and still is, very important to offer victims a protective legal framework.
Adopting the report and implementing the directive would send a strong political signal. The European Union could show in this way that it is concerned about the millions of people who live within its territory and that it is positively acting to reduce racial tensions.
It would also show that it recognises the diversity of its population which is a feature of its identity. This is the political response to be given to the resurgence of the racist and fascist extreme right in Europe.
At a time when some rightly have doubts about the Union, it could in this way also show that it is not just a coalition to defend the economic interests of the rich countries but that it is based on values of freedom, tolerance and solidarity.
For all these reasons we must vote for this report.
We know that the report and the directive have their limitations and will not solve all the problems.
Most countries already have legislation against racism and discrimination, including in some of their constitutions.
Yet discriminatory practices are continuing.
Clearly, what is often lacking is a real political will to effectively apply these texts.
In France last year there were only 14 complaints and convictions for acts of discrimination.
No one is fooled by this small number of complaints, particularly not the human rights associations which are being overwhelmed by thousands of calls.
Most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police.
They are not investigated by the public prosecutors who consider that there are more important cases to be tried.
In my opinion, there is nothing more important than improving the lot and the daily life of individual human beings.
Increasing the power of the associations, as quite rightly recommended by Mrs Buitenweg' s report, is positive, but governments must not be allowed to offload their responsibilities onto these associations.
Ensuring equal rights is a state responsibility.
The associations are currently leading the fight against discrimination.
They frequently have to take down the complaints, find a lawyer, obtain sufficient legal aid and sometimes chase up court officials themselves to get this discrimination recorded.
Mrs Buitenweg' s report recommends giving financial resources to the associations but I find it hard to believe that governments will do this when, at the same time, the economic criteria of the Stability Pact require Member States to reduce their budgets.
Neither would I want the payment of a few subsidies to these associations to be used as a pretext for justifying a reduction in the number of police officers or court officials who must now be trained.
Finally, another problem still remains which is the differing application of the nationality code.
Currently, a young person born in a Member State of foreign parents is faced with two different situations.
If born in France, this young person benefits from the nationality code and may be protected by the law if refused access to a job due to discrimination.
On the other hand, many second- or third-generation youngsters, born in countries such as Germany or Austria where nationality is conferred by descent, will always remain foreigners and will not benefit from any legal protection.
I know this was not the subject of Mrs Buitenweg' s report but I must highlight this as it is regrettable that, in identical situations, such different treatment can exist in the Union.
Parliament and the Commission should ask the Council about this issue so that greater coherence can be achieved in all legislation.
That apart, I congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and warmly welcome this report.
The previous speaker' s intervention was not translated properly because it was delivered too quickly, so I would ask future speakers to speak more slowly so that the interpreters can keep up.
Yes, I asked Mr Sylla to slow down.
But he is free to accept or reject my advice.
However, you are right: the consequences are that what he is saying is not heard in the other languages.
Mr President, I wish to make three points.
Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the draftspeople and the Commission - in particular Commissioner Diamantopoulou - on the directive and the report we have in front of us.
It has been a long time coming.
I was the chairman of the European Parliament' s Committee of Inquiry into the growth of racism and fascism in Europe back in 1986, when our rapporteur, Mr Evregenis, proposed such legislation.
I myself was the rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that reiterated that demand.
I suppose in a way it was worth waiting.
We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans.
Secondly, and without subtracting an iota from my support for the report and the directive as a whole, the Council will have to resolve a number of outstanding issues: on representative actions, on the definition of indirect discrimination and, as the previous speaker said, on the burden of proof.
The last of these must be workable, because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy!
The best basis is the existing burden-of-proof legislation, which is now underpinned by 25 years of case-law, and where the numbers are not available, expert opinion will suffice.
Thirdly and finally, I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group.
Many of them - the large majority I believe - have been genuinely concerned that Parliament' s procedures have not given them adequate time to consider the detail.
Yet a few clearly have darker motives.
With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia, the PPE Group, as a whole, should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections, then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes.
Those who lie down with dogs get fleas.
Mr President, the Economist says that we need 13.5 million immigrants by the year 2015 in order to get everything done that needs to be done in Europe.
The International Herald Tribune says that we shall not succeed in obtaining that level of immigration and recruitment.
On other continents, there is an awareness of how racism is growing in Europe, and it is precisely because of racism that immigrants are choosing other continents, notably America, instead of Europe.
We are used to coming out against racism, because we want to combat intolerance and xenophobia.
Perhaps we must also combat these things for the sake of our own future.
Those who maintain that they speak for enterprise and for small businesses are speaking against their own better judgement when they do not support the present proposed directive.
I support most of the amendments, but on one point I am uneasy.
This is Amendment No 29 in which it is proposed that a difference of treatment on the basis of ethnic origin, which is presented as a difference of treatment on the grounds of religion, conviction or nationality, is to be deemed discrimination.
I am afraid that this may be self-defeating.
In Swedish law on measures to combat ethnic discrimination, it is expressly stated that, in using the term ethnic affiliation, the law means that someone belongs to a group of persons of the same race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin or confession.
There is a danger that what we believe to be an extension of the definition concerned may, in actual fact, be a restriction of it.
The general interpretation is, in fact, that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality.
I shall not, therefore, be voting for the present amendment.
It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case.
I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for the work that they have put into this, which has been both a personal as well as a political commitment.
As others have said, this is an aspirational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create.
It is directly relevant, for once, to the lives of many people living within the European Union.
From my constituency of London where a large portion of the population come from minority ethnic groups and where there is a growing number of children of mixed-race relationships, this is an exceedingly important directive.
It is even more important for those areas where people wrongly feel that there is no need for anti-racist or anti-discrimination legislation, because there are no visibly non-white people, but yet they will still vote for parties which espouse racist or anti-asylum seeker policies, because they are afraid of the unknown and the different.
I welcome the directive.
I am pleased Council feels a sense of urgency about it.
I assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what Parliament is saying.
We have to acknowledge that in this House we regularly call upon other countries and governments to recognise the rights of ethnic minorities and to practice policies of universal human rights.
We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves.
It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes.
It requires us to call into question the workings of all our institutions, including longstanding well-respected ones, and our own practices.
That will not be easy or painless.
In the UK we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions.
That cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions.
That is why the amendments about training, monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has become strong and we have learnt how to build bridges over the last 50 years.
We have paid very great attention to the social dialogue, which means talking with each other, examining problems and understanding each other.
Social partnership is an ideal model centred on partners who interact with each other and help each other.
We should also all be concerned about integration, about good neighbourliness.
We should endeavour to provide incentives and to act as a model.
I believe that in human society acting as a model is a particularly important characteristic.
Particularly as an Austrian, I can say that in recent years, with a population of 7 million, we have accepted a million refugees.
We are therefore the European country that has accepted most refugees per inhabitant.
We were a kind of life-raft in Europe, and we still are today.
We fight against extremism on both the left and the right, as well as against violence.
Austria has the world' s strictest laws against fascism and against nazism.
We have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things.
We are now talking about discrimination.
First and foremost, I am speaking on behalf of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
We must make sure that we do not rob companies of working time and jeopardise their success by forcing them to spend more time on statistical form filling.
When I visit companies I often hear the complaint that there is too much bureaucracy and too many formalities.
Form filling is, of course, a very inefficient kind of work.
If, in addition, there are inspections, this also takes time and I believe that the vast majority of companies behave in a proper and decent way, and that relations between employers and employees are generally very good.
That is why I also believe that cancelling public contracts can also be provocative, and I am returning to the key issue now: reversing the burden of proof will have a knock-on effect if it is implemented.
It will encourage abuse.
People will need to protect themselves against such abuse.
It will be necessary to keep more evidence.
It will lead to risk limitation, by which I mean surveillance methods, video recordings and tape transcripts. Everyone will try to protect themselves as well as possible so that if they are taken to court they can provide evidence.
I can see great dangers here and we must ensure that they are averted.
Mr President it is a measure of the effectiveness and importance of this legislation that even in the midst of a comprehensive series of reforms of race relations legislation in my own country, we have a situation where further improvements can be made.
I was going to make a speech of the normal variety, but having heard some of the responses across the House, I want to change what I was going to say, which is more in sorrow than in anger.
This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13.
Of all the speakers, Mrs Diamantopoulou made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism.
Posturing is easy.
Motivations are many and varied.
My friend, Mr Sylla, and I are concerned about two important things.
One is that we create a level playing field through Article 13.
The burden of proof, the ability for organisations to take cases on behalf of individuals who have been harassed or discriminated against - all of these laws do not create an advantage for the majority of society.
They create the opportunity for people of talent and ability to release their talents and abilities to enrich what we have in Europe to create wealth, to create the culture and diversity of Europe, not to suffer disadvantage for small- and medium-sized enterprises or anyone else.
We must start talking positively about these proposals mainly because the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency, many who have created this report, many of my colleagues who have worked hard on their opinions, have responded in the way that we have because we understand that this legislation is not about victims, it is about enriching EU countries.
Many of those EU countries represented in this House do not pick and choose which race-relation legislation they have - they have none, many of them.
We have some - we can improve ours.
It is now an opportunity, a symbolic opportunity and an important practical opportunity for this House to make an historic judgement, to vote in full during a presidency which has helped us bring forward a law which I believe will enrich this House and that we, in time, will be very proud of.
Mr President, it was difficult to follow the previous speaker, who speaks from the heart.
So do I, for I applaud the fact that the Commission has been so quick in getting this proposal on the table and implementing Article 13.
I would also congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work.
I am, of course, very much in favour of our arranging for the present directive to be implemented in the Member States as quickly as possible.
I would especially emphasise four factors which I think are particularly interesting about this directive.
Firstly, we have obtained a broad scope of application and, secondly, the directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, including malice.
At the same time, a shared burden of proof has been proposed.
We have seen how this is an enormous advantage in connection with sex discrimination, and it is therefore good that it is now being introduced in this area.
Finally, it is also an advantage that this is a minimum directive, so that the Member States have the opportunity to go still further if they consider it right to do so.
However, the proposal also suffers, unfortunately, from a fundamental flaw in as much as it relates only to discrimination arising on the grounds of race and ethnic origin and does not cover the other grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13.
In this way, the Commission is going to create a hierarchy of grounds for discrimination, a way of proceeding which I think is totally at odds with the wording, meaning and spirit of Article 13.
It would be interesting if the Commission could explain to us what the motives were for creating this hierarchy of discrimination.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for their excellent work and the Commission for their proposals.
It is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the Commission's proposals on the whole of Article 13.
The time is right to do so.
In recent years we have witnessed across Europe a steady rise in racist crime, violence, discrimination and, it pains me to say, 'political rhetoric' which plays on racial discrimination.
I feel a heightened sense of urgency as we contemplate and embark upon the enlargement process.
That is why this debate is so important because it strikes at the heart of how we define Europe and ourselves as Europeans.
We are more than a trading block.
We are a group of nations based on a set of values - a set of ideals which must be incorporated and reinforced in all that we do.
I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation effecting all minorities.
The price if we do not is a Europe falling far short of its true potential.
That is why this directive and the Article 13 package, as a whole, are so significant.
They demonstrate that the Member States, Parliament and the Commission are serious about the long-term eradication of discrimination and racism.
It is not perfect.
It does not fulfil my every ambition, yet it represents a start to a fight against racism in Europe, in our nations, our regions and, more importantly, in our communities.
One day I hope to be standing in this Chamber debating directives which will aim to eradicate discrimination specifically based on, for example, disability, age and sexual orientation.
These current steps must be applauded but there is still a long way to go.
Finally, the spectacle of a white middle-class British male Tory giving a lecture on discrimination and the effects of discrimination would be laughable if it was not so damning and lamentable.
(Applause).
Ultimately, discrimination kills and it blights the souls of those who practice it and those who encourage it.
Mr President, our rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, deserves a huge pat on the back for her excellent report and the skilful manner in which she has led the consultation and negotiations.
We should, therefore, adopt this report without further delay.
This directive forms part of a larger package which implements Article 13 of the EC Treaty.
As others have already mentioned, this Article does not only pertain to combating discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, but also based on other grounds.
I can understand why the Commission has decided to include the fight against racial discrimination in a separate draft directive.
I can also see why we are discussing this document expeditiously now and why, hopefully we shall be adopting it later today.
Far harder to accept is the fact that this draft directive against racial discrimination applies over a broader social range and, in terms of content, comprises stronger legal guarantees and control mechanisms than the second draft directive which is still in the pipeline and which is designed to fight other types of discrimination.
Together with the time lapse between the discussion of both draft directives, this difference in content entails the risk that there will be a hierarchy of types of discrimination.
This would give out the wrong political message which would, in particular, have an adverse effect on the fight against discrimination on grounds such as age, handicap and sexual orientation.
If anything, these so-called more recent factors deserve more, not less, attention.
I would therefore like to see the Commission and Council pledge their willingness to eliminate this form of discrimination between grounds for discrimination.
I have even less appreciation for the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of discrimination on the basis of sex throughout the package which the Commission presented in November, as if the fight against this was done and dusted.
It was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made.
In fact, there was no such risk. Existing European legislation governing the equal treatment of men and women only pertains to the sphere of work and is still lacking in many other areas which, especially if we compare it to the directive which we are discussing today with regard to racial discrimination, need attention as a matter of urgency.
There is not enough time to list them all here, but I do not have the impression that a lack of knowledge on the part of the Commission concerning this matter is the problem.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will pledge that she will start this exercise within the foreseeable future and will present proposals soon, as a result of which the equal treatment of the sexes in and out of the work sphere, but especially outside the work sphere, will be aligned to the directive which we are discussing, and will hopefully be adopting, here today.
Mr President, we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms.
However, I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause.
New laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of Europe.
What we need is education, time and confidence building in a spirit of cooperation between the various ethnic communities.
We have in our own group two ethnic Members of the Conservative delegation who are extremely active and proud to be British Conservatives, in spite of what the other groups were saying earlier, and they will be voting against these measures.
The shift of the burden of proof, as called for by this draft directive, is both frightening and extreme.
Already in the UK, Mr Straw is planning that in rape cases the accused man will become guilty until proven innocent, on the basis of the testimony of one person - the woman in question.
This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice.
Of course, we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks.
I was not present, but I believe a number of allegations were made and cases cited by other groups earlier in the debate.
Criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the Member States.
Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases, I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice.
This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems.
The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever.
The more the word 'racist' is bandied about, the more it will become meaningless, devalued and ignored by the public at large.
I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately following the urgencies.

on the situation in Sierra Leone.
Mr President, let us exercise honesty rather than hypocrisy.
The European Union, the United States and the United Nations have all displayed considerable concern about the developments in Sierra Leone.
We are not prepared to make any sacrifices.
The United States is paralysed by the Somalia syndrome.
The Union hides behind Washington' s back.
We Europeans even leave the initiative to the Americans who send Jesse Jackson and let him loose in Freetown like a bull in a china shop.
The United Nations' intervention has once again turned into a fiasco.
Only thanks to the United Kingdom were we able to stop the rebels in their tracks and arrest their leader, Sankoh.
This offers opportunities for a peace deal which far outstrips the laughable one which has been shot to tatters.
More than anything, we now need a watertight diamond boycott.
To complain about cruel massacres and mutilations becomes very hypocritical if we ourselves allow the diamond industry to earn a fortune on the back of blood-stained diamonds.
I would call for at least exercising more honesty when we discuss Africa.
Mr President, the violation of the LomÃ© peace agreement by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone is not only a human tragedy for the civilian populations, especially for children, but is also a political tragedy for the whole international community.
The impunity enjoyed by the rebels in Sierra Leone and the weakness of the peace-keeping forces, who can neither leave the country, for political and humanitarian reasons, nor effectively confront the armed rebels, are a threat to any future United Nations peace mission.
At the same time, this would be the third failure, after Somalia and Angola, of the Blue Helmets and the United Nations in Africa.
Africa, where the cruellest conflicts are taking place, is also, as far as peace is concerned, a forgotten territory.
The mandate of the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone is, by any reckoning, insufficient to achieve its objectives.
Its reinforcement, requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, depends on a decision by the Security Council, the same Security Council which gave the Blue Helmets the resources they required in East Timor and Bosnia, but which is much more reluctant to do the same in Sierra Leone at the moment.
The United States and Great Britain have only sent forces to the United Nations mission in order to guarantee the safety of the evacuation.
The only solution to the difficulties of the United Nations mission, in terms of achieving compliance with the peace agreement, is to entrust the political negotiation to the leaders of Liberia and Libya, whose record in seeking peace is very doubtful and also very worrying.
The liberation of some of the hostages and the arrest yesterday of Sankoh do not put an end to this conflict, but rather they may be a cause for even greater concern.
Only clear and decisive action by the international community as a whole can put an end to it: the arms embargo; the control of diamond trafficking; the deployment of a rapid intervention force, under the mandate of the United Nations; and the prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, the savage attacks against civilians, against international peace and security as well as against the United Nations forces.
The European Union must therefore support all these types of measures, within the framework of the CFSP.
Mr President, during the Sierra Leone debate in December, I, together with a few other delegates, warned against the risks involving the LomÃ© peace agreement.
This agreement not only lets the leader of one of the world' s cruellest terrorist movements off the hook but, to cap it all, also rewards him with the vice-presidency and authority over the diamond mines.
But even that was evidently not enough for the rebel leader Sankoh. He turned the disarmament pledge into a farce.
Murder, mutilation, abduction and rape simply continued as before.
His strategy is very much akin to that of his godfather, Charles Taylor, in neighbouring Liberia, who, by means of terror, forces the population to vote for him in the forthcoming presidential elections and establishes a new Mafia state in the heart of Africa' s diamond industry.
The UN peacekeeping force, mainly comprising ill-trained third-world troops, is in danger of heading for a fiasco similar to those back in Somalia, Rwanda and Srebrenica.
Sierra Leone has made it clear once more that it urgently needs a permanent, international peacekeeping force which is well trained and equipped, and led by top commanders from the world' s best armies.
It is a good sign that the rebel leader was arrested yesterday and that more than 200 UN peacekeeping troops were released over the past couple of days.
But the question remains of how the rebels will react to this and how the peace agreement will take shape in future.
In any event, the arms embargo must be supervised more effectively and perpetrators must be brought to justice.
More than anything, however, an embargo should be imposed on diamonds smuggled illegally from the country, estimated at USD 60 million annually, which is what is at stake for the rebels in their warfare.
I will call for a ban on these precious stones, which are stained with blood from thousands of innocent citizens, in my own country, Belgium.
Mr President, we are appalled at the present situation in Sierra Leone.
There is a dangerous trend towards the escalation of armed conflict, especially as the United Kingdom has now become militarily involved outside international law and the United Nations.
We demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations.
One-sided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation.
The RUF is known for its extreme brutality, but we should not overlook the fact that the government and the militias associated with it are little better.
We demand that the sources of the conflict should finally be tackled, by which we mean stopping the arms trade, halting the RUF' s diamond trade via Liberia and Burkina Faso, and ending the interference of states that want to secure national objectives in Sierra Leone under the guise of humanitarian action.
I have the feeling that, economically speaking, the United Kingdom is acting in a neo-colonial way and that in political and military terms it is now acting like a colonial power.
It is very easy to get drawn into a war, but it becomes almost impossible to avoid the next logical step, military intervention, once the atmosphere escalates.
The military imposition of peace by international troops working with government militias against the RUF will not bring peace at all.
Quite the contrary, it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation.
It is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found.
Because of this, we need de-escalation in Freetown, not escalation.
Mr President, given the threats once again faced by the people of Sierra Leone, when they still have vivid memories of the horror and barbarity they have suffered at the hands of the RUF, we cannot content ourselves with simply condemning the events which are recurring.
Let us remember that amongst the objectives of the common foreign policy are the maintenance of peace and the respect for human rights, principles which are being totally disregarded today in Sierra Leone.
This Parliament must therefore urge the Member States to support the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that the deployment of a rapid intervention force may proceed in order to re-establish stability in Sierra Leone and thereby contribute to preventing the danger of a new civil war which today hangs over that country.
However, our commitment must not end with this call.
We must also fight for an end to the impunity with which acts of genocide and war crimes have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the Tribunals so that they may be judged.
We must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country.
That is why this Parliament must urge the OAU, the European Union, the Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone to adopt and promote whatever measures are necessary to end diamond trafficking and the control of that country' s abundant natural resources by those people who, thanks to diamonds, have become men of war.
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Schuman declaration.
The best tribute we could pay to those people who, through that declaration, sowed the seed which has borne such abundant fruit in terms of peace and well-being, would be to commit ourselves to the cause of that beleaguered country, to decisively help the people of Sierra Leone to re-establish peace and, through peace, the full respect for human rights and the possibility of economic development which will lead it out of poverty and allow it finally to live in dignity.
Mr President, the fragmented society in Sierra Leone, the child soldiers and the fights between warlords make it extremely difficult to do anything of any consequence.
We stand here in moral indignation and are, at the same time, filled with a huge sense of powerlessness.
Politically speaking, in Europe, Mr Chris Patten and Mr Solana are two people from the European Union whom, in the event of foreign security conflicts, we can call on to use their political resourcefulness to both intervene in the region and to support the UN.
With everything which has been said about diamond trafficking and the halting of other dealings which finance the local war, and with everything which has been said about the need to intervene, what we need at the end of the day is a political solution.
As Mr Solana occasionally visits the Philippines and Mr Patten is actively involved in the Balkans, I would like to ask them both, on behalf of all of us, to jointly commit their efforts once more, focusing on political support, to reach an active final agreement there with the local regional authorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, any woman or man who, at any time in the course of the last few months, has bought any diamonds must have felt concerned that these might have come from Sierra Leone or Angola and must have wondered whether, in buying them, they had financed the mutilation of children or the drugging of child soldiers or had supported the abduction of the latter from UNICEF' s rehabilitation camps.
We can condemn and we can make demands, but what we need to do, and can do, as a Parliament, is to come up with new ideas.
As was said earlier, we need a long-term strategy for Africa but also a Schuman-style plan for the joint management of those of Africa' s resources which are being fought over, for example in Sierra Leone or in the Congo, so that the struggle does not lead to conflicts with fundamentally undemocratic warlords.
What do we now have to learn, fifty years after 9 May 1950, that is to say fifty years after the Schuman Plan?
We need an equivalent plan for Africa' s resources, just as we need a movement in opposition to the diamond trade.
I feel that, from a human point of view, this is much more important than any amount of movements in opposition to the fur trade.
Mr President, we must not forget that the RUF is a vicious and brutal grouping.
We should congratulate the British Government on taking effective action in a peace-keeping capacity.
This is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the European Union.
I find Mr Markov' s remarks, in particular, slightly bizarre because we constantly need rapid-reaction forces to move in to preserve peace and prevent humanitarian disaster - exactly what has happened here.
Clearly, we also realise that peace keeping can only be carried out by the operation of effective force.
That is a lesson we have to learn if we are to have a rapid-reaction force within the European Union.
The other thing we should learn from this is that the LomÃ© peace agreement was imposed from outside by outsiders and was totally unworkable.
We should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future.
Mr President, once again the drama unfolding in an African country is bringing Parliament face to face with the daily horrors of a bloody conflict and civil war.
Certain kind souls are already pointing the finger at misgovernance and ethnic causes and indicating the culprits who should be eliminated.
As with the oil of Congo-Brazzaville, Angola or Nigeria and the mineral resources of Chad, Niger or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and as in the latter generally or in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the causes are indeed economic and the fight for control of the diamond-producing areas is the basis and reason for this continuing conflict.
We are right to condemn the Revolutionary United Front or RUF for unilaterally resuming hostilities and for involving thousands of child-soldiers in the horror.
However, the Sierra Leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism.
We are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the RUF for war purposes.
But what are the economic interests behind the government' s actions?
We are right to condemn Liberia and Burkina Faso for their involvement in the arms trade and the recycling of diamonds.
But who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds?
We are right to send in a UN Implementation Force and to want to disarm those who are fighting. Yet without proper distribution of the wealth of these countries, as in other African countries, and if we continue to allow mining and oil companies to pillage these countries and to fund the groups controlling these resources, our intervention will once again be in vain as it will not tackle the real causes.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission very much welcomes the capture in the early hours of the morning of 17 May of the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh.
We understand he was arrested by the Sierra Leonean police and that he remains in government custody.
I am sure we all hope that Sankoh will now accelerate the release of the remaining hostages. There are apparently about 360 of them.
We understand that has already commenced, but there is a long way to go.
Similarly, it is to be hoped that Sankoh will now honour the commitments he entered into last July when he signed the LomÃ© peace accord and that will allow a long-awaited peace and stability to return to Sierra Leone.
The Commission has been following closely and with very considerable concern the recent events in Sierra Leone which have derailed implementation of the LomÃ© peace agreement and called into question the commitment of the RUF towards restoring peace and stability in Sierra Leone.
That, if anything, is an understatement.
The European Union has issued two statements condemning the RUF' s violations of the peace agreement and the abductions of UN peace-keeping personnel.
The statements have both called on the RUF to adhere strictly to their commitments under the LomÃ© agreement and, in particular, to the disarmament process.
We remain convinced that the LomÃ© agreement still offers the best chance for lasting peace in Sierra Leone.
We will continue to support the legitimate government' s attempts to restore peace and stability to the country and to implement programmes of economic and social recovery.
The recent support provided to the UNAMSIL peace-keeping force by the United Kingdom is welcome - the honourable Member, Mr Titley, made the point well - as is the release last weekend of 139 of the 486 hostages, following the intervention of President Taylor of Liberia.
The Commission is aware of the reports concerning the involvement of neighbouring countries, in particular Burkina Faso and Liberia, in the smuggling of diamonds and in providing support to the rebels in Sierra Leone.
The Commission, together with Member States, is currently examining the regional dimension to the conflict with a view to formulating an appropriate regional response.
The Commission stresses the role to be played by regional organisations, for example ECOWAS, in the prevention of conflicts.
The Commission is financing with EDF regional funds the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism, which could provide an appropriate channel for dialogue on this question.
As regards humanitarian assistance, through ECHO we are continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs.
Since the beginning of 1999, ECHO has provided some EUR 14m of assistance, covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psychosocial support to children affected by war.
In addition, this funding has covered support to amputees - the all too many amputees in the country.
This month the Commission will be seeking approval for a new EUR 12m programme of assistance to Sierra Leone, principally covering refugees and the internally displaced.
This programme will concentrate on providing support first to refugees in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia, second to internally displaced populations and, thirdly, to women and children affected by the war and, of course, the amputees.
Ex-combatant children will again receive psychosocial support.
For me the most interesting point to come out of this debate was not just the expressions of concern about the situation in Sierra Leone - one would expect that - but the number of honourable Members who have expressed very clearly and cogently their views on the diamond trade.
I say with some feeling that I very much hope that Member States will take account of what has been said in this Chamber.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Sri Lanka
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0433/2000 by Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0449/2000 by Titley and Sakellariou, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0457/2000 by Van Orden and Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0466/2000 by Frahm, Morgantini and Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0474/2000 by Lambert, McKenna and Lagendijk, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
on Sri Lanka.
Mr President, the resolution initiated by my colleagues, Mr Van Orden and Mr Deva, concerns a matter that is highly topical and most urgent even though this is the first occasion on which Parliament has devoted time to the tragic conflict in Sri Lanka which has been going on for over 17 years.
The resolution sends out a powerful message.
The fighting has to stop.
The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last.
In this regard, it can only be helpful for the international community, whether it is the UN, the Commonwealth or the European Union, to maintain a strong and current interest in developments.
This legitimate interest should not interfere with the work that has already been carried out by the Indian and Norwegian governments whose representatives have been engaged for some time now in the difficult and sensitive task of brokering negotiations.
I know that in spite of the dreadful atrocities that have been committed against the civil population and against members of successive administrations, the Sri Lankan government at the highest levels is willing to enter into negotiations and is setting no conditions.
We must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued.
The international community, including the EU, should be ready to provide substantial material support in due course for whatever solution is worked out and to assist the economic and social reconstruction of the country after so many years of conflict.
Above all, Parliament' s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism.
This is a scourge which affects us all.
There is no excuse for the indiscriminate acts of murder and mayhem carried out by the so-called Tamil Tigers against children and ordinary civilians going about their daily business and against democratically elected politicians.
This is an attack on civilised society and the democratic institutions which we all value so highly.
Inevitably, the people most effected and most helpless in these situations are the nationals of the target country who have fled the conflict and are trying to lead new lives in Europe.
These people are most vulnerable to threats and intimidation from organisations acting on behalf of terrorists such as the Tamil Tigers.
Of course, there are many other terrorist groups whose activities are sustained in a similar way.
They cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity.
This situation must change.
I commend the resolution on Sri Lanka to this House.
The issue of the place of the Tamils in Sri Lanka is a long-standing problem dating back to at least the year of independence in 1948.
We have had agreements since then to grant autonomy to the Northeast Tamil region, which have been abrogated by the government.
In this conflict, far too many people have died.
There has been a growing catalogue of violence and human rights abuses on both sides - by the Tamil Tigers and, sadly, the government security forces.
These are well documented by organisations such as Amnesty and the US Department of State in its 1999 Country Report.
Young Tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the Tamil Tigers and violent interrogation by the security services.
It is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within Sri Lanka.
Thousands more have sought asylum and the whole population lives in fear of violence.
We cannot say what the exact state of affairs is at the moment as there is a complete media blackout in force as part of a set of new restrictive laws introduced in May.
The resolution is clear.
Those laws must be lifted before the elections in August.
Something has to change.
We have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement.
It is clear that the international community is no longer prepared to see internal armed struggle as only a problem for the state concerned and that long-term political investment and negotiations are necessary rather than arms sales.
Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process, but also the possibilities.
This resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move.
The situation would also be helped by agreement between the Sri Lankan political parties themselves and we welcome the efforts of the Norwegian and other governments and feel that the Commonwealth could have a very valuable role to play in this situation.
Mr President, this is an historic day and an historic debate because, after 17 years of war in Sri Lanka, the European Parliament for the first time is actually debating how to bring peace to this war-torn island.
In 1948, when Sri Lanka obtained independence, it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia.
In 1952, Lee Kuan Yew, the newly elected Prime Minister of Singapore, said: "My ambition is to make Singapore emulate Sri Lanka in prosperity, education and standard of living" .
Forty-eight years later, that beautiful island of Sri Lanka has been smashed by a terrorist group now recognised as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world.
There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese.
One million Tamils live in the north; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese.
They hold high office in Colombo, the present foreign minister is Tamil, the country' s leading businessmen are Tamil, so are judges, doctors, lawyers and cabinet ministers - the list goes on.
Yet this pointless war also carries on, to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition.
The resolution states how many people he has killed.
The LTTE has to be stopped.
I ask Member States to proscribe this terrorist organisation and to help build peace and stability in Sri Lanka and strongly support the initiative currently being taken by the Norwegian and Indian governments.
Mr President, here we are again witnessing a conflict between two diametrically opposed parties.
True, this is the first time we have tackled this issue, but we see similar cases every day.
Of course, we hope that peace will be preserved and that these issues will be resolved through negotiation rather than force.
However, we must not forget that the fundamental principle of self-determination is all too often disregarded, sacrificed on the altar of another, equally valid but opposite principle, that of the territorial integrity of the States.
At this point, a choice must be made between the two solutions.
I would not presume to say which solution is better but we must find the courage to consider all sides of the issue.
One of the Members referred to the case of the State of Singapore.
Singapore used to be part of Malaysia but it is now an independent State.
The division took place without conflict, and, today, Singapore is no longer part of Malaysia but has its own complete territorial and State independence. This was achieved without conflict, without murder, without torture and without acts of violence.
On the other hand, in the same geographical area, we have also witnessed another conflict, the conflict of East Timor and, with far too great a delay, Parliament declared itself in favour of the independence of the eastern part of the Island of Timor.
There it is. At times, I find it difficult to understand how the same people, the same Members of Parliament, are able to adopt different positions on situations which are, if not identical, at least similar in some respects.
The Island of Timor has been split into two parts and there are now two separate states, thanks to a referendum which was carried out democratically, although not in the best of conditions.
The people decided their future and, although this involved fighting, conflict and so forth, succeeded in obtaining what they wanted.
I wonder why this Parliament does not call upon Sri Lanka to hold a referendum as well, along the lines of the referendum held in East Timor, and to abide by the result.
Mr President, I yield to no one in my desire for peace in Sir Lanka and in my condemnation of all violence.
However, I say to Mrs Foster and Mr Heaton-Harris that they want to check their stories and sources because it needs both sides in a conflict to be committed if a lasting solution is to be achieved.
I know Sri Lanka, I have been there.
I can give you examples of what I have seen.
I have seen Tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops.
I know that Tamil people need 11 pages of documents just to travel from Batticaloa in the east to the capital, Colombo.
And like everyone here in this Parliament, and all European journalists, I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently, nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass.
I have seen the fighting in Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Kosovo but nothing from Sri Lanka because the Sri Lankan Government does not allow press coverage.
That goes back longer than last May.
This is a government whose defence budget has risen by 11% in a year and which, one day, will have to answer allegations of involvement in the assassination of leading Tamil figures and other human rights abuses.
Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans, based on citizens' rights, humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities, not helping to destroy them.
Mr President, the Commission is as concerned as honourable Members about the tragic and dramatic civil war which has been continuing for the past 17 years, a civil war which seriously affects the whole population of Sri Lanka.
It is salutary to recall that over 60 000 people have been killed during the course of this conflict - people in both ethnic groups.
We appreciate the efforts being made in Sri Lanka to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict but we also reiterate, as I am sure all honourable Members would, our concerns for the respect of the basic rules of international humanitarian law.
The Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the latest developments in and around Jaffna.
On 15 May, the presidency issued a declaration on Sri Lanka. This called on both parties, firstly, to cease hostilities and to begin negotiations; secondly, to ensure the safety of the civilian population and, thirdly, to cooperate with the Norwegian government in its endeavours to facilitate a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
I should like to say in passing that I would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the Norwegian government, which regularly reminds us by its behaviour on the international stage what we are all missing in the European Union on account of the Norwegian people' s referendum decision.
The presidency declaration also rightly called on the government to lift as soon as possible the restrictions on civil liberties and press freedom, which have been introduced under the emergency regulations.
As for our support for rehabilitation in the north and east of the island, a viable political solution has to be found and a measure of peace established before we could consider a major role in this process.
That is fairly clear and understandable.
Assistance in favour of refugees and internally displaced persons will continue naturally to be given through the UNHCR and non-governmental organisations.
The European Commission will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid to populations affected by the conflict.
Through our delegation in Colombo, we are following closely the impact of the situation on the civilian population and we are in permanent contact with the ICRC, the UNHCR and the main NGOs.
I last visited Sri Lanka in the late 1980s.
I flew into Jaffna - I think I was the first minister from anywhere to do so - in the back of an Indian helicopter gunship.
Alas, 12, 13 years later, the violence continues.
It has been a terrible blight on one of the most beautiful countries in the world, with some of the most talented people.
We are reminded of Sri Lanka' s potential, which we heard about earlier, through the occasionally accurate words of senior minister Lee Kuan Yew.
That is a reminder of what has been missed in Sri Lanka as a result of this violence.
We all hope that it ends very soon.
If we can contribute to the work being done by the Norwegian and Indian governments to help bring the parties together, we would be happy to do so.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.

Philippines
Mr President, Commissioner, the crisis in the Philippines we are discussing is a tragedy.
I represent one of the countries which has citizens as hostages there.
We appeal to the European Commission to ensure that its representatives continue actively to urge President Estrada to refrain from any assaults which might put the hostages' lives at risk.
I also sincerely hope that the hostages will be able to benefit from any medical aid, for example, that MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšres might be allowed access so that we may thereby protect the lives of those who are currently hostages.
There is, nonetheless, something to be learned from all tragic events.
I also believe that the Finnish people have learned that the basis for the present conflict is social injustice and that, far apart from one another though we may be, we are nonetheless affected by precisely such social injustices and violations of human rights.
Mr President, Commissioner, we must be very careful as Europeans about taking issue with separatist movements of the kind being discussed here.
I say that because many of the borders involved in these great island kingdoms - the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia - are purely and simply colonial borders that we drew artificially to suit our own political and economic interests and which destroyed historical structures.
To that extent, we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region.
That does not mean that it is not up to us Europeans to ensure that these structures do not disintegrate, with all the dangers that would imply.
We should not put ourselves on a pedestal.
We have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments.
Nevertheless, it is, of course, our task to create peace and stability in this area, and in particular to take action against all those criminals who, on a political pretext, have, in the most appalling way, kidnapped and maltreated innocent tourists who are citizens of the European Union.
There can be no political justification for ill-treating people as is happening there.
We therefore appeal to these criminals to release these citizens of the European Union and all the hostages immediately, and we give our full support to Mr Solana and everyone else trying to help to bring this hostage crisis to an end.
We should also take this hostage crisis as a warning to us to stop ignoring these parts of the world or simply pursuing our own economic interests there. Instead, we should be helping to create stable and peaceful conditions there, because these areas of conflict are like open wounds that we ourselves have often inflicted in the past in these regions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens who simply wanted to discover another culture and who are now being held hostage by the armed group, Abu Sayyaf.
It is not clear whether this is a case of organised crime or political demands but the island of Jolo is now at the centre of the hostilities with this awful hostage taking.
In these islands, which are characterised by tropical luxuriance and unspeakable poverty, the machine gunning of villages, kidnappings, ransom demands and torture are common currency.
This hostage taking and the many violations of human rights show how these armed opposition movements have sunk into criminal excess.
Although we cannot tolerate these constant violations of human rights, we also deplore the failure of the peace talks with the Philippine Government.
We also know that the violence has its roots in poverty.
This is why we strongly support the appeal made by the Archbishop of Manila to President Estrada that socio-economic reforms should be implemented.
Without the political will to end the situation, the violence can only continue.
Equatorial Guinea
Mr President, we are currently discussing an issue which Parliament has dealt with on previous occasions.
It is the case of Equatorial Guinea, one of so many African countries which have undergone a very poor transition from the colonial era, during which former colonial relationships, on the one hand, and the ambitions of other Member States of the Union to extend their area of influence, on the other, have prevented the support necessary and conducive to the establishment of a genuine democratic system.
In 1999 there were general elections to the Guinean Parliament, during which the international observers noted that human rights, democratic guarantees and freedom of information had been violated.
The same situation may now reoccur during the elections on 28 May, which is why, as this resolution states, we demand the appropriate intervention of the European Union, in order to guarantee that democratic elections take place on this occasion.
Mr President, the reason for this resolution has already been explained: in Equatorial Guinea, the political and social situation is still extremely serious.
Firstly, no steps have been taken to establish a constitutional state based on a multi-party democracy which fully respects human rights.
Secondly, the population endures harsh conditions of poverty.
The government of President Teodoro Obiang has failed to comply with each and every promise of democratisation which it made to the international community.
The leaders and activists of the opposition parties face constant persecution, in the form of arbitrary arrest and sometimes torture.
Of course, they have no access to the media and they have to face corrupt electoral processes, in which transparency and fair play are totally absent.
With regard to the municipal elections of 28 May, there are grounds for concern, because to date there has been no guarantee of any democratic conditions for these elections.
We are therefore concerned and we ask that efforts be made to observe how the elections are carried out.
Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development.
Paradoxically, its income, which comes from oil, is increasing, but none of it reaches the inhabitants, being entirely purloined by the ruling classes.
Given this situation, as the resolution we have presented indicates, we demand that the government of Equatorial Guinea initiate a genuine transition to democracy, which we believe could begin by making these municipal elections free elections.
The Union must exert pressure in this respect, and not lower its guard or accept any more false promises from President Obiang.
Therefore, if the municipal elections take place in the current circumstances, with no form of guarantee, we must not resume any cooperation with Guinea, apart from purely humanitarian cooperation.
Article 5 of the LomÃ© Convention obliges the Union and the Member States to demand democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea.
We therefore believe that this House should follow that line.
Mr President, the calling of municipal elections by President Obiang should constitute a step forward on the path to democratisation in that country and, therefore, we should take a positive of view of it.
Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it, which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles, based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and, consequently, also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free, and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation.
However, the experience of previous elections, during which serious irregularities and a total lack of transparency were noted, as well the continuing lack of democratic guarantees in Guinea, requires not only that we observe very carefully how the coming elections are held, but also that we demand, forcefully, that President Obiang adopts the necessary measures to guarantee fair play in these elections.
We especially have to ensure that the process is open to all political forces - which involves the liberation of the political prisoners - and that the opposition is guaranteed the full expression of its democratic freedoms.
We should also demand the presence of observers who can monitor, in total freedom, the handling of these elections, and verify that democratic rights have been respected.
These elections may offer Guinea the opportunity to start along the path to democracy.
They could also lead to a rapprochement with the European Union and the granting of the aid which the European Union was prepared to give in the event that democracy was respected.
Therefore, as a Parliament, we have the obligation to exert pressure on President Obiang and demand that he allows these elections to be held in accordance with democratic principles.
This is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of Guinea.
Mr President, we cannot and must not miss this opportunity to encourage the people of Guinea to take the democratic path or the opportunity it represents for its youth, since, in an environment of increasing poverty and inequality, the failure of democracy leads to a spiral of violence and repression, which in turn ends in an armed conflict which is often promoted from outside.
The European Union must, through all possible channels, demand that the Government of Equatorial Guinea free all political prisoners and end the coercion suffered by the democratic forces, in order to guarantee that the coming municipal elections bring hope to the people of Guinea and lead to fruitful relations between Guinea and the European Union.
Iran (press code)
The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest.
There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but, as Human Rights Watch notes, the struggle to control the press is, in many ways, the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole.
The very success of the reformist agenda seems to have provoked a backlash by the conservative reactionary forces and an attempt to punish the majority who voted in February for reform.
They are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists.
These attempts surely cannot succeed in the long run because the youthful population is impatient for change showing that Islam and guarantees of rights and freedoms are perfectly compatible.
We must do all in our power to encourage and support reform, including especially basic legal safeguards for freedom of expression as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a signatory.
In the meantime, we call on Iran to cease the persecution and prosecution of journalists and writers for views which do not threaten public order, or national security, but only the vested interests of conservatives.
Mr President, 'Bahar' or 'The Spring' is the name of a new independent newspaper in the Islamic Republic of Iran which we hope is still being published.
The name 'Bahar' clearly refers to a political programme and undeniably supports President Khatami' s reform policy.
This course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society.
Iranian conservative circles saw this trend as a deliberate attempt to secularise their own state - and with good reason.
To their growing dismay, these fervent defenders of the political status-quo within the Islamic Republic have been pushed onto the defensive since President Khatami took office in 1998.
This was underlined by a painful defeat in the parliamentary elections only a few months ago.
In order to turn the political tide, the hard liners in Tehran have not shrunk from using any means available to them.
Just cast your mind back to some eighteen months ago, when a number of independent clergy were killed in macabre circumstances, or to last year, when the student protest was ruthlessly repressed.
Incidentally, the followers of the revolution leader, Khamenei, attempted to systematically silence the independent and critical press by issuing publication bans.
This hit the ultra-conservatives during the parliamentary elections particularly hard.
Hence, their furious reaction last month when they closed all but a paltry three of the reform-minded daily newspapers.
The present joint resolution supports the persecuted and the journalists in Iran who are doomed to unemployment.
The latter knew and know that they can count on the support of the large majority of the population.
Why?
Because they were not afraid to publicly turn against a far-reaching lack of freedom in society, which is perpetuated by undisguised terrorist tactics generated by the state machinery.
With this resolution, the European Parliament aims to encourage Persian editors in their fight for freedom of the press and to banish all fears at the writing desks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about Iran again today.
The reform process in Iran is at risk.
Even before the newly elected reform parliament has been able to meet, there has been a menacing intensification of the power struggle in Iran.
We are dismayed at the manipulative reporting of the conference held by the Heinrich BÃ¶ll Foundation in Berlin, and we are deeply concerned about the arrests of journalists and critical intellectuals in the wake of this conference.
We are also concerned about the ban on all pro-reform newspapers and magazines published in Iran.
We call on the Iranian authorities to immediately release the conference participants and journalists who have been arrested, and to cancel all warrants of arrest issued in this connection, to lift the ban on the prohibited newspapers and magazines and, last but by no means least, to respect the political will of the Iranian people, which was so remarkably expressed in the election results.
We call on the Council, the Member States and the Commission to support these demands on Iran and to make respect for human rights a prerequisite for further cooperation with Iran.
Mr President, we are currently witnessing massive attacks on the freedom of the press.
Last week, Mr Putin' s troops occupied the largest opposition publishing house in Russia.
Yesterday, the same thing happened in Belgrade to the independent radio station there.
In Iran, we have a situation where newspapers are being banned for simply acting as a voice for those forces and individuals who were so successful in the last election, and who embodied - and continue to embody - hopes of pluralism in Iran.
I therefore fully support everything Mrs RÃŒhle has said.
We must take advantage of this phase to offer our firm support to democratic forces and forces for reform in Iran, because what we are witnessing at present is a fresh start and yet simultaneously a setback.
What is very much at issue here is that we should not allow those forces to be isolated, which is what the regime is working towards.
That is why it has also been so devastating that the developments at the conference in Berlin occurred, thus giving the regime a pretext for taking measures against the opposition in Iran.
I am convinced that a dialogue with Iran is, in fact, the only way to influence developments in that country.
We must not leave the opposition unsupported by adopting measures that encourage isolation.
Instead, we should press, through intensive contacts not only with the government but also with the opposition, and by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission bringing all their considerable influence to bear, for an end to these developments, and to ensure that the reform process in Iran, which is fragile but promising, is not once again choked at birth!
Burma
Mr President, it is an awkward situation, this tenth anniversary of the elections of the NLD in Burma.
Awkward because the Burmese junta was successful in obtaining international recognition.
I refer, naturally, to Burma joining the ASEAN.
It is quite possible that the other ASEAN Member States decided in favour of this with the best of intentions and in the hope that this would kick-start the democratisation process in Burma.
We have to ascertain, however, that this is not how it worked, that this attempt failed and may well have brought about the opposite effect, judging from the smirks on the faces of the Burmese rulers when they hosted the ASEAN meeting of Ministers for Economic Affairs earlier this month.
In our opinion, relations between the European Union and ASEAN should not suffer because of the problems within Burma.
These relations are too important for this.
It does mean, however, that, if this situation continues, we will need to discuss the situation in Burma in our contacts with ASEAN.
However, we have to ascertain at the same time that our own sanctions were not that effective either.
It may be opportune to consider whether we can take so-called intelligent sanctions against Burma.
After all, sanctions should just focus on the one goal, namely the reinstatement of democracy in Burma.
Yesterday, we saw the arrest of 95 members of the NLD and the situation in Burma has become untenable.
One of the key things we need to look at is the role of some European multinational oil companies, in particular the French-Belgium company, Total Fina.
We also need to criticise the French government for the fact that they are backing this.
Even the British government is more progressive when it comes to their policy on this.
The British government has actually called on Premier Oil to withdraw from Burma.
The French government should follow the example of the British government.
It is unacceptable that European multinational companies are investing in and backing up a system where large-scale gross violations of human rights are taking place.
When it comes to sanctions, we really need to answer the call that we should implement economic sanctions against the SPDC and that we should be ending all links between Europe and Burma based on trade, investment and, in particular, tourism.
It is unacceptable that we should be investing in tourism in a situation where gross human rights violations are taking place, where people' s lives and liberty have basically been denied.
Mr President, it is now ten years since Burma witnessed a political drama.
After a period of uncertainty and conflict, open and fair elections were held in 1990 and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was voted President with an overwhelming majority.
In the parliamentary elections, the NLD won most of the parliamentary seats.
Shortly after this, the military once again seized power.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned.
Parliament was dissolved and many MPs were murdered, imprisoned or driven out of the country.
Since then, Burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression.
Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country and are living in camps in Thailand, Malaysia and India.
In the country itself, entire population groups have been displaced in order to break up the minority groups.
There is talk of forced labour.
According to the Financial Times this week, Burma has more child soldiers than anywhere else in the world.
Burma can be compared with South Africa and Chile in the Eighties.
What action would we like the Commission and Council to take?
First of all, we would ask you not to accept that the military regime in Burma should represent the Burmese people at the Euro-Asian Summit.
We also ask you to take a hard economic line against Burma.
We advocate economic isolation and an absolute investment ban by all EU Member States, as proposed several times already by the United States.
Moreover, EU citizens should be dissuaded by their governments from travelling to Burma for their holidays.
Many of these new facilities have been built using forced labour.
This is the core of our request.
Burma should not receive any better treatment from the international community than South Africa and Chile did back in the Eighties.
If it does, then we are using double standards.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi should at long last receive an effective response to her peaceful protest.
What would she otherwise gain from a Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize if she does not actually receive support in order to free herself and her country from this terrible plight?
Football: "Euro 2000" and preventing hooliganism
Mr President, I must declare an interest because I am a Class I soccer referee and very active in that and have been involved in football at many levels for 18 years.
This resolution looks at the security and safety arrangements ahead of Euro 2000 so that decent football-loving supporters from across Europe can go to, watch and come away from football games this summer without fear or concern for their safety: a fairly apt thing to call for considering the recent events in Copenhagen.
Most Members will find this motion uncontentious.
However, I do understand that there are some queries about the question of the suitability of the Charleroi stadium and its ability to safely host the England versus Germany game on 17 June.
These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about.
I thank the BBC Watchdog Programme for providing me with details of the findings of a renowned British sports stadia expert, Dr Jim Dickey.
He found, after just a brief examination of the temporary structure above the north stand in Charleroi, that there were too many seats in the rows, the stand is too steep, the safety barriers are too low, the exits from the stand are too narrow and the stairways at the back of the stand are too wide.
This stand, like all the others, will be full to capacity on 17 June.
Meanwhile, a few miles up the road, the King Baudouin stadium, Belgium's national stadium, and now probably one of the safest stadia in all of Europe, will lie empty that day.
I understand the regional pride of many members from Belgium and I do not question that much time is being spent by the organisers of Euro 2000 looking into the safety and security aspects of the competition.
But surely, common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively re-examined.
I do hope that Members will support this motion, because this is something we can actually change for the better.
Why not look at an event beforehand and not worry about the consequences of the bad actions of a few violent people after such a football event.
Mr President, I hope there will be a great football match on 17 June between England and Germany.
Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe.
But, unfortunately, that is not the view of everybody.
The German police anti-hooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there.
I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I cannot say 'fans' and even the word 'hooligan' is not strong enough for them.
There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there.
If you doubt me, just look at the press photographs of the problems that occurred in Copenhagen last night.
As well as the problems my colleague referred to that could occur inside the stadium at Charleroi, there is a serious problem that may occur in the streets around that stadium.
The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned.
We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium, and the stadium in Brussels has been cited.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after discussing all these terrible events in the world, it is certainly refreshing to consider other problems even though, on reflection, these also involve images which cannot be tolerated.
I do not believe, however, that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly.
For example, paragraph 2 of the motion is wrong. In this paragraph Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that the Charleroi stadium, which is to host several games, in particular the England versus Germany match, does not meet the relevant Belgian safety standards.
This is wrong for several reasons.
The first is that the organisers of any game in Belgium and the promoters of any stadium must sign a public-law agreement with the municipality in which the stadium is situated. This agreement engages the personal responsibility of the burgomaster.
Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride.
Belgians are aware of the good and bad sides of regional pride and, as a result, the use of a stadium requires not only the signature of the burgomaster but also that of the Minister of the Interior.
It is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries.
Furthermore, everyone knows or should know that it is not the inhabitants of Charleroi who chose this game any more than the others.
Finally, in the context of Euro 2000, there is an additional requirement that the stadium must be approved by the European Union and UEFA.
For all the stadiums which have been converted to accommodate an adequate number of visitors, UEFA has not only given its final authorisation to the process but has also been involved in the practical organisation of the stadium reviews.
I know something about this as I have worked, in my capacity as burgomaster of the town of Liege, on the preparation of a similar stadium.
To conclude, I regret to say that our colleagues are using arguments which are inaccurate and which can therefore only lead to wrong conclusions.
I am not the only one to think this as Mr Desama would have said the same if he had been able to speak. Our Dutch colleague, Mr van den Berg, also agrees as he asked me to say that in this case he has witnessed, in addition to a responsible attitude from the Belgians,...
... very close cooperation with the Dutch government and it started at the very beginning and we extended this cooperation with France on account of the lessons of the World Cup and a host of other countries, 14, I believe, including the United Kingdom, of course, because we wanted to have contacts with the countries which might send teams to Belgium.
Mr President, I will conclude by saying that the third and last point is that I think Parliament should make rules and not bother about taking chances.
Are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving Paddington Station?
Mr President, there are a number of advantages to this text.
Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to reiterate that we all condemn hooliganism and that we all obviously want to fight this phenomenon to the best of our ability.
I must also point out, however, that, for two years now, in both the Netherlands and Belgium, the sporting, political and police authorities have been preparing in a professional manner for Euro 2000 and, in practical terms, huge investments have been made.
Despite that, is there still a risk?
Of course, but then there is always a risk.
When faced with such a phenomenon, you can never say that nothing will happen.
However, I must say very sportingly to our British colleague that this does not justify an event of this type being used from the outset to incite prejudice. It does not justify the attempt to spread incorrect information in official European Parliament documents either.
Paragraph 2, as indicated by Mr Dehousse, is incorrect.
The Belgian authorities have given authorisation for the Charleroi stadium to be used.
Paragraph 3, which indicates that the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels might be used, is wrong.
No authority and no official has indicated this.
We must therefore be reasonable and certainly not adopt texts like this.
Finally, our fellow member has cited information which he was delighted to indicate was given to him by the BBC.
I should like to mention something which was said on the BBC by someone who is not a football referee like you but who is the coach of the England team.
What did Mr Keegan say - I am nearly finished, Mr President - during his visit to Charleroi?
He said that it is a suitable stadium for a high-level match.
He even said that this stadium differs very little from a large number of stadia in England.
So, be sporting!
