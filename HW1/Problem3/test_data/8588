Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Tuomioja, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, we have witnessed a tragic scenario this summer, which has ended in a bloodbath.
More than 1Â 000 Lebanese people have been killed, the majority of whom were civilians, 1Â 000Â 000 people have been displaced, a country has been totally destroyed, its infrastructure is in ruins, a sea has been polluted, a farming industry has been poisoned and weapons that are probably illegal are still killing people today.
This equates to a disaster for Lebanon and many wounds for Israel, in which there has fortunately been less damage done.
What is more, during this tragedy, a scandal erupted over the UN, paralysed by the United States, being unable to obtain an immediate ceasefire, because Israel needed to be given time to finish its work on the ground.
The words have been subverted.
A massacre of civilians is from now on called âa disproportionate and indiscriminate counterattackâ.
Invading a country equates to âfighting off a militiaâ.
Killing a resistance movement is the same as âsearching for a kidnapped soldierâ, but no one is fooled.
The war was brewing.
We let it brew.
It was planned.
It is true that it involved many actors, such as Syria and Iran, but it also involved â sadly via Israel, which is a victim of the war - the United States, which is still experimenting with its disastrous concept of constructive imbalance in order to redesign the Middle East.
This concept, which ended in failure in Iraq, has been applied once again and is showing its limitations.
In this instance, the conflict has deep roots.
They are in Palestine, which is still under occupation and which is still waiting for a State of which half of the members of the government and of the democratically-elected legislative council are in prison.
It is also in Palestine that a ceasefire is needed, and where a peacekeeping force is required.
What is more, while the people of Lebanon were dying almost in front of the cameras, 250 Palestinians were losing their lives very quietly, under the occupation.
Nothing will be resolved in the Middle East if no solution is found to this conflict with the support of the entire international community, including the Arab countries, the Palestinians and, of course, Israel and the United States.
I am grateful to France and to Italy for having pointed this out and also to the Finnish Presidency for having flown the European flag again, embarked on this path and begun negotiations with all of the actors, including Syria.
We earnestly desire an international peace conference.
That is the European response to the US concept of destruction and constructive imbalance and it is, I might add, the only possible solution.
We are relieved today, but a page has been turned.
Europe will, of course, help rebuild Lebanon, but I defended in my group what you want, MrÂ Gollnisch, that is to say the notion of making those responsible for the destruction pay, not because we will have to claim back our money, but because this is a notion of justice and responsibility and because, without justice and without shouldering oneâs responsibilities, there will be no peace in the Middle East.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, each one of the civilian victims of this war is a tragedy, both in Lebanon and in Israel, and it is our solidarity with those who are suffering that I should like straightaway to express in this House.
This solidarity now features among our main concerns, just as, as has been pointed out, a return to the political process and the road map do, but there is also the release of the Israeli soldiers, support for the democratisation of Lebanon â the history, traditions and culture of which have nothing to do with the terrorist ideology of Hezbollah â the lifting of the blockade of Lebanon, provided that an arms embargo is decreed, and the crucial issue of the disarmament of Hezbollah.
I should like cordially to respond to MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, who was asking us just now whether anyone was concerned about these issues a year ago.
We, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit â myself and other fellow Members â mentioned ResolutionÂ 1559 in MarchÂ 2005.
We, the European Parliament, meeting in plenary, mentioned and voted on â I am quoting from memory because I no longer have the note here - âthe irrefutable evidence of terrorist actsâ.
We called for, and voted in favour of, the disarmament of Hezbollah, and also asked the Council to act along those lines.
We did do so.
That being said, I quite understand those who speak today before this Assembly of the need to start a dialogue and to resort once again to diplomacy, but I ask the question: how can Sheikh Nasrallah be made to comply with ResolutionsÂ 1559 and 1701 when, on numerous occasions, including as recently as yesterday morning, in the Lebanese press, he has rejected all appeals to disarm?
I would come back to what the Commissioner was saying: Europe is now more than ever at a crossroads when it comes to finding new paths and preventing a repeat of past mistakes, something that would prove absolutely tragic.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for a moment I found it liberating when our esteemed colleague MrÂ Watson said that we must look forward, rather than back.
However, the people killed so cruelly and senselessly, in this cruel and senseless war, oblige us to ask whether this war could have been avoided, and that is a question that Europe, too, must answer.
In March 2005, this Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Hizbollahâs terrorist activities and asked the Council to take measures to deal with them.
No such measures were taken; the Council did not comply with this request.
As for the UN resolution on disarmament: there was never any initiative on the part of the European Union to ensure its implementation.
On the contrary, Hizbollah was arming itself massively for years.
Did our secret services not know this?
Did we not notice that Hizbollah were setting themselves up with hundreds of rocket bases under the cover of civilian residential areas?
Nothing was done about this.
Did we really not see that Iran was using this conflict as a means of gaining hegemony in the region?
Could we in Europe really not see the impending danger of war, so that we can now so simply cover up our inactivity by looking forward, rather than back?
Every side in this House invokes Israelâs right to exist - quite rightly too, and I am very glad about this - but why do we then look on while those who wish to destroy Israel continually reorganise themselves, until social, political and even military panic breaks out over there?
Could it be that in looking back we see our own joint responsibility for these events?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as a pacifist, I have never believed that peace could be achieved by means of arms.
I am therefore not overjoyed at sending troops to Lebanon but, realistically, I realise that we are dealing with a damage-limitation intervention, which is the only possible way to get Israel to withdraw from Lebanon.
The more neutral the peacekeeping forces remain, however, the more credible they will be.
Therefore Italy and the other nations involved in UNIFIL must immediately break off all military aid agreements with Israel, such as the one signed by Italy two years ago.
If the aim is to achieve a lasting peace, troops are not enough, and so I call on the European Union to organise the deployment of civilian peace corps as well along the Lebanese-Israeli border, with their own mandate and managed separately from the military mission.
We should support the call already made by humanitarian groups for a UN committee of inquiry into possible war crimes committed by Israel against civilians, including the use of cluster bombs and the bombing of civilian infrastructure.
I agree with the Councilâs assessment that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without respect for the rights of the Palestinian people.
The European Union should therefore formally propose to send in a buffer force between Palestine and Israel as well, and to demand that Israel comply with all the UN resolutions.
Â Â  Mr President, the EU is using the conflict between Israel and Lebanon as a pretext for strengthening the common foreign and security policy.
Our view is that the Member States should act independently in their respective foreign policy relations and coordinate their efforts and common positions within the framework of existing international organisations.
The UN is the international organisation best placed to bring about a lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
Complex foreign policy issues require long-term global solutions rather than EU measures often characterised by narrow national special interests.
The international community must become better at preventing conflicts and at increasing the UNâs ability to intervene in time.
We support the ongoing development of multifunctional efforts to promote peace.
This work must take place within the framework of UN cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not endorse every act of Israel, but I am in no doubt that in the recent conflict it was not the aggressor and was, as a sovereign State, fully entitled to defend itself against sustained and murderous rocket attacks by Hizbollah.
The fact that Hizbollah, supplied by Iran and Syria, was able to act as it did while part of the Government of Lebanon illustrates the folly of ever admitting to government any terrorist-orientated organisation, be it in Lebanon, Palestine or, indeed, in my own Northern Ireland.
In Israel, the level of sustained assault was such that a powerful response was necessary.
Now, a major challenge for the future is to disarm Hizbollah.
I trust that critical part of the mandate will not be dodged or diluted; otherwise, we merely store up more trouble for the future.
Let us learn some lessons and let us address that critical part of the mandate.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the incredibly violent events that took place this summer in Lebanon are very serious.
We are witnessing the speeding-up of the historical process, and the ingredients sustaining this conflict have never been so concentrated: more and more military technology, more and more fanaticism and more and more arrogance.
Given these wayward paths that are being taken, we must be fully aware that we are sitting on a ticking time-bomb that is in danger of throwing the Middle East into a state of unrest in the long term and that will affect Europe.
Everyone recognises that the continuous build-up of violence has now reached its limits and that international law must be complied with.
Lifting the blockade of Lebanon is now a matter of urgency, but the main priority is to settle the conflict between Israel and Palestine before it is too late.
Europe must raise its voice.
It must make the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area based on peace, development for all and dialogue among civilisations of decisive importance.
When it met on 24Â August in Brussels, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly â EMPA â a sovereign assembly that gathers together MEPs, members of the national parliaments of the 25 countries and the elected representatives of 10 Mediterranean countries, decided to send a delegation to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine.
As chairman of the political committee of that Assembly, I shall be leading that delegation from 18Â September, with our mission being to examine the conditions necessary for a resumption of political dialogue.
Through this delegation, which links the two shores of the Mediterranean, we want to pave the way together for a new stage in a genuine Euro-Mediterranean partnership in which Europe has a crucial role to play.
MrÂ Tuomioja, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, the time has come.
Â Â  Mr President, let us be clear: to have been successful in prevention, management and, now, post-war reconstruction, Europe would have required the right tools.
We do not have them yet.
We do not have a Constitution in force; a Constitution that includes a Minister for Foreign Affairs, allows decisions to be made by qualified majority and enables the Council to call upon a group of countries to carry out the mission which is now going to be carried out by certain Member States.
We are being offered an opportunity, however: an opportunity that follows a brutal war.
Italy, France, Spain and other Union countries have committed themselves to participating in a reinforced UNIFIL, the main task of which will be to ensure compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701.
Politically speaking, however, the fundamental issue here is to change direction in the Middle East: change the direction that the United States has tried to impose unilaterally since the Iraq war.
What a difference between the soldiers who occupied Iraq and the European soldiers who are now going to enforce international law and restore peace.
Let us not forget that that difference is also based on values: the European Unionâs values.
We do not have to reinvent the wheel.
We have the Barcelona process and we must use it to the full.
We must imbue the Middle East conflict with the sprit of the Euro-Mediterranean process, with cooperation, with solidarity, with dialogue between cultures and peoples, in order to establish and maintain peace.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is part of that process.
It will be my honour to take part in the delegation that it is going to send to the region, led by MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi.
That is an achievement that we should stress.
We must defend democracy in Lebanon and we must also be able to promote a new international conference based on the spirit of the successful Madrid Conference.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council of Ministersâ failure to call for an immediate ceasefire meant we stood back and let the infrastructure of Lebanon be destroyed and led to more than one thousand civilian deaths both in Lebanon and Israel, not to mention the cluster bombs which will lead to even more.
I lay that failure directly at the door of the British Government, and Tony Blair in particular.
What has he achieved with his dog-like devotion to George Bush?
Apart from wanton destruction of property and life, it has led to further alienation of the Muslim community.
He has the nerve to say that he does not believe it will lead to further terrorist attacks.
If I am angry â and people like me are angry â over Iraq and now Lebanon, what sort of ammunition does it give to people intent on the indoctrination of alienated young Muslims?
Nothing, I repeat , excuses terrorist acts, but Tony Blair must wake up to the fact that his actions make him culpable.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, for the most part I agree with you and I think that you have steered Europe - this Europe which still lacks a Constitution - very well through this crisis.
You have said that there can be no military or unilateral solution to any of the continuing conflicts in the region, and, while I agree with you, I would like to add that we also have to talk about Iran in this context.
If we want to prevent Hizbollah from rearming, if we want to prevent Rumsfeldâs threat from becoming a reality after the expiry of the deadline â he thought that there could be a new war â if we want to prevent this, then we Europeans have to recommence negotiations with Iran on solutions to the nuclear conflict and also on ending its support of Hizbollah.
I believe that we owe this to Israel, but also to the entire Middle East.
This requires the courage to overcome the American barricade and to say, very clearly: the solution is simple, we cannot consider the suspension of nuclear enrichment, at least for the time being, as a precondition, rather it is our goal.
However, we cannot demand this as a precondition for talks; rather, we must negotiate in order to achieve our goal.
That is the way to proceed.
If we Europeans can achieve this together, then I think we will actually have a peaceful solution for the entire Middle East.
Â Â  â Mr President, European public opinion has reacted with satisfaction to the EUâs rapid and un-bureaucratic response to the events in Lebanon.
It was the Councilâs decision to send a seven-thousand-strong contingent of troops to Lebanon that saved the UNIFIL mission.
Similarly, the portions of humanitarian aid that the Commission provided also saved our image in that country.
These actions will give us the opportunity to become an important player in the Middle East, rather than standing on the sidelines, as was the case during the Iraq crisis.
For this to be able to happen in the short term, the most important thing, in my view, is to prepare and lead the UNIFIL mission properly.
Until recently, this was not a difficult mission and the forcesâ mandate was restricted.
However, the mission now needs to be significantly extended, meaning it will become dangerous, particularly for our troops on the ground.
Tasks such as isolating Hizbollah terrorists from sources of armaments or disarming the group pose a major threat to the military contingent.
Secondly, in the medium term, Lebanon needs financial aid, which needs to flow in on a larger scale.
This is necessary to rebuild the infrastructure, to strengthen democratic institutions, and to modernise and develop the Lebanese security forces In order to achieve this, we need to make use of our , in particular the power of EU cash.
Thirdly, in the long term, a comprehensive peace solution for the entire region is necessary.
This means entering into serious dialogue with Syria and successful negotiations with Iran concerning its nuclear programme.
However, a real agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is also necessary because this is where the key to stability in the Middle East lies.
Without it the region will remain a flashpoint.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we must look forward, but it is also worth looking back to see how the Lebanon crisis was managed.
Although the result achieved by European engagement is acceptable, the way in which this result was achieved is not entirely so.
We have seen how there was confusion for weeks, with debates taking place in the national capitals, but not in the European capital, in Brussels.
I maintain that it is thanks to the Finnish Presidency and to the Italian Government that Europe has narrowly escaped embarrassment.
The crisis zone is in our neighbourhood, and we therefore have a particular responsibility.
It is very nice to hear from Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the EU is ready to give humanitarian and practical aid immediately.
The chain of responsibility for this is clear, as are the mechanisms and methods for it.
When it comes to political and military aid, however, nothing is clear.
Here there is a huge gap, a great deficiency, and it took ages for things to get coordinated.
I would also say that this crisis has once again clearly demonstrated the price we pay for lacking a Constitution.
We need new instruments, a President of the Council who can call upon the Heads of State or Government, a European foreign minister who can make use of this operational level, a European foreign service which can gather information on the ground, and a group of Member States to be able, through enhanced cooperation, to act on the EUâs behalf.
Let us look forward.
I would also say: we now have a chance to become not just financial donors, but also political actors in the Middle East.
Europe has something to contribute.
The CSCE or Madrid Conference must now be the model for the next step.
We have put an end to the Cold War: this must also be possible in the Middle East.
Â Â  Mr President, if many of us see this moment as an opportunity for the European Union, it is not through Europeanist conviction, but rather through Europeanist conviction.
Only when the European Union speaks and acts as one and in accordance with its weight in the world, and in accordance with its commitments, can it really be effective.
If it does not do that, then it is not effective.
We therefore have the historic obligation to make the most of this moment, using the instruments we have, though it is true that we do not have all the instruments we should have.
This is a time for politics, for putting all of the European Unionâs weight and moral authority behind the search for a solution that guarantees Israelâs security without its neighbours having to pay with their lives and their freedom.
This is a time for European unity in order to demand an end to the occupation, in order to support the authority of the United Nations over the State of Israel as well, which, incidentally, owes its very existence to the United Nations.
This is a time for united military action within UNIFIL, the legitimacy and political weight of which will increase if it becomes genuinely European, and the instruments are in place to make it so, without the need for a Constitution.
Let us hope that a lasting peace can emerge from this miserable war.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the recent tragic events in Lebanon and the escalation of the situation in the Palestinian territories have brought the international community face to face with the impasses in this vulnerable region and their repercussions on global peace and security.
This is of particular concern to us as Europeans, because the economic, political or ecological repercussions of the crisis directly affect the Member States of the Union, while at the same time hampering the joint plan for peace, security and prosperity in the region and the creation of a free trade zone by 2010.
Europe therefore has vital reasons for seeking peace and development in the region.
Its intervention must start to exert greater influence for a peaceful solution to these problems.
Developments in this region indicate to us once again the complex and multifaceted nature of the situation, something which the European Union, due to its proximity and its historical ties and partnerships with the states in the area, knows better than other forces.
Thus, today, despite its weaknesses, the European Union is less divided than it was during the Iraq crisis and more aware of the need for joint action. It is demonstrating this with its intention to apply the Security Council resolution, the need to clarify the content and the role of the peacekeeping force and its participation in this force.
It must also work for the immediate reversal of the isolation of Lebanon in order for its political, humanitarian and development intervention to become more effective.
It must, moreover, support the Lebanese Government, which has been damaged both by recent events and by the long-term Syrian occupation and, at the same time, strengthen the democratic institutions and the evolution of the political system towards a popular system in which the creative forces will be freed from narrow religious confines and will operate on the basis of parties and programming statements.
Such a policy and social development will also bring Hezbollah, which remains a myth and a mystery, closer to 'Lebanisation', transparency and participation in order to resolve the problems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, following the conflict in the summer of 2006, which was a bloodbath for Lebanon, we agree that the European Union has an historic opportunity to play a major role in the complex partitioning of the Middle East.
Our road map has several objectives.
The first is to convince the international community and all the protagonists in the region that a violent solution â by which I also mean a military solution â cannot guarantee lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East, whether it be in Lebanon, Palestine or anywhere else.
The second is to take the lead in promoting the implementation of an overall political solution for the region and to state clearly that there would be no sense in settling the various regional conflicts separately.
In this connection, we recommend an international conference that would necessarily have to bring together all the actors in the region, including Iran â whose nuclear status is a particularly thorny issue â and also Syria, with which we need to resume association negotiations but without giving up our demands for democratic reform.
Nor can we any longer ignore indefinitely political forces brought to power through elections, in Palestine or Lebanon, that we ourselves deemed to be democratic.
Where Lebanon, specifically, is concerned, we need resolutely to commit ourselves to its reconstruction, arrange for the embargo to be lifted without delay, rebuild its infrastructure and destroyed houses and remove the mines that daily put the Lebanese in danger and make a third of the countryâs land unfit for cultivation.
These are not only financial objectives but also political objectives for the European Union.
Let us not leave the reconstruction solely to Hezbollah and another Qatar.
Finally, we need, I conclude, to support the democrats and progressive political forces in Lebanon.
As in the spring of 2005, let us know how to support the determination of the Lebanese to embrace their collective destiny.
This summer, they have shown what they are capable of.
Â Â  Mr President, I will start by quoting an article by GideonÂ Levy published in on 3 September 2006.
He says, âGaza has been reoccupied.
The world must know this (...).
It is in its worst condition, ever.
Since (...) the outbreak of the Lebanon war, the Israeli Defence Forces have been rampaging through Gaza â thereâs no other word to describe it â killing and demolishing, bombing and shelling, indiscriminately.
âNobody thinks about setting up a commission of inquiry; the issue isnât even on the agenda.
Nobody asks why it is being done and who decided to do it.
But under the cover of the darkness of the Lebanon war, the IDF returned to its old practices in Gaza as if there had been no disengagement.â
I turn now to the war in Lebanon.
On this, are our hands clean?
Did our Council of Ministers not call for a cessation of hostilities rather than a ceasefire?
Did they not know that only a bloodbath could only ever ensue as a result?
On this, I accept my countryâs responsibility.
Is it really enough to send blankets and bandages after facilitating the supply of arms that caused the injuries in the first place?
Was it completely unforeseeable that Israel would undertake actions against international law by undertaking a policy of collective punishment?
Was it really that unimaginable that Israel would seize this as an opportunity to march back into Gaza?
Many colleagues speak of terror, but is it not the case that the hand of extremists has been considerably ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for all the information they have provided.
I cannot, MrÂ President, hide my frustration as a Member of this Parliament when I have to acknowledge yet again that the European Union cannot move with as much speed, determination and authority as it should in such circumstances.
We have initiated a partnership policy in the Mediterranean region that is not just economic or commercial but must also be political.
I support the line you are taking, Commissioner, and the more assertive role that has been adopted.
Italy and France have taken an important initiative: even though the European Union certainly does not yet have its own diplomatic and military capacity, there is still ample room for manoeuvre for it to develop a leading role in many of that regionâs affairs.
The European Union needs to be much more assertive if it is to find a solution for the regionâs stability, and it must take action to help the Lebanese democratic authorities to strengthen their institutional structure and the organisation of their state.
To ensure true sovereignty and real independence, it must supply humanitarian aid and resources, it must ensure that our institutions maintain a top-level diplomatic presence in Lebanon, and it must activate the association agreements with Lebanon and with Syria.
On this subject, the Council ought to tell us why the agreement with Syria has never been signed, given that we consider Syria to play a very important role in the region.
The European Parliament too should take the appropriate initiatives to put the EU-Lebanon dialogue into effect.
Then there remains the problem that has been left unsolved for many years of the large numbers of stateless refugees in Lebanon, who are living in emergency conditions and constitute a potentially dangerous source of destabilising activities.
A political solution needs to be found for them.
Lastly, I must mention the conference proposed by the Council: the peace conference is an important moment that must be seized when the time is right, and the European Parliament will certainly not fail to support it.
Â Â  âMr President, there is no military solution to the conflict in Lebanon.
These words in the joint resolution which we are now debating inspire real cheer and hope.
In the past, many countries used war was a means of enhancing their prestige and power on the international arena, but these times have passed.
The words of von Clausewitz, a Prussian general, that âwar is merely a continuation of politics by other meansâ now belong in the dustbin of history. This is confirmed by the United Nations Charter, which forbids the use of force to resolve international disputes, the use of aggression and the violation of the sovereignty of another state.
This is the reason why the entry of Israeli troops into Lebanon was in breach of international law.
It aggravated the existing conflict, and unleashed the armed reaction of Hizbollah.
It is a good thing that the European Parliament is paying particular attention to the human dimension of this conflict, and that it is calling on the warring parties to free hostages, to treat the civilian population humanely, and to observe the Geneva Convention of 1949.
The Lebanese conflict is taking place near us, practically on our doorstep.
By sending out EU troops and providing humanitarian aid, Europe has already played an important role.
As an active player, the EU will have a real chance to make a significant contribution to resolving this conflict.
It is through such action that the European Union creates its own Common Foreign Policy, as described in such detail in the European Constitution.
It is for this reason, if for no other, that we so badly need a European Constitution.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, unilateralism has been showing all its limitations for some time, and the European Union has finally taken the initiative and promoted a bold intervention together with the United Nations.
It has thus gained a little time to settle the conflict.
The context is of course the entire Middle East, but the priority remains the relationship between Israel and Palestine, and that is where we must start.
The Union has shown the validity of an approach based on positive interaction between different cultures, the primacy of politics and a refusal to use force: these are precisely the values that have enabled us to live without war in Europe for two generations.
The European Union can and must promote the same principles and the same transparent, many-sided approach around the world, aiming at conflict prevention through political dialogue.
For all these reasons I am proud to be European at this moment, and still more to be Italian, in view of the role that my country has played in this context.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent conflict between Israel and Hizbollah is a tragedy for Israel and the people of Lebanon.
For some time, many of us in this House have been campaigning for the EU to declare Hizbollah a terrorist organisation.
It is clear that Hizbollah seriously miscalculated the scale of the retribution when it decided to kill eight soldiers and kidnap two from northern Israel.
Hassan Nasrallah, its leader, has admitted as much.
Hizbollah has a lot of explaining to do as to why its deliberate provocation has caused so much damage to Lebanese infrastructure, with the deaths of so many Lebanese civilians.
This is partly explained by Hizbollahâs outrageous tactic of using human shields to launch its rockets from civilian-populated areas.
Israel also seems to have made the mistake of believing that air power alone was sufficient to dislodge Hizbollah, whereas what was required were more boots on the ground.
Clearly, Israeli intelligence underestimated Hizbollahâs training and equipment, in particular high-tech Russian anti-tank and anti-ship weapons.
Russia must now explain how its weapons ended up in the hands of an Islamist fundamentalist militia.
My main concern now following UN Security Council Resolution 1701 relates to who is finally going to disarm Hizbollah.
Madam Commissioner, what safeguards are in place to prevent the millions of euros of EU aid and reconstruction money from being diverted to Hizbollah through one of its so-called charities?
We remember in the past all the allegations of graft when there was direct EU budgetary aid to the Palestinian Authority under Arafat.
I also want to know what will prevent troops from Muslim countries like Malaysia and Bangladesh, which do not recognise the State of Israel, from turning a blind eye to the rearmament of Hizbollah.
Lastly, I believe the time has now come under the roadmap for peace to prise brutal but rational and secular Syria away from theocratic, fundamentalist Iran.
The EU could offer significant trade and aid benefits to Syria to bring it back to the negotiating table with Israel.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by responding to the last speech.
I wonder what Muslims in Britain and across Europe think when the British Conservatives say that troops from Muslim countries cannot be relied upon to do their job in a United Nations force?
Like others speaking in this debate, I believe that further crises in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region can only be averted by refocusing the debate on a just peace between Israel and the Palestinian people.
Whilst the conflict was continuing in Lebanon, international attention ignored the rockets fired from Gaza and the 250 air strikes, 1000 artillery shells and over 200 killings inflicted on its people.
Was it justifiable to cut off electricity to half of the inhabitants of Gaza, to close nearly every school, and even to stop fishermen from taking to their boats?
The UN has described Gaza as a time bomb whose people are living in a cage.
Sometimes a moment of crisis brings new fluidity: Hizbollahâs statement conceding it had neither planned nor anticipated the conflict, the prisonersâ initiative, the possible national unity government for Palestine and the recognition by Israeli politicians and public alike of the failings of unilateralism must presage a diplomatic drive to return to a negotiated solution.
Today we have a map for the road but no one in the car.
Europe, which has done so much in terms both of humanitarian aid to Lebanon and in evacuating innocent people and committing peacekeeping troops, must now relentlessly pursue that political dialogue.
We need new dialogue with the Arab world to support UN resolutions and recognise not just election results but also their consequences.
We need to use intermediaries, such as Turkey, to help with that dialogue and speed up temporary assistance to the Palestinian people.
Â Â  Mr President, we are much obliged to the Finnish Presidency for having tried to keep the EU united on this difficult issue, but we do have quite a long way to go before we really have a common European foreign policy.
If the EU is to have long-term political influence in the region, we specifically need a political strategy, a kind of democratic Marshall Plan for the entire region, which is in actual fact the least free region in the whole world.
We must naturally help demilitarise and neutralise Hezbollah.
Damascus and, above all, Teheran have the key to this process, and extensive work needs to be done from those cities.
We must get the peace process under way again between Israelis and Palestinians, preferably in the form of the conference that fellow Members have talked about.
To have two democratic states side by side is the only way of creating peace and stability in the region.
In combination with this, conscious, systematic and long-term faith must also be placed in all the democratic forces in the region as a whole if we are to achieve results.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has finally made its voice heard and has been able to perform an active, leading role in the Middle East crisis, albeit a little late and not without some difficulty.
That, however, is just a first step on the long road that should lead the European Union, together with the United Nations, the United States and the Arab League, to achieve the stabilisation of a region where all the threats to world security have their origin.
UNIFIL is a means; the final objective must be the birth of a sovereign Lebanon free from foreign influences exercised in part through Hizbollah.
I would ask the Council and the Commission what point has been reached in disarming the armed militia that attacked Israel.
I should mention that last year this Parliament stated that there was incontrovertible proof of terrorist acts by Hizbollah and, by a very large majority of its Members, called on the Council to adopt whatever measures were necessary to put an end to the groupâs activities.
In that regard, Syria is called upon to stop shilly-shallying and to take active steps to help stop the flow of arms intended for terrorists.
Within the framework of safeguarding human rights, the UNIFIL troops, to whom we send our solidarity and support, must also be entrusted with the task of protecting the Lebanese Christian community: they are not to blame but are caught between the two opposing sides.
Alongside the Lebanese objective, we should set ourselves a broader aim: the âtwo peoples, two statesâ solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis will pull the rug out from under the feet of terrorists and Islamic fundamentalists.
Achieving this aim will require Europe to play a leading role, but how can the Union be the bringer of peace without a constitution to grant the necessary powers to those who must perform this task?
As a result, the debate on the constitution is thrust centre stage once again.
Rather than an exercise for legal experts, this is the central issue, the issue of how to export beyond our borders the most important result of our 50 years of Europe: peace.
Â Â  â Mr President, I had resolved to start my speech differently, but now I shall start by asking MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner to read in the magazine âLe Pointâ the article on relations between Israel and Palestine, especially concerning the serious problem of the water supply to the Palestinian occupied territories due to the practice being exercised by Israel.
The magazine refers to the apartheid being imposed by the Israeli authorities on the Palestinians on the subject of water.
What has the Council done over all this time?
Last February it decided to freeze financial aid to the Palestinian people, while Israel continues not to pay duty and taxes to the Palestinian Authority without coming under pressure, without some sort of measure having been taken on the part of the European Union.
I believe, and this is a challenge to the Finnish Presidency, that the European Union and the Council of Ministers should take a decision to lift the economic sanctions on the Palestinian people as soon as President Abbas forms the new national unity government in Palestine.
This will give an incentive to the Palestinian people, an incentive to the moderate reform forces in Palestine and the Hamas forces to integrate peacefully into the democratic life of Palestine.
Â Â  Mr President, following the hostilities the European Union has been widely called upon to lead and contribute the core of UNIFIL, to implement Resolution 1701, to play a primary role in humanitarian aid and reconstruction and to encourage the parties to take part in political dialogue.
However, prior to the end of the hostilities, we did not punch the weight of a major international player.
We may have reached a unanimous decision, but it was not a uniform one and we were not listened to either by the Security Council or by the belligerent parties.
If we had been listened to and these events had taken place a few weeks earlier, the military results on the ground would have been exactly the same but there would have been less loss of life, less destruction, less displacement and fewer Katyushas and cluster bombs, along with everything else qualified as âcollateral damageâ.

The lessons are there to be learned: neither military might nor Katyushas or Qassams can solve problems, and nor can unilateralism; the EU and the UN need to talk to all the parties, whether they like or approve of them or not.
Finally, Lebanon needs our full support to consolidate its sovereignty, because that country has suffered a war by proxy for purely extra-Lebanese reasons.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has been said, but I think that this resolution that has been put to the vote is well balanced.
It presents the facts in some detail but without ever pronouncing judgment and so avoids the pitfall of siding with one or other of the protagonists.
I regret that our resolution reduces the causes of the Israeli-Lebanese war to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
As General de Gaulle used to say, you cannot go into the Middle East, complicated as it is, with just a few simple ideas, and that is the message that I too want in a way to convey.
Like all of us, I want to see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved, but do you really believe that this will reduce tension within Lebanon and put a stop to Syrian interference and Iranian ambitions?
Moreover, will Hezbollah be disarmed as a result?
It is the insecurity and the growing suffering of the Israeli population of Galilee that have triggered hostilities against Hezbollah.
This state of permanent threat has been fostered not only by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also, and above all, by Hezbollahâs constant firing of rockets into the north of Israel.
Israelâs fears are all the greater insofar as the Hezbollah militias are armed by a powerful Iran whose democratically elected President constantly makes known his desire to wipe Israel from the map.
This is a man who must now be taken seriously, which is what I, for my part, do.
Consequently, I do not think that the two causes should be confused.
In the north, Lebanon is concerned to regain its sovereignty and put a stop to the interference by its various neighbours, while Israel wants to guarantee its security.
In the south, meanwhile, the task is to create an independent Palestinian state within secure borders that is able, over time, to co-exist in peace with its neighbour, Israel.
Â Â  Mr President, my whole life engagement with the Middle East does not lighten my own burden of responsibility.
The situation is grave; we are almost engaged in the process of recreating an Islamic Caliphate.
In south Lebanon, we are not facing resistance movement militias, but rather special units that are well trained, manned and equipped by Iranian revolutionary guards.
They are equipped via Damascus international airport.
This army is probably better than any other Arab regular army.
Therefore, I suggest we must close and seal the Lebanese-Syrian border, send an EU monitoring mission such as the one sent to Serbia and Republika Srpska in the mid-1990s.
We must fully control Damascus international airport.
We need clear rules of engagement.
I ask you, what precisely does âassist the Lebanese army, disarming of armed groups without right to use forceâ mean?
We have to pull Syria back from its involvement with Russia and Russian interests immediately.
What can we offer there?
We have to bring back Lebanese businessmen to increase investorsâ confidence in their country, and we have to stop Iran from smuggling uranium, otherwise regional war will turn into a global problem.
Â Â  Mr President, despite the very welcome efforts of the Commission and indeed of the United Nations, it is difficult to display optimism in this dark period.
Israel, a state that prides itself on its democratic credentials, launched with impunity a destructive war against a neighbouring, struggling secular democracy, destroying its infrastructure and killing its citizens, mostly innocent civilians.
It has also used inhumane cluster bombs.
How can we describe the bombing of Qana except as a war crime?
And yet Israel continues with impunity to maintain an air and sea blockade of its victim while continuing to squeeze the economic and political life out of Gaza, not to mention the killing of 200 Palestinians under the cover of the war on Lebanon.
I do not dismiss the malign role of Hizbollah in all of this, nor indeed â as has not been mentioned so far â the malign influence of the United States in encouraging Israel in its actions.
I believe that Israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of Lebanon.
It must release Palestinian monies and it must face an international inquiry into its actions in relation to Lebanon.
I also believe that an international peace conference that does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists in the Middle East will not succeed, nor will it get off the ground.
I am talking about a price in terms of money, in terms of trade and in terms of arms supplies.
Unless there is a price to be paid, those protagonists will not come to the table and will not make a deal.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a time of crisis in the Middle East but also perhaps a time of opportunity.
Europe faces three connected challenges in this regard.
First, the UNIFIL peace-keeping/peace enforcement mission in Lebanon.
UN forces led by the EU must ensure that United Nations Resolution 1701 is enforced and that, through cooperation with Lebanese troops and political leaders, Hizbollah can be disarmed.
UNIFIL II must also ensure that further arms are not smuggled into Lebanon to rearm any groups and that Lebanonâs sovereignty is respected at all times.
UNIFIL II must be successful.
A lot is riding on that and failure would have disastrous consequences for the region as a whole and for Europe.
On the issue of committing troops to UNIFIL II, some EU countries have been generous to date.
However, most commitment has come from larger EU nations and I hope we will see future commitments from smaller countries, particularly those who have significant experience of peace-keeping in Lebanon in the past.
In that context, I continue to call on my own government in Ireland to at least make an offer of troops, even if the numbers are small, because I believe they have a positive role to play.
The second challenge is to help rebuild Lebanon after the devastation of the summer.
The EU is already responding in this regard, but we should realise that we have an opportunity here, that in rebuilding Lebanonâs infrastructure we can also build the EUâs reputation in the region as a whole, as well as in the minds of the Lebanese people.
The third challenge is the wider political challenge of the need to provide stability in the Middle East generally.
In order to do this, we must grasp the difficult nettle of forging a way forward in the Israel-Palestinian problem.
The wider political roadmap is still there on paper and so we do not need to reinvent the wheel here.
However, we need to play our part in finding ways to create fresh enthusiasm and acceptance for the roadmap as the way forward and, in this regard, the difficult task of engaging with Syria will be necessary.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, it is with sadness that I have followed the tragic situation in Lebanon over recent weeks.
Lebanon has made great strides since the end of the civil war in terms of human rights and citizensâ rights, constructing and strengthening a multicultural and multi-ethnic democracy and civil society.
There has also been enormous progress with economic renewal.
Unfortunately, though, many of these gains have been diminished or destroyed by the excessive use of military force in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
I firmly believe that one of the conditions for sustainable peace in the Middle East is the existence of an independent, strong and sovereign Lebanon, together with the existence of Israel and a Palestinian State.
It has been demonstrated in recent months and years, however, that Lebanon cannot achieve this goal on its own.
It needs help from the international community; it needs help with economic renewal; it needs help with consolidating democracy; it needs help with the exercise of State authority in all of its aspects, including security and military aspects throughout the whole country.
This is the only way in which the elected Lebanese State institutions will be able to disarm the military wing of Hezbollah and integrate the movement into the countryâs political life.
I should like to call on the Council and the Commission not to backslide in their efforts to help Lebanon.
Â Â  Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, fellow Members, on the issue of the way in which we deal with the Middle East conflict, a number of representatives of the European institutions have recently appealed for a structured and overall solution to the regionâs problems.
MrÂ Brok recently stated that one of the keys to lasting peace in Lebanon was the disarmament of Hezbollah and the monitoring of the Syrian-Lebanese border with a view to stopping the traffic in arms.
Finally, one of my eminent fellow Members said that we were not the Red Cross and that we were to play a positive political role.
I agree with all that.
Indeed, no overall solution can seriously be envisaged without returning to the issue that, since 1948, has been at the source of all the conflicts that have caused blood baths in this region. By this, I mean the refusal to recognise Israelâs right to exist.
It is vital to bear that in mind or otherwise be in danger of confusing cause and consequence.
Today, it is Iran, together with Syria â its go-between â and Hezbollah â its military wing â that carry this message of hatred, throwing in the face of the international community their desire to wipe a sovereign state and its people from the world map.
We have a duty as human beings to relieve the misfortune of populations taken hostage by Hezbollahâs terrorist action.
Our commitment must be balanced if we are to play the positive political role that falls to us.
Balance does not lie in unilaterally and systematically stigmatising a single party to the conflict, in the event Israel.
Balance necessarily involves having the warmongers, Syria and Iran, confront their international responsibilities.
We owe it to two states, Lebanon and Israel - with which we have friendly relations - and we owe it to two peoples, those of Israel and Lebanon, who are our friends and who aspire only to live in peace.
I would therefore express the wish that the parliamentary mission that will soon visit the region should carry with it this concern for balance and be able to contribute actively to seeking a peaceful solution between people of good will in the region, so affirming our intransigence towards intolerance and messages of hatred while, at the same time, displaying what binds us together as human beings.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I fully endorse the speech made by my colleague, Mr Howitt.
It has already been said that violence cannot be an answer to the problems of the Middle East and neither can unilateralism.
History proves this: Israel withdrew from the Sinai in the context of a negotiated peace agreement and from the Arava in a negotiated peace with Jordan.
Israel withdrew from south Lebanon and Gaza unilaterally without agreements.
Enough said.
This is the EUâs chance to prove that our approach is right, but it will be a difficult sell.
I could share with you many personal stories of Palestinian friends and their suffering living under violent Israeli occupation, but I want to share the story of a friend of mine in Israel.
His name is Renan.
He is a DJ.
He does not want to fight, he only wants to dance.
He is dead set against occupation and walks at the front of every peace demonstration in Israel.
However, I was there when he received the call from the IDF to tell him to prepare for the fight.
He was shocked and afraid, but he said, âWhat do you expect us to do?
Hizbollah has been bombing Haifa and Natanya for years now.
How are we supposed to trust Europe if you are not even willing to call that terrorism?â
Our resolution speaks of root causes that need to be addressed.
Let me try to define these root causes in the words of Daniel Levy, co-author of the Geneva Peace Initiative.
He said that the Palestinian cause, the injustice of occupation, the hypocrisy of the United States and the West are a grievance for millions worldwide.
Some abuse and use that and will continue to do so with effect until this conflict is resolved.
In order to be effective in the region we need the trust of ordinary citizens.
We can earn this trust only by consistently addressing these root causes, but we can earn my friend Renanâs trust only if we are willing to say out loud that Hizbollah is a radical militant group that abuses the Palestinian cause to strengthen its position as a threat to democracy in Lebanon and as a threat to ordinary Israelis.
Â Â  âMr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I would like to briefly raise three issues.
The first concerns a common assessment of Israelâs reaction to Hizbollahâs provocative and shameful actions.
It was a reaction that was vastly out of proportion to the kidnapping of two soldiers and which is reminiscent of the Trojan wars fought over the beautiful Helen.
There are many examples of abductions and political solutions in the world.
It is difficult to support the reaction of a state whose existence is widely recognised by most of the global community, except for a few fundamentalist states, when this state has shown itself to be a military aggressor.
This is difficult even for Israelâs allies to accept, as we have heard from prominent Members of this House.
Secondly, did we really not know that Hizbollah had armed itself with several thousand Katyusha rocket launchers?
It was not something that could be done in a week. It must have taken months or even years.
Where were the international observers?
If the relevant knowledge and the will had existed, I believe it may have been possible to take preventive measures.
Now we have started to act by earmarking large sums of money to repair the damage, but is not it too late?
After all, we can not bring the dead â the children, the civilians â back to life.
Now for the final matter, Commissioner. This conflict is being prolonged due to the fact that it is part of a so-called social legacy, and may last for a long time yet.
In order to create the opportunity for a positive two-state solution for Palestine and Israel, both sides need to be thoroughly prepared for such a solution through appropriate education, from primary school upwards.
Such preparation may create a social foundation that will allow political decisions based on compromise to be taken more easily in the future.
Perhaps the next generation â the children and young people of today â will reach the decision that we consider to be the only sensible solution for us.
Â Â  â Mr President, 2005 saw the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process, a relatively lengthy process aimed at establishing sound ties with the other side of the Mediterranean.
Previously in this Chamber, I gave you an optimistic overview of its ambitions, of the whole process and of the path of trust that had been trodden up to that point.
Yet, as a Member of this House, a defender of the European project and a staunch advocate of international law, it was extremely difficult to observe without alarm the way in which the majority of Europeâs institutions monitored the events that took place this summer.
Until June, Lebanon was one of the most promising democracies, politically and economically speaking, in the Mediterranean and was capable of continuing that progress.
The country was also one of the biggest receivers of EU funds to support its reconstruction and development.
Today, however, Lebanon has to start again from scratch, everything has to be done again, everything has to be rebuilt â at least in terms of what euros and concrete are able to redo and rebuild.
Is there nothing we could have done earlier?
When we saw the conflict between Israel and Palestine unfold, should we not have taken prompt action?
When we saw the various international observers at the Palestinian elections having their authorisation removed, diplomatic and parliamentary immunity repeatedly violated and legitimately elected Members of Parliament and ministers detained, should we not have taken action?
Is it not the case that our relative indifference at the time and our inadequate response bore some of the responsibility for the whole situation?
I am sure that Europe did not do all it could to prevent this situation and did not take the necessary steps to turn words into real action.
We must not make the same mistakes again, and after todayâs debate this is absolutely clear to all speakers.
The EUâs role in this process is a vital one and demonstrates once again that the political strength of the EU is crucial to the worldâs stability and balance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, these are not just isolated incidents that we are witnessing in the Middle East, but rather a broad panorama of crises with global impact.
When we discuss and even criticise the efforts of the United States to eradicate tyranny and support democracy in Iraq and elsewhere, we must not ignore the games of Russia and China in the region, which may easily end up transforming the region into a burning crater of global terrorist war.
Everything is pointing to this threatening direction.
Under the auspices of Russia, Iran is becoming a major aggressive player in a region that is extremely important to humankind.
The political expansion of Iran is now targeted at precluding democracy in Lebanon and Syria, stability in Iraq and peace in Palestine.
The Iranian regime is easily distracting the attention of the UN and the EU and gaining more time for its key objective â nuclear hegemony in the Middle East.
The utopia of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is not likely to ever materialise.
The next page in history will be terrorist organisations taking power in elections: Hamas and Hezbollah are already participating in state governments and no one dares to ask Hezbollah ministers in Lebanon to choose between working for either a democratic government or a terrorist organisation.
On the contrary, the United Nations is entering negotiations with Hezbollah; negotiations with Al-Qaeda will surely follow.
Many of our problems arise from our reluctance to put up a united fight to defend ourselves against the evil; however, we are late to surrender.
Israel is left alone in its desperate struggle.
The Western democracies have shown no initiative â they are still defending themselves without any strategy and thus losing.
It is time for Europe to wake up.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to announce that, at the end of the talks with the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, the Israeli Prime Minister has announced that Israel's air and sea blockade of Lebanon will be lifted tomorrow at 5 p.m.
Â Â  â Mr President, in recent weeks, amid the appalling loss of life and humanitarian misery in the Middle East, it has been difficult to see any shaft of light.
At least the moderate Arab States have now witnessed the catastrophe that can so easily be provoked by organisations such as Hizbollah, and Lebanon has seen the effect of tolerating a State within a State.
Perhaps now there can be more sympathy for Israelâs concern to ensure that Palestine is not entrenched as another terrorist State and a base for perpetual war against the Israeli people.
It would be a tragic wasted opportunity if the reinforced UNIFIL merely became a bystander while Hizbollah prepares for its next attacks in the months and years ahead.
If there is not the international resolve to disarm Hizbollah â and that is a pity â then at least there should be a requirement to monitor and report on Hizbollahâs activities.
The Council should encourage Member States to make representations to this effect at the United Nations.
ResolutionÂ 1701 mandates UNIFIL to assist the Government of Lebanon to secure its borders.
We would encourage the Lebanese Government to take robust action in this field.
Â Â  âMr President, the Israel-Lebanon crisis is no longer typical of the conflicts in the Middle East that we have become accustomed to over the decades.
It clearly marks the start of a new global conflict between Iran and Syria, Hizbollah and Hamas, the Sunnis in Iraq and Al Qaeda on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other.
This means we need new political measures to resolve the conflict in this part of the world.
Europe now needs to get involved in resolving the conflict in Iraq.
In the same way, the European Union must also look at ways of dealing with Afghanistan.
The global threat requires a joint response from the European Union, the United States and NATO.
Europe needs a common foreign and defence policy.
Russia has to decide which side it stands on.
And Europe must emphatically demand such a decision, both in relation to Iranâs nuclear programme and arms shipments to Syria.
How did Hizbollah manage to arm itself with Russian weapons?
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to thank the European Parliament for this debate, which has been, as always, very colourful, interesting and pertinent, as well as wide-ranging.
For me, the essential message has been that the European Parliament is appreciative and supportive of the Councilâs efforts to end the conflict in Lebanon, to oversee the restoration of full Lebanese sovereignty and to facilitate a return to the Middle East peace process.
Indeed, if anything, you want the European Union to do even more; to be more coherent, to be more efficient.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I share this desire for us to speak not only with a single voice, but one which will be heard in all quarters and noted by all parties.
Realistically speaking, even in the best of times, there will always be limits to what the European Union can do acting alone.
Indeed, as a Community committed to effective multilateralism, that is as it should be.
The EU does not seek, in this conflict in the Middle East, to act by itself.
In Lebanon, we are working with others and we have to bring others on board to work alongside us.
That is the role of the European Union, but we also have to take the initiative and show leadership.
It should be remembered, too, that we would never seek to bypass or replace the United Nations.
We are there to support the United Nations, to help it to bear its responsibilities.
In this respect, the European Union has been able to live up to those expectations.
I have also read carefully Parliamentâs motion for a resolution on the Middle East, which I assume and hope will be adopted unanimously.
I regard it as a very good resolution, fully in line with what we have been trying to do and will continue to do in the Council.
It shows the ability of the European Union, and of the European Parliament, to concentrate on the essentials and give a message that will prompt all those involved in the peace process to engage in it fully.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would once again like to return very briefly to the humanitarian aspect of the question, which has also been discussed here.
A few weeks ago, Commissioner Louis Michel and I visited the area, and it was very obvious that there was immense suffering among civilians on both sides of this conflict.
It is very important and meaningful that the European Union, that is to say the Commission and the Member States together, should be committed to providing Lebanon with massive volumes of economic aid in this crisis right from the start, both in terms of emergency humanitarian relief aid and early recovery, which is now under way, as well as longer-term reconstruction.
In this connection we should recall that we have stressed everywhere that the humanitarian situation is also very serious in Gaza.
It is very important that the Lebanese Government plays a central and leading role in the long-term reconstruction process, one in which it acts as coordinator, and for that reason it is good that a new unit has been set up in Prime Minister Sinioraâs office to put this coordination process into effect.
The reconstruction process also needs a thorough needs analysis, and the Union will collaborate with Lebanon on this.
It is absolutely clear that a state of peace is also the main precondition for improving the humanitarian situation and, because of that too, we will need a comprehensive and long-term political solution to the whole range of problems that exist in this region.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I should like to thank everyone for this discussion.
It has been an excellent one and given us great support.
Nearly everybody said that there can be no military solution to the conflict and that there can only be a political solution.
Now, with the European Union having again undertaken to move forward with an initiative, it is highly important to have gained your support for adopting a broad approach, for looking at the possibility of going to the root causes and for eventually finding a comprehensive solution.
That is the overall picture and I thank you very much.
I should just like to answer two or three specific remarks.
Firstly, the Commission believes that we should work together with Israel and not suspend the Association Agreement.
We believe it is very important to work with the Israelis in order to exert an influence, and that we must engage with them, not the contrary.
Regarding Mr Tannock's point, no one has ever managed to prove the allegations that the European Union provided the money to others and not to the government.
With regard to Hizbollah, it is clear that our money will go directly to the government or to organisations that work with the government because, as I have said, we want to empower the government and to give the country back its sovereignty.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  In this Middle East crisis, as in so many before in this area and around the world, the innocent have suffered most for their leadersâ ambitions.
Hizbollah will claim that it is attempting to retake the Golan Heights, and Israel will claim that it is retaliating for these incursions by bombing Lebanon.
The difficulty is that everyone has some justification for taking action, but there is no acceptable justification for displacing tens of thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.
When we see the children killed in Qana, all justifications seem petty and shallow.
The Irish army was stationed in Lebanon for many years as a peacekeeping force, and there is a great affinity between the Irish and the Lebanese because of this.
We as a country have become familiar with Lebanon through family members or friends or neighbours who were stationed there and we feel the damage inflicted on their country all the more for this.
These people do not want this life; they want peace and safety for their families and a chance to live their lives.
There is no military solution to these problems, only peaceful solutions.
And whether that means imposing sanctions on all involved until they end their war or offering advantage to those who end it, we who have the capability must act.
Â Â  â Nobody can turn a blind eye to Israelâs latest war against Lebanon, which was bombed for 34 days, with the support of the USA and the passivity of the Council of the European Union, causing the acknowledged deaths of 1Â 084 civilians in Lebanon and 41 in Israel, and with thousands more injured.
Furthermore, around a quarter of the Lebanese population have been forced to leave their homes, essential infrastructures such as airports, ports and electricity power stations have been destroyed, and a large area of sea off the Lebanese coast has turned black.
According to the United Nations Development Programme, the bombing has destroyed 15Â 000 homes and 78 bridges and has damaged 630 kilometresâ worth of roads, amounting to a loss of at least USDÂ 15Â billion to Lebanon.
What is more, bombs have been directed at civilian targets, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.
Our condemnation of this war should also involve calling on Israel to pay the costs of rebuilding Lebanon, to end its occupation of the Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian territories, to end the blockades of Lebanon and Gaza to release Palestinian ministers and Members of Parliament immediately and to negotiate the exchange of prisoners held by Israel for detained Israeli soldiers.
There will be no lasting peace in the Middle East until Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese sovereignty is upheld.
Â Â  Broken by 34 days of war, Lebanon â which was, however, enjoying rapid development â is again the hostage and victim of a crisis with which it is unable to deal.
The European Union will help the Lebanese to rebuild their destroyed country and to get back on their feet and resume normal life and, in this connection, our humanitarian and emergency aid is vital.
Our role should, however, go beyond that of providing emergency aid. The European Union should act in its own right to bring about peace in the Middle East.
By participating in UNIFIL, several Member States are making a commitment on the ground under the banner of the UN, and they have made a just decision.
It is, however, united as Europeans that we should intervene to have Security Council resolutionÂ 1701 complied with, help to free prisoners, arrange for the blockade of Lebanon to be lifted, support the demarcation of borders and re-establish political dialogue.
In this crisis, the European Union has shown that its intervention could change the course of events and help resolve a conflict.
Reality confronts us with our political responsibilities. It is time for us to carry out the reforms needed by the European Union if it is to be the political actor of our neighboursâ hopes and our own expectations.
Â Â  I regret that the European Council did not call for an immediate ceasefire after the outbreak of hostilities by Israel on Lebanon.
Israelâs action was disproportionate.
Israel should now be asked to help rebuild Lebanon on the basis of âthe destroyer paysâ.
There should be a committee of inquiry on war crimes and the EU should revisit its economic and military cooperation with Israel.
We should also be aware and condemn the fact that the conflict in Lebanon was used as cover for even more intensive and brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.
The EU must work for a peaceful and just settlement to the disputes in the Middle East, particularly by pressing for a secure and independent Palestinian State.
Â Â  â At the root of the brutal attacks on Palestine and Lebanon is the USAâs plan for Middle East domination.
The USA actively pursues a policy of interference and shows scant regard for sovereignty and international law, and its ultimate goal is the geostrategic control of the region and control over the region's ample energy resources.
Within a context of contradictions, there has been broad agreement between the major powers of the EU and the USA, with the process of drawing up ResolutionÂ 1701 a prime example of this.
The EU has never condemned Israeli aggression, demanded a cease-fire or called for international law to be respected.
The reality of the situation must not be obfuscated by transforming the victim into the aggressor and vice versa.
It is Israel that is illegally occupying Arab territories, Israel that fails to honour the many UN resolutions and Israel that actively undermines the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State by means of a policy of State terrorism.
For there to be peace in the region, Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, dismantle the settlements and the wall and release political detainees; refugees must be able to return, and an independent, sovereign Palestinian State must be created with East Jerusalem as its capital.
All States in the region must be guaranteed their sovereignty and security, and the region must be demilitarised and rendered free of nuclear weapons.
Â Â  â Exactly five years after 11Â September 2001, the current conflict in Lebanon offers the international community a chance to review and correct the clearly inappropriate approach taken to solve the friction between the so-called Western and Islamic worlds.
For five years, in fact, ongoing conflicts (in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan) and the most serious diplomatic tensions (on terrorist attacks, the Iran issue, etc.) have all revolved around the same point, and therefore they cannot be eradicated just by means of more or less legitimate military missions created every time and always under different names.
The opportunity must now be grasped to form a genuinely multilateral force, with the participation and commitment of all the interested parties.
Its aim must be to solve the problem that lies at the root of all of these conflicts, which is the clash of ideologies between two different cultural blocks.
We need to seek and find a basis for dialogue as soon as possible, an opening that we, as âdemocraticâ countries, have a duty to pursue.
It must address the most pressing issues on which we diverge the most, from political and religious ideologies to economic systems.
I hope that the European Union will not miss the opportunity to promote such a dialogue but will sponsor it at an international level.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0325/2006).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
What plans does the Finnish Presidency have in relation to making progress on the revision of the Working Time Directive (COM(2002)0149 final(1)) and the Temporary Agency Workers Directive (amending Directive 2003/88/EC(2))?
Does the Council seek further progress in relation to these issues during its six-month period of office?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his interest in the progress on the revision of the Working Time Directive and the Temporary Agency Workers Directive.
Following the tremendous efforts of the Austrian Presidency preceding us, it is one of the main aims of the Finnish Presidency to reach agreement on the Working Time Directive.
The directive quickly needs to find a jointly agreed solution in order to comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the SIMAP and Jager cases.
The Presidency thus also intends to do all it can to ensure that the Council reaches a compromise settlement as soon as possible regarding the as yet unresolved âopt outâ issue.
The Temporary Agency Workers Directive is another complex and politically delicate issue.
As you know, differences in labour market structures and practices have led to differing views between Member States, and the problem has been to find an appropriate balance, where temporary agency employees would be given adequate levels of protection while at the same time the market in companies that provide a temporary workforce would be allowed to develop and grow.
Recently, the Member States have renewed their commitment to the Lisbon objectives, including increased levels of employment and the availability of better jobs, which are evident in their national reform programmes.
The Council believes that these objectives can be achieved in such a way that the different practices and traditions that obtain in national labour markets are respected.
The matter was last discussed by the Council in June 2003.
Since then, different Presidencies have had discussions at various levels to ascertain whether opinions had altered.
Up till now there have been two distinct views on the matter, so it has not been worth putting this issue on the agenda of future meetings of the Council.
The Finnish Presidency will examine the issue and is also expecting some input from the Commission, which said in its communication on the screening of pending legislative proposals that it would reserve the right to reconsider the proposal based on what emerges in other discussions on future proposals.
The Presidency understands very well that it is important for the European Parliament to make progress in this area.
We will be aware of the general opinion on this when the vote on the first reading of the Services Directive is voted on.
If the Commission delivers its vital input with regard to this matter during our Presidency, we will be ready to undertake some constructive work to find a solution that is acceptable to all the Member States.
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, for that very full answer and for your honesty, particularly on the question of temporary agency workers.
You will be aware of our frustration in this House, particularly with regard to the Working Time Directive, and are right to say that this has been discussed in previous Presidencies.
However, I would like to ask you a very frank question: what is different about the Finnish Presidency, and can you get the Members of the Council together and broker a deal in the interests of working people?
Can you give a commitment today that every effort will be made to take the Working Time Directive forward and to put the Temporary Agency Workers Directive on the agenda?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the commitment can be given that the Presidency will work very hard to find a solution for the Working Time Directive.
An incentive for this is, for example, that the way in which doctorsâ working hours are interpreted causes huge problems for the Member States, and for this reason too it is very important to find a solution for this directive.
It is still too early to say, however, whether we will be able to achieve the outcome that we would like to see.
Â Â  In his supplementary question Mr Moraes referred to the interests of working people.
Is the Council aware of some research concerning large European countries published in the in recent days, which shows that the majority of working people in all those countries, with the possible exception of Spain, want more flexibility in their working hours, not less?
Will the Council take this into account when trying to broker a deal?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I am not too sure if we are aware of this article in the Financial Times, but of course we are in many ways aware of the general trend, and as I have already said in my original answer and my last one, and in view of the developments that have taken place in the Member States, it is important to achieve a solution both in the matter of the Working Time Directive and that of temporary agency employees.
Â Â  â Do you believe that it is possible to solve this problem with the social partners in the context of a social dialogue â since they are, in fact, mainly responsible for the problem, also as far as working times are concerned?
Taking this into account, do you also believe that a solution is possible if this matter is delegated to the social partners â to the representatives of the employers and the employees?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, this is obviously something worthy of debate, and is an issue that can be raised at the tripartite discussions, but for the moment we are in fact actively seeking a solution that is acceptable among the governments of the Member States specifically.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should stress how important it is that the European Youth Pact should cover a wide area.
The needs of the young have to be taken into account in all relevant policy areas.
For example, in attempting to improve employment for young people, it may be important to enact various measures removing barriers to education and mobility.
The question by the honourable Member relates in particular to how the Finnish Presidency intends to support the commitments of the governments of the Member States to improve employment.
The Member States are responsible for planning and implementing their own employment policies, including those concerning young people.
Member States are also responsible for most of the other policies connected with this issue, such as education policy.
The Presidency may nevertheless have an important job to do in raising these issues, especially while the work of the Council of Ministers is being organised.
During the Finnish presidential term, the Council convening in December intends to deal with several questions directly connected with employment of young people.
The Council will be presented with a report by the Employment Committee which examines the Member Statesâ national reform programmes, including their employment policies.
The result of the survey by the Employment Committee just last year was that all the Member States tackled youth unemployment with reference to the Youth Pact and mentioned a raft of measures that had been introduced to build appropriate paths to employment for the young.
There had been very great progress made in linking this to another priority area, the investment in human capital.
This had been done, for example, by developing the transition from education to employment.
Finland expects that the Member Statesâ employment policies this year will also focus attention on resources for youth employment and ways of improving it.
Youth employment is also certainly high up on the agenda in the talks to be held by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 1Â December on demography and enhancing productivity through more and better jobs.
During the Finnish presidential term, the Council will discuss two issues that directly relate to improving employment for young people.
Firstly, improving opportunities for lifelong learning is something that affects everyone, including the young.
Secondly, the Finnish Presidency will try to propose concrete measures to improve accessibility to young peopleâs information services and provide quality information for all young people on important matters such as employment.
Special attention needs to be paid to deprived young people.
In March, the European Council asked Member States to include young people and youth organisations in the implementation process relating to the European Youth Pact.
The Finnish Presidency proposes to discuss initiation of an analytical dialogue at Council level with and between all youth sector actors, including young people and youth organisations.
To sum up, I will say that during the Finnish presidential term the matter of improving youth employment will be on the Councilâs agenda in many connections.
Finland urges all Member States to focus attention henceforth on the European Youth Pact and on the various ways of improving youth employment.
Â Â  â Mr President, thank you for such a complete reply and for the prospects which are opening up.
The third part of the European Youth Pact makes provision for measures to reconcile the family and professional lives of young people, so that they can create new families in Europe.
At a time when unemployment is being successfully combated, do you not believe that a vicious circle is being created?
That young people cannot easily create new families and that the demographic problem will get worse as a result?
Does the Finnish Presidency intend at the end of its term of office to present us with the positive results of its actions on reconciling family and professional life?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, one element of this Youth Pact, of course, is the attempt to improve young peopleâs education, their social participation and the transition to employment.
For that reason it is very important, and this autumn we also propose to support the decision allowing endorsement of such multi-professional skills, in order to facilitate young peopleâs transition from education to employment as well, this being one of the thresholds involved.
Obviously, reconciling work and family is still a separate category, but all these things are linked individually to the competitiveness strategy, that is to say the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the readmission and repatriation of illegal immigrants is one of the key factors in the Unionâs policy on immigration, especially within the framework of a comprehensive approach to the question of immigration.
I would refer the honourable Member to the concrete measures and initiatives which the Council cited in the general answer it gave this year to oral questions H-0440, H-0455, H-0473 and H-0478/06.
Regarding the period since the European Council in June, I would refer the honourable Member to the Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development, which Morocco organised, with the active involvement of Spain and France, in Rabat on 10 and 11Â July.
At the conference an action plan was adopted. Its third section specifically covers matters relating to the fight against illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
All the countries attending the conference stressed their commitment to the rapid implementation of the action plan.
On 17Â July, the Council adopted conclusions on immigration, stating once again that illegal immigration must be effectively prevented at Union level.
The conclusions also made mention of the significance of other immigration routes, especially in the Unionâs neighbouring regions to the east and south-east, and the preparations that are under way for the next Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development, which Libya has promised to host.
On 19Â July, the Commission published a communication on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third country nationals.
It also deals with matters relating to repatriation and readmission.
It was presented to the Council on 24Â July, and the Council will examine it at a later date.
At present, the Council is discussing a proposal for a directive on common norms and procedures to be applied in Member States when repatriating nationals of third countries who are illegally resident.
Talks on readmission continue in accordance with the guidelines and competences agreed by the Council.
The Commission and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union also reported back on the implementation of key measures included in the comprehensive approach at a meeting of the Council held on 24Â July.
Â Â  President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply, but I would like to point out to you that, despite all of these agreements, illegal immigration via the Canary Islands is still increasing.
Almost a thousand immigrants are currently reaching the Canary Islands every day.
Reception centres are overflowing, there is no way to return the immigrants to their countries of origin and the commitments made by 16 countries have not been fulfilled, except in the case of your country, since Finland, together with Italy and Portugal, has sent a naval unit.
At the end of the day, however, all of these measures, which look very good on paper, are not actually applied.
We are facing a real avalanche of immigrants, causing alarm amongst the civil population and concern for the whole of the European Union, since these immigrants have not come to get into the Canary Islands, but to get into the European Union, and that has consequences for its labour markets.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the case that the honourable Member raises is in every respect a very important one from the point of view of the European Union and the Council.
The European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has asked Member States for surveillance vessels, radar and border security experts to implement its own operation in the Canary Islands.
It is in the Councilâs interests to strengthen cooperation in this area by developing forms of combined operations, and the Finnish Presidency intends to improve Europeâs integrated system for controlling external borders.
Â Â  I just wondered how the Council expects the EU to meet the increasing challenge of illegal entry and the need for returns when in its draft budget for 2007, and compared to the Commissionâs bid, it has actually cut the appropriations for Frontex, the Borders Agency to which the Minister referred several times, and the European Return Fund.
I hope Parliament will be able to restore these cuts, but how can these be priorities when the Council is not following through on the financial commitments?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is obviously important that we also have adequate resources available to repatriate illegal migrants and to monitor that process, but I would also stress here the importance of the comprehensive approach to the problem of illegal immigration.
Then there is the matter too of cooperation with the other countries from which these illegal immigrants are arriving, and whether we can also improve conditions in the countries of departure, so that it would not be necessary to repatriate so many illegal migrants from the European Union.
Â Â  â I would be interested in hearing your opinion about the possibility of establishing a model of best practice in the field of return to countries of origin.
Do you think that the agency that the Commission has set up in Vienna might be able to produce a study of which methods have led to people choosing to return to their countries of origin?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union can also help in greater cooperation in the area of repatriation operations.
As with everything else, the exchange of experience and good practice are obviously important.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council would first like to thank the honourable Member for having drawn attention to the matter of respect for the fundamental human rights of the elderly.
Because the Union is based on the principle of respect for freedom, democracy, human and fundamental rights and that of the rule of law, the Council is naturally concerned about any possible loopholes in the legislation that would mean that the rights of older people are not being respected.
Respect for the fundamental human rights of all EU citizens and all people residing in the European Union is included in the Treaty on European Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in December 2000 by EU leaders confirms those rights which result from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States.
Abuse of the elderly in care is not only a human rights issue, but also a social, and in some cases, a criminal one.
This being the case, legislative action must be decided upon at national level, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
The Council also wishes to stress that it upholds the principle of non-discrimination.
It has already implemented measures to prevent discrimination and prejudice based on the six criteria of discrimination in ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and intends to continue implementing such measures in the future.
One of the criteria referred to is age.
We should nevertheless remember that it is the European Commissionâs task to monitor the implementation of, and compliance with, EU legislation in the Member States, and to submit proposals for justified legislative measures for approval by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has made a proposal for recommendation by the Council regarding the prevention of injuries and better safety.
One of the priorities is the prevention of violence between people.
The proposal will be on the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Councilâs agenda when it meets on 30Â November and 1Â December.
Â Â  I am very pleased that the Minister has said that there is further legislation coming forward on ArticleÂ 13 regarding age.
Can the Minister assure us that elder abuse will be given appropriate attention by Member States in the national action plans on health and long-term care?
Will the Minister urge the Council and the Commission to release any results on elder abuse across Member States, so that we can have an exchange of best practice?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we obviously have to remember that, concerning the need for a separate law on the protection of the elderly, it should be decided upon nationally in the Member States.
As I said in my answer, however, the issues on the safety of the elderly are to be discussed at the Council meeting on the subject at the end of November.
Â Â  In Austria, the families of old people who need care are increasingly resorting to employing illegal care workers, since the state care allowance is insufficient to pay for authorised professional workers.
In addition to proposing an increase in the care allowance, we are therefore also discussing a Social Year and appropriate retraining for the unemployed, as well as âcare semestersâ for prospective medical students.
Has the proportion of undeclared employment in the care sector also risen in other Member States, and which suggestions for solving this problem are being discussed, or rather, which proposals should be supported by the EU?

Â Â  . MrÂ President, naturally, the aim is to build and promote a common European policy in a direction that would allow us to create joint quality criteria for services, regardless of how they are produced and financed.
I cannot take a view on what the share of the grey workforce is, but this entire area of controversy is in my view linked to the question of the European social model, on which subject there was an excellent debate here yesterday in plenary.
Â Â  Yesterday we had a debate on the Daphne programme, especially as regards women and children.
We are hearing a lot about the abuse of the elderly and it might be possible to take this question on board, because it covers a similar area.
Two months ago there was a large meeting with eight European organisations of elderly people.
Could this question be taken on board within the framework of Daphne?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, the current Daphne Programme to which the honourable Member refers, and which is against violence, at present applies in particular to violence against women, but, as the honourable Member says, there are obviously also ways of exploring how the situation might be improved at European level with regard to elderly people too.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has not examined the incident referred to by the honourable Member, an incident it considers to be a bilateral issue between Italy and the United States of America.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, so is the answer that the Presidency does not intend to take any positive action at all on the matter that has been raised?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the answer is that the Council has not discussed or looked into this issue, but we have various kinds of mechanisms in progress, in the sense that the European Union and the United States have negotiated an agreement on mutual judicial assistance, which also has a certain connection with cases of this kind.
At present we need more internal procedures to have this agreement enter into force.
Â Â  I wonder if the Council would agree that this specific case highlights a more general problem that the United States expects Europe to cooperate with it on judicial matters, but when Europe asks the Untied States for cooperation, that country is much less willing to give it?
Will the Council have a debate among its Members to discuss how it might put more pressure on the United States to cooperate with the European Union on judicial matters?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the agreement on mutual judicial assistance that I just referred to will help speed up the assistance process, when it enters into force, in many kinds of legal problems, and could also be one key factor in faster and more effective cooperation between the Union and the United States.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
What is the Council Presidencyâs view of the current state of democracy and the rule of law in Russia, particularly as regards media freedom, the situation of non-governmental organisations, independence of the judiciary and the conditions under which, for example, former Yukos managers Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky are detained?
Does the Council Presidency consider that a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia is compatible with the European values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which Russia does not respect, as the following examples indicate: the violation of freedom of the press, restrictions on civil society through the NGO law, human rights violations in Chechnya and the conditions of detention of Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council believes that the strategic partnership with Russia must be based on the common values endorsed in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement, especially those to which Russia is committed as a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
The same values are also mentioned in the new treaty arrangements between the EU and Russia.
It is the Councilâs opinion that if there is to be better stability and welfare in Russia, effective democracy will need to be established at all levels in the Russian Federation, as will compliance with the rule of law, an independent judiciary, and unconditional respect for human rights, including freedom and independence of the media, and for a viable civil society.
Like the honourable Member, the Council is concerned about recent developments with regard to the rule of law, obvious curbs on freedom of the press, the concentration of power, and new legislation in Russia that restricts the work of NGOs.
The Council is likewise concerned about the human rights situation in Russia, and especially in Chechnya.
The Council is following developments closely and will raise these problems and issues regularly in political dialogue with Russia, in particular at the talks on human rights held twice a year.
The Council will also be monitoring the implementation of the recently amended law to prevent action by extremist movements, with particular reference to the now wider definition of extremist movement.
Â Â  We read that the German foreign minister wants to table in the Council a proposal to bring about common values by creating closer, long-term networks between the EU and Russia.
Is this not absurd, when Russia is not even prepared to change the poor conditions under which MrÂ Khodorkovsky is being held, conditions which contravene its own laws, or rather not even prepared to bring these conditions into line with its own laws, according to which prisoners must be kept close to their home town?
Have you spoken specifically and directly with Russia about the case of these two Yukos detainees?
Â Â  I would like to ask the same thing as the previous speaker, because this represents a case in which Russia is in glaring violation of its own laws.
However, obliged though I am for the answer to this question, it does, I think, raise yet another, namely whether, given the increasingly deteriorating condition of human rights in Russia, you believe that the concept of a strategic partnership with Russia is in itself possible or has a promising future.
Do we not rather have to develop new models of cooperation, models which, alongside economic and security policy considerations, actually guarantee respect for human rights?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, there is no longer any need to establish these common values as such, because they already exist.
They have been endorsed in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreements, and Russia is committed to them as a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
Obviously, however, there are challenges of all kinds associated with making these values conspicuous in practice and in the implementation of legislation.
These areas of dissatisfaction in the independence of Russian courts are indeed challenges for an evolving constitutional state, which we will be monitoring very carefully.
It is nevertheless very important that there should be a good deal of two-way communication within the framework of this strategic partnership.
For example, consultations on human rights are being held next in November.
Moreover, political dialogue, which is engaged in with Russia on a regular basis, provides an opportunity to discuss and raise these problems in the area of human rights.
Â Â  The economic situation in Russia is indeed very prosperous, but in the field of human rights there is a massive deterioration going on.
Does the Council really believe that the measures it has introduced - namely, dialogue within the context of a strategic partnership â are up to solving this problem?
Rather, does not this truly massive deterioration suggest to the Council that it should try a new strategy: reminding a neighbour of the European Union of commitments that it made in the context of its international relations?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the European Union and Russia are strongly linked in very many different ways: through peace and stability, economic cooperation and many other things.
That is why it is important that the strategic partnership should establish a good basis and framework for this mutual dependence which exists between us.
With the communication and political dialogue that accompanies this, and which exist at present, we can remind Russia of these human rights challenges, and that is what we do.
So, at this stage at least, the Council considers that the existing mechanisms provide a good basis for improving communication and the situation regarding human rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, while we are on the topic of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, I would like to draw the attention of the Council to the fact that this Parliament noted in its resolution this year that âthe present partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic, since it puts common economic interests in the first place, while failing to achieve any changes in human rights and the rule of lawâ.
Does the Council not think that the position of the European Parliament should be considered more closely, especially as the term of the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia is nearing an end?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the Council does listen to Parliamentâs opinion and listens very carefully.
These matters obviously need to be gone over now, while we are preparing for the renewal of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement and the establishment of a mandate to renew it.
I, however, believe that, while this collaboration is a very pragmatic one, it could in addition be much more dynamically strategic in nature than it is today, and that the European Union and Russia can also work in parallel, and as each otherâs partners, in global forums.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on 15Â June 2006 the European Parliament adopted its opinion on the first reading of the framework decision on the Seventh Framework Programme in accordance with the codecision procedure.
The Council, for its part, reached political consensus on the Seventh Framework Programme for research on 24Â July 2006, and this consensus is responsible for the outcome of the vote by the European Parliament.
I would refer at this point to document number 11978/06, which mentions the political consensus reached on the Seventh Framework Programme.
The point of consensus is to be able to prepare a second reading of the Seventh Framework Programme scheduled for the autumn. The result of this will presumably make it possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme before the end of the year.
The Community Framework Programme for research makes it possible to grant Community aid only to those research projects that are covered under the programmeâs scope of application and have passed through the selection process.
Research must of course comply with the legislation in those Member States in which it is intended to carry it out.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer, Madam President-in-Office, I appreciate it.
My question really refers to a situation in which a country does not have a legal framework in place.
Looking at what was voted through here in Parliament, we talked about research being subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State, but what if it turns out that a Member States does not have a legal framework in place?
In my own Member State, Ireland, for example, there is no law governing embryonic stem cell research.
Where, then, does that leave this decision by Parliament, and would the Council suggest that all Member States would need to put such a framework in place immediately?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the situation is of course problematic if such things have not been precisely regulated in national legislation, but according to the position adopted by the Council, the main conditions for funding are a precise ethical evaluation of each project proposal and consideration of the legislation in Member States.
It is therefore important to realise that the intention behind this single solution and decision is not to create rules on bioethics that apply to Europe generally but to make a clear decision on something less broad in scope, which is what sort of stem cell projects can obtain funding from this Community programme.
Â Â  I am very glad that you have made it clear that it is up to the legislation of the Member State concerned as to whether it can undertake research.
This is purely related to the funding of it.
I should be interested if the President-in-Office could tell us what opportunities she sees in the ability to undertake stem cell research and to fund it at a European level.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, national legislation is certainly something which will evolve in the years to come, because stem cell research is something new, although, as part of general European competitiveness and cooperation on research, it will be necessary to see whether added value can be achieved from cooperation at European level for research into this area too.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad; that is up to the Member States.
Nor has the Council discussed anything to do with the number of Europeans held in Guantanamo Bay.
Â Â  Mr President, it will come as no surprise that the reply to this question which I submitted as early as at the beginning of July, immediately following the summit between the European Union and the US in Vienna, is somewhat disappointing, because the question is very much linked to one of the topics that was discussed at that summit.
I would therefore be very interested to know whether any progress has been made and whether the Council has any intention of urging the United States to make haste in letting us know how many European citizens may be tried in the European Union and whether the Council is prepared to insist on a specific time schedule in this respect.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Guantanamo Bay is of course still a serious matter of concern, but the European Union warmly welcomes President Bushâs announcement that he wishes to close Guantanamo Bay, providing that a solution is arrived at on these practical matters.
Let us hope that progress is made in this area.
Â Â  On 29 June, the US Supreme Court ruled that military tribunals were illegal. At 7.45 p.m.
CET, President Bush is due to make an announcement that he is seeking to change the law to make it possible to try GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners â including EU citizens â by military tribunal.
If he makes that announcement â which I believe he will â can the Council protest in the strongest possible terms about this travesty of justice, as a matter of urgency?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the European Union has on many occasions stated that the treatment of prisoners captured on the battlefield must comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the customary rules of international humanitarian law, and must respect human rights.
Furthermore, it was the view of the informal meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Klosterneuburg in the spring that the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay should be closed as quickly as possible, so the Union has clearly expressed its opinion on the subject.
Â Â  I do not think I have heard such a feeble statement as âthe Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad, that is just up to the Member Statesâ.
We take international action to try to protect the citizens of other Member States, for instance in the Balkans, but we will not have any joint action to protect our own citizens.
Does the President-in-Office not agree that if the EU had said way back in 2002 that it was unacceptable for our citizens to be detained without charge or trial in GuantÃ¡namo, then they might all be free by now, or put on trial and convicted if that was what should happen to them?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is important for the Presidency, representing the Council as it does, to keep within the limits of its competence.
Any discussions which the Member States may have entered into bilaterally concerning the protection of their citizens are their own business.
It still needs to be said that the European Union has on several occasions raised the matter of Guantanamo Bay in discussions with the United States, and these talks will be continued.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been waiting for an outcome on a framework decision, as at least one Member State has had serious reservations about the text in the form that it was in in 2004.
As the Member State in question recently withdrew its general veto, the Finnish Presidency intends to work closely with the next country to hold the presidency, Germany, to have the issue discussed by the relevant working groups so that a framework decision can be taken as soon as possible.
There are no proposals on the Finnish Presidencyâs agenda relating to homophobic hate crime, which the honourable Member refers to in her question.
Â Â  I am very grateful for that positive news, which is most welcome.
But I am sorry that the Minister feels that there are no proposals on homophobic hate crime.
Does she not think that the EU really ought to be tackling the challenges of both racism and homophobia in their acute form of violence and hatred across Europe?
We are becoming years out of date with the challenges that we are meeting, not least because of the third-pillar problems of the veto in the Council to which she had referred.
Will you also make progress as regards the in bringing the third pillar â the intergovernmental part â into Community competence so that we can be more effective and democratic?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, I agree with the honourable Member that the European Union should try and intervene in key challenges, but, obviously, we have to do so step by step, and we cannot respond to all the challenges at the same time.
We intend to prepare a follow-up to the seminar for experts held in June in connection with the framework decision, and after that we can certainly consider this proposal for a framework decision for a working group to deal with.
As regards the , which the honourable Member mentioned in her additional question, as has been stated here before in Parliament, during its presidential term, Finland will actively look into ways of improving decision-making, leading to joint action in the area of legal matters and internal affairs.
Â Â  I am delighted that the one Member State's objection has been lifted to the adoption of the framework decision.
Will the Presidency urge the COREPER Working Group to expedite their work on this matter so that we can get this adopted as soon as possible?
Would the Council further agree that the adoption of such a framework decision would send a positive signal to our ethnic minorities in the European Union, particularly the Muslims, who feel under a lot of pressure in our continent at the moment?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the fact that we are making progress with the framework decision does not mean that it is now problem-free: differences in attitude to freedom of speech, the principle of legality and legal systems in the Member States in this regard still lead to unanswered questions.
On the basis of discussions held so far, we now propose to draft a more focused proposal for a framework decision, about which it nevertheless has to be said that it will hardly have had time to be drawn up before the next presidency is behind the wheel.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has frequently expressed its concern regarding the plight of women in Iran.
In its resolution last December on the human rights situation in Iran, one that also had the Unionâs support, the UN General Assembly expressed its grave concern over discrimination and other human rights violations, including the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice.
The Council deplores the worsening human rights situation in Iran.
When it met on 20Â March 2006, it condemned the harsh response to the peaceful demonstration organised on International Womenâs Day.
When it met on 15Â May, the Council expressed its concern about the increase in the number of executions, random arrests, the tightening of restrictions on access to information, and the increase in violations of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
The Council was referring in particular to the intimidation and harassment of advocates of human rights lawyers and minority groups.
When it met on 17Â July, the Council focused special attention on the continuing violations of freedom of expression and association, including the violent break-up of the peaceful demonstration by those demanding an end to laws that discriminate against women.
The Council is therefore aware of the incidents connected with recent demonstrations.
The EU still intends to raise questions of human rights, including the rights of women, both with Iran directly and in international forums.
The Union intends to state its concern both in the confidential and in the public context.
During the Finnish Presidency, the EU has already made three public statements on the human rights situation in Iran.
On account of the death of the student activist, Akbar Mohammad, at the Evin prison on 24Â August, the Presidency said that the EU was seriously concerned about the harsh treatment of dissidents, opposition leaders, student activists and all defenders of human rights in Iranian prisons.
In an official statement made at the end of July, the Presidency stated that the Union was gravely concerned about the worsening plight of the defenders of freedom of speech and human rights in Iran.
The statement made separate mention of the prominent human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, who was sentenced to five years in prison.
Mention was also made of Ali-Akbar Mousavi Khoeini, who was arrested during the demonstration in support of womenâs rights on 12Â June, the lawyer Farshid Jadollahi and Omid Beruzi, who were also sentenced to prison, and the arrests of defenders of labour laws in Tehran.
An official statement was made on 10Â July, in which the Finnish Presidency expressed the European Unionâs concern that the Iranian academic Ramin Jahanbeglu is still in detention.
The Council is still trying to organise a meeting between the EU and Iran within the framework of the human rights dialogue which began in 2002.
At the meeting both parties would have the opportunity to discuss all their worries concerning human rights.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki, for your detailed answer.
I am also very pleased that there has been such a strong and prompt reaction to these incidents, for I believe that there are many who, like myself, think that things are moving in the wrong direction.
This event is proof of the fact.
When one cannot even have a debate on these issues without being attacked in this way, fundamental work needs to be done.
I therefore wonder if there is any possibility of the Council taking the initiative of supporting the womenâs organisations that exist.
Parliament recently adopted a report on women in conflict management, at which time we talked about how we could take the next step in this area.
My follow-up question arises, then, from my belief that many people are concerned about the fact that things are moving in the wrong direction.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as I said, the Council is very worried that the situation seems in many areas to be deteriorating.
At least as a matter of policy, we have also supported and will continue to support womenâs organisations in a way that continues to highlight these human rights issues and the current problems, both in direct contacts and in international forums.
We have also asked the Iranian authorities several times for further clarification of the violations of human rights that have occurred in the country.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the ratification procedure for any treaty or convention, including one connected with the accession of new Member States, is up to each Member State itself to decide on.
For that reason, the Council cannot comment on the ratification procedure, nor would it be proper for it to do so.
Â Â  If the Council says it is inappropriate to comment in any way, it is probably difficult.
However, I wonder if I can tease something out from the Council, perhaps in a broader sense.
Does the Minister not feel that the mood perhaps changed in Europe after the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands, and that some people in certain countries have a fear of enlarging the European Union and perhaps see that calling a referendum would put a block on any future enlargement?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the mood has not changed, at least in the sense that, much to our satisfaction, the conclusions of the European Council in June, in which the matter of the Unionâs absorption capacity was also covered, clearly stated that absorption capacity would not be a new criterion imposed on applicant countries, but something separate which would also have to be taken into account within the European Union.
The Finnish Presidency proposes to have a thorough debate on all aspects of enlargement at the European Council in December, and after that we will certainly have a better idea than we do now of what the general mood is in the Member States with regard to this issue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the Counter-terrorism Coordinator drew up a comprehensive report in May 2006 on EU action to combat terrorism, which also covers the area of external relations.
The report is the response to a request by the European Council to have a six-monthly review of the implementation of the action plan on counter-terrorism adopted in June 2004 and last amended in February 2006.
The report contains a summary of the progress made since December 2005.
The European Unionâs policy to combat terrorism is defined in its counter-terrorism strategy adopted last December.
With the recent events in London, it became clear that there would be a need for closer cooperation than ever between terrorism and air security experts.
EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will be continuing these discussions at the informal meeting of the Council in Tampere.
Â Â  Thank you for your response, President-in-Office.
On foot of your final comment, particularly with regard to what we saw happening in London recently, there did not seem to be any coordination with other Member States in the European Union.
Perhaps they were not at the same level of threat as the UK on that occasion.
However, there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning the security measures in airports.
These depend on where you are travelling to and from.
Perhaps there is now a necessity for closer cooperation and coordination concerning these matters.
At Tampere will the transport ministers be included in these discussions on how to protect civil aviation from these threats?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we intend to step up that sort of cooperation and coordination as soon as we can.
During the Finnish presidential term, we will be updating the counter-terrorism strategy and the action plan that goes with it.
Furthermore, as I mentioned, it has become clear that there is still a need for closer cooperation between terrorism and air security experts.
The other example concerns liquid explosives.
The law enforcement authorities in the Member States will focus special attention on this question and others at their various meetings in the future.
Â Â  On the subject of combating international terrorism, can the Council tell us what steps it took to encourage the return of three IRA members convicted of international terrorism in Colombia, who later took refuge in a Member State of the EU â namely Ireland â and continue to enjoy sanctuary there?
Is it not clear that the EU undermines its credibility as regards taking a stand on international terrorism if it acquiesces in Member States harbouring wanted and convicted international terrorists?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is obviously important that the European Union is able always to act coherently, in order to preserve its credibility too, and above all to remain effective.
Perhaps we will be able to meet this challenge of coherence better if we engage in cooperation in the field of legal and internal affairs and in more effective decision-making.
Â Â  I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the current restrictions on travel and the security measures at British airports are causing enormous disruption to normal commercial and economic life.
I hope the Presidency will bear in mind, when coming to any concerted position at a European level, that it must make sure that economic and commercial life is able to continue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the restrictions on air transport and travel, which obviously apply especially to luggage, are not just disrupting commerce, but a large number of passengers too.
It is for this reason that it is so important for experts on terrorism and air security to work closely together to find the right level of security: sufficient to protect citizens from terrorist attacks, but at the same time making it possible to travel as normal in the future.
Â Â  As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 14, 15, 16 and 18 lapse.
Question No 17 has been withdrawn.
As the EU is preparing to operate with combat forces, various countries' combat units will in turn be sent on tours of duty.
Does any agreement exist between the Member States concerning the division of costs in the event of a combat unit being mobilised for military action during its tour of duty, and has it been agreed within the Council what is to be done if a country component of a duty unit does not wish to participate in an operation decided on within the EU?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, taking a decision to send troops for the EUâs crisis management operation is in all cases up to the Member States concerned.
Troops are assembled from volunteers in accordance with decisions taken nationally on the matter.
The joint operational costs of the European Unionâs military crisis management operations are financed with reference to Article 28(3) of the Treaty on European Union.
This paragraphÂ 3 states that any operational expenditure to which the implementation of these provisions gives rise is to be charged to the budget of the European Communities, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise.
Similarly, paragraphÂ 3 goes on to say that in cases where expenditure is not charged to the budget of the European Communities, it will be charged to the Member States in accordance with the gross national product scale, unless the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise.
This is what is stated in ArticleÂ 28 of the Treaty then, and the Member States sending troops are liable for other costs on a national basis.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, the second part of my question was completely ignored.
What should be done in a situation where a country on stand-by duty has no inclination whatsoever to take part in an operation like this?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as I said, the operation is initiated by a unanimous decision of the European Union, and a decision is taken in the Member States regarding any single operation.
Stand-by duty troops would at the same time be made up of a larger whole.
It remains to be seen what the reaction will be in a situation such as that proposed by the honourable Member.
Â Â  First of all, I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office for the work that has been carried out in organising the coordination between the Member States of the peacekeeping group that is going to Lebanon.
Following on from what you have said, President-in-Office, on the division of labour â some countries are obviously more able to provide logistical support than others â I would like to ask whether there is any coordination as regards who can best implement the various facets of the operations, or is that still a matter for bilateral relations between Member States?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, any stand-by duty troops would be assembled to form a team that works well together, and so there will have been coordination, as mentioned by the honourable Member, right from the preparation stage.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU-China relations (2005/2161 (INI)) (A6-0257/2006).
I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, pursuant to RuleÂ 168 of the Rules of Procedure, to refer the report by MrÂ Belder on EU-China relations back to committee.
Does anybody wish to move this request by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?
Â Â  Mr President, my group has requested that Mr Belderâs report on EU-China relations be referred back to committee because we consider it to be inadequate and unbalanced in addressing a number of issues covering relations between the EU and China.
The PSE Group also believes that there are a number of factual errors in the report which could only be corrected via a huge number of amendments.
However, we are of the opinion that such an important report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning a global power like China needs to be re-examined and re-discussed in detail.
This is because the report contains 125 recitals and paragraphs, of which only two paragraphs are on EU-China cooperation.
Just 13Â paragraphs concern foreign policy, while some of the EUâs basic principles of the last 30 years are ignored.
Global security and energy issues are barely mentioned, and therefore we need to bring balance into this report.
We urge the House to refer this report back to committee, where we will have sufficient time to address these extremely important issues as regards EU-China cooperation.
The Commission is currently doing a tremendous job in dealing with EU-China relations in more than 20 different policy fields, including foreign policy, global security issues and energy issues.
We need to act together to define a coherent position based on facts and clear information from the relevant departments in the Commission and the Council.
Parliamentâs position will be greatly strengthened and we will be more influential in achieving our common goals if we give ourselves some extra time to prepare and reflect on this report again.
Â Â  Now that the request has been moved, does anybody wish to speak in favour?
Please be patient, MrÂ Speroni.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, there is one speech in favour and one against.
At the moment I am asking whether anybody wishes to speak in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I feared that no one else would come out in favour. Allow me, then, to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are tackling this request in a totally constructive spirit.
I should like to say that, in the human rights area and whatever the outcome of the vote to follow, we shall of course support all the amendments in favour of human rights.
These are not, therefore, even at issue today.
What we should like to remedy â and this is what MrsÂ Dobolyi wanted to emphasise â are factual errors, shortcomings and deficiencies that are still extant.
We should also like to re-establish somewhat closer relations with the rapporteur. That is all.
Â Â  MrÂ Tajani has the floor in order to speak against the motion.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a comprehensive piece of work, which has been endorsed by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, must be voted on by this House.
I acknowledge and I also take on board some of the comments made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, given that we have tabled (as the PSE Group is well aware) an amendment designed to bridge a possible gap in the report, namely the reference to the one-China policy (ruling out Taiwanese independence).
By choosing to debate the report, we will thus be able to reach a comprehensive agreement, a sign that tensions are easing and that attention is also being paid to the requests made by the PSE Group.
In my opinion, the report is thorough, it can be examined and various parliamentary groups also want to examine it and to endorse it.
I believe that we are right to tackle the debate this evening and to proceed with the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the right time, only a few days before the EU-China Summit in Helsinki, this House is sending a clear and forceful signal to the Council and Commission with a view to establishing a strategic partnership that is truly worthy of the name.
The present report offers Brussels and Beijing benchmarks for all facets of mutual relations: credibility, stability and responsibility.
As a European rapporteur, I saw it as being of the utmost importance that I should listen very carefully to the Chinese discussions about the impressive peaceful development of the Peopleâs Republic over the past three decades.
These also spelled out the dark sides, with all the implications that these entail for the EU-China partnership.
It is only logical that these should also be included in the draft resolution.
A large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs endorses this specific approach on account of its indispensable and valuable contribution, for which I extend warm thanks to the Members concerned.
The public responses from the Chinese Embassy in Brussels during the various stages of my report oblige me to give you my position, in summary, in three key areas: the Ankang system, freedom of religion in the Peopleâs Republic and the issue of a peaceful annexation of Taiwan to China.
In a letter of 25 April, the Chinese Embassy flatly denied that political and social dissidents were subjected to compulsory psychiatric treatment. This abhorrent torture method is officially known as Ankang, which translates as: health through rest and peace.
As it happens, the 3 November 2005 issue of the German weekly included eyewitness testimonies of three victims of this Ankang system under the revealing title âElectric shocks against the freedom virusâ.
On 14 December 2005, the published an equally damning article on Ankang.
Disregarding these, the Chinese Embassy advised this House to delete Paragraph 24 of the draft resolution on Ankang as being completely unfounded, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, acting as if there were nothing wrong, tabled an amendment to that effect.
I asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs to withdraw the amendment on two occasions, but to no avail.
The Ankang system is completely at odds with the basic human rights that surely all of us warmly support, as I heard Mrs De Keyser say only a moment ago.
I am therefore completely perplexed by her attitude.
I would urge you to remove this blot on Parliamentâs escutcheon, and support the original text on Ankang which I am re-tabling as an amendment.
We already know enough about the many violations of the basic fundamental right of freedom of religion in China.
This applies just as much to critical internal discussions about this government action, even down to the offices of the state bureau of religious affairs.
I would have really enjoyed talking to those officials who were so approachable during my visit to this state institution last autumn.
According to the Chinese mission to the European Union in its 31 August news bulletin, the Chinese people enjoy extensive freedom of religion.
I would hereby invite it publicly to translate and publish the recent interview with Chinaâs âreligious big bossâ to clarify just what control the party exercises, for what is positive and negative in religions is to be assessed by the Chinese Communist Party and nobody else.
The overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people do not in any event wish to be subject to the same control.
This is what I heard from European diplomats on the ground and from many Taiwanese citizens themselves.
One of them explained why Beijingâs doctrine of peaceful reunification, certainly the ominous one-child policy, which is the PSE's key issue, does not have a chance in hell at the moment with those people: âIt is not so much about ideology or nationalism as it is about the difference in political system and in respecting all human rights as a way of life.
This does not stand a chance as long as China does not abandon its authoritarian regime, which is not likely to happen in the foreseeable futureâ.
I assume this adequately addresses the socialist amendments, which, moreover, curiously deviate from the officialise used in EU documents, raise the subject of two systems with regard to China and Taiwan.
That is rather revealing.
This report represents Parliamentâs commitment to a solid partnership between the European Union and China.
That is why it is honest in listing the obstacles in this political pursuit, certainly now that these are being recognised just as much on the Chinese side â I invite you to read the report which contains statements by the Chinese, not least by Chinese academics â but which, politically, are not at all sufficiently recognised as obstacles and eliminated as a result.
The message we must send to the Council and Commission on the eve of the summit with the Chinese leaders is that China needs to be helped to establish the rule of law and to be encouraged to carry out political modernisation as the necessary social parallel of its astonishing economic development.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by welcoming this debate.
I thank the honourable Members and the rapporteur in particular.
Let me make a few strategic remarks at the outset.
As you will be aware, the ninth EU-China Summit will take place in Helsinki in just three daysâ time.
It will be a very important opportunity to discuss current issues and concerns at the highest level.
However, I should also like to focus my contribution today â particularly in the light of the focus of your report â on how we can bring a more strategic approach to our relations.
I may then add a few words on some specific items.
Our relationship with China is one of the key issues facing the European Union today and one that is constantly on my mind.
This is true across the board, whether on environment and climate change, energy security, non-proliferation, global and regional security, economic and trade relations and specific issues such as illegal migration. There are also all the issues relating to the rule of law that you have mentioned.
We all know the key challenges.
Firstly, Chinaâs economic growth has been phenomenal, but, at the same time, it is still a developing country and more fragile than we might think.
To be sustainable, economic growth must be accompanied by social and political reform.
Secondly, China has a vital role to play in creating more stable international energy markets and dealing with environmental challenges.
Thirdly, accelerating globalisation â which is increasingly identified in the public mind with cheap production in China â is an issue and is leading to pressure for protectionism in developed markets, which both the European Union and China need to work to avoid.
Fourthly, China, like the European Union, wields global influence.
Will this support or hinder a rules-based multilateral world order?
Put simply, the question facing us is how we should respond to the rising superpower with whom we certainly share interests and common ground, but â and let us be realistic here â with whom we also disagree as regards some very fundamental values and beliefs.
Before suggesting some principles that should guide our strategic response to this challenge, I should reiterate that the basic premise for the EUâs policy towards China must be one of engagement and partnership.
There is no suggestion of containment or of hedging our options.
Engagement and partnership are the most effective basis for encouraging and supporting Chinaâs development in a way that meets the aims and interests of both the EU and China.
What principles should guide us?
In terms of Chinaâs internal reform and development we must be constructive and we must complement Chinese policy where possible.
However, the European Union must also send firm and very consistent messages on our areas of interest, such as the need for social and political reform to ensure Chinaâs sustainability, the importance of international non-proliferation regimes, and immediate market access and a level playing field for EU companies.
Secondly, internationally, the European Union has an interest in encouraging more active and responsible international engagement by China.
We need to enhance our understanding of Chinese foreign policy if we want to work together effectively.
We should emphasise the regional component, increasing our awareness and sensitivity as regards regional issues and encouraging regional integration and greater multilateralism in Asia.
Thirdly, the European Union needs greater focus and coherence internally.
Before exploring new areas, there should be a full internal review of our existing cooperation, leading to a clearer focus on priorities and, as necessary, moving on from areas which are ineffective or are no longer priorities.
Our aim should be a holistic approach, with the European Union as a whole speaking again with one voice on its China policy.
Fourthly, we should also work to ensure that our bilateral relations are strengthened by embracing all constituents of societies.
Parliament will also have a very important role to play in this context.
We need a long-term programme to promote mutual understanding and an effective strategic policy mechanism that is sufficiently informal and flexible.
Fifthly, throughout this process, the European Union should be aware of its strengths.
There is particular EU expertise on a range of issues relating to internal stability where China wants help, for instance on energy, the environment, regional integration and public health, and we should exploit this as fully as possible.
Sixthly, there are other areas in which we have less leverage.
I know the human rights situation in China is of particular concern to Parliament, as it is to the Commission.
The past year has not been seen as a year of significant progress on any of the areas in which we are particularly interested, such as the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the release of the 1989 prisoners, the abolition of reform through labour and greater protection for freedom of expression and of religion, where we continue to have real concerns.
But I can assure you, honourable Members, that these issues will remain a central part of our policy agenda and we will continue to engage and to push for progress.
The Commission is taking steps to turn these principles into reality.
We will, as the report requests, set out a new strategic vision for our policy towards China, which we will be in a position to present formally to the Council and Parliament in November.
I look forward to assessing the situation for myself during my trip to China early next month.
In addition to our continued support for Chinaâs internal reform process, I think we should also focus on four basic priorities: first, we need a greater balance in our bilateral relations, whether described as reciprocity, equality or mutual benefit.
That includes a more meaningful dialogue on human rights and related issues.
Questions such as progress on social and economic rights would be included there.
We are worried by the situation on civil and political rights in China, and in particular, as has been mentioned, as regards freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities.
We are, in that context, concerned that internet use is being more and more restricted and controlled.
As I heard the rapporteur say, we attach great importance to the issue of organ harvesting.
It is clear that the legislation on that issue recently adopted by the Chinese Government does not adequately address the issue of donor consent, particularly for those who have died in custody or who have been executed.
We have made our concerns known very clearly to the Chinese Government, both through our human rights dialogue and wider political channels, urging it, in quite strong terms, to take measures to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.
We need to make China a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder, it needs to be a positive and active contributor.
On trade issues, if EU markets are to remain open, we have to see to it that we need a genuine, bilateral and multilateral response from China implementing the letter and spirit of the WTO commitments.
We need to overhaul the management structures for our relationship to avoid fragmentation and to ensure our allocation of resources on China is appropriate.
There is much to be done in defining a realistic but also an ambitious strategic vision for moving EU-China relations forward.
We should not ignore the difficulties involved in achieving this â and I do not think we are ignoring them.
But let me reiterate that it is crucially important that we get the relations right.
Both sides want a genuine strategic partnership that merits its name.
It is our responsibility to translate this political desire into practice.
I think we have a good basis on which to move forward and, as we do so, I hope we can count on your support, because it is too important an issue for us not to succeed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what would happen if we were unable to speak today about the issue of China?
As was mentioned previously, the forthcoming summit between the EU and China takes places on 9Â September, with the Prime Minister, with Foreign Ministers, and with Ministers for Reform, Planning and Trade.
On 12Â September, also in Helsinki, there will be a high-level Chinese-European economic forum.
From the perspective of the world economy there are other important dates approaching, namely a new distribution of votes within the International Monetary Fund in favour of China and possibly to the disadvantage of Europe, and, at the end of September, new groupings and alliances will need to be formed in the Doha round in Australia.
As the draftsman of the opinion on this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on economic and monetary policy perspectives.
In 2005 the Chinese trade surplus was USDÂ 102Â billion; in 2006 it will be even greater, and by the end of 2006 China will have more than 1Â 000Â billionÂ USD in its currency reserves.
Demands are being made from many quarters for a rapid change in the exchange rate, and in the medium term China prepared to listen to these demands.
In view of the close interconnection of the financial markets, however, in my opinion I have argued in favour of a cautious change, because radical and swift measures could lead to incalculable consequences for the financial markets.
The International Monetary Fund must monitor such developments and take timely action where necessary.
At the IMFâs forthcoming annual meeting, China is due to receive more weight in the Fund, and in this development it is getting strong support from the United States.
One might ask the question why the USA, with its enormous budget deficit, is so keen to support China.
Perhaps this is because China, as was noted previously, with its exchange rate policy and its high currency reserves, now has a say in matters affecting the US dollar.
How is this perceived in the Member States of the European Union, and what do the officials in the ECOFIN council have to say about this?
The European Union is the most important trading partner for China, China is the second most important trading partner for the European Union.
We therefore owe respect to the Chinese for the way in which they have partly fulfilled, and are trying to fulfil, the commitments they made when they joined the WTO, although there is still considerable room for improvement on copyright protection and especially on credit issues.
The further opening of the banking and insurance markets, and the advances in the search for common standards, are visible steps forward.
At the end of September it is hoped that talks in Australia will breathe new life into the Doha round.
Here too the USA would be glad to see an increased Chinese influence.
Which people will the European Union choose to accompany this process, in order to give the Chinese the feeling that Europe can work in partnership with China in developing common strategies?
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we wholeheartedly support the Belder report.
It is a comprehensive report, it addresses all of the problems concerning relations between the European Union and China and it is based on the important debate that took place within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I thank MrÂ Brok, who sought to thoroughly analyse the topic.
We hope for a broad consensus on this report, and so we call on the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to vote in favour, not least because we are committed to supporting the one-China policy, which underpins efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question by means of constructive dialogue.
The report certainly does not portray China as an enemy of Europe; quite the contrary.
China is a very important partner in the sectors of trade and industry; many European companies find the kind of hospitality in China that allows them to discover new markets.
However, if relations between the European Union and Beijing are to improve, and if both sides are to benefit in future, then definite rules must be set and must be complied with, just as there are fundamental human values, which, when they are violated, can make cooperation between the European Union and China a less positive prospect.
We are concerned about the undemocratic decisions made by the Chinese Communist party, the violation of human rights and trade union rights, the freedom of minorities, freedom of information and the Tibet question.
The parliamentary group, which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments, has highlighted the issue of religious freedom: we are concerned about the Communist partyâs appointing of bishops; it is like the Vatican appointing generals in the Chinese army; it is incomprehensible, and the freedom of so many Chinese citizens is being violated.
There is also the matter of the rules concerning economic and trade relations; we call on the Council and the Commission to commit themselves to protecting businesses in Europe and in other countries bordering Europe, particularly in the textile and footwear sectors.
MrÂ Mandelson has sent out certain signals, but we must continue undaunted with regard to the protection of human rights, as must the Finnish Presidency, which I regret is not present in this House.
For all of these reasons, we shall vote in favour of the Belder report and shall endorse certain amendments that also relate to environmental issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is much we can agree with in MrÂ Belderâs report.
We agree that China needs to shoulder a growing international responsibility because of its status as a permanent member of the Security Council and now as the worldâs fourth largest economy.
We agree with the importance of Chinaâs role in Africa and the Middle East.
We need to have a dialogue with China over the situation in North Korea, where it has been playing an important role chairing the six-party talks; over Iran, where China can play a role in trying to find a solution to the nuclear crisis; and over Darfur, where China, because of its oil interests, has to date been resisting the deployment of UN forces.
We look forward to the establishment of an EU-China strategic partnership and we certainly support the need for the abolition of the death penalty â something we urge in all countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States.
We need to see continued improvement in human rights.
However, unfortunately, in total, the report suffers from both a lack of balance and the sins of omission.
I thought they were sins of omission, but in his opening speech MrÂ Belder has made it clear that the reason that the one-China policy is not in the report is not because he has forgotten, but he is actually in favour of changing it.
I hope that those in the Christian Democrat Group who still support it will not go along with that, but will support our amendment.
We have two lines on the plight of 150 million migrant workers â more than 10% of Chinaâs population, one sentence on free trade unions and yet there are five paragraphs on a religious minority that is a hundred times smaller.
The trouble is that Mr Belder cannot see the wood for the trees.
Yes, of course, we need to stand up for all the oppressed groups, but where is the rapporteurâs sense of proportion?
Equally, it is right to believe some of the bad things we are told about China, but it is not right to believe of them, without the evidence necessary.
There are areas in which we tread very much on the Committee on International Tradeâs territory, but the report takes a much more protectionist line than that committeeâs recent report.
The question of market economy status is dismissed very easily, yet 40 countries in the world have already granted market economy status to China â most recently the Republic of Korea in November 2005.
I respect the European Parliamentâs view on the embargo, but here we are insisting that all our partnership countries follow an embargo that puts China in the same situation as Burma and Zimbabwe â which I consider personally to be rather worse in terms of their oppression and discrimination â while, at the same time, asking the Chinese to assist us in putting pressure on those two countries that we say are exactly the same as China.
In paragraph 4, we note that China will have at its disposal EUR 1 billion in farm reserves by the end of 2006.
The accuracy of the report is fine; it is only one thousand times wrong: it is actually a trillion and not a billion and yet nobody has noticed; yet this is a wonderfully accurate report that everybody is endorsing.
Nowhere do we complain that China holds too few euros â rather than dollars â or say that China should continue to work with the European Union on the six-party talks.
We do not mention the fact that Chinaâs concern about the Yasukuni Shrine is reflected in the recently revealed fact that the Japanese Emperor refused to visit it once class-A war criminals were included there.
Finally, as the Commissioner said, we want engagement and partnership, not confrontation and containment.
I am afraid the wrong message comes from this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I welcome this report on behalf of my group.
It is important for the European Parliament to come up with a statement prior to the important summit at the weekend.
The EUâs relations with China have, of course, become ever more extensive, and not only in terms of trade policy.
It is therefore good that we should tackle these relations in a more strategic way.
China is a growing economy and an ever more important trading partner.
We liberal democrats see trade as an important way in which countries can become closer to each other and have more contacts and forms of exchange.
Trade also leads in the long term to increased openness, better regulations, less corruption and in time, we believe, to democracy.
Trade has also led to economic growth, enabling millions of Chinese to raise themselves out of poverty and meaning that we can, of course, also discuss how the fruits of that growth are to be distributed.
China has growing ambitions on the international stage.
That is good, but in that case it must also accept increased international responsibility and be a responsible partner.
We believe that China can play an important role in relations with North Korea, but we cannot accept China making use of its UN veto to prevent global intervention designed to put an end to the genocide in Darfur or aimed at putting pressure on Iran to open up its nuclear power programme to international scrutiny.
Given its size, history and population, China has huge potential.
At the same time, we have to recognise that China is also a dictatorship.
We cannot accept thousands of people being put in prison for having different political views or for being of a different religion or from a different ethnic group.
We cannot accept Chinaâs censorship of the Internet, and we view with great concern the reports now coming from right around the world â and most recently from a respected institute in Canada â on trade in organs from, for example, Falun Gong sympathisers.
We are also concerned about the threats directed against the Taiwanese democracy.
We must never miss an opportunity to point out to Chinese politicians and companies that we condemn these breaches of human rights.
At the same time, we must also be constructive in trying to help China travel the long road towards democracy.
In the same way, all of us as politicians, entrepreneurs and consumers must demand that Chinese companies permit trade unions and allow their employees to enjoy security and fundamental rights.
China is also an environmental time bomb, the environment being a huge potential area for cooperation between China and ourselves in the EU.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner talked of the need for a strategic partnership involving many practical elements.
We welcome this and hope that the European Parliament can play a critical but also constructive role in this work.
Â Â  Mr President, I too am pleased that we are holding this debate at last.
I believe that it would have been a mistake to refer this report back to committee and it would have sent out the wrong message, particularly given the importance attached to the sovereignty of this House.
China is clearly making great progress and modernisation is currently moving ahead, but we must bear in mind that the accelerated and rapid pace of that modernisation poses risks from the social and environmental points of view.
In this regard, the European Union must contribute to the development of the positive aspects of this modernisation and not encourage the negative aspects or the risks attached to it.
We must therefore make our position very clear at a time when we are discussing European Union-China relations.
Friends must speak clearly to each other; it is with friends that we must maintain good relations and also speak very honestly.
In this case, I believe that we must do so while making the values that we consider to be fundamental to a good, fruitful relationship very clear.
Some of them have already been mentioned, but I would like to raise them again, in order to make it crystal clear that we are in favour of abolishing the death penalty and that we believe that to be a universal value, that we are in favour of democratisation and freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and of freedom to exercise oneâs culture and religion, that we condemn systematic torture and the existence of re-education camps for prisoners and that we consider respect for the rights of people such as those of Tibet to be fundamental.
We therefore call upon the Council to implement the applicable policy and to agree to sending a special envoy.
