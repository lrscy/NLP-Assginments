Our basic premise is the conviction that the embryo that is created is human life from conception onwards and that any intervention on the embryo means its death.
There are alternatives for research which are ethically acceptable as well as scientifically valid, such as research on stem cells, which are also present in the individual after birth.
Therefore, on this occasion, we call for investment in research and experimentation on stem cells taken from individuals after birth.
Mr President, today the House has shown itself unworthy of an excellent report by a committee on human genetics.
A majority of this House, duped by an unholy alliance of socialists and liberals, has distorted a report, so that nearly all of us ended up having to vote against it in order to leave that outstanding product of the Committee on Human Genetics, the original text of the Fiori Report, standing as a beacon of Europe's protection of life.
I am proud that this Committee, in one year, drafted this magnificent report, which will stand as the product of a committee of real experts.
This House has yet to learn how to handle this report in a manner worthy of it.
I appeal to the citizens of the European Union and to the organisations in it defending human life, which are at last becoming as active as the animal protection organisations, to take a close look at how Members here voted and to enter into dialogue with us, so that this House may keep to the course it has taken since the Gergo report at the beginning of the 1980s, that is, to stand up for life - human life for human beings.
From conception to natural death, human beings deserve all the protection we can give, and without equivocation.
Mr President, on the Fiori report, Parliament has relinquished its responsibilities as a legislative assembly, because it has taken a wide majority decision to take on the responsibilities of an authority on ethics and morals.
This is the reason, the root cause of the failure of this Committee on Genetics.
Fortunately, we still have the Caudron report, which, at least, tells us that the European Union will be able to fund projects on stem cells from supernumerary embryos.
At least we shall have the assurance that we will not be forced by the European Union or European Union instructions to throw away cells that might give life and health to millions of people.
As for the rest, it is now a matter for national laws.
We hope that some people will be wiser than others, less willing to bow to the religious bureaucracies that try to impose their own morals and ethics on all citizens, not just the people who follow those religious practices.
Mr President, in my view, it is extremely unfortunate and a missed opportunity for this Parliament that this report has not been adopted.
What can this be attributed to?
To the fact that everything that was connected to the report was badly managed: in the first two phases, we had a rather liberal report, in fact, too liberal in my view, and we have ended up with a very restrictive final vote.
Why is it unfortunate not to have a report?
It is unfortunate because at the moment, we are allowing industry to carry on unmonitored: we have not concluded any agreements on the absolutely crucial change in patent law which restricts people in their chances of being cured.
Neither have we made any agreements on genetic tests. We have not reached agreement on whether, in European countries, something similar can be demanded when taking out insurance cover.
It is a missed opportunity, we have managed it badly and I think that we have done ourselves, but certainly also the citizens of Europe, a disservice by what has happened now after eleven months.
With regard to Mr Fiori' s report and the resolution resulting from the report, but also very largely from the work of the temporary committee on the problems of human genetics, I was compelled to vote against it because of the significant contradictions included or left in the resolution, but I must say that this vote does not do justice to the work of the committee which has been extremely well chaired by Mr Goebbels.
I agree with the feeling which has just been expressed very rightly by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and I must point out that the broadly negative vote of Parliament, even though it might ease everybody' s consciences, nevertheless leaves intact the considerable problems which have led to the creation of the committee and which have, furthermore, only increased since it was created, as the events of last weekend have shown once again.
. (FR) The Fiori report on the ethical, legal, economic and social aspects of human genetics is a good report, on which Mrs Montfort had also done a lot of work.
Unfortunately, it has been distorted by amendments mainly presented by the Left, aimed at removing all the moral obstacles to genetic research.
We are therefore opposed to this distorted text, and in the end, following a last minute u-turn, the European Parliament rejected it, to our great satisfaction.
It is interesting to ask ourselves what conclusions should be drawn from this, particularly with regard to the vote at our last part-session on Article 3 of the research framework programme 2002-2006, presented by means of the Caudron report, which was to decide the conditions under which the European Union would subsidise genetic research.
A rather obscure and unsatisfactory amendment was then voted on, in anticipation of the Fiori report, which seemed to authorise the funding of research into therapeutic cloning and research into the stem cells of embryos.
That same amendment, which was introduced today into the Fiori report in order to distort it, has in the end also been broadly rejected by this House.
Given that the same text was adopted at the last part-session and then rejected during this one, the least we can say is that the situation is unclear.
We believe that we should preserve the European Parliament' s traditional position of rejecting therapeutic cloning and research into embryos in the name of respecting human dignity.
. (FR) We have voted against this report which, even amended, is unacceptable.
The fact that it contains huge scientific errors is not the most serious thing.
It is above all steeped, from beginning to end, in an obscurantist attitude to science and its applications.
Some research may lead to excesses? No doubt.
Especially in a society where the application will be carried out by private companies whose objective is profit.
But why prohibit certain of them which are connected to genetic research, why refuse public funding for researchers whose work, the future will tell, may be decisive in terms of improving the lives of countless human beings?
We voted for some of the good intentions of the text where they were not restricted to being purely platonic, particularly in relation to the protection of workers, the disabled and people suffering rare diseases.
But we refute all its reasoning, the basis of which is clerical, reactionary and misogynist.
We reject anything that goes against the right of women to control their own bodies and to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.
With regard to patents, not only are we completely against any idea of patenting living beings, but we are against the equally horrendous patents on medical products which cannot be used for the care of millions of human beings too poor to pay.
More generally, we are against all forms of patent on inventions which are not aimed at protecting the inventor but at safeguarding monopoly profits for the capitalist groups which market them.
It is not research which must be restrained, but, rather, we must put an end to this economy based on profit.
Since we trust in the ability of humanity to, one day, govern its economy and social life, freeing itself from the hindrances of private property, we confirm our trust in the work of the researchers and in what science can contribute to a society liberated from exploitation, the rule of capital and obscurantism.
. (FR) The discussion of the Fiori report and its resolution has been characterised by a brutal confrontation between promoters of the exploitation of life and embryos and defenders of their humanity and therefore their integrity.
This stormy debate has largely taken place on the basis of a confusion of values, confirming the historical fragility of the foundations of our humanist and Christian civilisation when faced with the combined attacks of scientism and materialism.
This confusion of values in Europe and within the Member States has prevented any possibility of defining the status of the embryo, and I regret this.
Although science shows that the use of adult stem cells renders the use of embryonic cells pointless, scientific thinking is determined to violate the 'sanctity of life' by promoting the exploitation of the human embryo.
This demonstrates that the defenders of the humanity of life at all its stages of development are confronted with a real ideology which is not only dehumanising, but which is cloaked in a false humanism and realism.
. (FR) I have voted in favour of this report.
I very much regret the fact that the Fiori report on the 'ethical, legal, economic and social implications of human genetics' has been rejected in plenary session.
The problems relating to human genetics should not be dealt with in emotional and simplistic terms.
Nevertheless, that seems to be the approach taken by the majority of the MEPs who have voted against this balanced text.
This vote represents an unprecedented halt for European research.
This will therefore put the Union considerably behind its international partners, and leave many investigations in the air.
With regard to the great fundamental principles and universal values which we defend, the European Parliament had the opportunity to totally exclude the risks of eugenics, as well as reproductive cloning, while implementing solid legal safeguards to provide a framework for what is possible and acceptable in genetic research.
The European Parliament, by not taking a position on this very topical subject, has shown a lack of courage.
This is all the more deplorable when we consider that numerous patients are awaiting the development of new therapies which may offer possibilities to many of them.
I voted in favour of the 1998 directive on legal protection for biotechnological inventions, which I considered to be in order, although, like most of the texts we vote on, it certainly leaves room for improvement.
It is, however, necessary, as we cannot allow there to be a legal vacuum on this subject in the European Union if we want to stay competitive in international research, which we certainly will not if we do not give legal protection to inventions in the field of biotechnology and freedom to research.
Such freedom, however, must not lead to the erosion of ethical boundaries.
The hope of sufferers that there will be treatment for their as yet incurable diseases leads me to believe that even the Church must be open-minded about putting in place, and making use of, new methods of treating chronically sick people.
Research using existing stem cells, and the promotion of it (also favoured by President Bush of the USA) should be permitted in basic research throughout Europe.
Research on adult and foetal stem cells should, however, be given priority.
The use of stem cells for therapeutic purposes is marching on as a potentially revolutionary new method for treating diseases and injuries.
The therapeutic objective is to develop differentiated cells or permanent tissues for transplantation into patients with diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, heart attacks etc., conditions for which there are, at present, no effective therapies or treatments.
It is, in any case, clear to me that this should involve only stem cell lines which have already been produced and which can be suspended in a culture in which they can proliferate.
For me, erosion of the ethical boundary begins with the deliberate breeding of embryos for research purposes.
That must not be permitted.
.
The Fiori report, even in its amended form, is a muddled and unhelpful contribution to the public discussion on stem cell research and other issues arising from developments in medical research.
Decisions of this nature are largely a matter for Member States and the European Parliament must respect subsidiarity.
The UK, for example, has quite rightly conducted its own debate on stem cell research and come to the conclusion that a tightly regulated research programme can eventually bring benefits to sufferers of highly disabling and painful conditions.
The UK has successfully transposed the patenting directive, as all Member States should have done, and the distinction between inventions and discoveries is quite clearly understood.
No review or attempt to change the directive is appropriate.
For these reasons Members of the EPLP have voted against the Fiori report.
. (FR) The Fiori report has represented an historic attempt by the European Union to impose the adoption of a common position with regard to something which forms the very basis of civilisations: the definition of the human being and its dignity.
We have witnessed a ferocious battle between the defenders of the integral and nonnegotiable dignity of the human being, of which I am one, and the promoters of an ideology which is a combination of scientism with materialism.
By rejecting the report by 400 votes to 37, Parliament has clearly and irrefutably demonstrated the limits of European parliamentarianism.
Together, the Members have refused any compromise solution, which is a victory for philosophy over political logic, and I am delighted about that.
It proves that the European Parliament, which is supposed to be the 'democratic organ' of the EU, has neither the institutional legitimacy nor the political capacity to impose a common position on the basis of the 'nature of the human being' , and its dignity.
By means of this vote, the European Parliament has proved that only the States can create the appropriate framework for dealing with these fundamental issues, respecting the cultural and spiritual traditions on which our civilisation is based.
. (FR) I have voted against the resolution of this report as amended, as have my colleagues in the French Socialist Delegation and the Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party, because I have noted that the European Parliament has not managed to achieve a consensus and a reasonable position on the fundamental ethical and legal issues relating to human genetics, which I deplore.
I therefore believe that the text obtained is inconsistent and contradictory on certain points, such as the funding of research into embryonic stem cells or into the use of surplus embryos.
The negative vote demonstrates the inability of the rapporteur and the temporary committee to bring this difficult debate to a conclusion.
The lack of a European Parliament opinion is all the more harmful given that we are at a point where certain Member States are going to have to transpose the directive on the patentability of living matter into their national legislation, thereby modifying their legislation in this field.
I wanted to offer my support for research freedom, particularly for genetic research, into surplus embryonic stem cells, and although this type of research involves uncertainties and risks, it is very important that there be Community regulation and funding so that private research does not have a monopoly in this field.
- (SV) Mr Fiori' s report adopts positions on many difficult issues regarding human genetics, including the ethical principles which ought to apply in this area.
As a Christian Democrat, I believe that we need ethical parameters in society, with the most fundamental aspect being respect for human dignity.
However commendable the aim, it does not justify our using people as a means to an end.
Cloning is, therefore, unjustified in any form, whether the chosen adjective is 'therapeutic' or 'reproductive' .
It is impossible to make such a distinction, as therapeutic cloning is nothing other than the initial stages of reproductive cloning, with, from the beginning, a stated intention to destroy the embryo which develops from the substitution of the cell nucleus.
The embryo already contains everything needed for a human being.
Up to birth and beyond, we do not develop into people, but as people.
Research using embryonic stem cells is ethically highly controversial and is, moreover, banned in four Member States (Germany, Austria, Ireland and Portugal), but this is not the case where the use of adult stem cells is concerned.
It is, therefore, my view that research using adult stem cells should be prioritised, while ethically highly controversial embryonic stem cell research should not be funded through the Framework Programme.
Under the principle of subsidiarity, this does not prevent individual national governments from choosing to fund such research.
The fact that the funds available within the Framework Programme are limited means that we must set priorities.
As such, research which is so ethically controversial and which clearly breaches the law in many Member States should not be supported.
I have therefore chosen to support the report as it was presented prior to the reading in plenary, in line with my vote in favour of Mr Caudron' s report on the sixth framework programme.
. (FR) This is one of the fundamental issues to which the very notion of compromise has no relevance and which presents us with radical choices.
This is the case with human genetics, where the unassailable dignity of the human being is at stake.
The dividing lines running through this Parliament were clearly illustrated by the vote on the Fiori report.
There is a liberal-libertarian line which exploits the flag for research freedom and claims that there is a so-called need not to be left behind by the United States and calls for European Union funding of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus cells, thereby opening the floodgates to the reification and the marketing of emerging human life, at an extreme stage of its embryonic fragility, to the development of actual embryo farms, where human embryos would be created for the sole purpose of killing them and cultivating their cells.
The so-called compromise approach seems particularly hypocritical and is simply an indirect means of authorising therapeutic cloning.
It consists of accepting the funding of research into cell lines obtained from embryonic stem cells, which means the destruction of embryos and affectively authorises therapeutic cloning, since cell lines do not have the same genetic heritage as the receiver suffering from an incurable disease.
The third position, which we support, and which has been defended competently and with conviction by Elizabeth Montfort, consists of rejecting any exceptions when it comes to the dignity of the human being, at whatever stage of development.
We demand that the prohibition of cloning be maintained and we reject the false distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning, since they are exactly the same process.
We demand the prohibition of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus embryos and we demand concerted support for research into adult stem cells, the therapeutic applications of which are particularly promising.
. (FR) The Fiori report represented an attempt by certain Members to reintroduce into European thinking an intended hierarchy for the dignity of human beings.
Coming from the European cultural and spiritual tradition, I do not believe that any hierarchy is acceptable when it comes to human dignity.
Whether we are talking about ill people, disabled people, people at the end or at the beginning of their lives, every human being deserves the same degree of dignity.
Furthermore, I am categorically opposed to any attempt to subjugate any section of humanity to the supposed benefit of another.
It is one of the great characteristics of man that he strives for his own overall good, and scientific research contributes to this while also having to adapt to it.
Philosophy and history teach us that any compromise of the respect for the human being leads inescapably to its negation.
Finally, it is through political courage and a clear vision of what gives the human being its dignity and greatness, that it remains possible to maintain a civilisation and a form of progress which are truly human.
That concludes the statements on the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament suspended.
(The sitting was closed at 2.13 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 29 November 2001.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of Thursday 29 November have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, this concerns the Fiori report which we voted on in Brussels last time.
I have to say that this was Parliament at its worst.
We had a temporary committee which met for ten months to discuss an issue that could have been discussed within the existing committees.
Firstly, it was an abuse of the temporary committee status - Parliament is very fortunate to have this privilege, and I do not think that we should abuse it, especially in the way it was abused with that vote and the final outcome.
As chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would dearly love to know the cost of that temporary committee for an outcome that had nothing at the end of it.
I would hope that, if we have temporary committees in future, they will deal with subjects outside the normal committee structure.
If we have enquiries in the future, let us try to carry them out within the budget and not give rise to excess expenditure.
Mr Wynn, I can assure you that you will receive an answer very soon.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Order of business
Madam President, the Commissioner probably gave us more than we already formally have in the extremely important negotiations which were preceded by many debates here in this Parliament, and were followed by a resolution which we presented to the Commission, to which the Commissioner made reference during the negotiations at every opportunity and stated: "in the final analysis, I need the majority and support of the European Parliament" .
And we would now decide to hold a debate without a final say from us?
I cannot really imagine this.
I would also like to call on the fellow MEPs from the other parties, irrespective of the content of their opinions, to conclude this debate with a political verdict.
We owe it to the Commission and to the dignity of this House.
Since the negotiations are of such significance, we must really employ our full powers and reach a verdict.
Madam President, I do not think that anyone here will deny that the Doha Summit was an important political event, both for the European Union and for the whole world.
I believe that it is equally important to carefully analyse the outcome of the summit and the decisions that were taken there.
Rather than running the risk of adopting a superficial position, Parliament can simply publish a few brief considerations.
However, I think that it is too early to carry out a serious political assessment, which is in fact what is expected of a parliament.
I believe that we must wait and not vote for a resolution this week.
I shall now put the request to the vote.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Still with regard to Tuesday, I have received a request from Mr Westendorp to postpone the vote on telecommunications until Wednesday.
Madam President, on Wednesday's draft agenda there is a joint debate on the Middle East at 3 p.m.
It might be helpful for colleagues if in advance of that debate, in which there will be a great deal of interest, Parliament's services would consider reprinting copies of the joint address to this House by the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
The message delivered on that occasion might shed some light in our current darkness.
Mr Beazley, I believe you are referring to the speeches that Mr Avraham Burg and Mr Abu Ala gave to Parliament.
These speeches are available to all Members who wish to refer to them.
I do not think we need to resend them.
They can be consulted without difficulty.
Nevertheless, I think that your suggestion is a very interesting one.
Regarding Thursday
With regard to 'Human rights' , item 3 under the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have asked for the third heading 'Sulawesi' to be replaced by a new heading 'Immigration tragedy in Ireland' .
Madam President, on the list of urgent topics relating to human rights, there is one on Irian Jaya and another on Sulawesi.
Both islands are part of one country, Indonesia.
I propose that they be combined under one title, 'Indonesia' , and that the situation of both islands be dealt with under that title, and we would thereby have time to deal with the tragic situation in Ireland.
Of course, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I think that this is a very good suggestion.
The suggestion is to add a new heading, instead of removing one, and to deal with the two existing headings together.
We shall therefore take the vote on the request to add a new heading 'Immigration tragedy in Ireland' .
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
I wish to make a point of order to draw the attention of this House to the grave discourtesy and disrespect shown to it by a member of the Belgian presidency.
I refer to Mrs Magda Aelvoet, Minister for Consumer Protection, Public Health and the Environment in the Federal Parliament of Belgium.
I wrote to Mrs Aelvoet on 13 June 2001 - and that letter was signed by 20 Members of this House - requesting a meeting with her to raise the question of the fraudulent importation of cat and dog fur products into the EU from Asia and China.
We received no reply to that letter.
I wrote again on 12 July 2001 and received no reply.
Mrs Alvoet came here to Strasbourg on 12 September 2001 to address an intergroup meeting on animal welfare.
I raised this issue with her: she said that she had written to me and had extended an invitation to the MEPs who had signed the letter with me to come and meet her in Brussels.
When I returned to Brussels, there was no sign of this letter.
I wrote for a third time to Mrs Aelvoet requesting the letter and have received no reply.
Three times I have followed up with telephone calls and again received no reply.
I find this a grave discourtesy to the Members of this House who signed that letter and I also find it astonishing that a minister in the EU presidency should come before a packed meeting of an intergroup and say that she has written to me when she knew full well that this was a lie and no letter had been sent.
I hope, therefore, Madam President that you will confirm, on behalf of this House, that this sort of behaviour by a minister in the presidency is gravely discourteous and not going to be tolerated in future.
Mr Stevenson, we shall certainly take note of your complaint.
Madam President, like Mr Stevenson I want to raise a point of order with regard to a matter of discourtesy to this House.
Some months ago I wrote to the President of the Commission asking a formal written question, as I am entitled to do as a Member.
I received a reply which said: 'the research needed in order to provide a detailed response would be out of all proportion to the result desired and exceed the requirements of a response to a written question.'
That is a gross discourtesy to any Member asking a question of a body, which is supposed to be, there to serve and to be transparent in response to requests for information.
If that were the sort of response a minister in the British Government gave to a member of the British House of Commons, he would deservedly be pilloried in that House.
I expect better from the President of the Commission.
I wish to say, on behalf of this House, that when a Member asks a perfectly legitimate question I expect that question to be answered to the fullest extent.
We should not just be given an excuse and some sort of non-answer.
I would like to remind the President of the Commission of his pledges to provide transparency and openness in terms of information to this House.
Of course, Mr Bradbourn, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
Madam President, I had announced that I wanted to make a statement on behalf of the Socialist Group with regard to the constitutional crisis in the European Union following the last meeting of the Council of Justice and Interior Ministers last week.
My statement is as follows:
I would like to express our concern about the grave situation which has arisen in view of the Laeken Summit, because, by supporting the report by Mrs Reding, of the PPE-DE, and the report by Mr Watson, a Liberal, which was widely supported by the European Parliament, this House has defined a clear approach in the fight against terrorism.
Since 11 September, the European Council, on two occasions, in Brussels and in Ghent, has maintained the same approach, without reservations from any Head of State or Government.
The European Parliament has dealt with the Commission' s two proposals by means of an urgency procedure, with huge support at the last part-session in Brussels.
Today, Parliament is going to be consulted once again and we are in a situation where one government, the Italian government, is refusing to accept something which is clear to all the institutions of the European Union.
Madam President, I would like you to express, on behalf of my group, firstly our support for the President of the European Council, Mr Verhofstadt, who will go to Rome tomorrow to try to resolve this unacceptable situation; secondly, to express our support for the Commission, which has exercised its right to initiative responsibly and with a sense of duty.
Finally, I would also like you to strongly protest, on behalf of Parliament, at the unacceptable statements, delivered in coarse and rude language, made at the weekend by a former colleague of ours, now an Italian Government Minister, Mr Bossi, which would make Mr Haider green with envy.
This is a very important issue, on which we are all united.
If we cannot move ahead as fifteen, we will do so as fourteen, but we must combat terrorism on all fronts, and one of them is corruption and the recycling and laundering of money.
(Applause from the left)
I certainly share the concern that Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo has raised at the failure of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers to reach agreement on the proposal for a European arrest warrant.
I note, however that, in addition to Mr Verhofstadt's planned visit to Rome, there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers on Thursday of this week.
It must be hoped that agreement can be reached on that occasion.
The House anticipated that an agreement might not be reached and recommended at least consideration of the use of Article 40 of the Treaty which would allow a number of countries to proceed on the basis of reinforced cooperation.
Nobody wants that solution; it must be hoped that we can reach agreement between 15, but, one country must not be allowed to hold up progress in the fight against terrorism called for by the Heads of State and Government in Ghent.
(Applause from the left and the centre)
Madam President, I cannot remain silent for Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has, of course, made the most of the opportunity to transform what might actually be well-founded comments into a crusade, which has been on the march ever since the Italian people, of their own free will, elected a new government.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo just will not accept this, and the sooner he does the better.
I want all the Members who are protesting to understand this too: democracy is this, ladies and gentlemen; every people chooses its government freely and willingly.
More specifically, I would stress the absolute falsehood of what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has said.
The government and the Italian people are more committed to combating terrorism than anyone.
The government and the Italian people have paid the price of terrorist attacks in recent years and have always been in the front line.
It is silly to confuse the issue. There is no point in trying to put everything under one roof.
We are discussing the possibility of extending the European arrest warrant and it is on this, the extension of the warrant to other offences not initially covered, that we are attempting - and we are confident that agreement will be reached - to find a way of accommodating the different legal traditions and the different legislative frameworks of each country, so that we can be sure that the decisions we take to address the current critical situation of terrorism will also provide us with a properly harmonised Community legislative framework.
This, then is the issue, this and no other.
Anyone who wants to exploit the tragic events of 11 September to continue with this mad campaign against a legitimately elected government will certainly not find support.
I will end by suggesting that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo reserve his enthusiasm for more justified causes, and that he stop trying to mislead us by confusing the issues on the table.
(Applause from the right)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's comments demand a response.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that we expect that the Italian government, in which we have the greatest confidence, will help to ensure that we can finally reach an agreement.
We regard the fight against terrorism as a priority, and this is an issue on which there should not be any differences between the party-political families.
However, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I also believe this not an issue that should be the subject of party-political controversy, and we also know - please listen to what I am saying, I am trying to be very objective - that no result has been achieved on the party statute.
You also know that it was not those of my own political persuasion who contributed to this failure. I would ask you, just as you are critical in other cases, to be critical of your own party when results are not forthcoming, as in the case of the party statute.
Your credibility would be greater if you applied the same yardsticks right across the political spectrum.
(Applause from the right)
Madam President, I think it is pretty rich to compare the European arrest warrant with a party statute.
However, there are, of course, parties - particularly in Germany - where there is a close link between arrest warrants and their party statute.
(Applause and laughter) I would just like to say one thing to Mr Lisi: the entire 'Forza Italia' delegation has, at all the hearings on the Commission's proposals that have taken place in this House up to now, agreed to all the European Parliament's opinions.
So I wonder why the Italian Prime Minister, who comes from the same party as Mr Lisi - who incidentally approved all this himself - is now instructing his Minister for the Interior to veto offences which we all agreed should be prosecuted at European level.
I wonder if this could possibly have something to do with party politics, but not the issue that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has rightly raised here.
Madam President, the great majority of my group have voted against the Watson report on the European arrest warrant.
However, our motives were very different from those of Mr Berlusconi, and that is why I should like to make this contribution, mainly to avoid being tarred with the same brush.
In principle, the Group of the Greens are in favour of a European arrest warrant, but only after a number of minimum standards have been put in place in the field of law of criminal procedure, for example with regard to legal aid or to criminal investigation methods.
The rationale underlying a European arrest warrant is that all legal systems are more or less the same, and that it really does not matter in which country one is sentenced.
That is not yet the case at the moment.
If these systems were alike, it would not be so difficult to establish these minimum standards.
I know that sooner or later, everyone will support these minimum standards, but our group has made them a condition for a European arrest warrant.
As such, this is absolutely and fundamentally a different viewpoint from that adopted by Mr Berlusconi, and it should not be confused with his.
Neither should it be confused with a kind of anti-European sentiment.
We are in favour of a European arrest warrant, but only when this condition has been met.
Madam President, Mr Poettering, you just mentioned the European party statute in connection with the European arrest warrant.
The only real connection is that they are both things we consider to be desirable.
However, I do not quite understand your criticism of my group.
You were talking as if it was my group's fault that nothing has happened so far.
As I understand it, the situation was rather different. There were governments that wanted parties existing in only two countries to be granted this status.
Surely that cannot be so, the European party statute cannot be a way of providing back-door finance to national or regional parties.
I just wanted to establish that point so that no false impressions arise or misleading discussions take place.
Madam President, I should like to change the subject and get us off this tack.
Today is International Human Rights Day and I wish to express my distress and horror at the tragic death of the eight refugees, including three children, who suffocated in a container in southern Ireland.
Eight dead refugees who were the victims not so much of the traffickers, as the authorities hastened to assure us, but of European indifference and a global system which allows and encourages the free movement of heads, but not the free movement of people, of a system which condemns two thirds of the people on this planet to live in conditions of unbelievable poverty.
The European Parliament cannot stand by impassively in the face of the present-day refugee tragedy, nor can we feel safe in fortress Europe surrounded by such human misery and such a huge development divide.
I think it is a very good sign that we shall be debating the question of refugees and immigrants during the urgent debate on Thursday, and I would be most obliged, Madam President, if you would convey these views to the Council in Laeken.
I wish to raise also the discovery of eight people dead in a container of furniture in County Wexford over the weekend.
The dead included a four-year old boy, a ten-year old girl and a sixteen-year old boy.
There were three adults found dead also - two men and a woman - and there are five survivors.
It appears that, so far as we understand it, about 11 of these people came from Turkey, one from Albania and one from Algeria.
It seems to me quite appalling that we have a situation in Europe where people are so desperate that they have to put themselves into the hands of criminals in order to try and find a new life in Europe.
We have done something serious about dealing with the criminals on the one hand and with our approach to immigration on the other.
We cannot continue to allow the situation where people are so desperate that they will do anything and even put themselves and their children at risk in order to find a new life.
I would ask those in this House who are supporting Mr Berlusconi in opposing the European arrest warrant to ask themselves why are they supporting a situation where the criminals who put these people into this container will escape the justice which needs to be meted out to them?
Could I also ask, Madam President...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Madam President, I am going to make a very simple proposal relating to International Human Rights Day.
Given that eight people recently lost their lives in tragic circumstances and that you, Madam President, often invite us to show our respect for those who are victims of violence by observing a minute' s silence, we should, naturally, observe a minute' s silence tomorrow morning at the opening of the sitting, for the eight people who recently died at the hands of evil traffickers.
Madam President, I hope that the new President will treat all Members equally.
I have been indicating for quite some time - well before many people who have already spoken - that I want to make a point of order.
I have two points.
The first is in relation to Mr Stevenson's attack on a Belgian minister who is not here to defend herself.
A personal and vitriolic attack like that is unjustified when the person is not present.
Secondly, in relation to what has happened in Ireland this weekend, it is only proper that we should have a debate on this.
People are focusing on the wrong aspect.
It is quite clear that the fortress mentality of Europe is what is causing people to put their lives at risk, by trusting people who are trying to make a profit.
We need to open up the borders instead of encouraging this kind of fortress mentality.
That is the only way we are going to ensure that people do not lose their lives in such a tragic way.
Dover and Wexford are only two examples of what is to come.
Finally, I am very disappointed that some of my fellow Irish Members in this House did not feel that they could support this being discussed in Parliament.
That is a tragedy, considering that it happened in their own constituency.
Madam President, I rise to support the remarks of Mr de Rossa and Mrs McKenna with regard to the horrific situation and tragedy in Wexford, Ireland.
The Irish Government has already expressed its sentiments in this regard and will be taking appropriate action.
I support you also, Madam President, in making space on Thursday's agenda for a debate on this tragedy.
Certainly, Mr Fitzsimons.
As you know, Parliament has decided to include this issue in the debate on topical questions to be held on Thursday.
Madam President, at the last part-session in Brussels you very kindly said that you would write to the Greek authorities about the 12 British and two Dutch plane spotters who were arrested.
I was wondering whether you have had any reply to that letter.
My constituent Wayne Groves is still in prison after nearly five weeks with no charge and no trial.
I believe it is against the European Convention on Human Rights.
I should like to know whether there is anything further you can do on their behalf and whether you have had that reply.
Yes, Mrs Lynne, I have received a reply from Mr Papandreou, the Greek Foreign Affairs Minister, which I shall send on to you and to all Members as soon as possible, as this reply is open to public scrutiny.
As you will see, the letter does not, unfortunately, give an entirely satisfactory response regarding the people who are being detained.
Madam President, I should like to endorse Mrs Lynne' s point of order, but I should like to ask you to re-establish contact, and I should also like to call on my fellow Greek MEPs to ensure that these spotters, who have now spent nearly five weeks in a Greek prison for indulging in their pastime, can be brought to court before next Friday, because procedures will otherwise be delayed by a three-week break and these young men, these spotters who were enjoying their pastime, would then be locked up seven or eight weeks without being brought before the law.
I would therefore ask you and my fellow Greek MEPs kindly to exert some political pressure to ensure that these spotters can have a court hearing before next Friday.
Madam President, I would like to endorse the point made by Mrs Lynne.
Today is Human Rights Day and yet there are 12 European citizens in prison in Greece without trial.
Members opposite have been raising the issue of the European arrest warrant - this incident shows precisely why Members on this side of the House have concerns about a European arrest warrant.
British citizens engaged in the harmless pursuit of plane-spotting find themselves in prison in Greece without trial.
I really look forward to seeing the reply you have received, which you described as unsatisfactory, and hope you will respond in very robust terms to the Greek Government.
They must not be allowed to keep European citizens in prison without trial.
Unfortunately, Mr Perry, the reply was unsatisfactory, as I just said.
Mr Papandreou' s reply was as follows: 'I have made known the interest that the Foreign Affairs Ministry is taking in the matter.
Nevertheless, as you can understand, the executive power cannot possibly intervene in any way in the workings and the independence of the judiciary.'
I shall, of course, see what action I can take in this matter.
But unfortunately the response is, for the time being, negative.
Madam President, I should like to comment on the positions taken by the honourable Members in connection with the arrest of a number of Britons in Greece and, first, to assure them that, as Members of Parliament, we have no way of influencing the independence of the Greek judiciary, and rightly so, nor do I believe that you are able to influence the judiciary in your countries.
Secondly, you must know, as we said during the last debate in Brussels, that the acts for which they were arrested, at least as they have been reported in the press, are acts for which they would have been arrested in any one of the fifteen Member States of the European Union.
So we would be well advised to respect the institutions on the basis of which the fifteen Member States work together, to respect the independence of the judiciary and to respect the laws which apply in the fifteen Member States.
Let us be clear on one thing: there are fifteen countries here, represented by numerous parties and numerous persuasions, all are equal and of equal value, and no one has the right to tell other countries how to act, as if they were countries which did not belong to Europe.
I should like to thank you, Madam President, for writing a letter to the Greek authorities about the plane spotters, and for what you said today.
It is particularly important that you do this on behalf of the whole European Parliament and as you represent a Member State that is not involved on either side.
You said you would reflect on further action you would take.
Could I ask when you will report back to the plenary on that?
I should also like to thank Mr Souladakis for what he said.
I believe that there is a common understanding here of the necessity to observe human rights and of the need for cooperation between our two states in the European Union, as well as for respect for the independence of the judiciary.
Through you, Madam President, perhaps I can appeal to all the Greek Members of this House to see whether we can produce some form of joint statement in support of those principles which might advance understanding and lead to a quicker resolution of this issue for the 12 individuals involved.
Madam President, as you are well aware, the situation caused by ETA' s terrorism in Spain is horrendous, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work during your Presidency.
I would like to say once again that I totally reject ETA and all those who support it or apologise for it.

Madam President, both myself and my party have been seriously slandered in some sections of the Spanish media, since, through illness, I was not able to attend the last part-session in Brussels, where a debate and a vote were held on Mr Watson' s report, which I fully supported through various press releases which were sent to all the Spanish media 24 hours before the debate and the vote, and which were systematically hushed up.
For all these reasons, Madam President, I would ask for your support in this situation in which I have been unable to defend myself.
To this end, since my position and that of my party was clear, public and expressed prior to the vote, I would like to ask you formally that my vote in favour of the Watson report and Amendments Nos 117 and 118 be registered, as that is how I would have voted had I been present.
Furthermore, I would point out that the inclusion of my vote would not significantly alter the final result of the vote.
Finally, I would like to publicly thank the Efe Agency, the only one to express the truth in its communications.
We will always support the defence of life and the most fundamental rights and we will always be against murderers and those who justify and support them.
Madam President, today we are commemorating International Human Rights Day.
By coincidence, this week's agenda features a joint debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, requiring straightforward involvement by Parliament on human rights.
At the beginning of this year, I denounced in this House the pardon of 15 torturers by the Spanish Government, as this means that torture will continue to be frequently practised by the Spanish police.
Three months afterwards, a young woman, Iratxe Sorzabal,
(The speaker brandished a poster)
was sexually humiliated and subjected to torture sessions for hours from the moment of her arrest.
These photos were taken in the hospital and show the marks ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, on Wednesday, we are going to debate an item on cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism.
However, we discovered - on the Internet, in fact - that this debate is going to be based on an exchange of letters between a representative of Mr Bush - a Mr Forster, I believe - and Mr Prodi.
Parliament does not have a copy of these letters, although we can read them on the Internet, in which the United States government demands Europe take forty or so measures to cooperate with the fight against terrorism.
It also appears - we can only say 'it appears' as we have no documents to refer to - that Mr Prodi sent a reply to the United States government at the end of November.
I think that, for this slightly rushed debate to be held in more favourable conditions - the debate is, however, scheduled for Wednesday - it would be helpful for Parliament to obtain a copy of the letter that the United States government sent to Mr Prodi and Mr Prodi' s reply.
That is the request I would like to make.
Of course, Mr Krivine, we shall try to follow this up as soon as possible.
Madam President, this point may be of some interest to the House.
Honourable Members may recall voting in the mini-part-session on the Foster report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
This report had to be brought forward very quickly in the light of the events of 11 September.
We were then awaiting the response from the Transport Council meeting last Friday and everyone hoped that a common position would be reached.
I should like to inform the House that the Transport Council and Member States did not reach a common position, despite urgent appeals from all sides on the desperate need for these measures and despite the fact that this Parliament had bent over backwards to do its very best in a very short period of time.
The behaviour of the Member States and the Council in all of this has been quite appalling.
This is probably one of the most important measures that has come through since 11 September and it would have affected 38 European countries.
I will keep this House informed as to progress but I would like you, Madam President, to pass on our comments to the presidency.
I would like to draw your attention, Madam President, and that of Parliament, to the unacceptable and discriminatory behaviour of the Albanian authorities towards the Greek minority in the town of Chimara particularly, where, last week, special police forces demolished buildings, physically abused members of that minority, to whom the buildings belonged, even women and children.
The buildings included the minority' s administrative headquarters, the infants' school and several shops, which, on the pretext that they had been poorly constructed, were destroyed by bulldozers on the instructions of the town' s mayor, whose election, it must be stressed, was not recognised as legitimate by Council of Europe observers.
Madam President, I think that Parliament should take on board these extremely regrettable actions when preparing for the forthcoming negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Albania.
Thank you.
Madam President, are we, the Members of the European Parliament, all fraudsters?
Are we all thieves?
Are we all idlers?
Are we timewasters who do nothing from morning to night and spend our time enjoying ourselves and getting rich?
I do not think so.
Yet that is what is stated in a book by an Italian journalist, Mario Giordano, entitled 'L' Unione fa la truffa' [The Union is a swindler].
The title says it all.
This journalist is also, I regret to say, the director of a major Italian television company.
The book, which I found in a bookshop in Rome - where I had gone to meet my mother and sister as I often do - filled me with horror and sent shivers down my spine, for it describes all of us Members of Parliament as idlers who do nothing but plot frauds and robberies.
Madam President, please would you examine this book and instigate legal proceedings for libel against Mario Giordano, who, it pains me to admit, is Italian.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for this information. I can assure you that we shall take a close look at this book and see what can be done to restore our reputation.
Madam President, I wish to draw the House's attention to the vigorous protests and exasperation of Greek farmers, who are again involved in mass dynamic demonstrations against the anti-farming policy of the European Union, which is turning them off their land, ruining them and forcing them to abandon the countryside.
Our farmers are fighting against the policy of quotas which limits dynamic arable farming, even of products in which the European Union and Greece are nowhere near self-sufficient, such as oil, tobacco and cotton, for which the Council even ignored a resolution by the European Parliament calling for a 50% increase in quotas.
Our farmers are fighting against their exploitation by the processing industry, which snaps up their produce at derisory prices. Hundreds of thousands have already abandoned farming and joined the ranks of the unemployed.
They are calling for quotas to be abolished, at least for products in which the European Union is not self-sufficient. They are protesting about policy to date.
They are calling for infrastructure projects, such as irrigation works.
They are calling for producer prices which cover the cost of production and afford them a profit.
Madam President, we are at their side in their just fight for survival with all the means at our disposal, even if their fight qualifies as terrorism as defined recently by the Ministers of Justice of the European Union, a definition which we fear will also be adopted by the Laeken Summit.
Madam President, ten years ago this week, our Sakharov prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This Saturday, all living Laureates will go to Oslo to commemorate 100 years of the Nobel Peace Prize - she will not be there.
She has been kept under house arrest since September 2000 and has not been allowed to move about freely for 13 years.
Will you please, Madam President, send her a message of support from this Parliament and also urge the Norwegian Nobel Institute to express their deep concern about the fact that she is not able to join them on Saturday in Oslo.
Would you also ask the Nobel Institute to urge the military junta in Rangoon, Burma, to give Aung San Suu Kyi her freedom forthwith.
Mrs Kinnock, I am, of course, very willing to take this step, but I think that it will be even more effective after the debate, which is on the agenda under the item on human rights, has been held on Thursday.
Once we have held the debate, I shall be able to inform the Institute of the position that the European Parliament has clearly adopted.
I would like to inform you that, at the request of several groups, we will be holding a brief but intense commemoration tomorrow to mark the events of 11 September.
The commemoration will take place in the House, just before the address by the President of South Korea, in other words at approximately 11.50 a.m.
European Food Authority
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0416/2001), by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1088/1/2001 - C5-0414/2001 - 2000/0286(COD))
Madam President, today's debate is the culmination of a long process which began in the days of the BSE epidemic.
It is in a sense a proposal that comes as much from this House as from the other institutions of the European Union because our two temporary committees of inquiry culminated in the recommendation that there should be a body of this kind.
One Commission fell, another came into office accepting that something of this sort should happen and it is that proposal from President Prodi, driven forward by the Commissioner, which we are dealing with today.
It is, therefore, the work of many hands and if this debate today is considered, calm and, I hope, rational it is because of the extent to which the three sides in the triangle of forces have attempted to come to an agreed conclusion by the time of this second reading debate, in order to expedite the introduction of the new authority itself.
There should not be any undue delay.
If we can avoid the conciliation stage, we will do so.
There are still perhaps a few reservations which I shall refer to in a moment, but we have come to a point where we believe we have a consensus in this House.
We certainly have a majority in this House and I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups, particularly Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes for the work they have done right through since the original White Paper.
I would also like to thank my own researcher, Michelle Smythe, and everyone from the Commission and the Council, under both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, who have brought this forward.
Since Mrs Aelvoet has taken a bit of a pounding today I shall pay tribute to her part in it also.
We have now agreed on a timetable to get the new authority up and running.
To do that there is a series of specific compromises: 16 new amendments which broadly find favour with the Commission - I hope Mr Byrne will be able to indicate that - and the Council.
Firstly, we had to adopt an unusual procedure for one point that remains in some doubt, that is, the site of the new authority.
We wanted to set out criteria for the site of the new authority as we believe we should.
The Council, however, were not prepared to accept them in the body of the text.
But you do not throw away the whole report for that: we have put it into the legislative resolution and we hope that you, Madam President, will be able to set out exactly what our reasoning is.
The decision will have to be made on merit and not through the kind of political horsetrading that is currently being whispered about.
It would be the worst possible start if this body were sited in an inappropriate place for the worst of reasons.
We tabled the compromise amendments in order to bring forward the major priorities that this Parliament has always emphasised: firstly, a parliamentary hearing for the proposed executive director of the new authority and a three-month period for Parliament to express its opinion on the candidates for a small and tightly-focused management board.
That is the board that will meet in public and will make its opinions equally public so the citizens of Europe can see what it recommends.
It will have a role to play in risk analysis, risk communication and risk management, where its advice is appropriate.
These are substantial powers.
In addition, this legislation gives protection to those who want to report on unsafe practices in the food and feed business.
Citizens have a duty to tell the truth and I believe we have guaranteed that.
If the 16 compromise amendments, and the others already agreed with the presidency, are passed, we can proceed to set up the new EFSA.
The problem of BSE, for example, is still with us: cases of it have been notified in two previously clear Member States this week.
Everybody knows that food and animal feed have to be safer.
The procedures whereby such products come in and out of the European Union have to be open, transparent and, above all, safe.
Some of the practices of industrialised farming have threatened us all.
Producers and consumers alike have everything to gain from a monitoring authority which protects the interests of all and is beholden to none.
On that basis I commend this proposal to the House.
We have come quite a journey since the Commission produced its first White Paper.
At that time I had the privilege of writing the report for Parliament with my friend across the floor - Mr Whitehead - acting as shadow.
Now I am reciprocating as shadow for his report.
My party is not a great party for harmonisation but we are a party for harmony and that is what we have seen in this report and the way it has been dealt with.
I too wish to play tribute to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, also the Commissioner, Mr David Byrne, and - dare I say it in the light of earlier comments -to Magda Aelvoet, the minister.
I hope Ms McKenna will not take offence if I give her praise in her absence as she too has played her part in looking for and helping us to find compromises which make sense, which do not betray anybody and which take forward the concept of food safety for the peoples of Europe.
This is an issue which is of considerable importance to people.
There is nothing more important than the safety of the food and the drink that they and their families partake of.
There is a European dimension to this because, increasingly, not only does food cross boundaries but people cross boundaries.
So we need to be certain that the food we eat has been grown in soil we can trust and the fertilisers added to it are known to be safe.
The feed that is given to livestock also plays its part in ensuring that the food that ends up in our supermarkets and on our tables merits our confidence.
Then we want to make sure that the processing of food is safe and, finally, we want to make sure that when it is stored and retailed, it is still safe for us to take home.
Then of course it is up to us.
There are many critical issues in this report - the title of the food safety authority has been crucial to us.
We do not want to see an all-singing, all-dancing bureaucracy - we want an authority which is focused on safety, on the assessment of risk, on giving guidance where appropriate to the managers of risk.
An authority that understands that risk can never be eliminated but it can be adequately spotted and dealt with.
Science is crucial, so is independence - that is why the siting of this authority is important.
The pre-conciliation process - if I can call it that - that we have been going through is an example of how to take measures through Parliament and the institutions.
At this last stage Parliament has spoken overwhelmingly with one voice.
I know the Commission and the Council have listened and I believe they will have benefited because we are working together on this measure.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the European Food Safety Authority today, there is one thing in particular that we need to say to the citizens of the European Union. That is that we are convinced even now, without this Food Safety Authority, that the food people in the European Union are consuming is safe.
So safe, that I am convinced that it is among the safest in the world.
However, if we believe that a food safety authority would have advantages and lead to improvements in the European Union, there must be good reasons for that.
I would like to name three conditions that I believe need to be met to achieve such improvements.
Mr Bowis and Mr Whitehead have already touched on these points.
The first is the quality of the experts.
It is not acceptable for people the Member States want to get rid of to be sent to this authority as experts and scientists.
It is your job, Commissioner, to invite the Member States to send only the cream of the cream.
Secondly, to secure improvements we need transparency and openness.
Even more than the scientific committees, which have had a high degree of transparency since the BSE crisis, the Authority needs to ensure that it earns the people's trust.
That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Byrne, we need controls.
It is also your job, the Commission's job, to convey to the Member States that supervision and control are the most basic tasks of the Member States, something you have criminally neglected in recent years.
If we want to carry on guaranteeing safe food, and perhaps even safer food, if we want to win back the people's trust, then we can only do this by meeting these conditions and by tightening up controls.
If we do that, the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union.
I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure that is the case.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think it is rather fantastic that we have now brought about some pretty good legislation.
Two years is certainly a long time, but I personally thought it would take longer.
It is incredibly important that we talk about safety, on which we can arrive at a common view.
Safety has to be assessed.
Openness and public control are more important than anything else in this new legislation.
Whatever we say and however we behave, new crises will occur and there will be new scandals.
We are going to be presented with new scientific proposals which point in one direction or another and which, rightly or wrongly, will frighten people.
The only way to deal with this situation is through complete openness and with total public scrutiny, for people cannot be calmed down simply through publishing decisions.
Now, everyone with an interest - consumer and environmental organisations and the media - will immediately be given information, and not only information from a majority of scientists on a panel but also details of minority views.
In that way, no one will be able to say that the EU is concealing anything from its citizens.
Finally, I want to say that this is all well and good, but that I wonder how things will work out in terms of compliance and control.
What is there in terms of a possible system of penalties to be imposed upon those Member States and companies which do not comply with the safety standards?
That is one step. It is a large step and also the first.
Let us never forget, however, that it must be implemented. Otherwise, it will be merely hot air.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Whitehead, the Regulation that is before us is ground-breaking, in my view.
I am indeed of the opinion that something good can come out of a crisis situation.
We often see this in the food industry too. Crises can lead to headway being made in the legislative field.
The Regulation that is before us constitutes one such step forward.
I should like to underline a few aspects which were important to my group in particular, and which we have also adopted.
Firstly, the Regulation will ensure that it will no longer be possible for infected food to be exported to third countries, often Third World countries.
Secondly, the diversity of food is highlighted. It is also pointed out that traditional products exist, that we should recognise this and that food has a certain cultural role to play.
Thirdly, we as Parliament have ensured that we have turned the proposed food authority into a food safety authority, which is quite an achievement for our Parliament.
Thanks to Parliament and you, Mr Whitehead, we have been able to play a role and have been able to underline the significance of transparency in this respect.
It is indeed true that we need transparency in order to restore consumer confidence.
We, as Parliament, have also ensured that we have gained more insight into the make-up of the management board and into the appointment of the executive director.
Finally, we have also called for more objective criteria for the location.
When we came out of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy at second reading, we noticed we had 28 amendments, 28 amendments which the Council struggled to accept at times.
We carried out a kind of pre-conciliation exercise, one with which I am delighted, because the rapporteurs, along with the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, made certain that we, as Parliament, were able to take a united stand at the Council, a Council where we heard one voice, where Mrs Aelvoet listened to us, and I am really very pleased about that.
Madam President, our political group is entirely in agreement with the tenor of this report.
We also think that it is right to table a number of those amendments again that have not been incorporated into this common position. Furthermore, we think that these amendments are of such a kind that it should not now take very long at all to find a common solution together with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.
The most important amendment from the European Parliament is that which makes it clear that what we are concerned with here is an authority dealing purely with food safety and not with food in general.
For us, this clarification is important.
It is important to focus specifically upon the safety issues.
Amendment No 4 concerns the correspondence between the EU' s food regulations and other international agreements and regulations.
Obviously, the EU must cooperate in this area with other parts of the world.
However, the trend within the World Trade Organisation, in particular, is in danger of leading to a situation in which we have a series of different conflicts between different systems of regulations.
In that case, we think it is incredibly important to assert the right to tougher rules for health and environmental reasons.
Amendment No 22 relates to the funding of the authority.
For us, it is an issue of principle that an authority should be financed from the Budget.
It must not be financed by means of fees deducted for its services.
That is why Amendment No 22 is important to us.
A number of amendments relate to openness, and those we naturally support.
According to Amendment No 41, board meetings must, as a rule, be public and not held behind closed doors.
We think that is incredibly important.
We also approve of the proposal that members should be drawn from a broad geographical area.
The proposals we are now discussing have their background in the serious food safety crises within the EU in recent years.
Dioxin, BSE and salmonella are just a few of the areas concerned.
These scandals are closely linked to heavily industrialised agriculture and to an agricultural policy in which large-scale production and yield have become more important than the environment, animal protection and safe food.
If the EU is really to be able to attend to the causes of the problems in this area, reform of the common agricultural policy is needed, above all, so that sustainability and the protection of animals and the environment are put first.
Only then shall we really be able to tackle the basis of the food safety problems in the EU.
Madam President, the views of the 370 million citizens of the European Union on the food chain in Europe have dramatically changed in recent years.
This is partly due to the advent of BSE, foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and the chicken dioxin scandal that took place a couple of years ago.
Of course the consumer is always right, but on this occasion the European Union legislators have had to redouble their efforts to improve the safety of the food chain in Europe and to restore consumer confidence in food products within the Union.
It has not been an easy task.
However, the White Paper mentioned by Mr Bowis that the Commission brought forward outlines a raft of directives and regulations that need to be updated and modernised so as to make the food chain in Europe safer.
I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Byrne, the Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Public Health, for his absolute determination to guarantee that European Union consumers have total confidence in all food products that are sold within the Union.
That not only means improving safety standards of production within the Union but also tightening up rules and conditions for the importation of food products into the Union.
The key element of this White Paper is the setting up of the food authority, as we discussed today.
It is very important that this authority is up and running as soon as possible, no matter where it is located.
This European Food Authority can work with the 15 governments of the Union, in an advisory and preventative capacity, to guarantee that food products from farm to table comply with the highest public health standards.
We live in an internal market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.
Food is an internationally tradable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe.
This is only right and proper in the light of the fact that consumers are criss-crossing the frontiers of the European Union on a daily basis.
I also support the approach taken by Commissioner Byrne in guaranteeing that all interested parties are given due representation with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations under the White Paper on food safety.
Groups representing the food industry, farm organisations and consumer interests are all actively involved in the implementation of these directives and regulations.
Indeed, as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Parliament has the power of codecision with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations in the area of consumer protection and public health.
We intend to remain vigilant at all times so as to guarantee that confidence in the European food chain is fully restored, sooner rather than later.
I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and all involved in producing this excellent report.
Madam President, in response to the many food crises, such as chicken dioxin, salmonella, listeria, foot and mouth disease and BSE, several Member States have set up facilities to monitor food safety.
At the beginning of 2002, Europe will create its own food safety authority.
This new body aims, on the one hand, to meet citizens' expectations by placing food safety at the top of their list of priorities, on a par with unemployment, and, on the other hand, to provide the European Union with a body that is able to defend and promote the European agricultural model on the international stage.
Agricultural products are now an integral part of the World Trade Organisation negotiating round.
Within the WTO, the Cairns group is opposed to an approach to agriculture that takes into account food safety.
Nevertheless, in order to be successful, the authority will have to resolve the following problems. On the one hand, the composition of the Management Board, since, in order to involve all players from all parts of the food chain, the body will have to ensure a place on the board for representatives of the agricultural world in the same way as consumers, the food industry and distributors.
That is why we remain in favour of a Management Board composed of 16 members, and not of 12 as proposed in the report.
Lastly, as regards the definition of functions, who will be responsible for the alert system, for management and for monitoring?
This means bringing up the thorny issue of revamping the Rapid Alert System.
The role of the French Agency is limited to risk assessment, whilst the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for risk management.
The European Agency will have to restrict itself to a monitoring role.
My final point relates to the potential conflicts with the national agencies. France, Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium and Greece have their own national agencies.
Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are about to create their own.
The European Agency will have to fulfil a coordination function, whilst respecting the independence of the national agencies.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when euro-federalists are citing the need for a political Europe, which in their view would enable European integration to become more democratic, in other words, would give fewer powers to the European Commission, what do we see happening?
A new body is being set up - the European Food Safety Authority - and it must be said that this authority, because of the representatives appointed to form its Management Board, will necessarily be dependent on the European Commission, despite its legal title.
Let us cast our minds back to the unforgivable errors that the European Commission made during the mad cow epidemic. Its priority, at the time, was the creation of the single market, come what may, rather than the safety of food for European consumers.
In order to make the European Food Safety Authority more credible in the eyes of Member States' citizens, it is not enough for its seat to be independent of the European Commission as well as physically distant. The members of the future Management Board of the new body must be monitored by the same citizens, through their representation at the European Parliament.
It does not seem that the Authority is giving sufficient assurance that it will be independent.
It will be subjected to the power of lobbies and to the wishes of the European Commission and therefore, will be independent only of universal suffrage.
Furthermore, who can assure us that it will respect the principle of subsidiarity and individual food characteristics?
Will it smother small- and medium-sized food businesses with even stricter regulation, that will be tolerated by fewer and fewer citizens?
Why call it an 'Authority' when it has no legislative power?
And lastly, why give it so many resources - EUR 67 million and 339 officials - when it could be equally efficient and less costly if it worked together with the existing national agencies?
Thank you.
For many years, we have been attempting to restore consumer confidence and I believe that the creation of the Food Safety Authority is a step towards achieving this goal.
We must acknowledge that there was some excellent consultation in the management of this dossier and we must not fall behind with this today.
Zero risk does not exist and the consequences of a bacteriological problem, whether or not this is linked to terrorism, can be extremely significant for all our citizens.
We are well aware that food contamination can affect a large number of people.
That is why safety must be at the heart of this system.
We must not be overcome by panic either, because the European food chain, as a result of the many decisions that we have taken in this Chamber, is certainly one of the safest in the world. However, the shortcomings that have come to light during previous crises compel us to take further measures in the area of food safety.
In order to be effective and credible, the Authority must bring together the leading scientific experts; it must only undertake risk assessment, as part of the Rapid Alert System, whilst risk management must remain in the public domain.
It must also work together with the national agencies.
Its intervention must be proportionate to the level of risk, in other words, if there are simply rumours, communication must then be stepped up. If, however, there is a risk, the required precautionary measures must be taken; if there is a danger, then preventative measures are necessary.
Lastly, the Authority must be independent and utterly transparent.
At the same time, monitoring must be increased and, in the case of a serious offence, penalties must be substantial as well as effective.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a rule our food is already safe.
Nevertheless, 2 000 people worldwide die every year of salmonella poisoning.
In the United States alone, 9 000 people die each year of microbe-related food poisoning.
These are worrying statistics, and we are not even talking about other food-related illnesses.
With the general principles of food law, we are laying new foundations for safe food and we will be building on those in the next few months and years.
We must work on a system which fills consumers with confidence.
Emotions sometimes run high where food is concerned, beef being a recent European example of this.
Politicians cannot and must not ignore these emotions, but we must consider the facts.
That is where the European Food Authority comes into its own: it must be a beacon of objectivity.
The European Food Authority must join forces with national authorities, but we must ensure that it is not rendered powerless from the word go and that it is headed by an approachable front man who does not need to fight to impose his authority but who embodies quality and authority.
I would like to finish off with a word of thanks to the rapporteur who has proved to personify the self-same quality and authority.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, in effect, vote in favour of the Whitehead report.
The European Food Safety Authority, an essential food safety mechanism serving the consumers and the political authorities of Europe alike, is essential to the performance of the functions that it will be assigned.
Its first task is to investigate all the failings that led to the recent food safety crises, both the crises in the food business, such as chicken dioxins, food and mouth disease, trafficking in veterinary products, the excessive use of vaccines and tranquillisers on animals and also the original BSE crisis.
I would point out that even Finland now has its first case of mad cow disease.
That is the first point I would like to make.
My second point is that it is the agency that must also stop the uncontrolled spread of contaminating transgenic products that are even infesting traditional cereal crops, since consumers are rejecting transgenic crops, whose only virtues are commercial.
Therefore, this agency must also, other than resolving all those problems, ensure food safety from the farm to the fork.
In order to do so, the Food Safety Authority must apply, from the beginning of 2002, the principles of transparency and monitoring that my fellow Members have already mentioned.
The failings in the area of hygiene as being the sole criterion, which has been highlighted in the many crises that we have listed, particularly in animal feed, shows that the agency must give advice on good practice, on labelling, on products that have been produced locally, that contain dairy products, instead of dealing with industrial standards alone, which do not prevent salmonella, listeria or any of the more distressing epidemics.
Its main function is therefore to coordinate the national agencies, and to do so, the agency must be independent and transparent.
On the other hand, I have doubts regarding Amendment No 34, which deals with the appointment procedure to the Management Board, a process that seems hazy at best, since it refers to the meritocracy of the Management Board.
So what exactly does meritocracy mean in an agency that should be composed of experts in the relevant scientific fields?
The Management Board has a political and managerial role.
I very much fear that this meritocracy is simply a way of masking the pressure exerted by large food corporations.
I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reassure me on this point.
As for where the agency will be based, we believe this is a side issue...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, given the tug-of-war about the location of the European Food Safety Authority, it appears to be a highly prestigious matter. This does not contribute towards safer food or consumer confidence.
Another point of concern is our keenness to impose our strict standards on the rest of the world.
In this respect, I have to say that other parts of the world often do not have the luxury of aiming for the highest possible safety standards for food.
Their priority is to collect sufficient food to survive.
Needless to say, we should not simply export food which fails to meet our safety standards to those countries.
But in those cases where export increases food safety in the countries concerned, export of this kind must be allowed.
In those cases, the automatic destruction of batches should not be an option.
As far as the appointment of the management board is concerned, I do agree with the compromise that has been struck with the Council.
It is indeed unwise to enlarge this management board any further, because this could compromise its decisiveness.
Furthermore, I am opposed to organising hearings in the European Parliament prior to appointing the members of the management board.
This applies even more to the executive director.
It would be wise for the European Parliament to move further away from the executive tasks of the future European Food Safety Authority.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the coming week, the Laeken Summit will adopt a number of decisions, including - it is to be hoped - a position on the food authority, deciding where it is to be based.
We know how important it is that this decision is made.
Several years have already passed since the beginning of this procedure; this proposal has been on the table since 1999, at least, so it is high time that the decision is taken.
I feel that, in tabling a second time the amendment which was voted upon at first reading some months ago, Parliament is trying to make two statements, which you, Commissioner, must convey to the governments.
The first is that this is a matter covered by the codecision procedure and so Parliament' s opinion on the criteria to be put to the vote tomorrow should also be taken into consideration when it comes to deciding the site of the authority.
We know that one of the approaches taken at Laeken will be horse trading - you can appoint the Chair of the Convention if I can choose the site of the Authority, and you can have the Police College - but I feel, rather, that all these decisions need to be taken on the basis of certain criteria which are strictly related to the interests of the institution we are attempting to create.
Therefore, when Parliament points out that the site chosen for the Authority should have a longstanding tradition in food safety and food safety research in general, this is clearly a criterion whose importance must be stressed.
When we talk about a good scientific infrastructure and facilities in the field of food safety, you, Commissioner, and the Commission must stress the importance of this criterion.
When we say that it has to be easily accessible in terms of communications and have efficient and rapid transport connections; when we say that it has to have connections with those services that deal with public health and consumer protection issues; of course it springs to my mind that the Joint Research Centre, which employs thousands of European researchers, is situated in Ispra, and therefore, my opinion can only be that these criteria apply to one candidate city alone: Parma, in Italy.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, which is just as we expected.
I think that this regulation and this legal basis will, with the measures that follow, help to improve food safety in the European Union, and will establish the general principles of the new food law.
With reference to general food law, I would like to mention, in particular, that this represents a real success in developing the principle of a seamless improvement in the food chain from farmer to consumer.
A key aspect of the principles set out here remains the traceability of products.
I believe that we have accordingly established two significant new principles and requirements for improving food safety.
The centrepiece of the regulation is the creation of the European Food Authority, or, as it is designated in the amendment, the 'European Food Safety Authority' .
I do not want to spend too much time on definitions here.
What I consider most important is the fact that the framework conditions have been created for this Authority.
The first of these is adequate financial provision.
It seems to me that this has not so far been achieved to the extent we might have wished, and the same applies to conditions governing communication between the Authority and the various authorities in the Member States.
Appropriate arrangements have not yet been set up in the Member States, and there is still a lot to be done in this regard.
As for the openness of the authority, I believe that this House's amendment is certainly correct, but we also have to guarantee that in certain circumstances the Authority can also meet behind closed doors.
An important issue, as many others have already said, is the location of the Authority, and if the Council rejects our proposals, it seems to me that it must intend to locate the Authority in such a way that our requirements and conditions cannot be met.
We cannot let such a situation prevail, nor can we accept it.
The Council must finally give in on this and select a location that will facilitate communication with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States.
Mr President, my thanks go to the rapporteur for the excellent work on this report.
As has already been established, the European Parliament has been very active for several years now in questions relating to food safety.
The rapporteur has also carried out very valuable work by holding discussions with the Commission and Council, in order to ensure that the start-up of the food authority is not delayed; this means that at the Laeken Summit a genuine decision really has to be made concerning the siting of the office.
With regard to the selection criteria, in my opinion Parliament has spoken quite correctly: it is a good idea to emphasise the research connection, the fact that the office is independent, and that there will be effective experts there to guarantee quality.
In the case of transparency, I can only agree with the previous speakers; however, transparency also means that there is cooperation with the consumer organisations.
Let me start by saying that I am all for food and animal feed safety, but I cannot understand why the European Union believes that it is necessary to establish the European Food Safety Authority.
I believe I am right in saying that almost all major diseases, except possibly BSE, come from countries outside the European Union.
Therefore the World Health Organisation, which is already in existence and is doing just such work, should be adequate for this purpose and can protect all of our interests.
This organisation serves 27 of the countries of Europe including the countries of the European Union.
It strikes me that the European Union is creating a further quango which, like most authorities the EU sets up, will be expensive to run and turn out to be a white elephant.
If such a need did exist, surely it should be the work of each national government to look at the appropriate problems.
These would be pertinent to the conditions of that country and they can act accordingly.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by saying that I have great admiration for the way in which the rapporteur, and also, most definitely, the shadow rapporteurs, have dealt with this very complicated matter which was ultimately resolved very quickly.
There are, of course, minor points which require further attention, and I would mention monitoring as one of them. Who authorises this monitoring?
But also, who will be organising, inspecting and running this food safety authority? This should not be sixteen, but twelve, for we need independence.
What do we actually mean by food safety?
We mean that in the internal market, we will ensure that we can guarantee food safety everywhere.
That not only includes Europe' s fifteen Member States, but also all the candidate countries.
I have a few concerns in this respect.
Not because food in the acceding countries would not be safe, that is not what I am saying, but I am worried about the lack of good networks in the new Member States that could carry out inspections and instil consumer confidence.
Last Thursday, there was a meeting involving experts from the acceding countries who alerted us to the lack of such a structure.
That is one side of the coin.
Inspection, also from the government, to ensure that the process runs smoothly.
There is also a flip side, namely the lack of a civil society. That means a lack of well-trained consumer organisations that are independent and that could encourage the government at any time to pursue the policy effectively.
The same also applies to product organisations.
I wonder if the Commissioner would be willing to give us some information on that score, enabling us to see what we can do about this in future.
Madam President, life is one constant risk-benefit analysis - what we do, where we go and what we eat.
While the European food chain remains one of the safest in the world, recent scandals have damaged our consumers' confidence in the food we eat and the methods we use to produce it.
The public has lost confidence in the national and European food safety systems after the scandals and scares with beef, E.coli, lysteria, salmonella, dioxins, eggs, poultry, milk and hormones.
The list goes on.
The public wants to be reassured that the road from farm to market, to the supermarket, to the oven, fridge and table is as safe as can be reasonably expected.
They want safety assessment that is neither secretive, behind the closed front door of the Commission, nor tainted by producer or pressure-group interest.
Since the beginning of your tenure, Commissioner Byrne, you have responded to the needs of the consumers of Europe by making every effort to improve the safety of the food chain.
This proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the European Union.
The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law with a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced.
I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for a job well done throughout the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The result of their consensual approach has been to strengthen and unify the voice of the European Parliament on the key issue at stake.
I would ask the Commission and the Council to listen to this united voice and to adopt 'European Food Safety Authority' as the title of the institution.
Keeping the word 'safety' in the title of the authority will give a clear signal to consumers as to its purpose and goals.
I also firmly believe that if the authority is to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe, it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner, dedicated to the assessment of food-safety risk.
Risk communication will also be a key element.
One has only to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Philips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there.
In conclusion, in relation to risk management, the measured and proportionate use of the proportionary principle or the political management ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, the issue of food safety is one of the many unifying factors in the Europe of the citizens we want.
As far as the European Food Safety Authority is concerned, I feel that the European Parliament has played a very major role: a great deal was achieved between first and second readings and, in my opinion, tomorrow' s vote will produce an extremely important report for, indeed, at this point, there is no longer any excuse for procrastination.
We will have an instrument which will help us to keep a constant check on food safety in Europe.
As regards this major work, achieved through the efforts of both the rapporteur and the committee responsible, there are still a number of small points which, I feel, will have to be specified: for example, it is extremely important that the management board should include a representative from the agricultural sector because the fact that we are dealing with a process means that all the sectors need to be represented.
There are still a number of gaps as regards the procedures.
We are definitely going to use operators from the food sector and people and companies specialised in all the parts of the food chain in order to ensure that the necessary information flow banishes all fears from the tables of our fellow citizens.
One last question is that of the site.
An amendment has been tabled seeking to ensure that the locations of the sites of the Commission and the other institutions do not affect the choice of site.
The site should be in a place which has a longstanding tradition in food safety and which has scientific infrastructure and substantial resources in the field of safety.
Of course, I must put in a word for Parma, for Parma is one of the most important places in the Italian agrifoods system.
It is my genuine hope that the Laeken Council will take this candidate into due consideration.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mr Titford, I am convinced that setting up an efficient and independent European Food Authority as an early warning system is something very much to be welcomed.
It should act as a transparently functioning scientific reference point for the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, but it should also be open for producers and consumers.
Advice, information and risk communications for consumers can help to increase our confidence in the food we eat.
Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily and we must take responsibility for that here.
The food scandals over the past few years have demonstrated that we need, in particular, consistent implementation of directives and on-the-spot controls on food and animal feed.
If we are to achieve seamless traceability of production, it is essential to optimise the way we link the scientific facilities of this Authority with the control authorities in the Member States.
This will ensure safety in the whole chain from producer to consumer.
And imported food must be just as safe as food produced in the EU.
This safety can be guaranteed by imposing strict controls on food imports at the EU's present external borders.
In parallel to this, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to establish properly functioning systems for monitoring the safety of food and animal feed before accession.
However, one important problem will not be solved by the regulation before us today, and that is the dividing line between food and medical products.
We need to minimise the grey area between these two product categories, food and medical products, as far as possible.
If we do not succeed in this, the result will be new demarcation problems and legal uncertainty.
That is why it is a matter of urgent necessity for us to make sure that when legislation on medical products is reviewed, an unambiguous EU-wide definition of food and medical products is established, so that there is a clear dividing line, because we can only improve safety for the consumer if we establish a clear definition.
Madam President, I recall that when President Prodi first offered me this particular portfolio in July 1999 he emphasised to me the importance of food safety during the life of this Commission.
He particularly suggested the importance of establishing a food safety authority during that period also.
He said that it was important that the consumers of the European Union had the same confidence in such an institution as US consumers have in their Food and Drugs Administration.
I hope that the new authority can deliver on this for our consumers and for our citizens.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Prodi for his ongoing support during our work to make his idea a concrete reality.
The wide scope of the general food law covering all aspects of the food and feed production chain that may have a direct or indirect impact on the safety of food has been maintained throughout the first and second readings.
The Commission welcomes this.
We also underline the importance of the wide remit which has been retained for the work of the European Food Safety Authority.
It is important that the food authority builds a comprehensive overview of the entire chain.
This should include aspects of animal health and welfare, animal feed safety and plant health, in particular at the primary production level.
Given our recent food safety problems, it would have been unthinkable to have a food authority that did not cover such matters.
The Commission supports Amendment No 1 which proposes that the authority be called the European Food Safety Authority, while ensuring that the broad remit, which is so important, is not affected.
The Commission can support Amendments Nos 29 to 44 by Mr Whitehead, Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes.
These replace Amendments Nos 2 to 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 25 and 27, which I do not support.
I can also accept Amendments Nos 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21 and 26.
Many of these add clarity to the text or enhance the transparency of the development of food law or the procedures of the European Food Safety Authority.
I also welcome Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 24 which adjust the text to ensure that the correct budgetary procedures are in place and that arrangements for third countries, notably EFTA countries, are appropriate and in line with normal procedures for agencies.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 which would allow unsafe food and feed to be exported from the Community to the original supplier in a third country without any constraints or controls.
This is clearly an unacceptable practice that I am not willing to support.
Rejected food or feed could end up being used either in a third country or being shipped back to the EU and that would constitute a risk to food safety.
From experience, the Commission knows that such practices are also potentially open to fraud and black market abuse.
I do not support Amendment No 28 which refers to the selection procedure for the seat, as well as defining the selection criteria.
However, I note that Parliament is also proposing another approach.
This involves adopting a resolution to the report which calls upon the Council to consider certain criteria in its selection of the authority's seat.
This House is aware that I believe strongly that the authority's seat should be chosen on rational and operational criteria that will facilitate the smooth working of the EFSA.
For these reasons I can support the principles expressed in the resolution.
I also support the joint declaration from the Commission, Council and Parliament concerning the members of the management board of the authority.
I believe that Amendment No 37 on the board's size, the selection process and membership criteria achieves the right balance between the different views expressed at first reading by the three institutions.
In conclusion, I should like to say that since I took up office as Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, I have made it clear that the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority was a top priority.
Community measures which protect the safety of the food supply require a sound scientific basis and the authority will provide this.
The authority is designed to be Europe's automatic first port of call on scientific matters relating to the safety of our food supply.
Today we are taking an important step towards the establishment of the authority, towards giving the European consumer the safest food supply in the world, which is our ultimate goal.
I would like to thank Mr Whitehead, his team and Parliamentary colleagues who have worked closely with him on the amendments at second reading, and also Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes.
I want to thank you for the close working relationship that existed between all of us - not just between our two great institutions, but also on a personal level between myself and all four of you.
I discussed these issues with each of you at some stage over the last few months.
In addition, I would like to thank the Council, both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, and also the Minister Magda Aelvoet, who put her own shoulder to the wheel on this issue on a number of occasions.
I also thank the people in my own Commission who worked with me so assiduously, so carefully and so hard.
Not only do I appreciate the excellent work that has been done, but I would like to thank all those involved for the speed with which this complex proposal has been dealt with.
The spirit of collaboration with which the three great institutions have approached this file has been admirable.
It is clear from the amendments on which Parliament will vote that compromises have been sought which should enable the regulation to be adopted without a time-wasting conciliation process.
This will facilitate the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority early next year.
Electronic communications networks and services
The next item is the joint debate on five recommendations for second reading:
(A5-0433/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) [10419/1/2001 - C5-0417/2001 - 2000/0188(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Niebler)
(A5-0432/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) [12170/1/2001 - C5-0490/2001 - 2000/0187(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Niebler)
(A5-0435/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) [10420/1/2001 - C5-0415/2001 - 2000/0184(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Paasilinna)
(A5-0434/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive) [10418/1/2001 - C5-0416/2001 - 2000/0186(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Brunetta)
(A5-0438/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Common Position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) [10421/1/2001 - C5-0418/2001 - 2000/0183(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Harbour).
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission for its excellent and constructive involvement in the consultation on this telecommunications package.
I would also like to sincerely thank the Belgian Presidency, which has shown enormous commitment in its efforts to facilitate a compromise between the Council and Parliament, and I think that if we are able to reach agreement on Wednesday, and I very much hope we will, it will be entirely due to the excellent way in which the Belgian Presidency has handled the negotiations.
Thank you very much indeed.
However, I also, of course, owe very special thanks to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who have not only co-operated in such an outstanding way over a period of many months, but have also worked together on the compromises so constructively.
Over the last 12 years, the EU has achieved an enormous amount in the telecommunications market.
The monopolies of the established service providers have been broken, and there has been complete liberalisation and deregulation of the market in many areas, which has benefited both consumers and the economy in general.
One clear result of all this has been a fall in prices and a variety of new products and services from the various providers.
But there is, of course, nothing that cannot be improved further.
This was evident from the 1999 telecommunications report and from the seventh implementation report recently published by the Commission.
I would just like to mention a couple of key concepts: local loop unbundling for the benefit of alternative service providers, where further action is still needed in the Member States, and the subscriber's link to the network, which is still unsatisfactory in some Member States.
Some established service providers are still offering dumping prices and there are also still bottlenecks as regards leased lines.
The new legal framework for telecommunications regulation should guarantee some remedial action here.
I would first like to briefly present my two reports on the telecommunications package and I would then like to turn to two other critical points regarding the other directives.
First, then, the Authorisation Directive. The whole point of the Authorisation Directive is to harmonise authorisation arrangements in the Member States.
I would like to stress once again, as I said at first reading, that the Commission has produced some excellent proposals here, proposals that I welcomed at first reading and which I specifically wish to support at second reading also.
Up to now there have not been uniform procedures for operating communications networks and providing communications services.
There have been a variety of different conditions, including, in particular, varying obligations on providers to supply information, there have been variations in the length of the procedures, and the cost and substance of the authorisations has varied.
This situation will come to an end with the new Authorisation Directive.
The directive also envisages a step change in the authorisation system.
Up to now, it has been the practice to issue individual authorisations, but when the Authorisation Directive comes in, there will be a switch to general authorisations, that is to say that, in future, communications network operators will not have to obtain an official licence beforehand, but will only have to demonstrate that they intend to operate a network.
However, they will have to comply with the requirements of the general authorisation scheme or of the directives.
Obligations on providers, particularly those regarding information, will be simplified by the new directive, with requirements being limited to the essential. So we are talking about a very provider-friendly solution here.
One of this Parliament's achievements has been the introduction of greater transparency in the granting of rights of way, for example drawing up a register setting out the procedures for granting rights of way in the Member States, and we have also managed to ensure that legal protection against rulings on rights of ways is guaranteed in all Member States.
We would have like to have achieved even more, especially as regards costs.
In this case, Parliament stressed the importance of providers, if at all possible, not being burdened with excessive costs in future, if I may put it that way, with regard to rights of way, numbers, the granting of licences and frequencies.
As far as this issue is concerned, our discussions have not yet been completed.
Should it be necessary to reach a compromise on the whole package, Parliament will surrender its own position in favour of the Council's recommendation.
My second report is on the Radio Spectrum Decision. The essential objective of this decision is to involve the Commission more closely in the granting of frequencies in future, which is how it should be.
Radio frequencies are sought-after commodities, and frequency allocation involves taking highly political decisions, and we must accordingly ensure that the decision makers who bear political responsibility are involved.
The granting of frequencies, frequency assignment and frequency allocation are no longer just a technical matter, nowadays, but a real political game.
There are two points on which the Council and Parliament are not yet totally in agreement, and I am therefore particularly pleased to see Mr Daems, the President-in-Office of the Council, here in the Chamber today.
Perhaps he could say something about the two points which I am particularly concerned about later on in the debate.
One point which Parliament has tackled repeatedly is whether it should itself be involved in future decisions on radio spectrum policy.
This House had requested that whenever frequency reallocation, in particular, was at stake, Parliament should, through the codecision procedure, be consulted and involved in the decision-making process.
To this end, we also adopted an amendment in committee at second reading that would guarantee us this right in a binding article contained in the directive, in the decision.
Now, the Council only wants to include this article or this proposal as a recital in the decision.
I would therefore like to ask Mr Daems to consider once more, if we are agreed on this, that Parliament should also be involved in radio spectrum policy via the codecision procedure, in which case we could be included in the decision itself and not just mentioned in a recital.
My second point relates to the extent to which the Commission should be concerned with the granting of frequencies.
Parliament requested that in the case of frequencies with Community coverage, the Commission should be called upon to intervene or put forward proposals.
In the decision, or rather in the Belgian Presidency proposal that I now have before me, I see that by deleting two little words in Amendment No 1, that is to say 'in particular' , the decision-making power is in fact to be considerably extended.
So I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in this case, too, if he could consider whether we could not agree to delete those two little words, which would mean that we would be respecting the principle of subsidiarity and thus achieving a solution between the Council and Parliament.
I find it hard to believe that the Council could not accept this too.
I would now like to touch on two other points, concerning the framework directive and the Universal Service Directive.
First of all, I absolutely must thank the Belgian Presidency very sincerely once again. The Belgian Presidency has worked out an excellent compromise for Article 6.
This is about who will have power of decision in future when there are questions about telecommunications law - the Commission or the Member States.
I believe that this House can accept the compromise that has emerged.
Many Members would have liked us to go further in this area, but that was just not achievable.
However, the compromise that has now emerged, according to which the Commission can intervene in matters of competition law, and in particular in matters of market definition and with regard to what constitutes significant market power, is, I believe, a very fair one.
I would now like to turn to a point that I regard as particularly significant, and then I shall conclude.
We have been concerned for many years as to how we can promote digital television still further in Europe.
The amended proposals from the Belgian Presidency have been one of the greatest disappointments in all this, so that we will achieve nothing or very little in this area.
Two points have emerged.
The first is whether we can extend transmission obligations to APIs and IPGs.
This Parliament unanimously advocated this in all the negotiations. I would ask, once again, that great thought should be given to this or that the Commission should consider how we can achieve this.
Furthermore, on the subject of a commonly agreed standard for digital television in the European Union, I believe that we need to go further than the Belgian Presidency has indicated so far.
Perhaps the Commission could give a clear signal here, too, in order to help digital television to make a genuine breakthrough in Europe.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, my colleagues, Europe's greatest change is, of course, the networking which has taken place; this certainly unifies us Europeans more than a common currency.
It is of everyday and full-time significance, and its importance is growing all the time.
The core philosophy of the entire grand project for an electronic Europe is that the digital divide should not take hold in Europe in the way that it threatens to take hold in many other parts of the world; and we, as well as Parliament, the Council and the Commission all share a common line here.
The Commission's draft framework directive and the other statutes belonging to this telecoms package follow the correct line and are very balanced, and I am highly satisfied with them.
In this rapidly-moving period of change, we will make up for lost ground; and particular attention has been paid to the importance of convergence, of rapprochement. This means that, to an ever increasing extent, the same content can be prepared on the same hardware, be transferred along the same routes and be received on the same apparatus.
This creates a wholly new information space, or perhaps I should say information world, since this is a part of us, it is a part of us in the workplace, at home and when we are travelling.
Here, in Parliament, we desire that this world be regulated, but that at the same time competition be secured, so that no monopolies, duopolies or cartels are generated.
This will maintain a low pricing level, easy access, and employment and growth in this area.
I could venture to say that if we had had these regulations in force at the time when we decided on the 'electronic Europe' at Lisbon and when (at the same time) the auction in frequencies was initiated, then it would not have been possible for the catastrophe of the frequency auctions to unfold in the way that it did.
It would have been possible to standardise the bid auctions and to harmonise practice, and consequently such irregularities would not have taken place, the sector would not have been driven to its knees and we would have saved many hundreds from bankruptcies and the unfortunate unemployment consequences linked to these.
A telecoms package which consolidates the Union's telecommunication legislation will have great significance in competition with others outside the European Union.
It will result in us having more harmonised markets for this sector which in itself is already international and border-transcending.
We will then also obtain the benefit of the European Union's advantages of scale, which in turn will surely have an impact on both employment and on the success possibilities of firms and on pricing.
Of these five statutes, I regard the framework directive to be the most important.
The most difficult matters have been dealt with here.
Now we have before us my draft report which has been processed by the committee, for which I thank my colleagues (it was approved unanimously), and then also the presentation of the Presidency State.
It has gone far in order to meet Parliament half way, and in my opinion we should approve it.
It takes account of Parliament's stance in two central matters which we have been taking up for discussion throughout this summer and autumn: Article 6 and Article 4.
The latter concerns the appeals procedure and the former concerns the relationship between the Commission and the national regulatory authorities.
Now for the first time, and this can be regarded as a breakthrough, the Commission can intervene in a national statute, if this statute is not in harmony with the general statutes, both in the definition of the market and in the definition of a significant market position.
These are the two matters which we wanted to see implemented, and now, thanks to the Presidency State, they are in your proposal.
Furthermore, I hope that the Presidency State can tell us whether it is also possible that the Council may commit to this as well.
If this is so, then this package should in my opinion be approved.
I have been given to understand that the Commission is also of this view.
Madam President, Commissioner Liikanen, the new regulatory framework for telecommunications replaces the Community system which opened up the national markets in Europe and brought the era of monopolies to a close.
By way of justifying the revision of the Community telecommunications framework, the European Commission stated its intention to reduce the regulatory burdens according to the liberalisation objectives achieved on the basis of the model still in force.
The aim was, in fact, to secure greater confidence in market forces in order to boost the competitiveness of the European market and encourage investment in the emerging markets, facilitating the provision of innovative services.
The purpose of the revision of the prevailing model should, therefore, have the aim of gradually moving the telecommunications market on from its liberalisation phase to a phase of genuine, consolidated competition.
The relationship between the development of the regulatory framework and the dynamics of the markets should be pursued using a forward-looking approach which favours competitive conditions, ensuring the rapid distribution of innovative services, in order to provide direction for the market and the future exclusive application of the procurement rules which are gradually replacing ex-ante rules.
The new model should introduce a transitional phase that fosters this transition to a telecommunications market that can be managed in the same way as any other economic sector in strict respect for competition rules.
This end can be achieved by a body of ex-ante rules harmonised at European level which are characterised by the fact that they are temporary and exceptional; in other words, the regulation that we are discussing and approving ex ante must provide for it to be abolished when a sufficient level of competition has been achieved.
These ex ante rules must be kept to a minimum as regards requirements and strength, in order to ensure that intervention is proportionate to the regulatory objectives.
In view of the flexibility of the new model, which very prudently extends the scope of intervention of the international regulatory authorities, the main thrust of the new regulatory framework must be the need to guarantee the supervisory power that the Commission has laid down in respect of the national authorities, in order to ensure correct interpretation of the new framework and thereby avoid distortion of the competitiveness of the European market between geographical areas.
In fact, with the absence of a centralised authority at European level making it possible to assess the ultimate consistency of national decisions with Community objectives, the new regulatory framework is in danger of not achieving its objectives.
To this end, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen, allow me to illustrate an amendment which I tabled together with 51 Members from different political groups precisely to Mr Paasilinna' s directive. Mr Paasilinna has worked very hard on his proposal on the framework directive on telecommunications.
This amendment seeks to make things clearer for operators, to avoid fragmentation in the application of Community law in the various Member States and to ensure the development of a genuine internal telecommunications market.
The adoption of my proposal would facilitate harmonisation, which can only be achieved by establishing unambiguously defined power allowing the European Commission to intervene to guarantee that the application of Community law is coherent with objectives and pursues the same goals in all the Member States.
Harmonisation and centralised power are the basis for the development of the pan-European telecommunications market.
This what the operators want, this is what the market wants, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen.
The market wants the development of a pan-European telecommunications market, whereas the short-sightedness of the national authorities often tends to slow down that process of development in this phase; that is why I tabled this amendment which, I hope, will be taken into due consideration by the Belgian Presidency, the Council, the Commission and this House.
Mr President, in the concluding part of this package of directives, the universal service and users' rights directive, for which I have been privileged to be rapporteur, are very much at the cutting edge of the whole package.
These are things that will really mean something to all consumers and users of electronic communication services.
The common position that we received from the Council was a major advance over the first reading text and I would like to thank the Council and Commission for accepting so many of Parliament's ideas and suggestions.
The new text has been substantially restructured and clarified which is important for effective transposal in Member States.
As part of that restructuring, the aspects of market intervention contained in this directive - and this is very strong market intervention at a retail price level - are clearly set out.
It is worth reminding all of us in this House that these are very much seen as transitional measures towards a fully open market in which competition rules will reign supreme.
That is the direction we want to move in.
I would like to pick up on some further enhancements that we have made as a result of the second reading.
I would like to thank the Council for working so closely with us and also to thank my colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who worked very closely with me in making suggestions.
I hope that they will be pleased with the results that we have achieved.
It is worth reminding ourselves that the whole essence of this universal service directive is to ensure that a core service is available to both able-bodied and disabled consumers across the single market, and also that the users' rights provisions must ensure that consumers have a right to clear contract terms, to comprehensive transparent pricing information and also a guarantee of other important services.
The changes that we have particularly focused on at second reading concern some further important enhancements to the provision for disabled users.
I am pleased to say that at the common position stage, we have a clear indication in a separate article about the importance of Member States providing for disabled users on a wide range of services, in particular ensuring that disabled users have the sort of choice and range of services that all other consumers expect.
Those are broad-ranging provisions that will develop as services expand.
The new area - that I am pleased we have introduced, and I would like to thank the Council for accepting this - is to encourage the development of clear quality standards related to disabled user provision.
That is something that we have added in at this stage because it seemed to us that it was all very well having some common provisions but unless we have a way of monitoring those and making sure that those evolve with the rest of the range of services involved, then things might just stand still.
We will not see disabled users being able to take advantage of new technology and new services in the way we would like them to.
This is a very important provision which I am sure will have the support of all colleagues.
The second area that we focused on in second reading was to ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises also benefit from the sort of users' rights that are required for individual consumers.
In a rapidly developing world, we already know that small- and medium-sized enterprises are a key target for enhanced electronic communications.
We want SMEs to really buy into e-commerce, into the new possibilities afforded to them by enhanced electronic communications.
They do not necessarily have the negotiating power of larger companies and therefore provision is made for them.
In conclusion, I wish to talk about a third aspect which has involved us in a lot of tough negotiation with the Council, namely over "must carry" obligations which are included within this Directive.
These allow Member States to impose obligations to carry public service channels and channels of specific interest on electronic communication systems.
Many colleagues felt that there should be a specific extension of this to satellite and conditional access systems.
The Council and Commission have told us that this is already covered fully in the access and interconnection directive, but colleagues have not agreed with that.
When it comes to the compromise package that we will vote on I am prepared to recommend to colleagues that we do not support this area but on condition that the Commission assures us that it will continue to keep this under very close scrutiny when it comes to looking at the Television without Frontiers directive and also to encourage the fair access provisions.
If we do that, I am sure that we can move forward to approve the whole package in what will be a major advance for the European economy and for Europe's competitiveness.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, in turn, to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for the work they have carried out in tandem with the presidency, in the search for a common platform on the basis of which we can reach agreement. This will allow us to take a reasonably prompt decision at long last, thus promoting the development of the entire telecom sector, and hence the development of the internal market.
I should also like to include the Commission in my thanks, which, together with the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, helped us in every way possible to reach a common position.
Allow me to outline the process we went through.
By process, I mean the procedure we followed to reach a package which is hopefully acceptable to Parliament.
You have to bear in mind that it is not easy to reconcile very different opinions, especially where Member States are concerned, in order to be able to produce a package at the end of it.
It is therefore in this context that the response, prepared by the presidency, to the recommendations for second reading concerning the directives which are now before us, can, in fact, be seen as a very balanced response, which in the view of the presidency might be acceptable.
Needless to say, a number of additional explanatory statements will have to be drafted, for it is impossible to include everything in the body of a directive, for example with regard to comments by the first rapporteur, Mrs Niebler.
In my view, it is indeed self-evident that a new policy requires information and involvement by, for example, Parliament, certainly when it comes to the use of the existing spectrum.
Despite this, I believe that this general principle will necessitate a clarification from the party applying it, namely the Commission, and I therefore also believe that explanatory statements by the Commission, not simply on this score but also on a number of other aspects, could prove useful, as a number of rapporteurs have already stated.
I believe my present role to be as follows: if you, as Parliament, could ensure that this common response by the Council' s presidency will be accepted by you, then this is what will actually happen in practice.
In other words, it is, in my opinion, very important to me that I can officially say to you that, if the Commission can indeed fully support our response and if Parliament can fully accept this common position of the Council, the Council will accept this accordingly.
In other words, it is a package, as was stated a moment ago.
A package entails the risk that if you tug at one string of the package, the whole thing may fall apart.
I am not saying this because I like saying this, but because political realism, with which we are all familiar, teaches us that, if we want to proceed swiftly, we need to adopt a common position which offers a huge amount of benefits.
Let us be honest, the Council' s flexibility towards Parliament has been exemplary, and contained a crucial message which was news to me, namely that the concept of the internal market is clearly being prioritised, even by the Council.
If you ask me, this is a very special new message.
It is in this context that the response of the Council' s presidency is being presented to you here, and I would not like to see my colleagues who have asked me to tell you this, revisiting their previous common position by running a risk and tugging at a string - and I am saying this in all candour - for I then believe that we would be at a complete loss as to know where we would end up in some future procedure or other.
In my view, we have now reached a point where we can make enormous headway, where the Council' s flexibility is, I dare say, rather exemplary, where we stimulate industry, where we contribute towards establishing the internal market and, via the internal market, create advantages for the consumer in all its diversity and with all its aspects, inter alia, via universal service, which we all set so much store by.
In other words, the Council gives you the formal pledge that, if the Commission supports this fully, and if you deem this package to be acceptable, the Council will actually implement this package without any exception.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the President-in-Office for his straight-forward language, for he is simply saying 'take it or leave it' .
But first and foremost, I admire his enormous perseverance, particularly in the light of the fact that we have arrived at this result.
I have to say that one important sentence in the speech of the President-in-Office stood out for me, namely the emphasis he placed on the internal market.
Unfortunately, we have had to work for too long with a Council that no longer appeared to embrace the concept of internal market.
Thanks to you, and I should say, thanks to many of my fellow MEPs here in the European Parliament, this has now been rectified, fortunately.
Needless to say, what is at issue is that we will face more competition, more players, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, etc., and there is nothing wrong with that, of course.
It is about striking a fine balance between rules on the one hand, and scope for further market development on the other.
We are in this transitional phase, and we must aim for normality as quickly as possible, away from ex ante, towards ex post, to put it in simple terms.
This means, therefore, that we must weigh up the whole set of rules and market interventions against the question as to whether this is really future-proof.
In my opinion, this will need to be one of the assessment criteria for the Commission, to constantly monitor whether we could proceed any faster towards what I refer to as a more normal market, ex post, in other words.
This also naturally leads on to the question: what will the consumer gain from this?
Will we receive more service and lower prices, in particular?
I am therefore pleased with the Council' s compromise proposal with regard to international roaming, and I would ask the Commissioner now: what steps will the Commission take in order to ensure that next year, during the summer holidays, we will not be inundated with complaints by our voters that it is still very expensive, that the cost of ringing from a landline to a mobile line is still too high.
These are the questions which are important to our citizens, and we must simply get results on this score.
Article 6 has been mentioned many times.
One can appreciate it at different levels.
I am pleased that the Council eventually took the bull by the horns and has stated that an internal market requires an independent role by the Commission.
We will continue to fight in the next round, because what you are now offering is too little in my opinion, and more is needed for an internal market, but also on that score, we must of course establish a certain kind of realism.
As I understand it, you have on that basis, in fact, interpreted the revision clause along the lines of 'move towards this single internal market' . Although you have not adopted Amendment No 36, you have done so at a practical level, and I am extremely grateful to you for this.
Finally, in my view, it is very important for us to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take with regard to digital television, so as to be able to lay down this one European standard as soon as possible.
This is about Europe' s future, about achieving the objective of Lisbon, and I believe that the Commission now also has a key role to play in this.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to touch on a few points in the short time I have available.
Mr Daems, you quite rightly pointed out that you have achieved a great deal in the Council and you also referred to the flexibility on the part of the Council that this involved.
You said that we have reached a good compromise.
I agree, and I think that many of my colleagues in my group will see it the same way.
It is an acceptable compromise.
There are a good many points on which further negotiation is needed.
Mr van Velzen hit the right note.
We will have to carry on negotiating and fighting to achieve a common internal market, because this is just one step and further work will be needed.
I believe that we in this House have one particular problem with this, and I have already heard a lot of people saying that it is difficult to have an informal trialogue as part of the second reading.
That requires a great deal of work and needs a huge investment of time given all the linguistic difficulties involved.
The whole package that we have before us is very complicated and needs a great deal of detailed work.
I think that we here in Parliament - and I am addressing this comment more to Parliament than to the Commission and the Council, although it indirectly affects them too of course - will have to make a greater investment in ensuring that we have whatever support is required to tackle such a complex task from a political point of view.
This will still not guarantee completion of the internal market.
It is right that in future the Commission will have more power and scope for action.
We have not used the word 'veto' .
That is probably very clever in political terms, but nevertheless it is something along those lines.
Nevertheless, by means of cooperation and consultation, the national regulatory authorities have the power to ensure that they can take appropriate action to influence their national markets.
There is an interesting definition of transnational markets.
Nevertheless, there are two further problems to which previous speakers have referred regarding the interoperability of standards.
I believe that the proposal does not go far enough in this respect.
I cannot understand our countries, why they are not in favour of interoperability in the area of standards.
I hope that something more will emerge in this field.
There is also still a great deal more to be achieved, via consultation with Parliament, as regards Parliament's participation concerning technical measures, and that includes, in particular, Mrs Niebler's report, for which I am shadow rapporteur.
I would simply venture to point out that Mr von Wogau will, I hope, be bringing forward an interesting report next year dealing more fully with the issue of Parliament's participation in such consultation processes.
Once more, we have until Wednesday to consider things further, and the Council and the Commission have a further opportunity to comment on these points.
I would be delighted if they would do that today.
Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner and Minister Daems.
Needless to say, I would naturally like to echo the words of praise expressed by my fellow MEPs for Mr Daems for all his efforts, to which Mrs Marcel has also greatly contributed, of course.
I will return to this in a moment, for I would also like to thank all my fellow MEPs, and especially the rapporteurs, for the pleasant and close working relationship so far.
For we must realise that what is before us was only possible thanks to the unanimity with which we in this Parliament have worked on this package.
It was, of course, abundantly clear to the Council that we were not going to yield an inch on essential points, especially on the score that we want one internal market where companies and consumers can benefit from the achievements of that one Europe.
And we can only achieve this in this way.
That is why it is crucial for us to agree on sound procedures that are ultimately monitored by the Commission.
What I miss in the Council' s package before us, is a clear stand on one European standard for digital interactive television, something which my group deeply regrets.
What is clear is that Europe does not seem to be learning from past experience.
Indeed, the overwhelming success of the mobile phone standard, from which consumers and companies have benefited and will do so in future, apparently failed to convince the Council enough to dare adopt a clear stand for once, namely in the field of digital television.
I would therefore ask Commissioner Liikaanen whether he, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mr Bangemann, would be prepared to do this and would like to promote the MHP platform. I would ask him at the same time to present a clear timeframe for this.
You will have understood by now that the package that is before us, this compromise, is acceptable to my group, and I only hope that Mr Daems is prepared to confirm this.
For then it will be implemented to the letter of the law in all Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to add its voice to the chorus of approval for everyone who has worked so long and hard to enable us to inch forward module by module.
All of the previous speakers, and above all you, Mr President-in-Office, were right in saying that we need to see all this in the light of the e-Europe initiative and of the internal market.
I would like to express my appreciation of your efforts not only personally, but also on behalf of my group, and I know that sometimes things get sorted out in the corridor, over a coffee or in other informal ways, over a sumptuous meal, for example.
I am sorry to tell you that I have a bit of stomach ache.
Not because I have spent so much time recently with lobbyists from one side or another over sumptuous dinners, but because depending on how you look at it, what is on offer is either too much or too little.
Too much in the sense mentioned by Mr van Velzen: 'eat up, that is all you are getting' , or too little in as much as when we reach compromises we have to accept proposals from the European Parliament being slightly amended, with small, nebulous changes involving little words like 'shall' and 'may' , which are then taken out, so that I suddenly feel that the amendments are not so minor any more.
I would like to briefly pick out one point, as I had an excellent exchange of information throughout the whole period of cooperation with Mr Harbour.
I would like to highlight just one point in the context of the Universal Service Directive, and that concerns consumers with disabilities.
We are not giving anything away here.
We live in a society which for reasons of solidarity and on economic grounds takes whatever steps need to be taken.
What is at stake here is that after many years we are giving some very important signals in this area, in order to give people with disabilities full access to the information and communication society as fully integrated consumers.
This political willingness, this political awareness and this political will would simply not have existed to the same extent 20 years ago.
I just wanted to mention that point to demonstrate to you all that time is a great healer.
However, that will certainly not cure my stomach ache.
I think that because of this stomach ache I would very gladly vote for this compromise, because, just like all of you, I am in favour of this internal market, and I would have been happier if it had already been established now, not at some point in the near future.
However, I too will close by mentioning the crucial points that other Members have already touched upon, and which I do not really think are solved in the compromise: interoperability, digital television, transmission obligations, and Article 6 of the framework directive.
Whether this fare is too much or too little, I think it takes us forward an inch or two.
I would be very interested to hear what else you may have to say to us, and then, even if it upsets my stomach, we would be happy to say 'yes' .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of my group and on behalf of Parliament for the tremendous work that they have done on their joint reports.
When we look at what the Council agreed upon in Lisbon and the new European initiative in particular and consider utilising the advantages which would accrue to Europe from the telecommunications revolution, we can see that there are many great opportunities out there to be grasped, but they require proper order, proper rules and proper regulation to ensure their use for the benefit of all.
At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century.
I suppose it is appropriate that a man of his origins should be doing that.
However, there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular, I want to deal with two aspects.
First there is the universal service aspect - the universal obligation that my colleague Malcolm Harbour was talking about.
I will take a slightly different perspective.
There is a risk relating to competition, with new regulations and new rules being brought in, that there will be cherry-picking of the most valuable markets, the most valuable layers, and suddenly larger urban areas will benefit whilst rural areas and peripheral areas will lose out.
On top of that, as already mentioned by Malcolm Harbour, there is the question of disabled access.
Companies and institutions must be forced to adapt their services to suit the needs of the consumers and particularly those consumers to whom the Internet and the telecommunications revolution could open the most possibilities of all by bringing them into the real world and bringing them into dialogue.
A third area that I wish to focus on is the risk of creating new illiterates or new gaps between those people who have computer and electronic skills and those who do not.
We have a population in Europe today that is ageing: we have a huge middle-aged and ageing population that may not have the training and the skills necessary to usefully adapt to computers, electronic commerce and so on.
What is happening in our schools and providing access in education is very important, but we must look to new ways of bringing in the middle-aged and the aged into the process.
Finally, the eSchola initiative is a great one.
I hope it can be extended to bring in older people and more peripheral areas.
My last point is that, when we speak about consumers, let us ensure that we speak about all of the consumers of Europe not just those in the largest urban areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, rapporteurs, I wholly support the objective underlying the raft of proposals we are about to vote on, that of supplementing the internal market with liberalisation and the introduction of a system of genuine competition in a sector such as the telecommunications sector which is vitally important for Europe, its economy and the well-being of its citizens.
However, I feel that no one, including the Commission, should be under any illusion that this raft of proposals, although a substantial step in the right direction, might represent a positive, definitive solution.
I do not feel this will be the case; indeed, the fate of the regulation on unbundling the local loop, despite its almost unanimous adoption, and the difficulties encountered in its implementation bear witness to this.
An underlying contradiction still remains in many Member States, specifically in those where publicly controlled telecommunications companies are still very influential and where, as a result, the State finds itself acting as both player and referee at the same time.
There is a great conflict of interests within most public administrations which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest barriers to the process of liberalising the telecommunications sector.
In order to alleviate the negative effects of the present imbalances in the different national markets, it might be appropriate to confer upon the Commission greater power to monitor and guide the national regulatory authorities, and to create mechanisms for cooperation and coordination between the national authorities.
That is why the Italian Radicals will support Mr Brunetta' s amendment.
Although not the final solution, it could be an appropriate path to take.
If we want an open, competitive, effective telecommunications market, we need to fulfil an essential requirement, and that is to reduce the States' power as managers in the telecommunications sector. The State and the administrations must play a single role: the role they need to play of regulators.
Playing two roles, being both players and referees at the same time, slows everything down and places the success of the liberalisation process in jeopardy.
Mr President, the importance of the package as a whole is clear, both for a major European industry and for its customers and users.
But are we moving fast enough to keep up with a changing market?
I would like to congratulate colleagues, especially the PPE-ED team, for getting to this point where much of Parliament's position has been taken on board in the Council text.
I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue, not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly, has been accepted.
This gives some comfort to operators and provides a more balanced situation.
I also welcome moves improving Article 6 of that directive so as to achieve a more even regulatory framework across Member States through the requirement for cooperation and coordination between NRAs and the Commission.
Personally, I prefer the voluntary approach to adopting common standards in digital television technology rather than seeking to impose one solution.
I say, let the market provide the answer.
The package, as now formulated, seems a big improvement on the original proposal but we are still looking for consumers' concern about levels of competition and service to be addressed through faster transition to a true internal market governed by general competition rules.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for the cooperative and pragmatic way in which he has worked on the universal services directive.
In particular, his efforts to achieve a consensus have led to the Socialist Group's amendments - both to strengthen the 'must carry' provisions and to give stronger rights of access to disabled users - being carried in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The fast pace of technological change in the telecoms sector means that legislation must keep up with the pace of developments.
But it must reflect growing expectations of users and consumers for a minimum set of services at an affordable price, guaranteeing access for all.
The telecoms revolution has created a rise in consumer expectations.
It is our job to respond and ensure that our legislative framework in the EU can deliver competition and consumer benefits.
Consumers, for example, have not benefited from the existence of multiple competitors in the mobile phone market.
Tariffs have not fallen in line with lower costs of running networks, now prompting in the UK an Oftel inquiry and a European Commission investigation.
This directive must ensure genuine universal access and extend to all users, especially those with special social needs, those on low incomes and those with disabilities.
The disabled will be excluded from the opportunities if there are not sufficient guarantees of access across Europe to public payphones, directory services and electronic programme options.
