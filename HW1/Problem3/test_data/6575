The resolution does not legitimise any intervention or any armed attack upon a foreign state.
As for the crucial issue here, namely the interventions and follow-up provisions where policing and the law are concerned, we are being faced with a demand to implement the most far-reaching infringements of legal rights we have seen in the history of the EU, and they are to take place almost overnight without any preparation.
I would thank the architects of the summit. It has been an eye-opener.
Mr President, we approve the approach of the informal Ghent Council, which reaffirmed its solidarity with the United States, and confirmed and strengthened the implementation of an action plan containing 79 measures to combat terrorism.
On this issue, I can only reiterate what I said on 3 October 2001 in this Chamber, when I called on the Council to give priority, from now on, to security, to review the former strategies that have become inappropriate, to recognise that the controls do not restrict freedom of movement, that they restrict criminals and protect the freedom of our citizens.
At the time, I called for a review of the disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which demands the systematic abolition of controls on third country nationals, when crossing the internal borders of the European Union.
In response, Mr Michel told me that my ideas - and I quote 'would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms' .
In my view, this unjustified accusation - which I naturally refute - illustrates the reservations and the obstacles we can encounter in our fight against terrorism.
Fortunately, the Council appears to have overcome these obstacles, at least partly, since in the road map published by the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, there is a discreet proposal for the Council to study 'arrangements for coordinated recourse [...] to Article 2(2)' of the Schengen Convention.
So, ladies and gentlemen, what is Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention?
It is, as you may have guessed, the safeguard clause that my friends and I defended so staunchly, which will be so useful in the future and which enables internal border controls to be re-introduced.
Mentalities are now changing, so all is not lost.
Obviously, we must differentiate between withdrawing freedoms and controls, particularly at borders, which, within the framework of our democratic values, seek to preserve our freedoms.
This distinction is essential.
I hope, and I want to believe, Mr President, that the Council understands this.
Mr President, we evidently need major disasters to illustrate how much a too fragmented Europe is still failing in its ability to shoulder responsibility.
The coalition against terrorism will not function properly if the central player, the United States, is surrounded by only fifteen satellites.
Unfortunately, the European Union has in certain ways still not outgrown the satellite stage.
That particularly applies to the second and third pillars, which are precisely pertinent when we consider international terrorism.
Wherever matters are regulated well at community level (the first pillar), things are much better.
In other words: Europe is good at paying, but not good at making decisions.
That was evident in Bosnia and is now again evident in the fight against international terrorism.
The Union is often not very visible, and I am also delighted that Mr Verhofstadt has explained how seriously he has taken the irregularities that have taken place on this score in Ghent.
That is why we are happy to encourage the Council to give Europe a clear profile in terms of foreign and security policy as soon as possible.
Moreover, the willingness to make the necessary Community changes in terms of justice and internal affairs is also leaving something to be desired.
I am pleased to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that there is wide agreement among the Heads of Government about the fact that measures must be taken.
Reprehensible, however, are the improper objections which are being lodged by some Ministers for Justice, for example, the Minister in the Netherlands, about Europe' s interference in major issues at national political level, such as, in respect of, the policy of tolerance with regard to drugs, the policy on euthanasia and such like.
That is not at issue at all.
Mr Vitorino, too, has made it abundantly clear that he is closely monitoring subsidiarity on this score.
If the aim of the Ministers is to protect their own official or ministerial scope, then the public will not be served by that.
I would therefore like to warmly congratulate the Council with its statement that our policy to the outside world, also in the framework of globalisation, must be ensconced in ethical, social and ecological standards and must take account of Third World interests.
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to make a few observations on three external points, starting with the Middle East.
We have experienced the murder of Israel' s Minister for Tourism as a new low.
Subsequently, Israel invaded the autonomous Palestinian regions, which was, of course, an unacceptable violation.
We are all justified in asking for immediate withdrawal.
At the same time, the spokesmen for Mr Sharon, on the one hand, and the Palestinian Authority, on the other, mete out relentless and draining rhetoric of black and white thinking.
The others are 100% responsible, they are to blame for everything.
The representative of Mr Sharon has almost stated that the tanks which enter the Palestinian regions are a kind of peace dove.
Conversely, Hanan Ashrawi lays all the blame with Israel.
Neither of them leave room for concern or take any steps towards bringing the conflict to an end.
It appears that, for the time being, there is no chance of returning to the Oslo Agreements or the Mitchell report which is before us.
Needless to say, the neighbouring states play their part too. Countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi-Arabia are all very important players who have often used the Palestinian issue to their advantage to keep enemies out, but not to do anything of any consequence at home.
There is now scope for Europe, the Commission and the Council, in tandem with the US, to take a very unusual new step and simply to combine our economic and diplomatic power, and our UN responsibility and military power and to say: we are tabling a firm, fresh peace proposal.
For we as the world community, in the light of 11 September, can no longer afford to be dragged down in this continual downward spiral.
As we are well placed in Europe, we can also use intense diplomacy to persuade the countries in the Middle East to take part in the peace accord.
We have money.
We have trade.
We have the UN.
We have resources in that region.
We can be of real significance there.
In this respect, my suggestion would be to adopt a reasonably hard-handed approach towards both parties, for we need to table such a proposal now.
That is my first plea.
My second plea concerns Afghanistan.
The Socialist Group gives the UN resolution, which is very clear, its 100% backing.
The aim of the resolution is to trace both the perpetrators and the sponsors, as well as the countries harbouring them, and to bring them to justice, but also to ensure that we come out alive.
The EU has no military presence in Afghanistan.
That falls within the remit of other bodies: the UN and NATO.
However, we are the body that has the diplomatic power to unite the surrounding countries in that region that play a key role, namely India, Pakistan and Iran, so that they, together with us and the US, give the different parties in Afghanistan plenty of room.
Afghanistan' s key problem is that we will not reach a solution with the Northern Alliance, nor with anyone else.
History has taught us that.
What we need is a conference, wherever that may be in the region, involving the different forces - and I particularly refer to the social forces, such as the women' s organisations - which, together, will shape a new broad government, in exile and only as a first step, if necessary.
However, we must take that political direction.
It is the only way to get rid of the Taliban.
It is the only way to catch Bin Laden.
Prime Minister, your presidency, which was already reasonably complex, is certainly being tested by the attacks in the United States.
Do not, therefore, take any notice of people who say that a meeting of three of your colleagues immediately before the summit was a put-down.
Such a meeting is, of course, never pleasant for a presidency, but it proves at the same time how desperately we need a European framework within which external security, conflict prevention, our diplomacy, but also our internal security, legal and police cooperation can be regulated.
That is important for small Member States such as ours.
However, it is apparently difficult for everyone to understand that if one considers the Union after 11 September, it is, in fact, only small EU Member States that have taken any individual action.
You did not get sidetracked in Ghent.
I would ask you to ensure that this convention - the mere fact that we now have an agreement on this is already quite an achievement for the presidency - is given the appropriate assignments in Laeken.
I should like to say this about Afghanistan: humanitarian aid is only possible if the Taliban regime is removed from power and unfortunately, we need war for this.
And finally, thousands of people were able to protest in Ghent without any incidents. It has not always been like that.
In my opinion, we should draw attention to this for a change.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the decision of the Council at Ghent to give immediate humanitarian aid totalling EUR 320 million is unusually welcome.
The same applies to European solidarity in the campaign against international terrorism.
The next thing to do is to achieve a speedy halt to the fighting, above all to protect the population of Afghanistan.
The world is still in shock from the attacks on New York and Washington.
Two things strike me as being of particular importance, quite independently of the steps taken to date.
The first is the complete explanation of the background to these crimes and the publication of the results.
Without these, there is the risk that the attacks will give rise to legends which could poison many people's minds.
This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism.
What strikes me, secondly, is that the future reconstruction of Afghanistan presupposes, importantly, knowledge of the events in that country over the past twenty-five years.
As we know relatively little about this period, I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country.
We could perhaps thereby take the first step towards a peaceful solution and a forward-looking outlook for Afghanistan.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become clear, particularly in these last weeks and months, that common action by the Member States of the European Union as the European Union brings added value for every one of the EU's members.
When I see, for example, that the troika not only made a very successful contribution to the creation of the coalition against terror in the Middle East but is also responsible for this happening at all, this is important evidence for the truth of this.
So I regret all the more that individual Member States have an ever-increasing tendency towards bilateralism.
For example, the troika was in Washington at the same time as the President of France, the German Foreign Minister, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
I do not find that the right way to go about presenting a clear picture of the European Union as a whole.
I also think that the meeting of the three Heads of Government in the run-up to the summit can only give rise to suspicions that we are moving towards an outcome managed from the top downwards.
All the European Union's Member States are basically equal.
The European Union can only exist as it does now in so far as competencies reside in the supranational institutions and the smaller countries do not feel that they are controlled by the larger ones.
We will get into serious difficulties if this principle is not accepted.
Let me raise another point. As the Chairman of my group has already observed, there is the danger that, in the realm of internal security, good decisions by the Council will be ground down in the mills of national bureaucracies.
I would like to suggest that the Belgian Presidency, which has done such excellent work in the past few weeks, should take a look at the Treaty of Amsterdam and tell the Council that, if the Council of Ministers so decides, decisions on legal and home affairs policy may be reached by majority voting - a legal possibility provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam - so that we can come to the necessary decisions at a European level and can meet the challenge of combating terrorism, a phenomenon that knows no frontiers.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please permit me one more observation and a request. I wish to put on the record my thanks to you that the Convention will be possible.
If possible, though, Laeken should be founded on a procedure that offers the possibility of the Convention coming up with a unitary proposal.
It must be a Convention which can serve as the basis for the consultation of Heads of State and Government.
There is still a lot of concern about it, and I ask you to bear that in mind.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the Ghent Council are without a doubt positive and encouraging, not least - although not exclusively - in terms of the fight against terrorism.
The Convention' s decision is extremely important and mention must be made of the Belgian Presidency' s firm undertaking to achieve these results.
However, in a world political and economic climate which is changing rapidly in the wake of the tragedy of 11 September, and in the face of the new demands from democratic States - primarily for terrorism to be combated, of course, but also for an area of peace and respect for human rights to be created in Asia and the Middle East and, moreover, for economic growth and employment to be boosted - we would like to make quite clear the need for a better coordinated European Union initiative which can speed up the institutional reforms, which are still far from completion, and thus empower the European Union to enter the field as a world political entity, an initiative which is able, that is, to speak with a single voice in Washington and Islamabad alike, as President Prodi advocated.
To give some concrete examples rather than limiting myself to describing vague needs, we would point out the urgency, in particular, for an incisive, coordinated action from the Commission and the High Representative laying the foundations for an - economic and social as well as political - agreement which will lead to the creation of a reunified, coherent, manageable State of Palestine while fully safeguarding the security of the State of Israel, together with an explicit international guarantee, as Mr Van den Berg said just now.
Secondly, we would point out the urgent need for a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to reach long-term agreements with the oil-producing countries in the Middle East in order to secure the continuity of oil supplies and the stability of oil prices in Europe with a guarantee in euro.
This would be a huge political boost to consolidation of peace in that area.
Thirdly, we feel there should be a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to create the conditions for revitalising economic growth and employment in the Union, both by promoting forms of open coordination in the research and development and training sectors, thus setting the Lisbon project in motion, and by transparently inviting the Central Bank to join this effort, using the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy rightly recommended at Ghent, and further reducing interest rates.
After that, Mr President, everyone will be able to assume their responsibilities transparently, in full respect for the independence of the Central Bank.
Mr President, there are two messages coming from this House today.
Firstly, the rather modest compromise resolution drafted by an all-party group which, if I were a member of the forces serving currently in Afghanistan - and I think particularly of the British forces - would give me very scant comfort.
The other message comes from the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, and deals with a rather more robust approach to the current operations in that area and also his more forward thinking approach towards the future of Afghanistan.
Of course this House must have compromise resolutions and must, so far as possible, be united.
Europe must not act at the level of the lowest common denominator but accept that in politics, as in war, there must be room for leadership.
Today, our resolution does not reflect the sort of leadership which is available for the people of Afghanistan through their exiled king.
Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Peshawar today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking - including the moderate Taliban - the restoration of democracy in that country.
I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on 21 September and whom Mr Solana met only last weekend, does have a role in the future of Afghanistan.
He introduced democracy to that country in 1964: free elections, a free media, universities, hospitals; he introduced women into politics.
It is that hope of the restoration of democracy in Afghanistan and the ending of international terrorism which must be the focus of our attention.
Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the information from the President-in-Office of the Council on the progress made in relation to measures for combating terrorism and the arrest warrant.
Mr President, justice is a key word on the European and international stages following 11 September.
The creation of a European area of justice is the best contribution the Union could offer at this time.
We are not talking about a European criminal code; that is not what we want.
Neither are we talking about establishing emergency laws.
We are talking about something more fundamental: mutual trust between Member States and between their legitimate judicial systems.
Mr Cappato, I sincerely believe that the proposals which the Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, produced calmly and at the request of this House, and which are of the high quality we normally expect from the Commissioner, deserve our support and must be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
In no way will they violate the freedom and rights of the citizens.
On the contrary, they protect them, making justice more efficient and putting judicial cooperation in the hands of judges, and not of governments, within the European Union.
I am grateful for the information on the elimination of double incrimination, because - as the Chairman of my group, Mr BarÃ³n, said - this House feels that the effort we make to keep up with circumstances is not always reflected in the Council.
We would also be grateful for more precise information on the debates in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and for broader involvement by Parliament.
In this respect, given the speeding up of certain procedures, I wonder, Mr President, if this is not the moment to move cooperation in the criminal field to the first pillar.
I am slightly more sceptical about what has been said about progress on immigration and asylum in the Union.
I believe that not even the greatest will in the world would allow a positive assessment of this issue at Laeken.
There is just one proposal approved by the Council which may be of use today.
Why do we not implement the measures laid down in that one measure adopted in the Directive on the temporary protection of displaced persons?
It seems to me that the situation of the borders of Afghanistan and support for the refugees and the neighbouring countries, issues which the European Union has to deal with, provide us with a perfect opportunity to test this directive, to test the solidarity between the Member States in the European Refugee Fund and to implement what is laid down in it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, there is no doubt that Europe must play an increasingly influential role in securing world peace.
Little has been achieved thus far and more needs to be done, and here I endorse what President Prodi said regarding the common foreign and security policy.
In the fight against terrorism, a great deal has already been done. Europe has decided to take action but the political support and military support too from many of the States of the Union - Italy announced yesterday the amount of troops and resources it is making available for anti-terrorist actions - will not alone suffice: the crisis in the Middle East needs to be defused.
It may be that what has been termed the Marshall Plan for Palestine has not received enough attention - although it was certainly discussed at the Council. The population of Palestine has a per capita income of USD 800 per year, whereas the per capita income of the Israeli people is USD 18 000 per year.
There is therefore a substantial difference and I feel that capital and enterprise investments are a way of ensuring lasting peace.
The economic growth of the Palestinian people, who must have a State, will certainly contribute to calming a volatile situation.
We will never win the war against terrorism if we do not first resolve the Middle East question.
I feel that the course embarked upon by the Commission and the Council is the right one.
We are also concerned - as President Prodi himself said - by the economic crisis.
I regret to say that the United States has had to invest USD 150 billion to revitalise the economy.
Europe appears to be concerned but is not doing enough, in our opinion, to support the economy and enterprise: this is not a question of State aid, it is a question of enabling many firms to stay in business, of preventing redundancies, particularly in the airlines sector.
In the case of Alitalia, there is talk of around 5000 redundancies but all the airlines have been affected.
From this point of view, if we are to safeguard employment and make it possible for a large number of firms to stay in business and grow, I feel that Europe, the Council and the Commission must increase their efforts even more.
Mr President, I very much welcome the Belgian Presidency's use of the summit as an opportunity to put euro notes and coins at the top of the agenda.
Monetary union is, after all, not only for large businesses but also for every citizen.
I very much hope that this will be taken as a positive signal.
I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission's proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction.
We, the European Parliament, will, no doubt, also take this step in the next plenary session.
The current situation as regards employment and the economy, that is, the state of the labour market, as well as consumer confidence, should surely be seen in a very critical light.
I welcome the Commission's report to the Council on the appraisal of the economic consequences of the terrible events of 11 September.
It is, I believe, important that we agree on a Community-wide approach.
Not everywhere is there evidence of one.
I believe that, in this situation, we must, now as in the past, stick with structural reforms and the advances they have achieved, particularly in the financial markets but also in the markets for goods and services and that we at the same time must not only underline the need for sound finances in the European Union and adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, but should also make use of the flexibility for which this Pact provides, for we need more investments in the European Union.
Now as before, the Lisbon way is the right one, relying as it does on growth that is supported by investment and creates jobs and, above all, on mutual support in economic, employment and social policy.
Only when all the macro-economic actors have played their parts can our policy in the European Union be successful.
In these times of crisis we must hold fast to this, and the European Investment Bank, too, must be strengthened even more than previously in its task of helping public investments towards breakthroughs in the area of infrastructure.
By this I mean trans-frontier infrastructure measures in the EU itself, but also such as will connect our European Union with the states of Central and Eastern Europe.
Mr President, the fight against terrorism is clearly the current major concern of the European citizens and it therefore also has to be the main priority of our political action.
Mr President, I am talking about terrorism in all its forms, because there is no legal or moral basis for distinguishing between forms of terrorism, just as there is no such thing as a good murder or a bad murder.
In this respect, the action plan against terrorism, which the Belgian Presidency and the Commission are promoting vigorously, includes measures which we had argued for before 11 September.
In fact we must remember that the proposals in this area presented by the Commission are not the result of improvisation, but they conform to a mandate received at the European Council in Tampere, whose implementation had suffered considerable delay, which was condemned by the European Parliament on several occasions.
We are still awaiting the final approval of the Regulation on the freezing of assets, incorporating, it is true, as the European Parliament argued for, a list of European terrorist organisations, taking into account the financial operative support and propaganda framework of the terrorists.
I therefore believe that we must welcome the Council' s commitment to approve a package of measures at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December.
I am sure that the European Parliament will rise to the occasion and approve its consultative opinion before that.
Mr President, I will end by saying that none of these instruments being provided to the judicial administration of the Member States imply the least restriction of the civil liberties of European citizens, but quite the opposite: they provide additional means for protecting the freedom which those who use terrorism to try to impose their ideas take away from the individual.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the impression which our citizens have gleaned from the European Council of Ghent is rather chaotic: a closed down city, three major countries making prior arrangements, an angry Belgian President, disparate final declarations by Heads of Government and, to finish off, an angry Commission President.
At a time when unity of action is vital, Europe is divided.
I should like to make three observations.
The United Kingdom, Germany and France have lent their full support to the United States. In fact, the UK is even granting active military support.
I welcome this.
Other EU countries that are also members of NATO are providing more passive support.
The EU countries that are not NATO members lend political support via diplomatic channels.
These are three different kinds of support without any clear interrelation for the citizen.
And then the EU President asked for an evaluation.
So you, in fact, put a seed of doubt into our minds as to whether that support would last.
Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the United States is seeking support from countries outside the European Union, including Canada, Australia and the Pacific Association.
I would call for more coordination in Europe' s support for the actions against terrorism in the coming months, so that the image of division will soon be one of the past.
Secondly, I should like to comment on cooperation in the field of internal security.
Commissioner Vitorino has tabled the proposals extremely promptly, and these include one about a European regulation against money laundering, one concerning arrest warrants and one harmonising penalties.
In fact, those proposals had already partly been tabled.
Last week, the Council of Ministers for Internal Affairs failed to reach agreement. That was also the case for the European Council in Ghent.
Why did the Heads of Government fail to make those executive decisions?
Surely it is hardly justifiable vis-Ã -vis the citizens for the EU to be undecided about anti-terrorism measures at home.
Then there is the convention, which receives my support, because the Council has adopted the wish of the European Parliament and my group for a convention with a broad parliamentary basis.
We are less happy about the proposal to ask the convention to supply options.
That is the type of question you might ask a consultancy bureau, but not a parliamentary body.
Let the convention determine its own working method and submit its own proposals.
That worked for the Charter and, in my opinion, will work again now.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the informal summit in Ghent has shown two positive aspects, namely fundamental agreement on a Convention to prepare a constitutional treaty and the final technical adjustments to the euro.
Under other circumstances, without the shadow cast by terrorism, this would be an occasion for looking optimistically towards Europe's future.
We are, however, concerned with a situation in which we ask ourselves whether, with the euro, Europe's capacity for integration has already been exhausted.
A common currency, a common foreign policy and a common defence policy would give the EU that credibility in the eyes of its citizens and create that identification with it, whose absence we often regret.
It has been, above all, in respect of foreign and security policy, that the Ghent Summit has brought us down to earth.
Bilateralism, if you want to call it that, or undeclared intensified cooperation, laid bare the weaknesses that still handicap the European Union's effectiveness vis-Ã -vis the rest of the world.
Reviewing the international analyses following the Ghent meeting shows how the shock at the terrorist attacks on the USA has revealed the divisiveness within the European Union.
It is not only a reaction to the behaviour of the USA, which prefers to deal and negotiate with governments direct, but also the consequence of the inherent military weakness of the European security and defence policy, in which there is a yawning gulf between ambition and reality.
It is no secret that there are doubts as to whether the training of the European Rapid Reaction Force of 60 000 men is actually going to be completed by the 2003 deadline.
The European Union needs an energy boost, not only to unite it more closely with its citizens but, above all, in order that it might fully meet its responsibilities within Europe itself and as a partner of the USA.
The process of enlargement must be seen from this point of view, as must the post-Nice order, involving a Convention which should not be content to fritter away its time but, as the European Parliament has recommended, should work out a coherent basis for a decision on a constitutional treaty.
Mr President, the European Council confirmed and reinforced Europe' s decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States to combat terrorism and ensure internal security, and also its commitment to avoiding a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan.
After 11 September, the political geography of the world has changed radically.
However, the Shanghai Summit will be more important than the restricted summit at Ghent.
What is the European Union' s role?
Is a single foreign and security policy possible?
Will we be able to reinvigorate the Mediterranean initiative and work for peace in the Middle East?
In reality, good intentions are often contradicted by the behaviour of certain governments, who delay integration and endeavour to take away the political influence of a Convention which should be developing the method and objectives.
This is what we expect from Laeken and from an Intergovernmental Conference which needs to reform the Union before the European elections.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above all the constitutional issues, the present situation sees Europeans being asked the question: What is your capacity to act?
Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not?
To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such.
Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived. They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together.
Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act - they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally.
So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent.
Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works.
Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that.
We need capacity to act as a Community.
So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force.
Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world.
That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed.
In this respect, the Community must prove its strength.
We also, however, need an instrument at home.
We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers.
Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries.
Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the various interlocutors and groups for their observations.
I think that, except for two or three speeches, a predominantly positive evaluation has been made of the outcome of Ghent.
Such a positive evaluation from the various groups encourages us, of course, to continue our hard work in the coming weeks, for we have another important summit coming up, namely the Summit of Laeken.
I would also like to respond, as follows, to a few oblique remarks that have been made about the cooperation between myself and Mr Romano Prodi: our cooperation is excellent.
In fact, we have just decided to come to the next press conference on a tandem, so as to rule out any further misunderstandings.
Since we both are accomplished cyclists, this will undoubtedly be appreciated by Parliament.
I should in any event like to react to three points.
First of all, a few times, the question has been asked: so where exactly is the Union' s foreign policy now?
I think that Mr Romano Prodi has already entered into more detail on this and has, actually, made very valid points.
Last time we had an international crisis, the Gulf War, Europe had fifteen different opinions on the stance the Union should adopt.
Each Member State had its own opinion on the matter.
In today' s international crisis, we have, for the first time, displayed a united front on two occasions, on 21 September and last Friday in Ghent, in a matter which is, actually, very complex.
Firstly, to what does the stance of the fifteen Member States regarding the attacks in Washington and New York bear witness?
A joint vision and a joint approach.
Secondly, what is the stance now after 7 October?
After all, things changed on 7 October, since the reaction from the United States and the international coalition.
Again, we have a joint stance.
It is important in my view to underline this, for there was a time in the European Union when this was different.
Mr Romano Prodi reminded us that each time there was an international conflict, there was not one stance, but fifteen stances within the Council.
Now this no longer holds true.
However much I am of the personal view - which I share with many of you - that we should take things further still, for example that, certainly in the field of European defence, we should have made much more progress by now, I still believe that we should underline this positive development.
At long last, little by little, piece by piece, a common foreign policy of the European Union is forming, something which, say fifteen years ago, was almost unthinkable.
From that point of view, I believe, in fact, that Mr Van den Berg is more than right in emphasising the role we are to play now.
For our role is different from that of the United States.
The EU' s role is mainly one of political, logistical support, and diplomatic action to be undertaken.
He is right in highlighting the importance of the mandate which we have received from the Council with regard to the Middle East.
We, that is, Mr Romano Prodi, Mr Javier Solana and myself, are considering a date when we could undertake this important mission. Possibly the third week of November.
For I believe that it is up to the European Union, especially the European Union, to take an initiative in this respect.
However, we must be realistic and not foster any illusions.
We cannot solve matters with just one visit - there have been many already - but perhaps by gaining momentum in one particular area, this could ultimately lead to an initiative.
The second point I would like to make relates to what several Members have said and particularly concerns Mr Poettering' s comments.
Mr Poettering said that the Presidency was doing a good job.
He mentions the work on the single European arrest and extradition warrant by the ministers of the specialised Councils, amongst others.
But when will this come about?
It is obvious.
This very specific task was given to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and they must finalise the practical details before 6 and 7 December 2001.
Mr Poettering, I have already said - not today, not on 19 October but on 21 September - on behalf of the European Council, that the specialised ministers were given the task of finalising the details.
The only thing that I have done, with the help of the Commission and all the Member States of the European Union and the European Council, is to go further at the Ghent Council and to obtain approval of the principle of abolishing the double criminality system.
(NL) At the most recent Council, we at least managed to reach agreement on this, for that is the most important point.
It is easy to proclaim that a European mandate must be obtained, also for extradition.
The most important point had not yet been reached, namely an agreement on the principle of the abolition of dual criminality, not only for terrorist acts but also for other serious crimes.
We must indeed challenge a reductionist attempt to render the provision only applicable to terrorist acts.
That was not the conclusion reached in Tampere.
The Tampere conclusions were in favour of broadening the scope, in other words for other, serious crimes to fall within its scope.
I am therefore personally optimistic with regard to 6 and 7 December. I am addressing Mr Poettering and also Mr Cox, in particular.
But have no fear, if the Ministers for Internal Affairs and Justice fail to come up with the goods, then I will be taking the dossier to the European Council of Laeken on 15 December where the Heads of State and Government will decide.
However, I am convinced that the Ministers for Justice will not let things get so far that ultimately, the Heads of Government will have to solve a technical problem which is predominantly concerned with modality.
Finally, I also should like to briefly comment on the third point, namely the Union' s future.
I believe that we are all agreed that 11 September has shown that a more integrated, more progressive Union is needed, a Union with greater ability to act, which has better instruments at its disposal, and which - certainly as far as the foreign and defence policy is concerned - has greater powers.
To pave the way for this is exactly the intention of the Laeken Declaration.
Therefore, I can already give very concrete answers to the generally positive evaluation based on that convention.
The convention is a fact.
Yes, Mr Poettering, the presidency is a limited presidency in line with the request of all groups, comprising five people including the president of the convention.
Yes, the Member States and MEPs are proportionately represented, although exact numbers will need to be discussed in due course.
Yes, civil society is involved, not by setting up a new body but by creating a network around the convention whereby groups in society can refer to the convention and whereby, conversely, the convention can also seek advice from European affairs study centres, trade unions, any other organisations which exist in our society, as well as civil society.
A flexible network around the convention therefore seems preferable to the organisation of a special forum.
Finally, I should like to respond to the most fundamental question which has been repeatedly raised here. Indeed, it is related to that text.
If that text originates from that convention, how will the Council then relate to it?
Will it be considered a report that can be dismissed and need not be taken into consideration?
A discussion has therefore arisen as to the question of whether that is now a consensus text or a text providing options.
The answer is very simple.
That will, at any rate, be my reply in a few weeks' time when we are all meeting in Laeken.
If everyone is agreed, then we will have a consensus text. In other words, it will then be quite clear that this is an important - if not the most important - contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.
If no consensus is reached at the convention, then I obviously believe that options should be given, not in a neutral manner, but in such a way that the majority and minority options are clearly indicated, as well as the individual option of one member of the convention, if applicable.
It was also my intention to talk this over with the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and the two draftsmen of opinion on the future of Europe.
I cannot see the sense of unleashing a holy war among ourselves as to the exact significance of that text.
If consensus is reached, then we have a consensus text.
If we cannot have a consensus text because we failed to reach consensus, options must be indicated, but not in a neutral manner, not in a way as if we were supplying a list without any significance. Instead, we should highlight the majority and minority options, in other words, the wishes and trends which originated at the convention and which have been brought forward.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few comments on this debate, which has revealed great unity, not just between Council and Commission but also between these institutions and Parliament.
I would just like to focus on a few issues which appear to have remained unresolved.
Firstly, the issue has been raised, starting with Chairman Poettering, of the amount of aid granted to refugees.
I would like to say that the immediate appropriation has been decided of EUR 315 million, but the problem is not now, at this time, I regret to say, financial, but the enormous practical difficulties of getting the aid to the people concerned.
We are working through the NGOs and many other organisations.
I would stress that, as things stand now, sufficient funds have been transferred in practical terms. When further funds are needed, then we will come back here to request them and discuss the matter together: the present problem is the difficulty of implementing these operations.
I will now turn to another debate, taken up by a number of speakers, including Mr Tajani and several others, who linked this major phenomenon of the world being divided into two parts to peace in Palestine.
This is an issue of fundamental importance, in which regard I would point out to Mr Tajani and the other speakers that what has been termed the 'reconstruction plan for Palestine' is something which is very much on our minds: I have discussed it many times with Mr Peres and we are well aware that we should concentrate on taking action in certain sectors such as water, energy, infrastructure and revitalising industry.
This is our duty and the Palestinian and Israeli citizens know that the Commission is focusing its efforts in that direction.
As soon as the political conditions allow, we will be here, requesting the necessary resources.
However, I believe that the knowledge that we are taking practical action and are all ready to work together is in itself conducive to peace.
Then, Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the decisions adopted in the field of justice and the fight against financial crime.
I agree with what he said, but we must be careful.
We have adopted decisions here: if we do not implement them we will lose all credibility.
Therefore, the ministers responsible must speed up the implementation of these decisions or else they will be taken again at the summit.
A further point related to the Convention.
A general agreement has been adopted on the board, the executive structure and so forth.
I would, however, like to focus on one point, touched upon by Prime Minister Verhofstadt, which is the duration of the Convention.
Parliament and the Commission have guided and supported the Convention' s creation: they must support its work and they must support its conclusion, and so the work must reach its conclusion before the start of the electoral campaign for the European elections.
This is a genuine deadline, not a theoretical one.
Many speakers have brought up the issue of the Community method in this debate.
Well then, on this matter I would simply like to borrow a vivid picture painted by Mr Duff. He said: "When the two planes crashed into the World Trade Centre they demolished more than the twin towers.
We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht."
This is, in my opinion, a correct, responsible, practical observation. Mr Duff has fully understood the political meaning of the Commission' s efforts to achieve unified Union action by applying the Community method, which is the only effective way of ensuring success.
A further point, mentioned by all the speakers, is the issue of the institutional reforms.
The Commission and Parliament are working on the practical aspects of this matter: we have argued and helped each other, and I think we are making progress - painstaking progress - in our joint work. We have not yet finished but we are working, so to speak, on the bricks and mortar, on the concrete facts.
At this point, although I do not wish to interfere with the internal organisation of the Council, I would point out that our reform will not be sufficiently effective if it is not accompanied by a reform of the Council' s working procedures.
(Applause)
My intention in saying this is not to interfere in other people' s business but to stress the need for effectiveness.
We need to bring all our work out into the open and achieve more transparency, accountability and democracy in our governance.
The Commission has already addressed this point in its White Paper and we and Parliament expect to debate it with the Council.
With regard to the economy, everyone has stressed the difficulty of implementing the Lisbon decisions.
However, this is an area in which there has been a vast difference between the general decisions taken and the implementation of the decisions in subsequent individual Councils, with regard to liberalisation and market reform, speeding up innovation, and projects ranging from the creation of the single air space to the establishing of the Community patent, areas in which we are still extremely behind schedule.
Our economy will only become dynamic if we rectify these shortcomings.
Lastly - and, in this respect, more great progress has been made - we have undertaken to support the introduction of the euro with the indispensable backup measures such as the single market in cross-border bank transfers.
We have committed ourselves to this and it is an absolutely crucial point.
Finally, one last point on the subject of the Convention.
I will go back to Mrs Maij-Weggen' s comment on the actual definition of the Convention: we cannot consider it to be a consultative body, as some have described it.
It cannot be a body which just gives advice and is then disbanded and no longer involved.
We are making the Convention as transparent as possible but also giving it as much democratic authority as possible, and we therefore expect it to produce major, incisive results.
I would add, moreover, that the presence of the Convention is a breath of fresh air amongst the closed doors of secretive diplomacy.
The air of democracy is nourished by the oxygen of transparency and accountability, and the Commission therefore fully supports the commencement of the Convention' s work so that dialogue will, at last, be opened between the institutions and between the institutions and the European citizens.
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
As you heard, during the last part of your speech there was a buzz of voices which made it difficult for all the Members who were listening attentively to your speech to hear properly.
I apologise for this.
Steps must be taken to avoid such disturbance once and for all.
As you and my fellow Members can see, all those who were not paying attention to your speech are continuing to chat in the corridors and will only sit down when the next President opens voting time.
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Mr President, the confusion in the House before voting time is in danger of becoming a moral issue.
It is a political issue and is the result of the way our work is organised, with the debates taking place separately from the votes.
Parliament is becoming a voting parlour, and this is the inevitable consequence.
If we want to avoid this confusion, then we must allow a 15-minute pause between the debate and the votes. That way there will be less people attending the debates and we will be able to become a voting parlour pure and simple and increasingly less a Parliament!
Thank you for your comment.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the deluge of e-mails which we are currently receiving, as a result of which my computer refuses to work and I can no longer locate the actual e-mails that I should like to read.
Could you see to it that something is done about this by the offices?
We will certainly take note of this.
VOTE
The Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
The Commission rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17.
Before the vote on Amendment No 17: GrÃ¶ner (PSE).
(DE) Mr President, we had reached a compromise with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and they are now departing from it.
So we too will not now abide by this compromise, and I call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment No 17.
Voting time will now be suspended and resumed after the formal sitting on the occasion of the visit of his Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
Mr President, I should like to mention that the Greens and the Liberals have kindly invited everyone to their joint meeting this afternoon to meet His Holiness, the DalaÃ¯ Lama, at 3 p.m. in Room 100 in WIC - that means everybody who was not included in the invitation of the PSE and the PPE-DE.
Welcome
I would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Mr Simeon Saxe-Coburg, who has taken a seat in the visitors' gallery. He is visiting the European institutions.
Prime Minister, on behalf of President Fontaine, welcome to the European Parliament. I hope that the accession of your country, which we hope will happen as soon as possible, will lead to the consolidation of the democratic process which has been set in motion and enable the Bulgarian people to take its rightful place in the Community of the peoples of the European Union.
(Applause)

Hautala report (A5-0358/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, as a Member of the joint EU-Bulgaria Parliamentary Committee, I too would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Bulgaria.
I will have the pleasure of visiting your country next week, Prime Minister, and I therefore welcome your presence here and hope that Bulgaria will soon become a fully paid-up Member of the European Union.
With regard to Mrs Hautala' s document, I have to ask myself, and you, Mr President, this question: if many Muslims are so resolute in their oppression of women - they do not even allow women to walk down the road like human beings - how can we allow them to enter the European Union if they cannot respect this and all the other European Union directives on equality between men and women?
We need to reflect on this point.
The pursuit of the second wave of the feminist movement in the 60s and 70s was strongly focused on enabling women to get on in paid jobs.
On average, women were not as highly trained as men, and even if they were, due to male domination, they often got the jobs with the lowest status and the lowest income.
Moreover, many women were financially dependent on their husbands.
Highly trained women were right to claim access to jobs from which, in those days, they were almost automatically excluded.
For women who were less highly trained, the situation was often different.
Cleaning offices or stacking shelves in supermarkets are not demanding jobs, and, in many cases, not to be preferred to the role of housewife.
That group of women experienced it, in many cases, as liberating if the income of their husbands obviated the need for them to work.
Most women now have a paid job, while men do not work fewer hours to look after and raise the children.
Feminism has become the employers' accidental instrument to solve staff shortages and to limit government spending.
Certainly under those circumstances, it is even more important to actively fight any form of discrimination and intimidation at work.
MiguÃ©lez Ramos report (A5-0335/2001)
Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I read Mr Ramos' rather technical document, which also has great political meaning for me.
As you are aware, I have been a regional councillor of the Lombardy region for five years.
My daughter, Elisabetta, has been a regional councillor of the Liguria region for five years and is currently a regional councillor of the Lombardy region, for the Pensioners' Party of course.
I say this with pleasure in order to stress my personal hope - in addition to what is, I believe, the hope of all of us - that the regions in Europe will gain increasingly in political and decision-making importance and that they will be allowed to participate more fully in the production of the European directives and regulations which concern them.
.
(EL) The debate on territorial units for statistics (NUTS) is not a technical debate about statistics because regional statistics and the classification of regions on the basis of NUTS provide a constant line of reference for analysing social and economic developments in the regions and determining which areas are eligible for structural support.
One of the most serious problems is that completely different political and economic units are used as a basis for collating and processing statistics.
This is no accident and arouses even greater suspicion in conjunction with the fact, as the report quite rightly points out, that the Commission exercises 'a great deal of flexibility' when applying the criteria for classifying an area in NUTS Ã, ÃÃ, or ÃÃÃ, using them as it pleases, depending on the 'needs' of the case.
For example, a NUTS III type administrative division is used to allocate funds to Objective 2, thereby subsidising half the population of the Union and drastically reducing the funds available for the less developed areas for which they are supposedly intended.
Between 1994 and 1999 (Delors II package) 51% of the population of the ÃU received support, of which only 25% corresponded to Objective 1, which funds NUTS II type regions.
Lastly, of this 25%, only 16.4% related to Objective 2.
In other words, because a small administrative division was used (NUTS ÃÃÃ), the rich countries received considerable support, thereby blatantly distorting regional policy in practice.
Finally, it is again the rich countries which benefit, gobbling up a large slice of what are already miserly and insufficient appropriations from the Structural Funds.
Some countries benefit even more because the NUTS III type administrative divisions are very small compared with other countries.
For example, this sort of administrative division (prefecture) has a surface area of 2,950 square metres in Greece, 3,162 square metres in Portugal and a mere 758 square metres in Germany.
All this illustrates, yet again, the malfunctions, inequalities, irregularities and hypocrisy of ÃU regional policy, in that a large chunk of the appropriations distributed in structural aid is 'recycled' and finds its way back to the more developed Member States, thereby seriously curtailing the potential for any national development policy, which is forced to remain within the confines of the poorly tailored Community 'straitjacket' .
As a result, not only do we fail to achieve the much-vaunted objective of convergence between the poorest and richest regions but, as the figures confirm - and Greece is a prime example - there is increasing divergence, not just between Member States in the north and the south, but between regions within Member States themselves.
The only thing achieved with any degree of satisfaction is that people have been paid to turn a blind eye and mechanisms have been created to promote the interests of the large monopolies, which have benefited most from Community programmes.
Despite the fact that the rapporteur's report fails to 'bring matters to a head' , it does at least touch on several serious problems and we shall support it.
Weiler report (A5-0360/2001)
.
(PT) The study contained in the 2001 Joint Employment Report, produced on the basis of national reports, demonstrates how little attention most Member States pay to employment guidelines.
In fact, only seven have paid any attention to the general objectives laid down at the Lisbon Council and reaffirmed at the Stockholm Council, and only three have referred to the specific objectives on the rate of employment for women.
As stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, to which we contributed proposals, that were approved, antagonism clearly exists between the objectives for employment rates that have been laid down by the Council and the minimal importance that the majority of the Member States attach to integrating sensitivity to gender issues in their employment policies. This failure to integrate such sensitivity in Member State policies can be seen in the lack of national objectives for reducing the various disparities between the genders in the labour market, whether these be a lack in adequate childcare services, or the limited initiatives for reducing wage disparities between the sexes, for example.
The Weiler report is not sufficiently critical of the current employment situation in the European Union, although it does acknowledge some negative aspects of practices in these areas of employment, specifically where it focuses on the need to establish national targets and on meeting them.
It does not, however, provide a critical analysis of the guidelines proposed by the Commission nor does it offer any clear alternatives for issues that we need to commit to, specifically the need to give priority to employment policies or not to continue the current trend of subordinating these policies to monetarist ones, thereby finally burying the neoliberal approach that prevails in the European Union, having rejected the proposals that we tabled on this matter.
.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the thrust of the Weiler report on the employment guidelines for 2002.
It also has a lot of sympathy for the amendments submitted by Mr Bushill-Matthews but feels that the Weiler report is not the appropriate report for such amendments.
.
(EL) Without doubt the economic crisis is worsening, having already been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
This recession, which appears to have set in for the duration, at least according to most analysts, cannot be resolved, yet again, at the expense of the workers, by making mass redundancies and eroding their rights.
Overall employment has basically bottomed out and unemployment is staying put, even if it is not increasing as, for example, in my country.
At the same time, more mass redundancies are on the cards in important sectors of the economy, such as transport, tourism etc. Employment policies have become an exercise in apportioning unemployment, even more so in the guidelines for 2002.
It is no accident that the countries 'patted on the back' here by the EU are the countries which first proceeded to overhaul the labour market, especially by extending part-time and other forms of flexible employment.
The European Parliament report supports the guidelines, which revert to the familiar subjects of structural reform and more flexible employment contracts, the purpose of which is to create a huge army of employable people with no rights or claims, whose productivity and competitiveness are tailored to the speculative demands of big business and its interests.
Geographical mobility of the workers serves no purpose except to strengthen the concentration of human resources and wealth in the rich areas of the ÃU, which get richer by absorbing the best manpower and scientists.
The sole purpose of the second pillar of the guidelines on entrepreneurship is to make the unemployed self-employed, thereby artificially reducing unemployment and rejecting the responsibilities of social solidarity.
As for subsidised job schemes, not only have they been completely ineffectual in combating unemployment, the money has generally gone straight into the employers' pockets and workers have been replaced by the subsidised unemployed, resulting in constant infringements of collective agreements.
Continuing privatisation, mergers, adjustment to EMU, increased imports and more intense capitalist competition, thousands of small and medium-sized farms wiped out and the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises have created conditions for spiralling unemployment.
The policy which the ÃU persists in applying, despite an average rate of growth of 3.3% in 2000, does not appear to be reducing the unemployment or the poverty which is the bane of the lives of 22% of the population of the ÃU.
The workers want a different policy, a policy predicated on people and their needs, with full, secure social rights for all workers, a better standard of living and real social development and prosperity.
We are mainly well disposed towards Mrs Weiler' s report.
We particularly appreciate the emphasis she places upon the quality of work.
We are nonetheless critical of quite a few of the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which make sweeping ideological statements about the market economy and the way it is run.
We believe that an economic policy is thus being recommended that militates against the European employment strategy, especially during periods when the economy and demand for labour are not expanding.
Because these amendments have been adopted by the House, we chose to abstain in the final vote.
.
I wholeheartedly support this report by Ms Weiler which welcomes the 2002 employment guidelines.
Whilst the report recognises that full employment can be achieved through further structural reforms of the labour market, it also calls for increased investment in training, especially for job seekers.
The quantitative, as well as qualitative, returns that the EU would reap as a result of its commitment to training are unquestionable.
Training and education are essential ways in which EU Member States can jointly boost the EU's employment rate.
Time and again in Member States, investment in education and training has proved to be successful and when coordinated at a pan-European level, this would be amplified.
It is important that these commitments are realised and that they do not simply turn into hot air.
Finally, the recommendation that both sides of industry should agree on changes in working practices could pave the way for enhanced industrial relations and create a situation whereby the specialist knowledge of each party is fully utilised.
SeppÃ€nen report (A5-0350/2001)
Madam President, you, like me, love the sea and have often visited my city, Genoa, which I have admired for 20 years from the top of the Righi hills.
I see the sea and reflect deeply.
The sea unites, the sea belongs to everyone, the sea has no borders.
It is therefore right that the European Union should concern itself with all seas, particularly those which bathe the shores of some of our States, and that it should provide financial aid, not least, as in this case, to States beyond its borders such as Russia, for environmental projects to make these seas cleaner, more navigable and more beautiful.
Mr President, Mr Fatuzzo' s explanations of vote are so poetic that I would like to ask you, as a member of the Bureau, whether the Presidency has any intention of publishing these speeches in a book, considering their value and the sentiments pervading them which surpass all the other speeches in the House and endow them with a poetic value that Parliament must not fail to appreciate.
I will inform the Bureau of your suggestion, Mr Dell' Alba.
Virrankoski report (A5-0345/2001)
Mr Dell' Alba, in a minute you will see that not all Mr Fatuzzo' s speeches are poetic.
This one concerns nuclear power stations.
Clearly, through this funding we are protecting the Chernobyl power station - and I voted for the motion - but we must think carefully: should we really close the Bohunice power station in Slovakia - which I visited with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy last week - and on which thousands of billions have been spent to increase safety, and make its closure a non-negotiable condition for Slovakia' s accession to the European Union?
Should we not think more carefully about this?
The manufacturing companies that used to buy energy from Chernobyl, and by means of which it was possible to sustain such a colossal complex of nuclear reactors, are, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, largely non-existent.
The population of the Ukraine is so impoverished that it lacks the purchasing power to be able to buy any substantial amount of electricity as a consumer.
Neither is there any internal funding available to finance new, cleaner and safe methods of generating electricity, and, given the long half-life of radio-active material, we will need to be very patient before what is left of the demolished stations is removed.
Everything that is being done now, unfortunately, is impossible without outside aid.
The measures to provide Chernobyl with a new protective casing by 2005, are too little and too late.
The first casing - erected shortly after the disaster in 1986 - still conceals a dangerous seat of fire, and nuclear energy remains a source of future risks.
In the debate on 2 May regarding 15 years of Chernobyl, I already indicated that other types of nuclear power plants are also unsafe and that they, upon closure, leave a legacy impossible to solve.
Despite all these shortcomings, I support this finance proposal, for doing nothing is not a solution at all.
Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report (A5-0328/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou' s report.
It concerns the Social Fund, which, as we know, is a fund dedicated to workers and to improving and enhancing the chances of the unemployed of finding work.
In particular, this document regulates the definition of innovative measures, that is the new initiatives in this sector.
I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this last explanation of vote to wish you 'Bon appÃ©tit' , of course, and to apologise for the drain on the European Parliament' s finances, for I have been informed that every minute of my speeches costs the institution ITL 1,2 million.
If the services were willing to pay half of it to please Mr Fatuzzo, I could save on the other half and not make any more speeches.
Joking apart, I would like to end this explanation of vote by calling for the innovative measures of the Social Fund to be encouraged and accepted, even if they are proposed to the Union by the candidate countries.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Council reform
The next item is the report (A5-0308/2001) by Mr Poos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the reform of the Council [2001/2020(INI)].
Mr President, it is a true honour for me to be able to present to you this report on Council reform in the presence of Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, representing the Council and Mr Barnier, representing the Commission.
This own-initiative report does not concern the Council alone.
It also concerns the European Parliament and Commission in equal measure, as they have the same interest in ensuring that the three institutions work well, and are efficient and coherent.
In an enlarged Union, it is imperative that the Community institutions improve their ability to make decisions and increase their reaction time.
I do not believe that it constitutes any insider dealing to state that today the Council is the most badly organised institution.
This is a serious problem, since this institution, which has both executive and legislative competences, is still, in spite of the changes made to the Treaty, the European Union' s main centre of power.
The Council has already lost much of its effectiveness.
In my report, you will find a long list of dysfunctions.
The Council itself had carried out some preparatory work three or four years ago and I used this and other work as a basis.
Since then, however, nothing has been done, although some other preparatory work was carried out by former - and very key - figures on the international stage, and I shall mention, in particular, the Notre Europe working group led by Jacques Delors.
One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression, which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures, along with the Commission.
The rise in power of the European Council, combined with the weakness of the General Affairs Council, has re-established the intergovernmental method of preparing decisions.
The aides, or 'sherpas' , used by the Heads of State, have reintroduced a method that is reminiscent of nineteenth century secret diplomacy.
Mini-summit meetings, like the one held at Ghent, have brought back the tendency to place control in the hands of a chosen few, a dream that some have never given up on since the Fouchet plan of the 1960s.
In order to correct this digression, I recommend nothing more and nothing less than going back to the Treaty.
We should ask the European Council to stop tackling detailed issues and to stop acting like an enormous vacuum cleaner that tries to deal with all the important decisions.
You should not bite off more than you can chew.
What is even worse is that the European Council now causes the institutional system to come to a standstill.
No one dares to make a decision anymore.
Everything is now referred back to those at the top.
The European Council should restrict itself to giving general guidelines on European policy, as laid down in the Treaty.
We must re-evaluate the General Affairs Council, enabling it to resolve conflicts between the specialised Councils and ensuring that decisions are coherent.
To this end, it is essential to have a single channel for preparations, and the same single channel for preparations could also be used by the European Council.
We must demand that the ministers in the General Affairs Council do not deal with European affairs at a brief monthly meeting, where an in-depth discussion of the items on the agenda is not possible due to the limited number of ministers attending and the unacceptable practical conditions.
The proposal for a resolution suggests a number of practical solutions, which can all be implemented immediately without having to amend the Treaty.
Before I finish, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the proposals on improving collaboration with the European Parliament.
They concern the presence of Council ministers at our important debates as well as speeding up the legislative procedure from the first-reading stage.
With regard to transparency, I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will support the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which proposes that Council discussions be made public when it is working on legislation.
This obviously requires considerable reorganisation of the agenda and discipline in the conduct of meetings.
If the Council did not meet behind closed doors when carrying out its duties as co-legislator, citizens might also perceive it as a second legislative chamber, which is, in fact, a task that the Council already fulfils today.
Mr President, Mr Poos, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in an awkward position here, since I have to take the floor as President of an institution which, according to Mr Poos, is the most badly organised of all those in the European Union.
Therefore, the task is, without doubt, fraught with danger.
You are right in thinking that the Presidency was very interested to read Mr Poos' report on Council reform. Mr Poos has had a remarkable political career spent in many European forums and is consequently well acquainted with them, both internally, having been a participant, and externally, having observed them from a critical standpoint.
That being the case, I would like to say that the Presidency fully supports the analysis, perhaps not the description, but the analysis stating that we need to improve the way in which the Council is run.
The Helsinki European Council of June 1999 has already acknowledged that substantial changes in the Council' s working methods are necessary, and pointed out that these changes must be gradually introduced from now on so that by the time of enlargement, the Council can smoothly accommodate a larger membership.
The same Council also approved operational recommendations to achieve this.
The main thrust of these recommendations is very similar to some of the proposals made in Mr Poos' report.
I shall mention just a few.
The recommendations stressed, therefore, that the main task of the European Council should be to provide the necessary impetus for the Union' s development and to define general political guidelines.
They emphasised that the General Affairs Council is responsible for overall coordination.
There was also a call to improve coordination of European policy within Member States.
The recommendations stressed that the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) has responsibility for the final preparation and presentation of all agenda items to the Council.
The final recommendation was to restrict the number of formations of the Council.
These recommendations, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, were implemented in parallel.
By way of example, the General Affairs Council has therefore followed the practice recommended at Helsinki, to divide its agenda accordingly into two parts: external relations issues and horizontal questions, which include overall policy coordination.
The General Affairs Council has also reduced the number of formations of the Council to sixteen, in order to improve the coherence of work, and to prevent fragmentation of the EU' s activities.
The role of COREPER was clarified in the Council' s internal rules of procedure.
Public debates are now organised on new and important legislative proposals, and on the programme of the General Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council.
The first assessment regarding the implementation of the Helsinki recommendations was presented by the Council' s Secretary-General at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001.
From this, it emerged that progress has been made, but a great deal still needs to be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, certain measures were, for example, not completely implemented.
The European Council of Gothenburg gave explicit recognition to this and pointed out, as the Secretary-General underlines in his report, that other reforms for the Council' s structures and working methods are needed.
In the light of this, the Secretary-General was requested to formulate specific proposals for measures, preferably during the European Council of Laeken, which must guarantee the effective operation of the Council following enlargement, by means of better preparation for council meetings, clear coordination between the different council formations and more efficient working methods, so as to enable the Council to take the necessary decisions by June 2002.
Meanwhile, the Belgian Presidency will continue to implement the Helsinki recommendations.
Parallel with this, the General Affairs Council has intensified its coordinating role.
For example, from now on, the presidency will report to the General Affairs Council on the most important dossiers which are being discussed in the other Council formations.
This list is drawn up so as to allow the General Affairs Council to carry out fully its horizontal coordination role pertaining to all activities of the different formations of the Council.
The object of this exercise is to make the Council activities in its different formations more coherent, and to ensure that these are better tailored to the general objectives of the Union.
Furthermore, this also reinforces the role of the General Affairs Council in the context of the preparation of the European Council.
Additionally, recent events in the United States have clearly illustrated that overall coordination of the Union' s activities in the fight against terrorism is necessary.
The General Affairs Council of 17 October looked into a report of the presidency on the activities of the different formations of the Council in this field.
With this report, the presidency has drawn up a roadmap comprising all Council initiatives and activities, each time indicating those responsible for the implementation, the deadlines and the progress made to date.
The General Affairs Council has asked for regular updates of this roadmap.
After all, this is an important instrument which enables progress to be evaluated for each formation of the Council.
During its next sitting on 29 October, the General Affairs Council will once again pour over this updated roadmap.
This initiative clearly illustrates the capacity of the General Affairs Council, if necessary, to guarantee general coordination of the Council' s policy.
Furthermore, this initiative should help re-confirm this coordinating role of the Council in general.
Needless to say, there are other reforms needed to improve the operation of the Council.
There is no doubt that the report requested from the Secretary-General will, therefore, prove useful in generating further thoughts on this issue.
And that also applies, of course, to the report by Mr Poos and the EP resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I would also like to say that, with regard to the dysfunctions in the Council, the Commission widely supports the analysis presented in this excellent report.
Personally, I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis, given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament.
I would like to say that, having begun by voicing our overall appreciation of the report, the Commission also supports the reforms that you put forward for the Council.
Transforming the Council into a structured and efficient body is in the interests of the whole European Union.
Your report takes up many of the suggestions and comments that we at the Commission have expressed in the past, and particularly in our recently published White Paper on European Governance.
These options for reform are all the more interesting since they can be made - as you have said - without altering the current Treaty.
With reference to the Council, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would obviously like to say that, from my point of view, each of our institutions is autonomous and has primary responsibility for its own reforms.
We know very well, however, that each of the institutions is concerned with how they all function. It is in this spirit and within these boundaries that I would like to give you the European Commission' s impression of the other institution, in other words, the Council of Ministers.
Admittedly, within the framework of the debate on the future of the European Union, we must carry out an in-depth examination of the institutional set-up, the role of each institution and the amendments that need to be made to the Treaty so that our Union has a genuine institutional framework that is both more democratic and more effective.
That is why I think, Mr Poos, that your report is an extremely important element, which will spark off the wide-ranging debate about to open on the institutional framework of the EU, its effectiveness and its democratic legitimacy.
Nonetheless, the debate on the most fundamental reforms in the run-up to 2004 cannot be an excuse for refusing to immediately adopt the reforms that the Council can already implement in the existing Treaty. Furthermore, one of the objectives set out in the White Paper is to ensure the Council functions as efficiently as possible.
Apart from the different views that might be expressed on one point of detail or another, there is some convergence on the analysis of the dysfunctions that we have found - and of the reforms that need to be carried out.
This convergence is evident in the report that you are presenting, Mr Poos, in the White Paper and also - as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated - in the Trumpf-Piris report, which was drawn up by the General Secretariat of the Council itself. The operational conclusions of this report were widely approved at Helsinki by the European Council and were also widely implemented in the Council' s internal rules of procedure.
It falls within the remit and it is the duty of each institution - I would like to reiterate this - to continually examine whether that institution is working efficiently.
The Commission wanted to do this by adopting the White Paper and proposing the administrative reform drawn up by my colleague, Neil Kinnock.
I believe that the Council will have to do this one day, as will the European Parliament, and the Commission will do all it can to support these two institutions in this undertaking.
In this respect, I would like to reiterate that the Gothenburg European Council has already asked the Secretary-General of the Council to submit detailed proposals on this issue for the meeting at Laeken.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise - without going into the details of each proposal in your report, Mr Poos, that all we need is political will to successfully complete this assessment and improvement work.
Obviously, this must be shown by the Member States governments as well as by the institutions themselves.
There are at least two points that deserve particular attention. On the one hand, the concept of the legislative Council and, on the other, the role of the General Affairs Council.
We are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the Poos report defines the three functions of the Council, which are to legislate, to take decisions regarding government and to coordinate policies.
Consequently it is very clear - and the Commission supports this - that the Council must be organised differently so that it operates within the framework of one or another of these three functions.
Therefore, the legislative Council should basically work in complete transparency, with open debates and public votes.
Admittedly, the number of sectoral Councils may be too high, but it is primarily the lack of coordination between these sectoral Councils, which means that, unlike the European Parliament, in which the Assembly takes the final decision, the Council arm of the legislator has much more difficulty in coordinating its various decisions.
This situation calls for particular consideration of how determined we are - as you mentioned in the report - to encourage consensus between Parliament and the Council from the first-reading stage within the codecision procedure.
Mr Poos, although the Commission fully supports the determination to bring about swift agreements, we must ensure that they do not have a negative effect on the coherence of texts that the Commission proposes.
Under the Treaties, the Commission has the exclusive right of initiative and the responsibility of protecting the common interest.
The Commission therefore hopes that the determination of Parliament and the Council to bring about consensus at first reading ensures that the Commission will be fully involved in all aspects regarding substance and procedure, in order to guarantee this coherence in the texts adopted.
I would like to reiterate that the Commission has been given the exclusive competence to hand down a judgment to protect the common interest at this stage of the codecision procedure.
You are also quite right, Mr Poos, when you point out in the report that the crux of the debate is, essentially, how the General Affairs Council functions.
It is extremely difficult, in just one monthly meeting, to take decisions on all the issues relating to EU external policy, including those on security policy, on maintaining the single institutional framework of the European Union and all the horizontal and institutional issues, such as, for example, the recent regulation on access to documents or the coordination of the EU response to the tragic events of 11 September, as well as coordinating sectoral policies.
The Commission is fairly well placed to judge the degree of variation in the subjects dealt with by the General Affairs Council, as there are times when we require several Commissioners to represent us at the same session.
We therefore support your view, Mr Poos: the various formations in the Council need a central body responsible for coordination and, at the moment, it is very difficult for the General Affairs Council to do this.
We must therefore avoid a situation where the General Affairs Council becomes some sort of Foreign Affairs Council, because there is no other formation in charge of coordination.
Furthermore, is it necessary to create a new General Affairs Council, made up of ministers who fulfil a coordinating role within their governments and who wield the necessary political authority, as you suggest?
This would, in any case, enable the European Council to be freed from arbitration and from policy coordination, so that it can fully devote itself to its real job of providing political impetus and defining guidelines for the European Union.
However, creating this sort of Council raises a whole raft of political, even constitutional, issues, as you yourself admit, in some Member States, particularly in those that have a coalition government.
To sum up, Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank Mr Poos once again for the extensive, excellent and very thorough piece of work that he has done and for the useful proposals contained in the report.
Quite frankly, I do not believe that it is the Commission' s role to respond to one or another detailed comment regarding the way the Council functions because, as I have said, each of our institutions, quite naturally, functions autonomously.
This, however, does not prevent us from performing a global assessment where there are no taboo subjects, to repeat the phrase that Mr Verhofstadt used this morning, when he stated that there were no taboo subjects where the wide-ranging debate and the Laeken Declaration are concerned.
The issue of how to improve collaborative work, particularly in the field of legislation, is not a taboo subject either.
The Commission would like to say that it is also in its interests to work with an efficient Council and that the two messages contained in this own-initiative report, in other words, that we must guarantee coherent action as well as a certain level of political representation in the Council' s decision-making, have certainly been heard, Mr Poos.
Thank you.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, our group thanks the rapporteur, Mr Poos, for his report.
Our colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, led by our coordinator, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, have, of course, been committed to supporting his work.
This report, though, sets alarm bells ringing.
When the report observes - an observation that I welcome, although I regret its accuracy - that the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council has been undermined, the Commission's right to take initiatives weakened and, finally, government-level cooperation in Council built up to the detriment of cooperation at Community level, then that is cause for alarm as regards the Council's ability to operate.
The Foreign Ministers, who at present constitute the General Affairs Council, can no longer perform this duty adequately.
They travel around the world - which is after all what they are meant to do - spend a few hours in the Council, leave their deputies to represent them and are not there for the vote anyway.
That is why the Council should, for once, take its Rules of Procedure, more specifically Article 11(4), seriously and check how many Ministers are actually present at the concluding votes.
We need, then, a new General Affairs Council.
Let us call it a Council of European Ministers, meeting weekly, or more often if necessary, in Brussels or, of course, in the national capitals, and always available within their governments.
We also insist on something to which Commissioner Barnier has referred, namely that the Legislative Council which meets in public to decide on laws - not in committees, but in final rulings - needs to be separated from the Executive Council.
I hope we will reach the point where this can be established and that a Council of European Ministers - as I wish to call it for the sake of simplicity - conceived along these lines, will also be able to coordinate the work of the various Councils.
Some of their voting procedures are utterly different, and the European Council must then again be asked to give authority to the Council, so that the ladies and gentlemen can deal with the matter again.
Things must change!
I would like to address one point which is not particularly topical but is intended to point the way ahead.
It concerns the need to find a successor to occupy Mr Hombach's position.
I recommend that we should not appoint a sort of Hombach Mark II to this position, not because I have anything against Mr Hombach, but because, in institutional terms, we need to go in a new direction.
I think these duties should find a home at the Commission, so that the Commission, which has the Budget resources at its disposal, can also take responsibility for these issues...
(Applause)
.... so that we can eventually achieve the transfer of the High Representative's functions to the remit of the Commission, where a Vice-President would take them over.
(Applause)
Please let me make a final observation, which is not directed at my esteemed colleague Mr Poos: I hope that the present members of the Council have the strength and insight to come to the right decisions while they belong to the Council and not only after becoming honourable Members of this European Parliament.
(Applause)
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in this debate firstly in order to express my personal gratitude and that of my group to Mr Poos for his wonderful report.
It really is a piece of work carried out with knowledge of the subject, not only because he is a veteran of the Council, but because I witnessed perfectly, ten years ago when we were preparing the Treaty of Maastricht, how Mr Poos, then a member of the Council with the government of Mr Santer, along with Mr Santer, showed the same attitude of openness, cooperation and solidarity towards Parliament which he is now proposing in his report.
The result was the Treaty of Maastricht, which gave us codecision.
I believe that we must salute his coherent and serious political track record.
With regard to codecision, we are not just dealing with a reform of the Council as such, but we are an interested party in the matter.
Codecision has allowed us to develop a shared culture in which the Council, for the first time, has been opening up to Parliament.
We must consolidate this.
There is a very important step proposed by the Poos report, which is that the Council, in legislative session, should act publicly.
If there is an insufficient number of Ministers, they could apply the rule applied by Parliament: that votes should be nominal, and if members are not present, they should not be paid allowances.
These are therefore measures which can be applied straight away and which do not have to await the reform.
From this point of view, I believe that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, whose path has taken the opposite course, having moved on from Parliament to the Council, can introduce a degree of freshness into the work of the Council.
I hope she can cooperate with us.
A final observation, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: we are on the eve of the Convention; we have fought for it in Parliament and we believe that we also have to cooperate positively in the process of reforming our institutions, which are interdependent on each other, in a way which means that we cannot reform one without taking account of the others.
In conclusion, I believe that we have to teach by example.
We are awaiting the Council meeting on the 30 October, from which we want a unanimous position from the Council with regard to the Belgian proposal on taxation, in order to bring about the statute of Members once and for all; we also believe that the package of anti-terrorist measures is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our co-citizens that we are united.
And lastly, the President-in-Office of the Council will allow me to point out that we would like her, with a view to Laeken, between the White Paper on Governance and the Mandelkern report, which is with the Council, to present us with a coherent proposal which is not based on a reduction of Parliament' s legislative powers.
That would also help the reform.
Mr President, just as the Commission and we in Parliament change our methods of working, the former through its White Paper, the Council too must of course change its own methods of working, both in the light of enlargement and because, as many people point out, its present methods do not work so well at present.
Mr Poos has much long-standing experience of how the Council operates.
I hope that the Council will take his views on board.
I assume that this issue will come up at the convention and that, as Mr Verhofstadt said this morning, there will be no taboos.
Precisely what shape is to be taken by the Council' s work is not of course something we Liberals have any reason for taking a view on, because it is not our task to regulate these matters.
There are nonetheless certain issues in which we think we can become involved.
Transparency is one such issue.
For us, transparency in the EU' s work is important when it comes to all the institutions.
It is a key to winning back people' s confidence in the European project.
At present, the Council meets behind closed doors and legislates for millions upon millions of Europeans.
That is not acceptable.
Everyone talks about this, and everyone criticises it.
Very minor reforms take place, but these are not enough.
The legislation must be a matter for public debate.
A separate department must be formed within the Council in which the ministers meet entirely openly and in public in order to legislate.
There must, moreover, be proper Minutes issued afterwards.
The members of this legislative Council must of course be politicians, not officials, with clear mandates from their respective governments.
Another issue which worries us rather, and which Mr Poos also addressed, is that of all the overhyped 'mini-summits' which assume an enormous amount of importance.
A great many decisions are made during these meetings of rather doubtful status.
We hope that less emphasis will be placed on these meetings and that they will instead be transformed into working meetings.
There is an increased tendency in the Council - not so much in the country that at present holds the Presidency, but in many others, especially Sweden - towards intergovernmental activity and a desire to strengthen the Council at Parliament' s and the Commission' s expense.
We view this development with great concern, because more intergovernmental activity and more decisions behind closed doors scarcely lead to a more democratic EU.
Mr President, during a meeting last Saturday, I happened to hear a new colleague of an important minister describing, with the frankness of a newcomer, his first experience of a Council of Ministers. He said that it was a sort of Barnum Circus, where everyone talks but hardly anyone listens or actually seeks agreement.
We support the rapporteur and the majority of his proposals, and so I would like to use the time available to me to send two messages from our group to the Council, in particular.
The first is that, even if the Council were to approve Parliament' s proposals tomorrow morning, we would not be able to resolve the fundamental democratic imbalance and we would not be able to stop the intergovernmental drift.
The only way to genuinely improve the democracy and efficiency of the Union is by strengthening the Commission and Parliament and removing the Council' s right of veto.
The second message is a call to reflect on what Commissioner Barnier has said, namely that despite the positive elements and the endeavours of the Belgian Presidency, it would currently be impossible to reform the Council without a grass roots debate among its members on the very nature of the Council.
I am sure that ideas vary among the Union' s Member States on the Council' s future, and I therefore call strongly upon the Presidency to assume responsibility for organising this debate on the future and to ensure that practical steps are taken which open up the way for rapid progress along the path outlined by Mr Poos, pending more comprehensive reforms.
Mr President, Mr Poos and the Commission' s gargantuan endeavours could be likened to those of an eagle which is eager but unable to take flight towards the future heights of the new European ambitions.
However, we must see this report as a positive contribution to the preparations for the future structure of the Union, a Union which must of necessity be an autonomous, independent political entity, secure in its cultural and social traditions, which can serve as an effective response to the confusion brought by a hegemony such as that we are currently witnessing.
The Union must assume a new role.
In a situation in which alliances are being disbanded and reformed on a global scale, Europe comes across as weak, appointing dubious triumvirates to represent it on the world stage when it needs to be united and firmly autonomous in presenting and maintaining a line of peace and social justice to eradicate the threat of terrorism.
The reforms proposed by the Poos report are necessary and achievable, and we support them.
These are small but important steps, worthy of due consideration by the Council and Parliament.
They will also contribute greatly to resolving the democratic deficit, endowing the Council with a new institutional role and a closer relationship with Parliament.
This fundamental political and external security action and its mandated representative can only be effective if decisions are taken in a context of joint responsibility between all the countries rather than with some of them being excluded.
The Council has to understand this.
We are not just complaining for the sake of it: this is a democratic requirement for the well-structured, transparent running of the Union and will benefit the Union as a whole.
Mr President, I would like to say that I believe that both Parliament and the Commission are most fortunate in having somebody of the calibre of Mr Poos to give us this very fine report which is long overdue.
I very much welcome Mr Poos' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament, as I believe it will, the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers.
We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive, as it were, to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be.
Regrettably, the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness.
The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable.
The General Affairs Council, as Mr Poos says, must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper.
If it does, nobody will have an overall view of what is happening; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future.
The work of the Council must be more consistent, and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council.
I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail.
It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty.
Also, Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks.
We are all too familiar with Ministers appearing at General Affairs Council meetings, taking the television cameras on the way in with their one or two one-liners and then going on their way.
The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief.
Madame, I know, I was there!
I saw it for myself on more than one occasion and things have not improved since I left.
In actual fact, they have got much worse, and that is something that must be aired.
We want the General Affairs Council to do its business.
We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business.
We respect, and must respect, the three institutions and the role that they have to play.
This Parliament cannot afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions, be it Parliament or the Commission or, indeed the Council, being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time.
Mr President, who knows the Ministers Mr Van Dale, Mr Conde de Saro and Mr Christoffersen?
These three gentlemen will, over the next 14 months, be responsible for the adoption of the majority of laws in the EU.
The permanent representatives of the countries which hold, or are to hold, the presidency - Belgium, Spain and Denmark - are clever diplomats who live in the shadows.
They meet every week in Brussels and negotiate the larger part of our laws.
Seventy per cent of these are prepared by their subordinates and aides.
Fifteen per cent of them they deal with themselves. Another 15% are placed on the ministers' desks, and the permanent representatives brief or deputise for the ministers during the formal adoption.
The meetings take place behind sealed doors so that no one can see how far we are from that democracy in which we are united in believing in the fifteen Member States.
It does happen that a matter is discussed in public and finds echoes in the national parliaments. Indeed, it may directly entail a brief or negotiating mandate for the minister.
However, that is the exception. As a rule, we as voters and elected representatives have forfeited the larger part of our democracy, which is administered by 15 permanent representatives and their officials.
The solution to this democratic deficit or embezzlement, for we know, of course, who have absconded with the power, is simple: to read our constitutions and return legislative power to the elected representatives.
Let us recreate the core of democracy whereby the electorate can go to the polls and new majorities can be obtained and new laws adopted.
That core does not exist in today' s EU.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, we could actually say that we have had a stroke of luck.
The day after one of the worst spectacles that the European Union and, in particular, its Council of Ministers has ever provided to the citizens of Europe, the excellent report by Mr Poos, the former chairman of the Council of Ministers, appears, which not only shows us the way forward - it gives an outline that should be displayed on all the churches or public buildings in the European Union, just like the theses used to be posted on the Wittemburg church.
We have witnessed a European Council, where the dispersal of the institutions, the dispersal of the Council, split up into asides, factions and the most diverse formations, had a detrimental effect on the work of the Belgian Presidency, which did nothing to cause this of course. Now we are reiterating the great principles and calmly and dispassionately saying how Europe should be run, and where it is failing, because we are not applying the wise recommendations and thoughts of Mr Poos, which are also enhanced by his years of experience, of someone who has an insider' s view of the Council of Ministers, and of the European Council full stop.
I therefore think that the vote on this report is a great moment for Parliament.
Unfortunately, Europe in practice does not provide any inspiration at all, which is one of the main reasons why the work of the EU, the image of the EU and the weight of the EU are insufficient.
Therefore, if this text can be an element that the Belgian Presidency, in the run-up to the Laeken Summit and the Laeken Declaration, may largely take into consideration by saying 'ladies and gentlemen, this is the way forward, this is the Community method and this is how things should be run, so that at least we are trying to put our house in order' , then this text will be worthwhile, and I hope it will receive Parliament' s unanimous approval tomorrow.
In any case, the radical Members will support it unreservedly.
We think that this is the way forward, that this is how we get there, that we must see European integration and not European destruction, which is, unfortunately, what the Council all too often gives us the impression is being allowed to happen. It is not really the Council itself, but its members, its actors, who certainly demonstrated at Ghent, as they did at Nice, that they are very capable of breaking up the institutions, and that they are actively working towards this goal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Poos and point out that all the institutions of the European Union will have to re-orientate themselves and find better ways of working in view of the challenges being presented to them, the enlargement of the European Union and the changes which will come about simply because of the number of people involved.
The Commission has for some time been pressing on with this sort of internal reform process.
The European Parliament is occupied in creating the same sort of conditions by means of the Corbett report, which is currently in progress, provided we can achieve these without amendments to the Treaties becoming necessary.
I believe this should be done by both these institutions and also by the Council, which will have the greatest problems simply by reason of the increase in the number of its members.
For when I consider that in future, when there are 27 members at a meeting of the European Council, it will take an hour and a half simply to deal with the precedence of delegations and then that the statements made by every delegation will make even lunch difficult - and of course we cannot go without lunch - then it clearly does not go without saying that we will be able to work effectively.
This has nothing to do with the effectiveness of a Council Presidency, but exclusively with the structures.
That is why it is extraordinarily important that we really do tackle many of Mr Poos' proposals in this area, which can be realised by simple amendments to the Rules of Procedure and without Treaty amendments.
I believe we have to do this for two reasons, namely to increase efficiency and for the sake of greater transparency.
Efficiency can only be increased by the burden of the General Council no longer having to be borne by one pair of hands and in the context of one organisation.
Meeting up constitutes Item A, we do a bit of foreign policy, then all 27 of us meet the President of Kazakhstan, then move on to Item B, which is legislation, and all this with seamless transitions from one item to the next, so that half the participants are always in a press conference.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I may be exaggerating a bit, but I fear that the reality is rather like that in some areas.
It would in fact be necessary, for this reason, to move over to an Executive Council concentrating on foreign policy in particular.
We really should be in a position to formulate a coherent foreign policy in the Council, provided that it is an intergovernmental organisation, and must make it clear that one effect of transparency will be a Legislative Council whose votes will be publicly taken and publicly explained.
We will only win people' s acceptance of Europe if they know who took what decision and for what reason.
That is a fundamental issue when it comes to gaining our citizens' acceptance, and only in this way can we, by means of the codecision procedure, bring about the public interaction of Parliament and the Council, so that the citizen and the media have the chance to reach a fair judgment and hold to account those who are responsible, or believed to be responsible, for wrong decisions.
I believe it to be urgently necessary that the work should be made parliamentary in this way and that this should be the means by which it is also made political.
We are engaged in the work of legislation, which in many fields is regulated by officials who share in the decisions.
I find it hard to reconcile this with our democratic conceptions and so I would like to ask you to take the initiative on this point in Laeken, because we can achieve a great deal without amending the Treaty and should also be preparing ourselves in this way for enlargement of the European Union.
Mr President, the Poos report is audacious, cautious and realistic.
Audacious because it immediately proposes a set of amendments to improve the workings of the Council.
Cautious because it acknowledges the viability of the amendments without needing to modify the Treaties.
And realistic because it recognises that it is also becoming politically necessary to make considerable improvements to the workings of both the Commission and Parliament.
The report' s proposals even consider the idea that improving the institutional workings of the Union will require major adjustments to the balance of established power which, without endangering the workings of these bodies, guarantee the full participation of all Member States.
I would say, as a matter of fact, that this is the fundamental issue.
The broad objectives for the European Union in economic, social and security terms and for its external representation will only be achieved in the short term if Europe as a whole, through its various public opinions, and the fifteen Member States, through their representatives in the various bodies, attach priority and urgency to improving political cohesion on the basis of fully egalitarian participation.
Passivity, a lack of clear definition, division and disputes between countries, which prevent changes from taking place, help maintain the status quo, prove right those who see the European Union as nothing more than a group of merchants whose primary concern is to divide up the limited financial resources it has available in a way that is not always fair or equitable.
Strengthening the institutions, improving their workings and efficiency, drafting and producing Community policies for security and for our external representation is absolutely essential, but this must be carried out by all fifteen Member States without exceptions and without cabinets.
For this reason, the report warrants our support and our admiration.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today is an intelligent and creditable attempt by Mr Poos to reform the Council without changing the Treaties.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts although I cannot share his optimism.
I do not believe that this mini-reform can solve the problems of the Council nor do I see the political will to carry it out, unfortunately.
I hope that I am wrong and Mr Poos is right.
Mr President, the golden age of the General Affairs Council has passed and it seems unrealistic to believe that the European Council is prepared to reinstate the powers which it has taken away from it.
European policies are not external policies but internal policies of the Member States and the important decisions must not be reserved for the Foreign Affairs Ministers.
They already have enough to do with the common foreign and security policy.
The institutional triangle is still essential to the good functioning of the Union, provided that each of its elements continues to adapt to the new requirements.
In the case of the Council, we are facing a quagmire whose deficiencies can only be remedied: a) by recognising the decisive role of the European Council; b) by giving the General Affairs Council the task of effectively preparing its decisions so that they are not relegated to national bureaucracies; and c) by organising all the specialised Councils into an efficiently-structured system.
This efficiency will not be achieved without abandoning the now obsolete system of a rotating six-monthly Presidency, replacing it with a longer-lasting Presidency.
Effective political action cannot change its priorities every six months.
My group raised this issue in the debate of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, although, out of respect for the focus of the report, we do not insist on this point.
The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms, which are likely to lead to a process of self-reform which is becoming increasingly essential.
I would be pleased if it achieved that objective at least.
We would all gain from this, even those of us who believe that Council reforms can only be achieved by the Convention because they need to be far more in-depth.
Mr President, every single pronouncement by the European Parliament expresses our faith in democracy, transparency and efficiency.
And quite rightly so. However, it is not enough.
These general principles only acquire substance and translate into practice if they permeate the organisational structure of the entire European Union.
Which is precisely why we should welcome Jacques Poos' motion for a resolution.
It is one of the most important texts to pass through the European Parliament.
The rapporteur demonstrates that a great deal can be done in the area of both democracy and efficiency without revising the Treaties, merely by applying them more accurately.
Taking the report as my starting point, I should at least like to highlight the following: first, the way in which the Council is organised is so complicated, with its 27 sectoral formations which have a fragmentary effect on its work.
It addresses individual trees, but rarely the wood as a whole.
The General Affairs Council should meet more frequently, but with the ministers present, not just in Brussels but, if possible, at the meetings too.
If the Council is to work, national administrations and governments need to adapt to the European institutional attitude and modus operandi.
As for relations between the Council and the European Parliament, there is good cause to increase the numbers of days' presence, although personal appearances in Parliament by the President-in-Office of the Council and transparency do not necessarily mean that the Council has to be reformed.
Finally, I note that the Europe issue has increased the volume of work and deserves greater attention.
The members of the Council need to make a reasonable division between their national and European duties if they are to make a more effective contribution.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, in turn, should like to congratulate Jacques Poos on the excellent report which he has presented to the House and to thank him for the highly democratic manner in which he dealt with the proposals and observations of the other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, observations intended to improve the report.
I should like to comment on three points in the report which I consider extremely important.
The first is item 9, which refers to the Council's two areas of work, namely the legislative and the executive.
I think that Mr Poos is quite right to say that a distinction must be made between the legislative Council, that is, it must be clear when the Council is acting in a legislative capacity and when it is acting in an executive capacity.
This is extremely important and, I think, needs to be borne in mind.
The second point concerns collaboration between the Council and the European Parliament.
It would be unfair to the Council not to say that certain steps have been taken, but that does not mean that more are not needed.
I should like to comment on two paragraphs in Mr Poos' proposals which I think are very important.
The first is paragraph 18, which refers to the role and the relations which the High Representative for the CFSP should have with Parliament.
I should like to ask the Council to bring Mr Solana to order.
The High Representative needs to learn that his relations with Parliament come within a certain framework and are governed by certain rules which he would do well to understand.
The second paragraph is Paragraph 19.
I was delighted at the excellent example set by the Belgian presidency this morning, when the President-in-Office of the Council reported to the European Parliament in person, and I should like to congratulate Mr Verhofstadt for this morning.
The third point, which I think is very important, is the huge issue of transparency. It is an issue which concerns all the institutional bodies of the European Union.
It has been raised by other Members, such as Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, who has done an excellent job on the issue of transparency, as, of course, has Mrs Maij-Weggen, but what I want to say to the Council is that European citizens are not just interested in what the Council decides; they are far more interested in why it decides what it does.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council functions poorly, which is also bad news for all the other EU institutions.
It is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the Commission.
The lack of transparency and efficiency, which have often been referred to here, also affect our work and give us a bad image in the eyes of the EU's citizens.
That is why reform of the Council is urgently necessary, as must be emphasised again and again.
Mr Poos has produced useful and valuable suggestions as to how such a reform might now be possible without the need for a new European Treaty.
I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives.
The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character.
I do not believe that the number of Councils on various sectors is the problem.
The problem is the deficient coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States.
Changes must be made here.
I believe we must follow up this idea of sending a permanent minister to Brussels who would take over the coordination of government policy at national level.
On Monday, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added further items to the agenda, for example, the issue of the Council Presidency when there are at least twenty-five Member States, or also how the European Council is to be defined.
What is that?
An organ, a super-board, or is it part of the Council?
This reform is urgently needed, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and we hope that you can do something even before Laeken, and that, in Laeken, the Council will again be on the agenda with a view to the future Treaty on the Union.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Poos for this report on the much-needed Council reforms.
We sometimes say in connection with the Pope that there is no need to be married to be able to talk about marriage.
However, in the case of Mr Poos, we can say that he has every right to talk about the Council as he has formed part of it for a very long time.
How badly the Council functions at crucial moments was evident at the Ghent Summit where three Prime Ministers had made prior arrangements outside of the Council, where the President of the Council made essential statements on the evaluation of the attacks on Afghanistan which were subsequently not backed by the Council, where various Prime Ministers made various statements following the European Summit, where decisions were taken on a payment issue of banks in relation to the euro, but where no decisions were made on crucial anti-terrorist measures proposed by the Commission and Parliament and where, to cap it all, an embarrassing dispute arose between the President of the Council and the President of the Commission.
That is how the Council comes across to the public.
And that negative image dominates the entire decision-making process and the way the Union is viewed throughout the Union.
How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union functions better and to improve the Council' s image with the citizen?
How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union' s entire institutional structure is more democratic and open?
In my opinion, a few factors are of crucial significance in this.
First of all, the Council must confine itself to its original brief, namely to express the view of the Member State governments, under the supervision of the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
Secondly, the Council must coordinate its tasks more effectively, thus ensuring that the General Affairs Council and the joint committees speak with one voice.
In my view, the number of joint committees could be cut down even further.
Thirdly, the General Affairs Council should function far more forcefully on the basis of solid positions of national members of government for European affairs, preferably in the capacity of Minister.
Belgium set a good example in this connection.
Fourthly, where legislation and the budget are concerned, all Council meetings should be public, which means that both discussions and decision-making should take place in public and reports that are compiled on these should also be made public.
Fifthly, in the case of legislation, including the budget, only ministers should be granted a right to vote, which means that it is not acceptable for them to be replaced by, for example, the permanent representative or by officials.
In my opinion, the Council should function entirely in line with its actual task as a Federal Council, much like its German model, so that it becomes crystal clear to the citizens what its role is in the democratic process of the Union.
I truly hope that the report by Mr Poos will play a key role in the forthcoming IGC and above all, I hope that the Council will take to heart what has been expressed here in Parliament in the way of criticism, but also the odd word of praise.
Mr President, people have a right to know how their representatives in government have acted and voted in the Council.
It is entirely unacceptable in a democracy for laws to be made behind closed and bolted doors on behalf of 380 million people and without there being any public scrutiny.
The most important position adopted in the European Parliament' s report on Council reform is therefore to be found in Paragraph 26, concerning the need for openness and stating the European Parliament' s request that, when the Council acts as legislator, both the deliberations and the votes should be in the public domain, as well as Parliament' s particular request that, at the beginning and end of all legislative procedures, public debates be held in accordance with Rule 8 of the Council' s Rules of Procedure and that Rule 9(1) of the Council' s Rules of Procedure be implemented.
It also states that the results of votes and the explanations of vote referring to legislative texts must be published.
Through this future openness, the European Union will be democratised.
It will lead to greater pressure being exercised by electorates and to greater supervision of the Council by national parliaments.
It is about time!
In turn, that will lead to growing demands for a concentration of the EU' s tasks and the need to limit the EU' s powers of decision-making.
In other words, the report we are adopting today will have long-term consequences.
I believe that we are thus coming significantly nearer the objective formulated by former Commission President Jacques Santer in 1995: Do fewer things, but do them better.
Thank you very much, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation.
Commissioner, Mr President, honourable MEPs, in two weeks' time, the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation will get underway in Doha, Qatar.
The European Union is making every effort to ensure that, on that occasion, a new trade round will commence on the basis of a broad and balanced agenda.
In this connection, the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council on 26 October 1999 will remain a point of reference.
The General Affairs Council of 8 October has underlined the importance of a new trade round.
Next week' s General Affairs Council will once again examine the state of affairs.
It is indeed important for a strong and united Union to leave for Doha.
You all know, of course, that it is the Commission that negotiates in matters of trade on behalf of the European Union - as is the case here - and that Commissioner Lamy, who will be taking the floor after me, plays an absolutely crucial and, in any case, very valued role in this.
For your information, I should like to add that the topic of the preparation of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation has also been discussed during the Social Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council, and, if I am not mistaken, this will also be done at the Environment Council, with a view to harmonising the positions, or at least, to being informed of the different sensitive issues.
A new round of broad-based negotiations must enable progress to be made in the further liberation and regulation of world trade, which is vital for a variety of reasons.
Firstly, the Conference will be taking place against a backdrop of a slowing down world economy, a situation which has been exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September which are having a negative impact on economic growth in both the industrial and developing countries.
An agreement on the start of a new round will thus give the world economy a powerful and positive signal.
Even during the most recent informal Council in Ghent, the EU Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission urged, and I quote: "to work actively towards launching of the WTO negotiations.
The current economic uncertainty means that trade liberalisation founded on a rules-based multilateral system and associated with a real development dimension is more important than ever, economically and politically" - end of quote.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new round of trade negotiations is also extremely important for the developing countries.
The round must enable us to improve the integration of developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, into the multilateral trade system, particularly by providing better market access, through measures that facilitate the implementation of agreements that have already been reached, and also through measures that seek to make more operational the special and differential treatment given to these countries.
Thirdly, a new round will aim to strengthen the WTO rules-based system, by clarifying and explaining existing provisions, particularly with regard to trade and the environment, and by extending the WTO' s scope to new areas such as investment, competition and trade facilitation, so that the WTO adjusts to the needs that have come about due to changes in the global economy and so that it responds to the concerns arising from globalisation.
The European Union will also attempt to promote multilateral governance by ensuring increased coherence and improved cooperation of the WTO with other international organisations, particularly with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in order to help to improve the way that globalisation is controlled.
(NL) I should like to underline that consequently, the European Union not only seeks to further liberalise world trade, it also seeks to further regulate world trade.
In fact, that reflects public opinion in the Member States perfectly.
Non-trade issues, further progress in terms of transparency of the World Trade Organisation mechanism, the preservation of the European model of government services and the special statute of those services are some of the interests which the European Union protects.
Together with the developing countries, a serious effort has been made over the past three years on the issue surrounding implementation.
That has made it possible to identify the relevant themes.
In some cases, these concern the application of the agreements, or a slight adjustment or interpretation of the text to be specified.
In other cases, these concern points which could well result in a formal change to the existing agreements.
All this slows down the process.
It is a process in which the European Union takes an active part, and is fully aware that this forms a key component for many countries.
I should like to point out that, alongside this effort involving the developing countries, an effort must also be made involving the so-called 'rich countries' which were originally, up until the beginning of this year, absolutely unconvinced - some more than others - of the fact that there is a real problem of implementation with regard to the developing countries.
(FR) Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for over a year, the European Union has played a central role in another important matter, namely trying to find a solution to enable the world' s poorest people to have proper and effective access to medicines.
The European Commission action plan in this area was approved by the General Affairs Council last May.
The European Union is working hard so that a clear statement on access to medicines and on the TRIPS agreement can be adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha.
Today, the WTO consultations are focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration and on the draft decision on implementation-related issues.
Two documents, which were tabled on 26 September by Stuart Harbison, the Chairman of the WTO General Council.
Many of the WTO members consider these documents to be a good basis for our work, and they will be amended in line with the negotiations that have taken place since they were published.
As far as the European Union is concerned, the draft Ministerial Declaration will take into account a whole raft of subjects that we consider to be crucial.
The document still, however, falls short of expectations in several areas.
Commissioner Pascal Lamy will no doubt comment on this issue in his speech, and the Commission will continue to strive to ensure that the Ministerial Declaration responds to the European Union' s concerns and interests.
We are taking an active part in the negotiations on the agenda of the new round with an open and flexible approach, and we are also particularly concerned about assisting developing countries whilst protecting the legitimate aims and objectives of the European Union.
While the various components that will feature in the new round and the implementation-related issues form a whole, the final assessment by the Union will be based on both the overall balance and on the balance within the various subjects that will be discussed.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, by way of conclusion, I should like to say that the purport of the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation is to further adjust the regulating effect of world trade, and that this conference offers us a chance to give the world economy a considerable boost by commencing a new trade round.
Finally, I should like to underline the positive political and economic significance of such a round.
It aims to reinforce international solidarity, curb inequality and to enhance the stability of the world and the world economy.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having organised this debate on the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation. There are two weeks to go before the conference opens and some lively discussions are now going on in Geneva and elsewhere on the negotiating programme that will be launched.
I would now like to say that, as negotiator for the European Union, it is very important to me that the European Parliament actively participates in this debate.
As you know, we fought together, at the previous Intergovernmental Conference - at which the Treaty of Nice, as we call it, was draw up - in order to enhance Parliament' s competences in the area of trade policy.
As you also know, the Member States did not adopt our proposals.
In these circumstances, the Commission is doing everything in its power, within the framework imposed on us by the Treaty, to inform the European Parliament and to involve it in the Union' s trade policy.
You also know that we are in favour of creating a consultative parliamentary body at the WTO, to enhance the role of Members in the multilateral trading system.
I am convinced that, if we want the support of public opinion, if we want to improve the WTO' s legitimacy, then enhancing the role of Members in the WTO' s work is not only possible, but also, and above all, it is necessary.
So, what is in the negotiating programme proposed by the European Union?
On several occasions over the last two years, since Seattle, we have had the opportunity to come together to discuss the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference.
The exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied.
The considerations and concerns that you have voiced during these meetings are very similar to those of the Commission.
Like us, you want a negotiating programme on the liberalisation of trade and investment, to meet the needs of our exporters and those of developing countries.
But, like us, you also want an agenda that focuses on the drafting of new rules, the clarification of current rules and the linking-up of World Trade Organisation rules and those of other international bodies in the areas of society, the environment, health or food safety.
It is these rules that will provide greater market efficiency, better social development and sufficient environmental protection.
We believe that the key to sustainable development of the planet as a whole hinges on our ability to combine the opening-up of the markets with the application of multilateral rules.
This is why there are three subjects on the agenda supported by the European Union since the Seattle meeting. These are market access, regulation and the integration of developing countries; the unity of these three subjects is guaranteed by what is called the single undertaking.
Lastly, we want to hold intense negotiations and come to swift conclusions.
Some may be surprised that the tragic events of 11 September have changed neither course nor our schedule.
I would like to briefly explain this.
Even before 11 September, we believed that an approach based on the principle of well-ordered liberalisation was required.
This has become even more necessary since the terrorist attacks took place.
The process of opening up markets, regulating trade, integrating developing countries and the concern to ensure environmental and social sustainability - we need these more now than ever before.
These are issues of stability and security, both in relations between countries and between generations.
Dialogue, negotiation and peaceful resolution to commercial conflicts have made international trade a laboratory for international governance, where each partner participates in decision-making.
Faced with the instability caused by the attacks, we must further strengthen the importance of the multilateral dimension, which we believe to be the best way to give today' s de facto globalisation a legal status.
Of course, the WTO is only one of the pillars making up a multilateral system, which must meet the challenges of globalisation.
A round of World Trade Organisation negotiations is therefore necessary, of course, but it is in no way sufficient.
We must also strengthen the other institutions of governance, the environment, social development, development funding and policy support agencies.
Let us now consider the prospects for the Ministerial Conference, which will take place in two weeks' time.
Generally speaking, I think that we are in a better position than we were at this stage before the Seattle conference.
The preparatory work is being carried out in a spirit of positive cooperation.
The belief that the multilateral system must now, more than ever, be an essential part of growth and prosperity is widely shared.
And I think we must also point out that the open, constructive spirit and the efforts made by many partners - such as ourselves, the United States, and an increasing number of developing countries - have already helped to partly reconcile the differing views that prevented Seattle from being a success.
This came across very clearly at the last informal select meeting of WTO trade ministers, which was held in Singapore on 13 and 14 October and which I attended.
I feel that this was also correctly reflected at the meeting of APEC trade ministers (Pacific-rim countries) that took place last week.
I think that we have now reached a point where we can envisage an ambitious, balanced round that meets the primary objectives of the European Union.
Of course, we have not yet achieved this goal.
We are now entering the final and crucial stage, in the run-up to Doha.
As you know, a draft Ministerial Declaration, which will constitute the framework of negotiations for the new round, was published on 26 September 2001.
All the members of the WTO considered this document to be a sound basis for moving forward.
Of course, no one was fully satisfied, which, if you are familiar with the culture at the WTO, is more or less a good sign prior to negotiations.
Obviously, not everything in this document is acceptable, not even for us, and I shall outline to you the main areas of difficulty, which require further work.
The first difficulty concerns trade and the environment, areas that give us particular cause for concern due to the lack of ambitious proposals.
Clearly, we hope to make the framework for negotiation much more substantial.
Progress is being made in some areas, but we must admit that most of our partners in developing countries are still hesitant, to say the least, about the idea of accepting negotiations on this subject.
We shall do everything we can in the following days to improve this situation.
I also made it clear to my colleagues, in Singapore, that a framework on this issue was not only a political necessity for the European Union, but should also be of interest to all the members of the World Trade Organisation and of the multilateral system as a whole.
I think that the message concerning the political importance that this question holds for us has got through.
We still need to draw operational consequences from this.
The second difficulty, after environment, is agriculture, which is still a very sensitive subject.
The draft declaration before us seems to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations in several respects, since it aims, in particular, to phase out subsidy categories, which goes further than the framework that Franz Fischler and myself received...
Mr Lamy, I must ask you to interrupt your speech.
As you will all, of course, understand, this is an exercise in evacuating the Parliament building.
We shall adjourn the sitting and leave the Chamber immediately.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to follow the instructions given by Parliament' s security staff calmly and orderly, and to leave by the emergency exits.
This sitting is now adjourned, and will resume as soon as the bells indicate that work can be resumed as normal.
(The sitting was interrupted at 16.35 due to a fire drill and resumed at 17.10)
Mr President, I shall carry on with what I was saying before this brief interruption, which is that the draft statement for the Doha Conference, currently on the table, raises a number of issues with regard to the environment and agriculture, and now I shall talk about the social aspect. We are not completely satisfied with some aspects of the statement either, specifically with the way it deals with the social domain.
We feel that it is treated too sparingly and should be extended to more appropriately reflect the importance of this issue for our societies and our own ambition, for such is the mandate I was given, to establish an international and multi-institutional dialogue on this subject.
With regard to investment and competition, we are unhappy with one of the options put forward, which is to limit ourselves to working programmes.
In our opinion, working programmes cannot replace negotiations, even if it does make sense that there should be a connection between a working programme and a negotiation, provided, of course, that this is agreed in advance.
The issue of the relationship between health and intellectual property, which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned, is also problematic.
As you know, we are very committed to this matter and we are working actively on reconciling the more extreme positions so that a substantial political statement can be agreed on in Doha, reconciling the flexibility of the agreement on intellectual property with, on the one hand, the need of developing countries for access to essential medicines and, on the other, the concern to ensure that innovation through research can take place.
These are our concerns and other delegations will obviously have their own concerns about the ministerial statement.
For a number of developing countries, the implementation of existing WTO agreements, or in many cases, their adaptation, is of the utmost importance and we must, we feel, be willing to respond openly and creatively to these concerns.
Some of the least advanced countries have a real problem of lack of capacity and resources and a solution must be found to this problem in the future work of the World Trade Organisation.
Despite the concerns that I have highlighted, most of the WTO member countries seem increasingly willing to show the necessary flexibility and openness to sufficiently conduct ambitious negotiations in Doha in terms of substance, and I am beginning to think that we might be able to see our four priorities met there: trade liberalisation, further regulation, the inclusion of development at the top of the multilateral agenda and the integration of our objectives for sustainable development into the WTO.
All of these aspects are designed to ensure that we give greater consideration to our fellow citizens' concerns.
On behalf of the Commission, I hope that the resolution you will be voting on tomorrow will provide clear and powerful support for these European Union objectives.
With a vote in favour, you will be strengthening our negotiating hand and sending a political signal to our trading partners and to the general public, that the European Union will not simply be taking a 'business as usual' approach to these negotiations.
To conclude, I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the Members of this Parliament who will be joining our delegation to Doha, and the positive and cooperative approach between us that I would say we developed in Seattle.
This is, in any event, the result of the questionnaire that I sent to you at the time, to which most members of the delegation replied, and I count on your active support to promote what is, in my view, our common agenda.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner Lamy, it is my pleasure to be able to state on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the major Parliamentary Groups have found it very easy to reach agreement on the joint statement which we will decide on tomorrow following this discussion.
This shows that on certain major questions a general view predominates over party lines.
We have not seen much of Commissioner Pascal Lamy over the past few months, and for once I can say that we are glad about this.
He had energetically and skilfully shuttled all over the world trying to create a basis for a new WTO negotiation round; on which a decision needs to be taken in Doha in mid-November.
In the midst of all this, however, Commissioner Lamy has found time to do a good and adequate job of briefing the Parliamentary delegation that is leaving for Doha.
We must thank him for this also; of course I was not to know that his message is so explosive that a fire drill would have to be arranged during it.
My group fully supports the negotiation line that the Council had already decided for the Seattle conference.
The new negotiation round to develop the liberalisation of world trade and rules of the game must treat matters on a broad basis so that we can strengthen sustainable economic growth; reinforce, develop and renew a trading system based on global rules; and ensure that its benefits are shared out equitably.
We are also happy with the idea that the meeting will be held in Qatar.
Now, if ever, it must be shown that we cannot be intimidated by terrorism; instead, we shall continue - on the 'business as usual' principle - with our policies of international cooperation for the sake of freer and fairer trade.
This must also work towards a better environment, social development, the reduction of poverty, and human rights.
There are some who would like to eliminate free trade, abolish the WTO and return to bilaterally regulated trade.
This road, ladies and gentlemen, would be a road to protectionism, and then on to trade wars and also, subsequently, to possible armed conflicts.
It would be a road which would make all enemies of freedom, democracy, the State under the rule of law, social development and human rights nod with satisfaction.
I would like to thank all my colleagues who have worked so hard in order to bring about a Parliamentary meeting in connection with the Doha meeting.
I would like to mention by name my colleagues Erika Mann and Konrad Schwaiger.
We have heard today that there is still uncertainty about the mission from the United States Congress.
We must indeed hope that at least as strong a delegation arrives from the United States Congress as from here; without them we will be a bit one-sided.
I believe that during the next few years we can develop Parliamentary monitoring of world trade; this is important in order to open up to citizens the work of an organisation such as the WTO and, through this, to seeking approval of the activity falling within its sphere.
Mr President, it appears that Doha has sounded the alarm bells here in this House.
Over the past two years, the WTO has been under fire on many occasions, with good reason.
Some of the critics claim that there is so much wrong with the WTO that we should not start a new trade round until the problems surrounding, for example, fair access to the world market for developing countries, the lack of democracy and decision-making within the WTO and the imbalance between trade and non-trade issues have been resolved.
We, the Social-Democrats, however, have reached the opposite conclusion.
These problems must be solved as an absolute priority, and it is precisely by starting a new trade round that this can be achieved most effectively.
Only then will reform be truly possible.
The PSE Group gives its unqualified support to a new trade round with a broad-based agenda aimed at economic and political reform.
It is quite simple: we know that trade stimulates growth, attracts investment and creates employment, both within and outside Europe.
The world economy is now poised between recession and recovery.
The recession as a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September gives the perpetrators ultimate triumph.
Who stands to suffer most from these attacks?
The world' s poorest of the poor.
The World Bank expects that the terrorist attacks will cut economic growth in the developing countries from 5 to 2.5%.
The expected growth and effects are approximately another ten million people under the poverty line and an added 20 000 to 40 000 children under five who will die.
That is a disaster.
A new trade round is necessary in order to restore confidence in the world economy to some extent and to open the way to renewed sustainable growth.
We also know, however, that trade on its own is not enough.
Without an adequate regulating mechanism, we run too great a risk of the trade benefits being distributed very unevenly indeed and of the environment and social standards coming off worst.
That is why in the negotiations with other groups on the resolution, we, as the PSE Group, insisted that the Fourth Ministerial Conference' s first priority should be to tackle worldwide poverty, reforms, democracy and the relationship between trade and non-trade issues.
Why?
Think of the impact of the WTO rules on matters such as the environment, safe food, workers' rights or the freedom of governments to regulate public services without running the risk of being taken to court by profit-seeking multinationals.
To the Social-Democrats, the fundamental objective of institutions such as the WTO is to bring worldwide processes such as globalisation under political control, enabling us to steer these processes in accordance with democratic, political choices.
It is therefore our greatest challenge, together with many developing countries, together with many reform-minded and sound NGOs, in the face of opposition from the neo-Liberals, but also from a number of our fellow MEPs here in Parliament and that section of the anti-globalists who oppose a new round, to start this new round nevertheless.
The Fourth Ministerial Conference is a key moment in the debate on globalisation, including the socio-economic security aspects of this debate.
If the programme for the forthcoming three-yearly trade round compiled at the Ministerial Conference does not provide a solid basis for progress in the field of democracy, the fight against poverty, environmental protection, growth in developing countries and the protection of public services, then we, as Social-Democrats, fear the worst for the course of the current debate on globalisation, and eventually the very concept of globalisation itself.
This is the message of the resolution which, we hope, will be adopted tomorrow.
We support a new trade round.
We are in favour of free trade which is fair and supports the citizens throughout the world.
Finally, a word about the acid test in all of this.
We hope that those cheap medicines which the President talked about in plain terms will also prove to be a true test, for without it we cannot imagine that this new round could be successful.
We wish Mr Pascal Lamy every success, for he is doing fantastically well so far.
He has a great relationship with our Parliament, for which we are very grateful to him.
Mr President, firstly I should like to extend our congratulations to both the Council and the Commission for what seems to be a much improved preparation for this meeting, compared to the methodological confusion that seemed to reign prior to Seattle.
We hope it will bear fruit in a couple of weeks' time.
As a group we are also very keen that we should learn the lessons from Seattle and not use the launch of the round, or the text for the launch of the round, to somehow foreshadow or preclude the conclusion of the round.
That is obviously a lesson well-learnt and we applaud the attempts to keep the document which will be discussed in Doha as crisp and brief as possible.
