To this end, we would ask for the urgent mobilisation of the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund for Galicia, which has been devastated by fire and which is facing a very serious ecological, economic and social situation.
Â Â  â Every year fires consume a significant proportion of Europeâs forests.
This year has sadly been no exception.
With climate change and global warming, the portents are not good.
Natural disasters cannot be avoided, yet precautions can be taken right now by complying with the Kyoto Protocol and by setting out an appropriate forestry policy.
In Portugal 420Â 000 hectares were burnt in 2003, and 320Â 000 in 2005.
This year, by the end of August 59Â 000 hectares had been burnt, which is terrible, not least because protected areas have been burnt and there have been victims to mourn.
It should also be acknowledged, however, that major efforts have been undertaken and enormous investment made in prevention and on-the-spot firefighting; a permanent monitoring system has been put in place involving the security forces, the armed forces and many young people; helicopter brigades have been set up to fight the fires during their first minutes; and there have been days on which more than 500 fires have been detected.
There has been major investment in the training of firefighters and in the creation of professional forest firefighting teams, and I should like to pay tribute to their dedication and hard work.
In Portugal and in other countries great efforts have been made, but more needs to be done.
The Commission must adopt the proposals put forward by Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, this summer there have again been numerous fires in several countries of southern Europe.
They have been especially devastating in Spain, particularly in Galicia.
This year in Galicia, the fires exposed the inefficiency and lack of planning of the regional government.
This very much exacerbated the consequences of the disaster: 4 fatalities, more than 500 wounded, more than 100Â 000 hectares burnt, 4% of Galiciaâs wooded area burnt, serious environmental damage and, furthermore, serious repercussions for livestock farming, the tourism industry, etc.
This black August has also caused deep alarm throughout Galician society: Cerdedo, Soutomaior, Ponte Caldelas, Pontevedra, Meis, Santiago, PadrÃ³n, Muros, Vimianzo, AviÃ³n and Quiroga are some of the many municipalities affected by the fires in Galicia this summer.
The Galicians are a Europeanist people.
They know that, as Goethe said, Europe was created on the road to Santiago de Compostela, and, as an Objective 1 region, Galicia is aware of the role that the Structural and Cohesion Funds have played in its development.
I would also like to point out that, in Galicia, the number of âyesâ votes in last yearâs referendum on the European Constitution was far higher than the average for the rest of Spain.
Galicia is now expecting the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund to be mobilised, which, furthermore, will help to improve the Unionâs image.
Nevertheless, more measures to prevent any repetition of this kind of disaster are needed.
We must therefore make progress with the construction of a European civil protection system capable of responding quickly and effectively to the disasters that take place almost every summer and which affect the forests of southern Europe in particular.
The European Union must also pay more attention to the continentâs forest wealth in terms of preventing fires.
In this regard, I am not sure whether the coming dismantling of the Forest Focus programme within the Life + programme is good news.
Furthermore, as this Parliament has said on many occasions, we need a European directive in the field of forest fires and drought.
Neither Galicia, Spain nor Europe can resign themselves to the continued disappearance of our forests, as if that were their unavoidable fate.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am delighted to have with us today Commissioner Dimas, who is particularly sensitive to the question of natural disasters, given that this year fires swept through once again, especially in the countries of southern Europe.
We note that the fires intensify every year, despite the fact that we have more and more aeroplanes available for putting them out.
That is because we are changing â or rather we have changed â and we are downgrading the climate of the planet, thereby exacerbating the greenhouse effect.
In my country, Greece, there was a truly huge disaster in Halkidiki and Mani.
In Halkidiki, one of the most beautiful â perhaps the most beautiful â and one of the most important tourist destinations in Greece, 60Â 000 decares were burned, causing huge damage both to the environment and to tourism and farming.
The victims need immediate compensation and the burnt areas need immediate â I repeat immediate â protection against the risk of the soil being washed away.
Preventive measures for the future and a new fire policy need to be applied.
We need to examine the possibility of replanting with trees that stop fires and which do not burn as easily as pine.
Lastly, we need to examine again what sort of Europe we want.
If we do not help our fellow sufferers now, then what sort of a Europe of solidarity are we talking about?
If we are not generous to those who have been destroyed, then we should not be surprised if the people soon stop following us.
If we do not stand by the people who have been destroyed, then we shall lose their trust and such a Europe certainly has no future.
We need to examine the issue beyond the question of the fires.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, I myself was hemmed in by flames while on holiday in Halkidiki, and saw two thousand people gasping for breath.
In such a situation, one wonders what could have been done better beforehand.
First of all, of course, I want to thank the emergency services, who did their utmost with promptness and speed, but I also want to thank the Greek Government for organising everything so very well, and with the help of the Greek Navy, for managing to save over a thousand lives.
What I regard as vital in a case such as this is an improvement in communications facilities.
I can remember trying to dial 112 â the emergency number.
When one is in a state of panic, numbers get confused, so it would certainly be a good idea to automate this to some extent.
I also think it important that we in Europe should set up a civil protection force, the primary function of which would be to resolve the problems arising in disaster situations of this kind, and which would be able to try to get the situation under control as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Such a strategy for natural disasters is a core challenge.
If there is to be cooperation not only between the armed forces, the rescue services, the fire brigade and the police, but also between all the bodies with responsibility in such situations, they need a suitable communications platform in order to be able to help each other rapidly and effectively.
Something else of importance would be a European observatory to make information available.
I had to telephone, from Greece, the APA press service in Austria in order to find out the actual extent of the disaster.
It was very interesting to see that the Austrian office very quickly got in touch with the Greeks, and it was this that enabled the Navy to save many peopleâs lives.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very positive contributions to tonightâs discussion.
A very wide and rich range of issues was raised, from trans-boundary pollution â fires in Russia, which should of course be raised in the framework of EU-Russia cooperation â to stricter criminal laws regarding arson and arsonists, which lie within the exclusive competence of the Member States.
The European Union mechanism for civil protection is a relatively new instrument with limited resources, limited means and competences, but recent experience shows that it works: it is a real example of European Union added value.
Having said this, when dealing with natural disasters there is no room for complacency and it is clear that our prevention, preparedness and response activities can still be improved.
This is why earlier this year the Commission prepared a legislative proposal to reinforce the mechanism both politically and operationally.
For example, the proposal will allow for the mobilisation of extra transport equipment and will provide a platform upon which to contribute to the development of early warning systems.
In April 2005, the Commission also presented a proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies.
One part of this proposal provides the legal framework for the future financing of civil protection operations and will result in a budget of EURÂ 119 million over a seven-year period.
This is an improvement on previous levels of funding but, as I have mentioned many times before, the Commission can only respond to the ambitious requests made by other institutions if sufficient resources are made available.
Mrs Estrela, we have an ancient proverb, ÎŽÎµÎ¯ ÎŽÎ® ÏÏÎ·ÎŒÎ¬ÏÏÎœ â money is needed.
Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!
Both these instruments are currently being negotiated by the Council.
The Commission would like to have them adopted by the end of the year once Parliamentâs opinion is available.
I would also like to offer specific thanks for Parliamentâs initiative to earmark an additional EUR 6.5Â million in the civil protection budget for 2006.
This has allowed the Commission to launch an initiative to design, develop and test European approaches to joint civil protection intervention.
This cooperation and coordination will make our fight against natural disasters â such as the floods in several European countries, or the summer forest fires in Spain, for which assistance was requested by the Spanish authorities on 9 August â even more effective.
On the specific question of forest fires, which was raised by a number of Members, it is necessary to note as I have before that forestry matters are a Member State competence.
Member States are responsible for launching actions to protect forests threatened by fire, as well as restoration efforts.
The main aim of the measures we take at European Union level is to reinforce the Member Statesâ policies.
These measures include the possibility of financial support available under the new Rural Development Regulation, the Forest Focus Regulation and, from 2007, the Commissionâs proposal for LIFE Plus, which explicitly provides for the possibility of financing forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention activities in order to continue the work of the Forest Forum.
Let us look towards the future.
The Commission is preparing a study to look at the effectiveness of Community measures for forest protection and at options to improve the effectiveness of these measures.
The results of these analyses are expected by the end of 2007.
The Commission has proposed a directive under the codecision procedure on the assessment and management of floods, which I hope will be adopted soon.
The Commission has also undertaken preparatory work with regard to the threat of droughts, which become more intensive and frequent each year, particularly, but not only, in the southern parts of Europe.
We are engaged in discussions with the Member States to collect information and to assess whether similar legislative action is needed.
Quite a few speakers referred to the Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, which does not allow the Commission to mobilise the fund on its own initiative.
It is necessary for the Member State concerned to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage.
To date, no such application has been received from the Spanish Government.
The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the regulation for mobilising the fund are met.
The rules governing this instrument allow for the possibility of assistance in the event of major natural disasters. To qualify for aid, the estimated cost of total direct damage must exceed EUR 3Â billion at 2002 prices, or 0.6% of gross national income of the state in question, whichever is lower.
The Solidarity Fund is not designed to support general longer-term prevention measures for the rehabilitation of agricultural production potential.
In such cases, other potential sources of funding exist at Community level, including projects co-financed by the structural funds.
In addition, several possibilities of response to national disaster exist within the common agricultural policy.
In 2006, the Commissionâs civil protection mechanism responded to floods, earthquakes, forest fires, marine pollution and emergencies with a humanitarian dimension.
Four European countries requested assistance in the spring floods, even though a greater number were eventually affected.
We sent experts to all sorts of situations, from coordinating the European effort in Cyprus and Lebanon to assisting the Indonesian authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake and the eruption of a volcano.
We sent emergency supplies such as medicines, medical supplies, food and shelter.
We dispatched equipment to pump water and to extinguish fires.
With your support we shall continue to better prepare ourselves and to improve our response for the benefit of the Member States and those we seek to help.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is a Commission statement on the situation in DR Congo.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obviously a pleasure for me to find myself back here today before this Parliament in order to discuss a country that is particularly dear to my heart â the Democratic Republic of Congo â and, more specifically, in order to discuss the electoral process that is currently under way there.
You will recall that, after the Lusaka ceasefire agreements were signed in July 1999, the European Union and the European Commission worked tirelessly alongside Congo not only to restore peace and stability there, but also to restore peace and stability throughout the Great Lakes region.
It is with a certain pride, I believe, that we can say today that the peace and democracy process in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the rare cases in which the European Union has been able to show itself to be a real political player by deploying all of its external policy instruments.
It is worth pointing out, in this regard, the increased importance of development cooperation in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, which had been suspended for more than a decade, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Security and Defence Policy, the appointment of a special envoy and the only military operations conducted outside Europe: Artemis in 2003, in order to bring peace to Ituri, and now EUFOR, in order to directly support a United Nations peacekeeping mission and an election observation mission led by your fellow Member, General Morillon, and in which a good number of you have participated.
I am delighted that so many diplomatic and financial efforts should have finally led to a first round ballot of the presidential election and the legislative elections being held on 30Â July.
This first brush with democracy, after more than 40 years, occurred under what can be described as model conditions, given the overall situation in the country.
The election observation mission was able to observe first hand the objective difficulties that the country and its population are experiencing.
In spite of these difficulties and the disturbances that took place in the wake of the provisional publication of the first round presidential election results, this is an important result, with which we can only be satisfied.
I can assure you that, throughout this process, the task has not been easy for anyone, and especially not for the people of Congo and their leaders, who have inherited a country that has been divided and rocked by years of war.
A country in which 30 years of poor governance and corruption have destroyed the institutional capacities of the rule of law, irreparably damaged the basic infrastructure and profoundly altered the socio-economic fabric and social organisation.
These elections represent a unique opportunity to draw a line once and for all under the bad practices of the past, which have led the country into bankruptcy, plunged it into the depths of war and dragged it into the vicious circle of under-development and poverty.
Congo possesses considerable natural resources, occupies a strategic position at the crossroads of Central Africa, and has high-quality human resources; I firmly believe that Congo will be called upon one day to play a major role in the stabilisation and development of the whole of Africa if good governance, the rule of law, human rights and the key elements to which Congo has subscribed by ratifying the Cotonou Agreement are fully respected in there.
Thanks to the work done thus far, there is now an opportunity to really lay new institutional and administrative foundations in the country and to embark upon â and I am by no means exaggerating here â a radical reform of the State.
It is not the interest of a few individuals that is at stake here, but clearly that of the whole of Congo and its population, and we, the European Union, have a moral obligation to respond in an effective and clear-sighted manner to this requirement that the people of Congo are voicing out loud.
The deplorable events that, on 20, 21 and 22Â August, followed the provisional publication of the results, have not, in my opinion, done anything to taint the symbolic value of this major act in the history of Congo.
Through their massive turnout at the elections and their model behaviour, the people of Congo have taught their leaders and their politicians a great and fine lesson in democracy and good citizenship, one that cannot go without being mentioned.
With the second round of the presidential election, scheduled for 29Â October 2006, in prospect, the two presidential candidates must therefore be called on by all possible means to submit to the verdict of the ballot boxes and, above all, to respect the results unconditionally.
In this connection, I also wanted to point out the importance, which has often been overlooked until now, of the results of the legislative elections. These results will determine the majority in parliament, from which the prime minister and future government will have to derive.
Indeed, the new Constitution provides the country with the institutional structure of a modern country in which the separation of powers guarantees a balance of forces and in which the government is called upon to be accountable to its citizens by regularly submitting to elections.
In spite of the difficulties over the last few days, the aim of the European Unionâs action in DRC can only be to make a success of a transitional process that must hinge on the establishment of new authorities and institutions on the basis of the results that will come from the ballot boxes, in line with the international standards of transparency and reliability in electoral matters.
It is clear that the situation remains tense and that this tension is liable to mount further as the election campaign and the date of 29Â October, which has been set for the second round, draw near.
It is therefore vital that the international community continues closely and constantly to monitor the situation on the ground.
In this connection, I am convinced that MONUC and EUFOR and the people of Congo will be able to do a great deal to help prevent outbursts and acts of violence in Kinshasa.
Faced with these objective difficulties, some early, encouraging signs are reaching us from the ground.
Under the auspices of the United Nations, a joint committee on the Kinshasa events has just been put in place; it will be divided into two sub-committees, an independent investigation sub-committee, which will be in charge of establishing the facts about the events of 20, 21 and 22Â August in Kinshasa, and a sub-committee that will have the task of defining the codes of conduct necessary for the election campaign, ahead of the second round of the presidential election and post-election period, to go off peacefully, in accordance with the will of the Congolese people.
The two parties have also promised to cooperate fully with the independent investigation committee and have committed themselves to working in favour of the electoral process, in accordance with the global and inclusive agreement, signed in Pretoria.
To this end, the two sub-committees began their work on 30Â August 2006.
On the other hand, it is important for the other African players, particularly the African Union and South Africa, to commit themselves to taking a leading role in the actions aimed at bringing President Kabila and Vice-President Bemba closer together, in the common interest of the nation.
As regards the European Commission, I am pleased to inform you that I have just agreed to the request put to us by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to help in covering the USDÂ 46Â million financial gap in the electoral process by contributing an additional EURÂ 16Â million; the Communityâs total contribution to the electoral process will therefore increase to EURÂ 165Â million.
I can also confirm to you that the election observation mission, placed under the control of General Morillon, will continue to monitor the progress of the electoral process, in this interim period, until its conclusion.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, responsibility for Commissioner Michelâs statement lies with him himself and with the Commission; he alone bears responsibility for a statement he made some time ago in an interview.
The Committee on Development discussed this with the Commissioner a week ago, and as far as I am concerned that lays the matter to rest.
There is one lesson, though, that we must learn from what has happened, and it is that what is said in this House on the subject of the Congo may well not always be listened to here, but a very great deal of attention will be paid to it there, as we have been obliged â painfully â to learn.
Let every one of us, then, be careful in what we say in our contributions to this debate.
This very evening, the results of the parliamentary elections and the outcome of the scrutiny by the Supreme Court are expected.
That is the moment at which the first round of the presidential election can be regarded as over.
Even though it is fundamentally improper that we should be debating the Congo at this point in time, let us, here in this House, congratulate the Congolese people and its independent electoral commission, whose dedicated work, patience and tenacity have made this first electoral round a success.
Let us hope, for our own sake and for that of the Congolese people, that the first national assembly to be elected for forty years may be able to convene and commence its work. It will help to stabilise the country.
It will be for us an important partner in dialogue.
Let us play our part in preparing the provincial elections; Europe and its Member States must play an effective supportive role, not only in the electoral process from beginning to end, but also in the subsequent period of reconstruction.
As MrÂ Morillon will confirm, the EUâs election monitoring commission is staying put, and the UN is making its own considerable contribution.
MONUC and EUFOR have found their roles and enjoy respect, and we MEPs will observe the forthcoming round of elections.
It is cause for hope that the Congo has such a considerable potential as a democracy, but the process of democratisation is under threat from agile forces with which we are familiar, and on which we need to exert influence.
Let us then persuade them that it is in their interest too that peaceful democratic elections should meet with success, and that the authority of a legitimate state should come into being; that is the only chance for the Congo and its people.
Â Â  . â I took part in Parliamentâs Electoral Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I visited more than 40 polling stations in various parts of Kinshasa and I had the opportunity to observe the work of one of these polling stations in Dima, just one of the 250Â 000-plus around the country, until the last vote had been counted.
I admired the patient dedication of the Congolese people â men and women, people working in polling stations and voters.
They all said to me, with moving seriousness, that the authenticity of the peopleâs choice â the choice of the 25Â million-plus registered voters in a logistical operation of epic proportions â would depend on their commitment and vigilance in carrying out their electoral duties and that, in turn, peace, democracy and the countryâs development would depend on that choice.
This operation, and indeed the entire transitional process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2003, could not have come this far were it not for the European Union.
The election should therefore be a source of pride not only for the Congolese people, but also for Europe, which provided 80% of the funding for the presidential and legislative elections, with the European Commission contributing EURÂ 165Â million.
The EUâs involvement in the DRC since the terrible war that devastated the country has been the best example of the implementation on the ground of Europe's security doctrine: humanitarian and development aid, technical support for demobilising and disarming militias, the maintenance of the political process and use of the instruments of European security and defence policy, with any additional resources used coherently to achieve a single goal, namely a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Congo, in control of its resources for the peopleâs benefit.
As regards EUFOR, the European military force which, since the 30Â July election, has played a key role in reducing tensions between the forces of the two presidential candidates, MrÂ Kabila and MrÂ Bemba, consideration should be given to the idea of extending its tour of duty until the new government takes office towards the end of January, in order to guarantee that the electoral process is carried through to a successful conclusion.
It would be a serious mistake to leave the job only half done, because the transitional process remains poised on a knife-edge.
The fighting in the capital in August between the presidential guard and MrÂ Bemba's militias demonstrates that the main political actors are still prepared to resort to armed violence.
It also shows up the inability to form a unified national army, which has perhaps been the biggest and most dangerous failure in the transition process.
According to the International Crisis Group, the task of integrating the armed forces has been only half completed.
It is not only Azarias Ruberwa and Jean-Pierre Bemba who retain private armies.
PresidentÂ Kabila himself has failed to submit his presidential guard to the process, and it was his forces who set off the armed hostilities that took place in August.
Whatever the result of the election, the international communityâs priority should be to demobilise the militias and help set up a single Congolese army viewed by the Congolese people as a force for stability and democratic authority.
Right now, however, it is not Congolese or European weapons that will guarantee the ultimate success of the electoral process.
That will primarily depend on Congolese men and women, such as the independent candidate for Parliament, Eve Bazaiba Masudi, member of the Kafko NGO, which is made up of women fighting courageously for peace, democracy and human rights, in close coordination with MONUC, the United Nations Mission in the DRC.
Eve Bazaiba Masudi and other women representing Congolese civil society are seeking to mediate and to hold the warlords to account.
These women deserve the EUâs support, and I trust that the Commissionâs delegation and the committee chaired by GeneralÂ Morillon, whose outstanding work thus far I wish to commend, can support these people who are bringing peace and dialogue.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as head of the European Union election observation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I have stayed in that country on many occasions, Commissioner, since the Commission entrusted me with the responsibility for the mission in October.
An entire book could be written on the exceptional adventure embarked upon by the people of Congo in order to provide themselves with democratic institutions with the help of the international community and of the European Union, in particular.
I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30Â July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections.
Just after that first round, I had the satisfaction, on 1Â August, of signing, together with my counterparts from throughout the world, from the African Union, from the French-speaking community and from the Carter Foundation, a joint declaration that was basically designed to point out how impressed we were â and I quote â with the strong turnout of Congolese male and female voters and with the participation of the political party witnesses and the national observers in the election of 30Â July.
In congratulating the people of Congo for the calm and dignified atmosphere in which these elections took place, we were urging the candidates â and I quote again â to respect the choices of the Congolese people and to use legal means of redress in the event of a dispute.
Finally, we were calling on them to develop the peace process observed and to make a lasting contribution on the road to national reconciliation and to the rebuilding of the country.
This appeal was sadly not heard by the most diehard supporters of the two candidates who were well ahead in the first round and, shortly before the provisional results were announced, on Sunday 20Â August, they began to confront each other in the very heart of the capital, before reaching the stage, late in the afternoon on the Monday, of fighting with heavy weapons around the residence of the senior vice-president, in which the members of the international transitional aid committee, chaired by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Bill Swing, were gathered.
It was only thanks to the assistance of a security operation put in place by the general commanding the MONUC forces, with the support of the European-led forces of EUFOR, that the hostages were able to be set free and the madmen forced to return to their camp.
I was therefore pleased to have championed in this Chamber the setting-up of that force and I felt proud â you are right, Commissioner â to be European, because it was the remarkably effective intervention of the European Union that enabled a swift return to calm.
We should also once again congratulate the people of Kinshasa, who refused to let themselves be led into murdering and looting again, as they were being called on to do by the staunchest of those who remained opposed to any democratic revolution.
The calm that has prevailed since then throughout the country may offer hope that those people will no longer cause any harm.
It is up to us to demonstrate the greatest vigilance and to continue to use all of our political and, if need be, military, weight to put pressure on the two candidates that are still in contention until the second round of the presidential elections, scheduled for 29Â October.
Then, and in accordance with the Constitution, the power, Commissioner, will return to the people, by means of its elected parliament.
That is what the people of Congo aspire to.
That is what we must continue to help them achieve.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has committed itself financially and politically, with a great deal of determination, to the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we can only be delighted at that.
The same goes for the desire expressed by the Congolese people to finally be able to choose their leaders by themselves, and for Europeâs support in this area, provided that this support is perceived as being completely neutral, something that has posed problems recently.
That being said, the situation remains very tense, and while it is clear that these elections seem to be necessary or urgent, after so many years of war, chaos and victims, they will not be enough to put right a country that still has serious problems, starting with extreme poverty and a high level of violence, which regularly undermine the efforts to establish the rule of law.
Controlling the trafficking and trade in weapons, setting up an effective police force and judicial system and bringing the most serious criminals before the International Criminal Court are the requirements for consolidating peace.
This situation of impunity has just as serious an effect on health issues.
Besides the shortage of health care personnel to which DoctorÂ Mukwege, who practises in the west of Congo, drew our attention in Brussels, in May, there are also the mass rapes and inhumane treatment inflicted on women that must be combated relentlessly. This must be done by also relying on the abilities of the local communities to organise themselves, to restore acceptable daily living conditions, and to denounce and punish acts of violence.
Will the new elected leaders of DRC be able to put a stop to this violence?
It is justifiable to be worried, especially given the unrest that followed the announcement of the presidential election results, which do, however, still offer an opportunity to both of the candidates who finished first in the elections.
In the event of serious unrest, what exactly would EUFORâs mandate be?
Finally, the mineral and forestry resources in DRC are now the subject of shameless exploitation, whereby corruption more often than not goes hand in hand with a disastrous social and environmental impact.
The answers that will be given, not only by the elected Congolese authorities, but also by the European Unionâs political and economic partners, in relation to transparency, to the way in which profits are used, and to social and ecological conditions of exploitation, will be key to determining whether or not DRC is capable of taking action in favour of sustainable development.
How do you see things in this area, Commissioner?
If one takes account of the events that took place in DRC, then to put in place a democratic and peaceful transition would constitute a strong sign of hope for the thousands of Africans who are now fleeing their countries in order to make a dash for Europeâs shores with the idea of thus escaping from the chaos and of ensuring their own survival.
In any case, everything must be done to give the Democratic Republic of Congo and the millions of Congolese people, who have suffered so much and who have reacted with so much energy and vigour, their chance.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I find it regrettable that it should be at this hour of the day that we are discussing this issue, which is a rather important one, and not least that we should be doing so at the same time as the Committee on Foreign Affairs is meeting and voting on Turkey at this very moment.
The lamentable fact is that this is another indication of the âimportanceâ attached to this issue.
Glad though I indeed am that these elections took place, I take a rather more sceptical view of them than do those who have already spoken.
Although we are told that both the elections and the deployment of EUFOR were great successes, I think the European Union and Congo have narrowly escaped disaster.
What if Kabila had been elected in the first round?
The situation would have been markedly worse than it is now.
It is clear from the results and the campaign that these elections were not essentially about politics; they were to a considerable degree about regional allegiance in a Congo that is, in fact, divided between East and West.
Many persons in positions of responsibility within the EU â and none more so than CommissionerÂ Michel â displayed a bias in favour of Joseph Kabila.
I would like â and here I am addressing MrÂ SchrÃ¶der â to be able to say that this has sorted itself out, but, far from it, it had a great influence on what happened on the ground, and I would like to quote from a article, according to which: âThe gross irresponsibility of Bembaâs campaign, which was characterised by ethnic nationalism and sometimes by racism, was at least equalled by that seen in the conduct of the Europeans, in particular that of the Development Commissioner Louis Michel, who, piquantly enough, is from Belgium.
His manifest and public bias in favour of the previous incumbent, Kabila, prior to the elections at the end of July 2006 is something for which the people in the West of the country, and particularly those in the Bemba stronghold of Kinshasa, have never forgiven himâ.
I have to say to CommissionerÂ Michel that the normal response to something like that would be to resign.
As I have done before, I demand that you pay for actions by doing so.
We also know, Commissioner, that a whole array of economic interests are at stake here.
For example, George Forrest, a Belgian, invested USD 400Â million in a copper mine in Kamato, and it seems likely â or this is what keeps on being said, at any rate â that he used this to make a considerable contribution in support of MrÂ Kabilaâs campaign.
The does not mince its words when it writes that MrÂ Kabila is making use of State resources and has received payments from foreign mining enterprises.
I do not regard that as a good sign.
All we can do now is to hope that the European Union really will play a neutral role.
Â Â  () Mr President, far more people have lost their lives during the war in DR Congo than in the hundred times more high-profile conflict in Iraq.
Note that these losses have been estimated to amount to between 50Â 000 and 200Â 000 dead.
However, according to UN statistics, around four million people have died during almost ten years of internal conflict in DR Congo.
This is a tragic world record.
From an economic point of view, DR Congo is a very important country for the world economy.
It has no crude oil, unlike the Middle East, but it does have a raw material which is needed for the production of mobile phones: coltan.
A resolution of the conflict in DR Congo is at hand.
This is not thanks to a single superpower which desires to be the worldâs policeman, but thanks to the UN international forces, which have often been mocked.
The largest peacekeeping force in the history of the UN has been deployed in DR Congo. It consists of 17Â 500 young people.
The elections in DR Congo have cost the international community 500Â million dollars. This pales in comparison to the war in Iraq, which costs 177Â million dollars just for one day.
I think that the planned European Parliament mission will be a further step towards re-establishing order in a country which deserves to finally enjoy some peace.
Finally, I would like to say that I do not agree with the proposal made by the previous speaker, MrÂ PflÃŒger, with reference to the dismissal of CommissionerÂ Michel.
It is far more entertaining to have Commissioner Michel here in this House.
Â Â  â () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what happened in Kinshasa on 21 and 22 August showed clearly that the European Union was right to take the decision to send troops to help secure the elections in Congo, even though there had been many, in various of its Member States, who had expressed doubt as to the wisdom of this approach and as to whether the European Union and its forces really could make an effective contribution.
Just now, MrÂ Morillon, to whom we must be grateful for the outstanding work he did as chief observer of the elections, once more confirmed that it would not have been possible for calm to be restored as speedily as it was had it not been for the deployment of troops â specifically Spanish and Polish troops â under European command, and I see that as the best indication of the rightness of that decision.
We must, however, remain vigilant, not least in the immediately ensuing days and weeks.
It is also significant that our activities in Congo should involve the civil and military powers, working closely together to manage the crisis.
Commissioner Michel has just brought home to us in a powerful way what the European Union did in the past to stabilise the Congo; the securing of these elections is just one among many interventions.
I am confident that the Commissioner, now that these elections are over, will continue to develop the plans that are needed if this country in the heart of Africa, which is important not least in terms of the security of Europe, is to be made even more stable.
Â Â  Mr President, it is unusual for this Parliament to debate an electoral process in the middle of that election taking place.
However, there are a number of reasons why that is justified.
Firstly, as colleagues have said, the three million deaths in five years; there are still one thousand people a day in the Congo dying from the indirect consequences of that war.
Secondly, the electoral process to enable those former belligerents to join the democratic process remains fragile, as the three days of fighting in the Congo following the publication of the preliminary first-round results demonstrates.
We should do everything as a Parliament to support the process of post-conflict reconciliation and democratic transformation.
Thirdly, this is an electoral process where the EU is playing a central role, as Commissioner Michel has already explained: 80% of the cost of the election is being met by the European Union, the biggest ever EU electoral observation mission in Africa and all of it backed up by an EU military mission assisting our UN partners in providing the necessary protection to enable the election to take place in peace and stability.
The electoral observation mission, ably led by our colleague General Morillon â whose work I commend â has made only a preliminary report and any political assessment this Parliament makes must similarly be guarded before drawing our own conclusions in this House.
Yet, the Members of the European Parliament present did note the late publication of the voter rolls, the failure in many, if not most, cases for the candidate details to be posted outside the polling stations and the apparent sharp inequalities between the financial means available to different candidates and parties, together with legitimate questions as to how their money was raised.
However, in terms of the technical conduct of the elections, I want to emphasise the incredible commitment to the process shown by the mainly young polling officials.
In Lubumbashi, where I was based, they worked non-stop throughout the night, without electricity, fuel or water; a 22-hour count conducted in large part by candlelight and where the officials slept for a few minutes by rota in their determination to enable the process to be completed fairly and accurately.
I have been taking part in elections since 1979.
I have never seen an election like it.
Finally, my colleague, Mr SchrÃ¶der, has already made it quite clear that it was necessary to enable Commissioner Michel last week to answer on the record the questions raised with him, and that process has been completed.
Tonight, I want to simply repeat my closing statement to the Commission last week and say that redoubled efforts should be made to insist on the European Unionâs neutrality in this process and that the European observation mission must be specifically tasked with monitoring the allegations of bias made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
I invite the Commissioner to join with his colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, to ensure that the results of this monitoring are fully evaluated, both for the second round of the elections in the Congo, and for the benefit of future European electoral missions.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all observers, I was very impressed with the high turnout, the discipline and excellent organisation, a real feat in a country such as Congo, where both infrastructure and communication are lacking.
The euphoria of the moment, however, should not blind us to certain developments that give less cause for optimism and more cause for disquiet.
First of all, there were the extravagant and disproportionate election campaigns waged by a handful of big players, while other candidates did not even have the absolute minimum at their disposal.
The large-scale misuse of government funds meant that the playing field could hardly be described as level.
Only those with funds and a private militia were able, and allowed, to take part, which begs the question of where the money came from all of a sudden.
Secondly, there was the very negative campaign from a certain corner of the opposition which put itself offside.
The nationalistic, patriotic discourses of those men degenerated into language with genocide overtones, and it is regrettable that other candidates adopted it as well.
Major frustration even led to the reproach that the international community and the EU were taking sides.
This reproach intoxicated even those politicians, who, like Tintin, had only discovered Congo, and it makes no sense whatsoever: the truth is that there would probably never have been elections in Congo had it not been for Commissioner Michelâs unstinting efforts.
Finally, there is the painful conclusion that Congoâs democratisation process remains very fragile.
The events of 20Â August have left a bitter aftertaste, along with the fear that a long campaign which has divided the country into West and East will, in the long term, fail to produce the stability that is hoped for.
The Congolese people fortunately did not respond to the provocations.
They are desperate for peace, and deserve better.
Â Â  Mr President, I was part of the Observation Mission, too, and the first-round polling day passed surprisingly smoothly, given the enormity of the task.
As Mr Howitt said, the election agents were well trained and confident about what they were doing and showed great dedication.
There were a few things that appeared not to be organised absolutely perfectly.
For instance, there did not appear to be a coherent plan for dealing with the enormous volume of material disgorged into the compilation centres â some of it sensitive material, some of it not.
It is important in the weeks up to the second round that as much is done as possible to tighten up on any procedural weaknesses, so that there can be no technical grounds for dispute at what will be a very sensitive moment.
Secondly, we observers detected the perception in some quarters, as has been mentioned, that the EU was not neutral.
It was an erroneous perception, but it could weaken the authority of the EU mission, which needs to be trusted by all sides.
It could also potentially put EU election observers at risk.
The EU needs to work hard in the weeks up to the second round to convince the Congolese of its neutrality.
Nothing must be done that could be construed as favouring one presidential candidate over the other.
Finally, I would stress â as did Mr SchrÃ¶der â that no one must doubt how much this election matters.
It matters for the Congolese, who have waited 40 years for democratic elections and who turned out in great numbers on 30 July, but it matters globally too.
For example, there is a supposedly closed uranium mine in the south of the Congo from which uranium is still being mined and exported, probably to Iran.
The world is not safe while there is an ungoverned hole in the heart of Africa.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thought at first that I would not reply to the speeches in which some doubts were expressed about my neutrality regarding the problems in the Congo.
I shall reply, however, because the comments have occasionally been very excessive.
MrÂ PflÃŒger, I would like to tell you that your conception of the law is, let us say, too hasty.
In certain non-democratic countries, we still encounter these sorts of conceptions.
I thought that we were safe from such conceptions as that in Europe, in any case, and especially in a Parliament as honourable as this one, which is, effectively, the guardian of democratic values such as the right to a defence, respect for proper information and objectivity based on extensive argument.
I would like to be very clear regarding what has been said.
MrÂ PflÃŒger, all the statements that I have been making for weeks, months and even years regarding my interest in the Congo seem to have escaped you - and without doubt this is because, like others too, you have not tried to deepen your understanding of the issue.
Now, I have never sided either with one candidate or the other.
I still maintain very regular telephone contact with PresidentÂ Kabila just as much as I do with Vice-President Bemba.
During the events of the 20, 21 and 22 August I intervened personally in order to calm people down, as I believe GeneralÂ Morillon knows.
I can therefore affirm that I am in personal contact with both candidates.
For example, I can tell you that President Kabila reproaches us for not having reacted sufficiently when, in the course of the election campaign, candidates used arguments based on ethnicity or âbeing Congoleseâ and made xenophobic statements.
I must say as well that the strategy of certain candidates involving the denunciation of âthe foreign candidateâ â this unfortunately forms part of certain practices - has evidently impressed the international community to such an extent that it has not reacted to what is obviously a worsening of the Congolese electoral debate, with argument based on âbeing Congoleseâ or on one or other candidate belonging to the Congo.
I mention all this in order to say that I utterly and completely reject the accusations of partiality that certain people have levelled at me.
I could show you more than ten interviews I have given to European or Congolese newspapers that express my perfect neutrality.
I have reproached PresidentÂ Kabila just as much as I have reproached Vice-PresidentÂ Bemba and other candidates on the electoral lists.
MrÂ VanÂ Hecke has had the intellectual honesty to be more thorough in the remarks he has made.
Thus, several months ago I also spent a whole afternoon in the house of MrÂ Tshisekedi, urging him to get his supporters to register and even urging him to make use of his right to be a candidate because I thought, and I still think, that MrÂ Tshisekedi is a man of experience who knows the Congo well, a man with a programme that could have been revealed in order to improve the political debate.
Taking into account what I have just said, MrÂ PflÃŒger, it is a little thoughtless to accuse me of being partial simply because one day during a broadcast, in response to the question âwhat does a candidate like MrÂ Kabila represent?â, I answered âthe hope of the Congo.â
If I had been asked âwhat does a candidate like MrÂ Bemba represent?â, I would have answered âthe hope of the Congoâ, because all those who take part in an election represent the hope of their country, in this case above all because it was the first time that an election was being held.
I therefore find your tunnel vision particularly excessive.
You accuse me, for example â and if we were in the Belgian national Parliament I would have immediately reacted by appealing to the Rules of Procedure in order to respond to personal comments â of protecting Belgian economic interests.
Which Belgian economic interests?
One of the serious problems facing the Congo is the lack of interest from foreign investors.
Moreover, it is legitimate enough for any country, for any business to deem that it has the right to seek economic or commercial partnerships with any other country, on condition that it ensures that natural resources are respected, that it prevents these resources from being pillaged â this is what foreign forces have done for a very long time and what internal forces are still doing today â and on condition that it respects basic economic ethics, a factor that, unfortunately or fortunately, must be taken into account in the open world with which we are familiar.
I therefore ask the question: which economic interests?
Today, the economic interests that I encounter in the Congo are Chinese, Indian, Israeli, American.
This is not a reproach, not a critique, but I find few, very few European economic interests, MrÂ PflÃŒger.
The truth has rights, and I must tell you that I would hope that European businesses would invest in a country like the Congo.
It needs such investment.
You made reference to a Belgian business that has developed in the copper sector. I suppose you are referring to the business owned by MrÂ Forrest.
I cite this because it was pointed out that one of my sons was married to MrÂ Forrestâs daughter, that they were directors of MrÂ Forrestâs companies and that I was therefore related to MrÂ Forrest.
In my life I have only met MrÂ Forrest three times for a few seconds, and I was in the company of a Belgian parliamentary delegation.
Mr Forrest creates 630 jobs through his company; he creates hospitals and schools: a whole social system is developing there.
I am not defending MrÂ Forrest personally; I do not know if he is honest or not, I am simply observing.
What I do know is that a Belgian journalist carried out an investigation on MrÂ Forrest and that he became a supporter of MrÂ Forrest, simply because he creates jobs.
Out of the 630 people whom he employs in his business, there are 600 Congolese.
I am not defending MrÂ Forrest, I do not know him well, I have met him three times in my life for a few seconds.
I have therefore had enough of this sort of attack which â it has to be said â borders on nastiness and which I cannot let pass.
I can assure you of one thing: I am completely impartial, I have contacts with everyone in the Congo and I am proud of having doubtless been one of the first - well before 1999, when I was still leader of the opposition in my country - to try to mobilise the international community to finally take an interest in this country.
Why?
Simply because, as someone said in this House, there have been almost 4Â million victims in Central Africa in ten years.
This figure cannot be compared with those of other world conflicts.
That is why I have always thought that it was my duty as a politician to concern myself with the Congo.
That is true, MrÂ PflÃŒger.
The second reason why I am so engaged in the Congo is that I am Belgian and thus, in a way, I feel inspired by a kind of historical memory.
As a Belgian, it is not so much that I felt responsible, but rather I felt indebted to the Congolese population.
It is thus true that I feel a particular attachment to the Congolese population, without doubt because I have this recollection of a certain collective bad conscience and because I still have this old conception of morality which consists of rereading the history of my country and of my people in an intellectually honest way.
This is why, when I was the Foreign Affairs Minister, we visited the Rwandans to apologise. This is something that others have not done yet, and I regret this.
This is the reason why, as regards the political assassination of MrÂ Lumumba for example, I also apologised in the name of my country to MrÂ Lumumbaâs family.
I do not therefore need a lesson in ethics, and you may organise all the investigations you wish into my activities.
The same people who claimed that I was biased have also claimed that I was the owner of a diamond mine in the Congo, that I bought a villa on the river - in short, it is all gossip-mongering.
The only excuse you have for such an excessive reaction - and this does not correspond with my definition of intellectual honesty - is that you do not, I think, know the Congo very well.
Perhaps you have been to the Congo, perhaps not, I do not know, but in any case you have an image of the Congo partially distorted by the excesses of certain parties who use any old argument in the campaign.
There is populism in the Congo too, it exists everywhere, it even exists in our countries. Sometimes it even exists in this Parliament, and I regret this.
This is what I meant about neutrality: hearing a chorus of people repeating that the Commission is not neutral is ultimately tiresome.
To the accusation: âyou have not been neutralâ, I reply: âwe have been perfectly neutralâ.
MrÂ Kabila is annoyed with me because we did not denounce the excesses in the debate on âbeing Congoleseâ; MrÂ Bemba is annoyed with me because, in my capacity as Foreign Affairs Minister and as Commissioner, I would meet PresidentÂ Kabila.
When I go to the Congo, whom do you want me to speak to if not the head of state.
Of course it was necessary for me to meet MrÂ Kabila.
However, if there is one thing that proves my neutrality, it is that I have never been to the Congo, not once, without meeting MrÂ Kabila and the four Vice-Presidents who make up the presidential milieu.
I have taken my sense of neutrality even further.
I have systematically sought contact with MrÂ Tshisekedi.
Somebody mentioned women; I have met representatives from the whole of civil society, I have met everyone.
It is true that I am probably someone who has quite an important network of information in the Congo, and I pride myself on having been able to play a modest role in the transitional process.
In this connection, people bore grudges against me because I supported the transitional process until the end, but there was no solution other than to support this process.
MrÂ Tshisekedi and the UDPS, who denounced the transitional process, had signed the Pretoria Agreement, they had signed the Agreement underpinning the transitional process.
Afterwards, I had the impression that this party chose the policy of making things worse, that it had decided that the transition was not going to succeed, so that an alternative was needed and that this was the best way to gain power.
Personally, I can do nothing.
I do not think I can be blamed for the fact that the party withdrew from a process that it had supported and to which it had signed up.
I simply hoped that all the active political forces would participate in the election.
Unfortunately this did not occur, and I regret this.
This chapter is now closed.
If I truly felt that I should resign, I would not wait for anyone to ask me.
Perhaps I am a little old-fashioned in this respect.
I still believe in political responsibility, but this sense of responsibility should work both ways: it should affect the person who has responsibility and the person who exposes the way in which that responsibility has been exercised.
Now, if you criticise the way in which someone has exercised political responsibility, your criticism should be based on real points. You cannot just say anything.
I am prepared to argue for a long time about this and I cannot accept the accusations made against me.
These affect me deeply because, for years now, the basic intention underlying my political commitment has been, precisely, to try to help this fine country and fine people to escape from the poverty and confusion towards which â it has to be said - the international community has shown complete indifference, if not disdain.
As for the army, I have noted what was said with great interest and I obviously agree for the most part with the various speeches that have been made.
I agree with MrsÂ Gomes when she says that the reform of the army will be an extremely important point.
More or less half of this reform has already been achieved.
I would simply like to point out that it was necessary to reduce the army concerned, or rather the assemblage of different troops and militias amounting to roughly 330Â 000Â soldiers â I do not know if you can imagine this - down to 100Â 000Â men, also taking into account the fact that, for example, the process of demobilisation and reintegration attracted fake soldiers who joined in because they wanted to profit from this process.
To reduce such an army is therefore much more easily said than done.
It is easy to talk about but difficult to achieve, and a certain amount of time is required in order to carry out this process properly.
I hope that the international community will continue with its commitment to aid the Congo and to reform its army.
The same applies to the police.
Substantial progress has, moreover, already been achieved.
MrÂ SchrÃ¶der, I agree with almost all of what you have said and I would also like to thank you for the balanced nature of your comments with respect to the aforementioned subject.
Even so, when you say that we should not debate the Congo at the moment, I myself believe that we should debate it.
I think that the second round can succeed if the international community tells both candidates unequivocally that they do not have the right to sabotage the second round because that would be to insult the Congolese peopleâs passion for democracy.
The attitude of the Congolese, this peopleâs enthusiasm about its historic meeting with democracy has been beautiful to see and has been the best recompense for all the European Unionâs efforts.
I think we must talk about this.
In fact, we must not stop repeating that the second round must not be a failure and that whoever is beaten must respect the result.
Whoever is beaten will also have his role to play, and the winner will have to take this into account.
This is my personal conviction.
Perhaps people will again reproach me for exceeding the bounds of strict neutrality, but my personal conviction is that whoever wins must have the wisdom not to act as if the other candidate did not count or as if he represented nothing.
That is the approach he will have to adopt in order to revive the Congo.
This is my profound belief, and the leader of the opposition will also have his role to play.
Without any sycophancy, I would to like to congratulate GeneralÂ Morillon for the way in which he has carried out the election observation mission up to now.
I believe that he deserves a lot of credit: he has carried out his mission under extremely difficult conditions; with his considerable experience he has succeeded in seeing things in context when it has been necessary not to be absolutist, in being severe when it was necessary to be severe, and, in any case, in remaining rigorous and never straying from his course.
I would genuinely like to thank him and to congratulate him.
MrsÂ Aubert, you have asked me the following question, and with very good reason: âWhat do you plan to do?â
As I recall, this is the main point of your speech.
The real response is based on what we have already debated in this House.
I think that, more than ever, we must suggest and encourage projects of good governance in the Congo.
You mentioned, for example, the correct and appropriate use of natural resources.
We all know that the Congo is in fact a very rich country.
It is creditworthy, as they say, it is a country that could ensure the prosperity and well-being of its population.
The Congo has everything.
In the first place, it has its people and extremely important human resources.
In my view, what is needed is to recreate a genuine state, a state in the governmental sense of the word, with a working judiciary and administration, with people who are paid and who receive their salaries and with a working education system and a working health care system.
I have spoken with both candidates and I have told them: rather than arguing about how Congolese you are and about all these subordinate issues which, at base, only concern your own personal interests, it would perhaps be more worthwhile to tell the Congolese how you plan to give them better access to education, justice, health, administration, culture and infrastructures; and also how you are, for example, to implement an embryonic social security system with the help of the international community.
This is the real debate.
I think that what I have just said corresponds very closely to the conclusion I wanted to offer.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for having lost track of the time.
I thought that it was important to set the record straight on a number of points and to specify my hopes concerning the second round of these elections.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The first item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the suspension of negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade (O-0088/2006 â B6-0427/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 24Â July, the Director-General of the WTO, MrÂ PascalÂ Lamy, announced, as a result of the meeting of the trade negotiations committee of the WTO in Geneva, the suspension of the Doha Round negotiations.
I hope that this suspension is provisional and that the talks are not reduced to ashes, but rather that a phoenix can rise from them â as the Commissioner has said.
This decision, which, provisionally, has put an end to five years of negotiations and more than seven years of diplomatic efforts, has led to great uncertainty within the multilateral framework of the WTO trade negotiations and, furthermore, it raises a problem with regard to an informal time limit, which is more political than chronological: the forthcoming expiry of the mandate of the Trade Promotion Authority, granted to the President by the United States Congress to allow him to negotiate in global terms.
Mr President, I would say in passing that it is odd that for an organisation such as the WTO, which is an intergovernmental organisation and a ministerial conference, everything depends on a decision by a Parliament, the United States Congress, highly respectable though it is.
The other Parliaments of the world, beginning with the European Parliament, also have the right to express an opinion, without imposing any kind of condition, or any guillotines, such as those currently being imposed by the United States Congress.
In this regard, I would like to say that next week, in the governing committee of the parliamentary assembly that we have created between the European Parliament and the Interparliamentary Union, we will have the opportunity to discuss and work on this issue with representatives of the majority of the worldâs Parliaments, because we believe that this is an issue that concerns all of us.
We in Parliament, and specifically in the Committee on International Trade, have not waited until the holidays were over to express our concern.
I did so, on behalf of that Committee, immediately after the announcement, pointing out that we cannot resign ourselves to a definitive failure of the negotiations.
What we have to see is how we can move on from this crossroads and how we can put the process back on track.
There have been a series of contacts and bilateral meetings during August and I hope that the Commissioner can tell us about any opportunities for progress.
I also believe that the Commission must try to exploit its mandate as far as it possibly can, because we have responsibilities.
Firstly, to defend our interests, but at the same time also to promote the principle that a multilateral system which benefits everybody, not just the developed countries, but also those countries that should be the main objective of the negotiation â the developing countries and, above all, the least-developed countries â can truly play a fundamental role, such as the one the European Union should play as the worldâs leading commercial power.
I therefore believe that it is important for the European Parliament to speak out and to support the possibility that we can continue with, put back on track and renew the objective of achieving a Doha Round for development and also to support the Commission â which has not had much of a holiday in this regard â which we hope can continue working to conclude this Round.

There is still a margin for manoeuvre; there always is a margin in politics, though, chronologically speaking, the time limits are running out, and perhaps the need to act quickly can help.
Mr President, we believe that the comments the Commissioner can make today are important and, above all, we want him to know that he can count on our concern, our support and our desire for this Round to once again become a process geared towards a more prosperous and cooperative humanity in the future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there can be no doubt that the costs of the failure of the Doha Round negotiations are high and will increase in the event of a definitive breakdown.
These costs arise, :
Firstly, from lost earnings to the global economy, development and employment, earnings which the successful completion of negotiations would have generated.
Secondly, from the undermining of progress in certain sectors of activity which are especially important to developing countries.
Thirdly, from the weakened credibility of the World Trade Organisation itself.
I believe that the danger in the event of a total failure far outweighs the danger of achieving an albeit less ambitious overall agreement, although an agreement cannot be accepted at any cost to the Union.
The European Union maintained a constructive and responsible position.
It tabled noteworthy proposals and abandoned many of its objectives right from the start of the round.
Consequently, any return to the negotiating table depends on flexibility on the part of other leading trade partners if we are to envisage a balanced result.
We, as the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, continue to advocate multilateralism.
The commitment to a multilateral trade system makes a decisive contribution towards security, transparency and the stability of international trade.
It also helps to disseminate enhanced economic interdependence across international political cooperation.
The breakdown of multilateralism contains within it the danger of sectoral trade conflicts and the revival of regional trade strongholds.
Consequently, the successful completion of multilateral trade negotiations should remain â as the Commission and the chairman of our committee emphasised â the supreme choice, the supreme priority on the Union's agenda.
At the same time, we must strengthen supplementary strategies of bilateral and cross-regional relations with other important partners.
The stability of the global trade system calls, in my opinion, for new dynamic impetus to the link between commercial interdependence and joint responsibility between the European Union and the United States of America and this link between interdependence and joint responsibility must be verified.
With Mr BarÃ³n Crespo before me and his country's victory over Greece in the World Basketball Championship in mind, I would suggest that we look on the outcome of these negotiations so far as time out rather than a definitive breakdown.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the suspensions of the Doha Round negotiations is first and foremost the breaking of a promise to adjust the balance of trade rules to benefit developing countries.
It represents a triumph of the narrow interests of some countries over the broader interest of the international community and, like the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, we are all, of course, thinking about the mid-term elections due to take place in the United States.
The suspension already potentially threatens the multilateral system as the main framework of trade negotiations and a return to more imbalanced bilateral negotiations that will act to the detriment of the poorest, and in particular the smallest, countries, as you pointed out, MrÂ Mandelson.
Furthermore, it will leave the multilateral system in place, which will not disappear, though the idea was to begin to reform it and make it more compatible with the objectives of development and with the other rules of the international community: namely the need to take on board the objectives of public health, the environment, and tomorrow â we hope â the social dimension of globalisation.
The main losers of this suspension of the round of negotiations will be developing countries, and, of those, the least advanced countries in particular.
Irrespective of the shortcomings and the limitations, what was on the table, and what was being proposed by the EU â which was often, indeed, what Parliament wanted to see â will be jeopardised, will be lost: the abolition of export subsidies by 2013, free access, as regards rights and quotas, for products from the least developed countries to the markets of the developed countries, even though the problem remained of the 3% tariff lines that a number of other industrialised countries had sought, increased access to the markets of industrialised countries for all agricultural production in developing countries, even though the US proposals fall well short of what is required, addressing the situation of cotton producers, the trade-related assistance package, and the amendment to the Trade Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on access to medicines.
I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you are simply announcing that you are once again going to set forth in search of peace, to meet again with the G20 and the United States and to attempt to find ways to return to the negotiating table.
We must not, in my view, allow the Doha Round to die.
Whatever the difficulties posed by the expiry of the authorisation to negotiate granted by Congress to the US administration, we must not allow the undertakings and the promises that had been made simply to be thrown out of the window, and I am delighted to hear that, for its part, the EU will honour its commitments and keep its promises.
We should perhaps return simply to the heart of the Round and remind our partners from the industrialised countries that we knew that it would not be based on reciprocity, and that we would have to offer more in the way of access for agricultural products than we would gain via industrial tariffs and the opening up of markets and services. Europe must continue to promote the multilateral system.
It certainly needs to be reformed so that there can remain a framework of confidence between developing and developed countries. After all, it is within the multilateral system that the developing countries can continue to be heard via the G20 and the G90, and that the trade rules can be made more compatible with the aims of eradicating poverty and with all of the other rules of the multilateral system.
Â Â  . (NL) Mr President, has the Doha Round failed beyond repair?
That is what more and more commentators seem to assume that it has.
Especially since Hong Kong, nine months ago, no progress has been made, and in July, negotiations were postponed indefinitely.
Like the Commissioner, and most fellow Members of this House for that matter, I refuse to believe, though, that this is the beginning of the end.
There is, after all, a great deal at stake.
Outright failure could well result in the collapse of the multilateral trade system, with all that this entails.
Failure to reach a global trade agreement increases the risk of ever more countries resorting to bilateral or regional agreements, which, in any case, puts poor countries in a weaker position.
In addition, an interruption in negotiations can increase the number of trade disputes, during which WTO Members will try legal action as a way of getting what they did not manage to get via an agreement.
There is more, though, as the Commission pointed out: sooner or later, the WTOâs very will be challenged.
It is therefore necessary, now more than ever, to make the WTO more transparent and enhance its democratic legitimacy.
Our group sees it as essential that rich and more developed countries should try to bring their viewpoints closer together beforehand.
There is absolutely no point in organising another high mass if the US and the EU fail to close the gap between them in the area of their agricultural supply and other issues.
The American Congress recently applauded the tough stance adopted by the US negotiators.
A blame game of this kind will do nothing to bring about constructive solutions.
All key players, including the EU, the US and the G20, have to pull their weight in order to achieve a result.
Meanwhile, what is termed the Hong Kong must remain intact in full.
All pro-development commitments must be delivered upon.
Whether or not an agreement is reached, the EU must not back out of its intention to abolish export subsidies by 2015.
At the same time, all developed countries and advanced developing countries must be invited to observe the EUâs âEverything but Armsâ initiative.
The tone of this compromise resolution is voluntaristic and positive.
It confirms our belief in a multilateral approach of trade policy despite everything, based on the honest conviction that when the Doha Development Agenda fails, there are unfortunately no winners, only losers.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the Doha round has failed, and what you, Commissioner, are presenting us with today is a rehash of what caused it to fail.
You say that you hope that it will be completed nonetheless, but on what do you base that hope?
You say that the developing countries are losing out and that the damages them more than anyone else, but why is it that the developing world countries and their representatives have not completed the round?
Perhaps they took another view of it and were even smart enough not to, on the grounds that the liberalisation that underlies your thinking, the liberalisation that you want to push through, has self-evidently not made them rich.
Far, too, from filling the stomachs of the people who live there, it has driven them into debt and has failed to solve the problem of famine.
This is the first time that these countries have come together, and if they manage to wield enough clout against the industrial nations of the West to cause this thing to fail, then that puts things in a different light and we need to see if we can come up with another offer.
You say that the reduction in customs duties as offered will bring EURÂ 20 billion to European agriculture, but are these EURÂ 20 billion not surplus to it, and â if we make this cut â would these EURÂ 20 billion not at least benefit the countries of the developing world, or would this be nothing more than a reduction in food standards?
Are the countries there being bought off for less than they need to rise above poverty, with agriculture here being ruined as a consequence?
Qualified access is what is needed.
The market access that you offer in return for access to the developing worldâs markets for industrial products and services, destroys their infrastructures and the fragile development of their own industries and trades, while denying agriculture here a chance of existence, even though we need, as a matter of urgency, to produce food.
It follows that quality and qualified market access are what is needed to enable the countries of the developing world to enjoy our price levels and standards and to develop their own economies.
The agreement on sugar showed us that those ACP countries that were able to supply sugar while complying with these conditions saw their economies develop, while those that were unable to do so found themselves having to sell to the multinationals at prices below the poverty level, and that state of affairs is going to continue.
So, Commissioner Mandelson, what you should do is make a proper offer of the sort that these countries can agree to, one that stabilises food supply and improves the stability and quality of trade, rather than one with a general tendency to put farmers around the world out of business.
It is then, I believe, that the multilateral approach will be the right one, and everyone will be able to benefit from it in a way that they certainly cannot from the liberalisation that you are proposing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha Development Round has failed.
What was it meant to develop?
That is the core issue.
Was it only trade â trade for tradeâs sake â that was meant to develop, or was it the intention that more trade should bring development in its wake?
For if the latter is what is intended, then there is a great deal more that must be included in the negotiations; it will be necessary to ask what contribution trade makes in the various countries in terms of raised social standards, of improved protection for the environment, of enhanced quality of life.
That is a quite different approach from a desire, above all else, to open up markets in order to exchange bigger trade margins, for there can be no reciprocity then.
Solidarity is about the stronger helping the weaker, and what that means is that the more developed countries must give more than those that have not developed to the same degree.
It is not only quantity that is at issue here; it also means a qualitatively different approach, not to mention the insight that those who have not yet developed the market in their own countries must be enabled to do this before anything else happens.
It may be that they will need to keep their markets closed for a time before they can be opened up.
What use is it to many developing countries to be allowed to export to the European Union if they have no products they can export, quite simply because they cannot even yet feed their own people?
Yet, at the same time, these countries are told that if they are to be allowed to do that, they must be so good as to open up their markets to our services and our industries.
No agreement will ever be reached if our way of negotiating never rises above this, and I say that as one who is fanatical in support for a multilateral system.
Commissioner Mandelson, you will recall that I have, on very many occasions, asked you whether you really believe that the USA is interested in a multilateral conclusion to the WTO round.
I have always said that I do not.
The Americans can defend their interests better if they are not tied down by multilateral agreements.
That is why it is much more important that the European Union should join together with the G20, and that is something to which we must, of course, give renewed consideration in view of the immense differences between the countries of the South.
This cannot be only about opening up markets if the consequence of doing so is to put the European market at the mercy of Brazilian agri-business, which is huge and dominated by three families; in no way whatever does that do anything to help these countries.
I believe that what we need to do is to rethink our approach.
We want trade.
Again and again, you say that we want free trade.
We can have an ideological disagreement about that; I do not want that sort of liberalisation, but let us leave that to one side for a moment.
What matters is not so much that we should have free trade, but that trade should be made fair.
Fair trade is just trade, and âjustâ does not mean âequalâ.
If the same standards are applied to all categories of countries as regards reduction of tariffs and the opening-up of their markets, then that may be no more than equal treatment, but it is not just.
You must change the mandate that you have been given; this is the approach that you need.
If you want to advance trade, you have to bear in mind â and, indeed, make it your priority to do so â the circumstances of the individual countries and the stage of development that they have reached.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am not at all surprised that the World Trade Organization talks have collapsed once again.
For some time now, I have been calling for the exclusion of agriculture from these talks.
Agriculture makes up a mere 5% of world trade, yet the blame for the collapse of the talks is laid firmly at European farm gates.
Why should 5% hold back the other 95% of trade?
It is time to remember that.
I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in CancÃºn, and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets.
Nothing could be further from the truth, and we are hearing it again in this Chamber today.
The developing countries have little to gain from such a gesture; in fact, the EU already allows free access to 50 least-developed countries as it is.
The real winners would be the beef barons of South America, if we were to allow Irish farmers to be sold out.
The real losers in this situation would be the small European farmers who are already on the breadline.
Let us make no mistake about that.
A recent survey of Irish consumers, for example, revealed that just one in five people has confidence in food imported from outside the European Union.
This is not surprising. Opening up the EU agricultural market any further will bring food security and food traceability into serious question.
Are we willing to accept the scenario of uncertainty regarding the food we feed our children, in the light of food safety scares such as mad cow disease, CJD, or avian influenza?
Are we willing to accept a free-for-all approach to the use of angel dust and other suspicious substances amongst Brazilian beef farmers?
We in Ireland have recently witnessed the demise of the Irish sugar industry.
Brazilian sugar barons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform, while 4Â 000 Irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant.
In Hong Kong last December I witnessed Korean farmers fighting for a livelihood which is currently being threatened by transnational grain corporations, who are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries.
This is a fallacy.
It is clear that the WTO cannot succeed as long as we insist on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihoods of small European and Irish farmers.
It is time to move on.
It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers.
Â Â  . Mr President, the suspension of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations represents a heavy blow not only for the WTO, but also for all parties to the negotiations.
The WTO has lost some of its credibility, whilst global trade has benefited from drafting and enforcing international rules for the movement of trade.
As I fear that the developing countries will be footing the bill for this suspension, I would call on Commissioner Mandelson to monitor the interests of those countries both multilaterally and bilaterally.
Indeed, a desperate lack of economic prospects in Africa is one of the factors forcing an increasing number of people to seek their salvation in Europe.
I personally have my doubts as to the composition of the G20.
After all, new economic power will also need to translate into new responsibility.
Also, I have always backed American trade representative Susan Schwabâs appeal to China to show evidence of this new responsibility.
Commissioner, in your interview with the German magazine , you expressed your commitment to carry on in order to get Doha back on track.
Could you explain to me on what your optimism is founded, particularly in the light of your indication that you do not expect the negotiations to be complete before the end of the year?
Do you have any evidence to assume that the Americans will make a move by then?
Moreover, I should like to urge you once again to reflect very carefully on the European agenda after Doha, for that may be more desirable than we may think.
Â Â  Mr President, it is extremely disappointing that the WTO negotiations have been suspended indefinitely, and I am particularly worried about the position of the developing countries.
The objective of the WTO negotiations, as we know, was to improve the position of the developing countries, and all those involved had to do their bit: Europe in the area of import tariffs for agricultural products, the United States in the shape of internal support to farmers, developing countries, such as Brazil and India, with regard to access to their markets for industrial products, and suchlike. It is very unfortunate that no progress has been made and further negotiations could now be a long time coming.
I do not wish to point the finger at any of the parties, for that is also difficult with so many parties being sat around the table, but it should be said that the way in which the Commissioner has acted has unfortunately not led to the desired results, and that it is now becoming more difficult for developing countries to gain a stronger foothold in the world economy.
I am pleased, though, that the Commissioner has expressed his commitment to the developing countries more than once, and I will hold him to that if I may.
We cannot change the facts, and that is why it is important to look to the future, particularly that of the developing countries.
During the negotiation round, agreement was reached, in principle, about a number of items that are very important for developing countries, which include, as they have already been mentioned: aid for trade, no import duties for the poorest countries, trade facilities, as well as special and differentiated treatment.
What could have been a major step forward, is now left in the lap of the Gods.
I understand, and also condone the fact, that the Commissioner would like those agreements to go ahead as much as possible, but I then wonder how, according to the Commissioner, can this be done in those areas?
Can the plans be implemented as yet and if so, how?
Finally, I should like to mention the Export Promotion Organisations (EPOs) that are related to the WTO.
We have not yet seen any concrete proposals, and that is why I should like to know: what is, according to the Commission, the impact of the suspension of the WTO negotiations on the developments of EPOs?
Does the Commissioner believe that, in the framework of the EPO negotiations, there is scope for walking the extra mile for the benefit of the ACP countries?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have had the pleasure of sitting in this House and following the progress of trade policy for twelve years, in the course of which I have seen three Commissioners deal with the subject, and I know how difficult it is.
This House has been there through every twist and turn of the negotiations; it has seen how difficult it is to conduct them on a multilateral basis, and how difficult it is, too, to understand what is meant by a modern trade policy and trade strategy.
Speaking personally, I am highly sceptical as to whether we have a right understanding of it even now.
I can go along with much of what you have said just now, and I am grateful to you for referring to the Commissionâs new communication, which will be reaching us shortly.
Sometimes, though, I take a rather sceptical view of our own self-criticism and our understanding of the changes that have come about in the world.
On the one hand, it is certainly easy to criticise the Americans â and there is no shortage of reasons for doing it â but it is also important that it be mentioned that there is, in developing countries too â Brazil being one of them â and for reasons that Members have already addressed, scepticism about agreeing with the WTO.
Another factor may well be that China has become a global trading partner, with a greater impact on countries like Mexico, to name but one, than it has in the EU or the United States.
There are so many reasons, and I sometimes find it regrettable that the debate on a modern trade policy, to which you yourself refer in your own document, is not engaged in at the necessary depth.
What is also lacking is an understanding of the fact that the EUâs Member States have taken up very different positions as regards the challenges of globalisation.
Some of our countries are very open, because they can afford to be, while some, however, are in difficulties because they got around only very late to introducing reforms and transforming themselves.
This is evident from the textiles debate and from the anti-dumping debate with reference to shoes, and there are many other examples.
I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy.
That involves â as I have mentioned â the part played by China.
Have we really understood what Chinaâs accession to the WTO means?
If you are going to consider the possibility of Russia joining it there, Commissioner, then we urge you to discuss the matter with us; the lack of any debate about the effects and consequences of that is something I find regrettable, and, for that reason, I am in favour of having one.
It is something for which this House expressed its support as long ago as 2002, at the same time as it declared itself in favour of negotiations with Asia, and yet, as I see it, the debate with this House and with the responsible committee is lacking in depth.
I would like to see a debate about what our participation in the GATS+ negotiations forming part of the bilateral round might mean; here, too, you are right, but I do wish we could have a debate about it.
What I do think needs to be done if we are to talk in terms of a modern trade policy is for this House to be fully consulted, not just when we are called upon to agree to the outcomes of negotiations, but at the outset, when such negotiations are being considered.
The Commission, the Council, and this House, meeting in Stuttgart, have already negotiated a statement, and that involved this House being consulted either fully or to a considerable degree.
I would recommend to you that we do the same thing again, and hope that you can agree to this.
Â Â  Mr President, the indefinite suspension of the Doha Round creates serious risks for our global economy.
It threatens parity and prosperity for the developing world, jobs, growth and security in Europe, and the future of the multilateral trade system itself.
A new explosion of discriminatory bilateral and regional agreements could substitute global liberalisation, eroding the multilateral and rules-based system of the WTO.
While some might say that no deal was better than a bad deal for developing countries, without the shield of the WTO â as you said, Commissioner â they will be left vulnerable to use and abuse in a unilateral scramble for trade domination.
Failure will mean that protectionism will fill the vacuum as momentum towards wide-ranging reduction of barriers ceases; the world economy will slow down and global trade imbalances will continue to rise; financial markets will become more unstable; and international economic cooperation will break down further.
With the erosion of the WTO system, speculation is rife about what form a âPlan Bâ might take: perhaps and East Asia free trade area; perhaps Japanâs proposal for a pan-Asian comprehensive economic partnership that includes India, Australia and New Zealand.
Either of those would create a new Asian bloc that, along with the European Union and NAFTA, would produce a tri-polar world with all its inherent instabilities.
Does the Commission agree that there is now an urgent need for a Plan B to get world trade policy back on track and for the EU to play a key role in shaping the world trade order?
Does the Commission agree that such a strategy must have these three key objectives: to spur the revival of Doha; to offer an ambitious alternative to restart the process of liberalisation on the widest possible basis if our primary goal fails; and to counter the proliferation of preferential deals amongst small groups of countries?
Time and time again I have stood in front of you, Commissioner, and reflected on the finger-pointing blame game that has plagued progress.
It is time to set that blame aside.
The âEverything But Armsâ initiative shows that the EU can do good, but we can and must do better before the US mandate expires and, with it, our opportunity to eradicate poverty and distribute fairly the benefits of globalisation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the results so far achieved during the Doha Round and the outcome of the TRIPS agreement on access to medicinal products are having disastrous effects on the living standards of millions of human beings.
It is quite clear that the slogan âFree trade = poverty reductionâ was just bait to persuade the southern, poorest countries of the world to endorse the expectations of the industrialised countries.
The real reason for the suspension of the WTO talks was that it was impossible to reach an agreement among the six main nations, which were determined to defend the interests of their agribusinesses; the other 143 countries were excluded from the negotiations.
According to the FAO, the breakdown was due to having focused all the talks on free trade instead of fair trade.
It is better to have no agreement at all than a bad agreement!
The suspension of the talks may provide an opportunity for reviewing the Commissionâs negotiating mandate, which should concentrate on: 1) reforming the WTO to make it more transparent, more inclusive and more democratic, embedded within the UN system, and bound in its decision-making by the framework of international law; 2) reviewing the three main agreements now on the agenda: agriculture, intellectual property and services; 3) providing a binding frame of reference for the activities of transnational companies; 4) making respect for the rights of peoples a condition of free trade, by ensuring that the human rights clause, as approved by Parliament on 14Â February, is observed; 5) refusing at bilateral or regional level to sidestep the rules agreed upon at multilateral level, taking the EPA talks with the ACP countries as an example.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question by our Committee on International Trade is very relevant and timely.
The European Parliament cannot look the other way when negotiations which are so important at multilateral level and which had offered such great hopes for more organised, transparent, free and fair trade are suspended.
We would refer to the motion for a resolution presented by our group with regard to the concrete aspects we are debating here.
We would like to point out, however, that a failure of the Doha Round would be a failure for international trade and for the multilateral system, since it would jeopardise the achievements such as tariff and trade preferences and would lead to a multiplicity and overlapping of rules, thereby making companiesâ lives more difficult.
The real fundamental reasons for this failure must be entirely exposed.
The inflexible States that have hindered the negotiation must be condemned, and we must not give up on the negotiations.
They must be revived so that we can take advantage of the progress already made and make the Doha Round a success for the sake of a fairer form of globalisation and for the sake of the WTO itself.
The very future of this organisation is at stake; the WTO could be greatly harmed by this crisis.
This requires serious reflection, and the WTOâs operating mechanisms must be updated, modernised and democratised.
The European Parliament must continue to play the role that has been assigned to us by seriously and rigorously monitoring the situation that has been created and promoting a solution to the current impasse for the good of everybody, but above all, as others have said, for the good of the least-developed countries.
Commissioner, we are grateful to you for being here and for the information you have given us, and you know that you can count on this Parliament, as other speakers have said, in the efforts to unblock these negotiations.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commercial sky clouded over in Geneva last July.
Despite the hopeful ray of sunlight offered by the G8 a few days earlier in St Petersburg, the minds of certain negotiators clouded over and the negotiations of the development round were suspended .
Football matches are also suspended as a result of bad weather, but they are eventually played when the fog lifts or the storm passes.
The current situation should not discourage us or undermine the political will to continue along the path of multilateralism and development.
We must continue to fight to maintain a multilateral international trade system with clear, transparent and binding rules, in which all countries, and particularly developing countries, can participate fully and from which they can benefit.
If that did not happen, we would be entering the jungle of bilateralism. That would expand the current tangle of more than 250 bilateral treaties, it would penalise the developing countries and it would promote Darwinism, protectionism and discrimination.
We must not move backwards.
Commissioner, what will happen to the commitments and agreements reached last December in Hong Kong, particularly in terms of development?
Is the principle of the single undertaking still valid in the Commissionâs strategy?
Will the elimination of export subsidies for 2013 be maintained?
What will happen to the negotiations on cotton?
Which countries are prepared to apply all of these agreements?
Furthermore, it was said in Geneva that all of the negotiators would lose out.
All citizens, and particularly those of the least-developed countries, are also losing out.
What initiatives is the Commission planning in order to explain to the citizens that the WTO is not dead and that it is still the best instrument for regulating and promoting fair and free international trade?
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although there is, of course, something fundamentally wrong when the negotiations of the Doha round are broken off, every crisis brings an opportunity with it.
As we have seen over the past few years, no particular success has been achieved by going from one round to another and constantly saying that we are not satisfied but will keep going, so it follows that the time now left to us must be, not least, a time in which we reflect on things.
Theoretically, we all realise that the WTO, with its 150 member states, cannot be managed in the same way as it was at the beginning, when it had 23 of them.
Why do we not draw particular conclusions from this?
Why, too, can we not for once consider where, overall, Europeâs interests lie, and what our trade position is in the various sectors?
It is not enough to say that agriculture accounts for only 2% or 3% of the total trade figures if those figures, in effect, relate to large regions of the European Union and would change the shape of our society, and so we need to come up with a sort of overall concept.
It really is worth trying to do that.
Neither WTO negotiations nor trade talks carried on a patchwork basis, along the lines of 'I give you three cows and you give me two fishes in exchange', are no use any more.
If the differences between states are constantly on the increase â and you, Commissioner, said as much â then why are we thinking in such categories as âmultilateralâ or âbilateralâ?
Why can we not start thinking in terms of â among others â âmultiregionalâ categories?
In a nuanced world like this one, we cannot apply the same yardstick to every state.
However much we may cherish development policy â and I, too, am in favour of it â we, in this European Union, also have an obligation to our own citizens.
What is very important in these rounds â as their failure demonstrated â is the need for greater involvement of the parliaments in the negotiations.
It is not enough for a parliament to be able, at the end, to give or withhold its approval.
Since we lament the failure to involve the public, let at least their representatives have the right to be present at negotiations and consulted â if no more than that â while they are in progress, for it is we, at the end of the day, who have to explain them to the electorate.
Â Â  Mr President, when the Doha Round ground to a temporary halt at the end of July, we had already taken small steps towards fair trade.
It was agreed that all export subsidies for agricultural products would be abolished in 2013 and that the US and Japan would follow in the EUâs footsteps by guaranteeing free market access to the least developed countries for 97% of all products; there was agreement about an extensive package of aid for trade; and, finally, the Americans had said that they intended to start phasing out their support to the cotton sector.

That, after five years, was a hard-won result, but the signature is, of course, missing, and, as I already stated I do not believe that the poorest countries should lose out as a result of that.
It is simply crucial that these measures be taken if we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives by 2015.
In response to my written request, the Commissioner has expressed his willingness to propose a frontloading arrangement with this package.
Would it be possible for him to confirm his commitment to this here in this debate?
Could he also confirm that the EU is prepared to abolish its export subsidies in 2013, unilaterally if need be?
At the same time, does he not share my view that a frontloading measure of this kind could also help get things back on track for the least developed countries?
I still take the view that, if deals are done bilaterally, multilaterally, regionally or however else one would like to call it, among the strongest parties in other words, it is particularly the weakest countries that stand to lose out.
This is something the Commissioner has said himself on many occasions, and that is why he has every reason to state that, since those countries should not be at the receiving end of those deals, we should as yet commit to this multilateral trade agreement.
Do not let the fight against poverty become the victim of deadlocked negotiations.
If the world trade round cannot be saved, at least we should save the Millennium Objectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, so the spotlight finally shines on the hypocrisy that reigns in the area of international trade on this planet, the dialogue between the cheats, the liars and the thieves.
If the situation were not so tragic, everyone would be relieved that the wolves are leaving the woods with their identities revealed and that the apprentices are once again seeing that the masters can sometimes get a taste of their own medicine.
You are right, MrÂ Mandelson, to boycott the meeting in Canberra, in Australia, scheduled for two weeks hence, because the World Trade Organisation should not be buried so hastily.
The situation is extremely serious, because governments have shown themselves to be incapable of managing world trade for the common good, and worse, incapable of setting a development timetable.
I should like to share some thoughts and a proposal with you.
As regards the Doha Agenda, it is worth taking note of the development areas on which there is consensus, and postponing the reform of international trade until the developing countries have adopted social and environmental standards conducive to fair competition in the world.
My second comment relates to farming.
The EU should not offer any more concessions until it discovers what form farming will take after 2013, bearing in mind the major developments offered by biotechnologies and the problems of feeding people that will inevitably arise.
The question is, Commissioner, can you assure us that the common agricultural policy currently in force following the 2003 reform is compatible with current WTO rules, and that we do not run the risk of losing out in a dispute brought before the Dispute Settlement Body?
Lastly, given the inability of our political leadership to find common ground on international trade, I should like to suggest that a Parliament initiative take place without delay under the auspices of the world interparliamentary union and the European Parliament.
This initiative would consist of questioning the citizensâ legitimate representatives on this issue and of making suggestions to those representatives on the right way forward for sorting out the appalling mess in which international trade finds itself.
Â Â  Mr President, I was always amazed at the Commissionerâs optimism throughout these talks.
Many of us believed that they were doomed from the start, specifically because the EU gave too much too soon, while the US gave very little at the beginning and remained dogged in its position.
There has been too much focus on agriculture, which you have said yourself, Commissioner.
Too much blame is now being levelled at agriculture for this apparent failure of the talks.
Doha was oversold for its potential for lifting the poor out of poverty.
I have said here before that the poor are used far too often in far too many negotiations.
Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date.
The price for EU agriculture and for EU consumers in terms of food supply is enormous â you have outlined it to us here this morning: downsizing by USD 20Â billion a year.
I wonder whether we could put names and faces on that downsizing.
We are retracting from milk, poultry and grain markets, not to mention beef.
I do not know many poor farmers who will gain from that, but I know many in the G20 who are not poor and who would gain significantly.
In my view, no deal better than a bad deal.
If the worldâs poor need food to eat and clean water to drink â and we know they do â then Doha was never going to deliver that to them.
I am sorry to say that, but that is the case.
We need to add to that the real threat here for the European Union.
We have raised standards of food production; we have environmental and animal welfare issues.
These were never on the table at Doha, so we were never going to have fair trade for farmers globally.
I have some questions to ask the Commissioner, one of which is very specific.
I shall answer the first myself: will world trade â free trade â deliver sufficient global food supply?
I think not.
We need to look after food production just as we are concerned about energy now.
Lastly, what about CAP reforms?
We have them on the table; we are going to have to give more.
Is that what we have ended up with at the table now, in giving too much too soon?
Â Â  Mr President, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker, MrsÂ McGuinness, on the point she made about the poor.
The alternative to a successful Doha Round is sadly already emerging.
It is a backward step to a world of unequal and exclusive bilateral deals: deals that are already strong-arming many poor countries into accepting lesser terms on market access and intellectual property rights; deals that are leaving the poorest countries out in the cold.
I believe that we still can and should go the extra mile to ensure the completion of a round that is truly about development.
That will take time.
In the short term, as others have said, we need to rescue the gains made at Hong Kong: the landmark agreement to end export subsidies by 2013; duty- and quota-free access for the poorest countries, modelled on the EUâs pioneering âEverything But Armsâ scheme; as well as a substantial commitment to expanding aid for trade to improve supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructures in the LDCs.
I commend the Commissioner on the flexibility he has shown since the collapse of the single undertaking in seeking to salvage the development package â a flexibility again, I am afraid, lacking in some of our negotiating partners.
Amid the stock-taking at the WTO, the recent report of that organisationâs task force on Aid for Trade is timely.
It highlights the real need for demand-driven additional aid, aid targeted to enable the poorest countries to participate in the global trading system.
Aid for Trade cannot substitute for delivery of the Doha Round, yet, in the intervening period, it remains an important tool to meet the technical and logistical challenges that these countries face in bringing their goods to the world market.
The faltering of the Doha talks and the disillusion surrounding their aims means that Aid for Trade is now more politically apposite than ever.
It is in the interests of all countries, developed and advanced developing, to commit funds multilaterally to ensure that the appropriate investments are made in trade-related infrastructure to allow the poorest countries to trade their way out of poverty.
I look forward to the EU â and the Commission in particular â taking a lead on these issues.
Â Â  Mr President, we all understand the difficulty and the complexity surrounding the WTO negotiations and we support the Commissioner and his team.
The EU put a good deal on the table; we were waiting for serious counter-offers and were sadly disappointed by what came back.
Surely now is the time for the EU to show moral courage and leadership.
Has the Commission considered the potential costs and benefits of the EU unilaterally eliminating all its subsidies and import tariffs on agricultural products and how this might benefit the EU, developing countries and the WTO negotiations?
In New Zealand, farmers screamed when their subsidies were abolished.
Yet New Zealand farmers are now amongst the most efficient in the world, in fact forcing other trade blocs to put up tariffs and barriers to their products.
We no longer live in a post-war Europe where food security was a legitimate concern.
Surely we need to bring the farmers of the EU into the 21st century and show moral leadership in setting dates for the abolition of both subsidies and tariffs so that less-developed countries can benefit with new markets for their produce, EU farmers would become amongst the most efficient in the world, and we would secure the goal of services liberalisation, releasing the talents of Europe onto the world.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Kamall.
There are not many farmers in your constituency, are there?!
Â Â  â () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, for all those attached to the multilateral structure, as has just been pointed out, this suspension of the implementation of the Doha Agenda for Development, designed to make trade rules work in favour of development, is very bad news.
If it ends in outright failure, we know what awaits us â a proliferation of regional agreements, which always work to the detriment of the weakest.
In other words, this would be at complete variance with our objectives, which are aimed at realigning the rules of international trade in favour of the developing countries.
This Round ought to enable us to deliver a fairer share of the benefits of globalisation and to take account of differences in levels of development. It should also offer developing countries better access to the markets, without forcing their own markets to open up at any price.
Of course, there were some shortcomings in these negotiations, but they also delivered progress, as has been pointed out in this debate.
This progress, these victories, deserve to be saved and in this respect I welcome the wish expressed by MrÂ Mandelson.
This wish is indispensable, and it is vital that the negotiations be relaunched. Yet making progress also entails reforms, and the question of the reform of the WTO is on the table today.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to say straight from the outset that I agree absolutely with Commissioner Mandelson's approach and the considerations he expressed.
There can be no doubt that our basic objective must continue to be the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations.
This will be in the interests of the European Union and the Member States.
However, this success cannot be achieved at any cost, nor can it be achieved with unilateral concessions on the part of the European Union.
I believe that the time has come for us to answer a crucial question of strategic importance: can the institutional structure of the World Trade Organisation, as we have known it since it was established in 1995, serve the strategic objective of the European Union for a democratic, multilateral trade system?
I fear, on the basis of our experience to date and given the failure of the Doha Round negotiations, that it cannot do so.
The World Trade Organisation currently generates more crises than it can resolve.
That is why I consider the priority for an initiative to be taken on the part of the European Union for a major ambitious democratic reform of the World Trade Organisation to be of strategic importance, just as I consider the need for the European Union to submit an integrated strategic trade policy for the development of bilateral and regional trade relations to be of strategic importance.
That is exactly what the United States are doing, MrÂ Mandelson, as you well know; over and above the Doha Round, they are developing their bilateral and regional trade relations.
We need to and must do the same.
Today, regional and global correlations of not only commercial but also political strength are being shaped and the European Union must not get left behind in this major strategic venture.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a real risk of the longer-term suspension of the Doha talks again resulting in a multiplication of bilateral free trade agreements, and, while there is no doubt about the fact that the poorest countries of the world will lose out as a result of this, it will also become more and more difficult to defend workersâ interests.
We once had the ambitious objective of building an environmentally and socially sustainable society, and what has become of that?
Beginning in the 1970s, the industrialised states committed themselves to spending 0.7% of their gross domestic product on development cooperation; in 2005, we spent a feeble 0.33% on it.
A sort of global Marshall Plan could now be a new initiative to the benefit of both sides, on the one hand doing away with poverty in the really poorest countries of the world and giving them a fair chance in the worldâs markets, while, on the other, preventing environmental and social dumping.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this has been a very useful debate because it has focused our attention, it has provided insight and it has given me guidance, which are the essential roles of Parliament vis-Ã -vis the Commission.
I am a new Commissioner and do not know what has happened in the past or what precedent has been set, but I feel instinctively that the information-sharing, consultation and dialogue I have with this Parliament and with the Committee on International Trade is very strong.
It is certainly more wide-ranging and frequent and of greater depth than I was used to as a minister in my national parliament.
I welcome the depth and strength of those contacts and am slightly surprised by the criticism that has been expressed.
I do not know whether it is one representative of Parliament or of the Committee on International Trade as a whole, and I hope it is not.
The Commission consults Parliament on all main trade policy orientations on the basis of the Westerterp Procedure which, as we know, provides for the possibility of a debate in Parliament before the opening of negotiations on any trade agreement, as well as for information from the Council before the conclusion of any such agreement.
We do so also on the basis of the Stuttgart Declaration, which states that Parliament should be consulted on the conclusion of all agreements â even ones covered by the then Article 113 â that have an important bearing on the Community.
Our commitment to this relationship is shown by the fact that we send the Committee on International Trade copies of all the policy documents that are under discussion in the Councilâs Article 133 Committee.
There is no legal obligation on us to do this.
We do it because it is right and because it helps underpin our relations.
No doubt we could do even better in the future, but to characterise what we do at the moment as âpoorâ or âinsufficientâ seems inaccurate.
A number of the points raised relate to legitimate concerns over the impact of these negotiations â both their direction and suspension â on developing countries.
I should make it clear that developing countries do not conform to a âstandard sizeâ state of development or set of interests when it comes to the negotiations.
There are different developing countries with very different interests and very different needs.
Our job is primarily to ensure two things: firstly, that all developing countries benefit and gain from these negotiations and, secondly, that the weaker, more vulnerable and less-developed among them receive the greatest direct assistance, not least in terms of capacity-building, Aid for Trade and the putting in place of a full duty-free and quota-free system that enables them to access rich world markets.
In other words, we operate a system of proportionality: proportionality vis-Ã -vis what we expect developing countries to contribute and the effort we expect of them in bringing these negotiations to a conclusion, and proportionality also in terms of what we give and how we support and underpin their development.
The countries that are in greatest need and have least to offer are quite rightly those which are, and will remain, our priority in these negotiations.
It is important to stress this because, unlike some of those who have spoken, I passionately believe that a good Doha deal can contribute to development and to fairer trade, through the way in which we operate special and differential treatment between developing countries, the way we allow carve-outs for commitments to developing countries to protect and enable the development of infant industry, the way we provide for longer implementation periods for developing countries so that they can prepare for change and, in particular, the way that we grant special access to the least-developed countries and attention to their capacity needs.
We shall continue to adhere to that standard, as you would expect us to do, throughout the negotiations.
What is important is to have not just access for developing countries to the markets of the developed world, but also much greater access for developing countries to the markets of other developing countries.
What is important is South-South trade, especially given the extent of duty-free and quota-free access that we in Europe already give to developing countries and particularly the ACP countries, as a result of which 75% of agricultural exports from Africa come to Europe, as do 45% of those from Latin America.
In fact, we are the most open and fair-minded trading bloc in the world.
Let us remember that fact, whilst also reminding ourselves of what we can do better in the future.
The greatest and earliest gains for developing countries will come from increased trade opportunities with other developing countries.
It is therefore South-South trade that we must not lose sight of when delicately and sensitively addressing the issues of tariff reductions and the much-needed multilateralisation of âEverything But Armsâ.
Others who have spoken have suggested that far from giving too little for and to developing countries, the European negotiating position has consisted of giving far too much, too early and showing far too much flexibility.
Well, we in Europe conceived the Doha Round.
We were primarily instrumental in launching it and we have nurtured it throughout.
After CancÃºn we were instrumental in putting it back on track, through the framework agreement, in 2004, and I do not apologise for putting an end date, in Hong Kong, on the elimination of our export subsidies.
This was a commitment we had already made, assuming, of course, that we reach the end of these negotiations and that other countries act similarly in eliminating the components of their export subsidisation.
I make no apology, and am not actually primarily responsible for the future of the common agricultural policy, although I would point out that I do not as yet see a consensus emerging in favour of its abolition.
In the event of a doubtful outcome to the Doha negotiations, we will have to look very carefully at what happens to the future of export subsidies, because that is linked to another point that has been raised in this debate â i.e. whether or not we will be more or less vulnerable to litigation at the WTO in cases brought against us on agriculture should a deal not be reached in the multilateral negotiations.
If these negotiations do not succeed, I agree that it is likely that there will be an upsurge in cases brought to the WTO, especially concerning agriculture.
We in Europe can view this possibility with relative equanimity.
We have reformed our common agricultural policy because it was right to do so for our own purposes and needs, as well as for the needs of others within the international trading system.
To the extent that we have now implemented that reform, and will continue to do so, we are protected from litigation at the WTO.
However, not all WTO members are in the same position and I certainly do not exclude the big agricultural exporters â for example Brazil and Argentina â trying the judicial road if they see that the political and negotiating one is blocked.
However, others are more vulnerable to that than we are in Europe.
Before I make one final comment about timing, let me just say this about the WTO itself.
Everybody â including the present Director-General of the WTO â agrees to varying degrees that the WTO would benefit from some institutional and procedural reform, as others have commented on during the course of this debate.
The Sutherland Report provided some interesting ideas in this regard.
However, we need to be clear in our minds on this. The present impasse in the negotiations is not due to an institutional problem but to a political one, and no institutional improvement could break the present deadlock.
That is something which requires political will and an adjustment of attitude and policy on the part of certain WTO members.
That brings me to my last point, which relates to when these negotiations can restart.
Quite simply, we will have to wait until the mid-term elections in the United States are over in November before we can entertain the idea of a serious resumption in negotiations.
I will be working to that end.
Thank you Commissioner.
With 15 minutes at the beginning and nearly 15 minutes at the end, I think you have been very consistent.
It also means that we now have a problem with the following debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0193/2006) by MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality on the proposal and the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme âFight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and informationâ as part of the General programme âFundamental Rights and Justiceâ (COM(2005)0122 â COM (2006)0230 C6-0388/2005 2005/0037A(COD)).
Â Â  . Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would first of all like to express our thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mrs GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Angelilli, for the excellent job they did.
I have to tell you that I was very happy to fulfil the request of my fellow Commissioner, Mr Frattini, to replace him, at least at the beginning of the debate, because this is a very important subject and one which is close to my heart.
I also want to tell you that the Commission is firmly committed to the Daphne programme, which sets out to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people.
We know that Parliament also values it very highly.
Daphne will be ten years old, but what the Commission is proposing is already the third version of the programme.
During that period its success has been widely acknowledged.
It has served to finance a great many projects which have helped to achieve progress in the fight against violence.
The attachment to Daphne felt by Parliament and many sections of civil society is reflected in their suggestion that the Commission should stop presenting Daphne measures and action to prevent drug abuse under the same programme heading.
As you know, the Commission has taken Parliamentâs wishes on board and on 24 May it put forward two separate programme proposals.
Although Daphne II runs to the end of 2008, it is essential that Daphne III be adopted by the end of the year so that the new forms of action provided for by the proposal for a decision, as well as the budget appropriations, which are much higher than in the past, can be used right from the beginning of next year.
I am looking forward to todayâs debate.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, the Commissionâs original proposal was that Daphne should be a joint programme for combating violence and both educating people about drugs and preventing the abuse of them.
Getting it to withdraw this proposal took a determined campaign, with joint statements by the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality and womenâs organisations, and I really am relieved that they have avoided the issues of drugs and violence being confused and enabled us to press on with what is one of the EUâs most successful programmes.
To date, however, it has been possible to use Daphne I and II to fund only some 17% of the good proposals that have been submitted, which is a demonstration of how enormous demand is, and it is for that reason that the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality is calling for additional resources.
Today sees us sending out two very clear messages.
The first is that Europe will attach greater weight to the campaign against violence and refrain from conflating it with other aspects.
The second is that we acknowledge and support the valuable work done on the ground by organisations such as womenâs organisations, numerous self-help and human rights organisations, youth associations and their networks.
Violence is on the increase in daily life, particularly those aspects of it that cross borders, and it is this that the Daphne programme addresses first, having come into being in response to it.
The womenâs movement made a priority of such matters as domestic violence, child abuse, and the trafficking of women for their sexual exploitation, and we have been able to develop many good projects to deal with these things, while also raising public awareness of them â and not just since the World Cup.
Daphne I and Daphne II have yielded valuable knowledge, one result of which has been that all the projects have been summarised in a user-friendly âtool kitâ, which it has now been possible to pass on to the various professional organisations; studies have also been made available to a wide professional public, along with contacts far beyond Europeâs borders.
Now, though, we have new tasks to which to address ourselves.
Daphne III makes cross-border ânetworkingâ much more important.
New things are happening in the migration field, and there is much important work to be done on the people-trafficking front.
We have proposed financial support for a network of ombudspersons for children, and a single number for children's emergency telephones throughout Europe.
We also want to reinforce the networks of organisations dealing with violence on the Internet.
The various activities make up a long list, and so it is not unreasonable to do as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has done and demand EURÂ 120 or 125Â million for them, and I hope that this House will help to meet the need that this demand reflects.
This House, during the last stage of Daphne, managed to secure the establishment of a helpdesk, and we have had a very positive experience of this.
It has helped organisations to establish contact with one another across borders and to find the right people to talk to.
When considering the establishment of a âthink tankâ, we should also have recourse to the immense reserve of knowledge to be found in the organisations, drawing on this knowledge and deepening it.
I do not, however, wish too great a burden to be placed on Daphne, and so I would ask you to be careful with AmendmentÂ 56.
It is intended that it should clearly define Daphneâs main target group as being children, women, and young people, and should make clear that such categories as social workers, frontier personnel, and the police are not included.
My message to you is that there must be no doubt about the fact that Daphne is mainly targeted at women, children and young people, although the others can be involved, as is made clear in AmendmentÂ 57 and elsewhere.
We continue to demand a European Year against violence against women; it is something that has been being called for for a long time, not least in Daphne I and II, and we are being persistent and consistent in continuing to do so.
I will take this opportunity to ask that all forms of violence, without equivocation or exception, be targeted.
This is something that the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality has worked through with the Commission, and I hope that we will be able to come to a final agreement on it with the Finnish Presidency of the Council by the end of the year, as we are indeed willing and ready to do.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and all my fellow Members who have worked on this report.
I also thank the Commissioner for his support and his words this morning.
I am convinced that important results can be achieved when everyone collaborates, and they have been achieved in this case.
Above all, the continuity of the Daphne programme has been guaranteed; this is an important, valuable programme for preventing and fighting violence towards women and children, which has already in the past obtained significant and to some extent unexpected results.
In addition, the programme has been guaranteed an budget line that is rightly separate, as the rapporteur also said, from the drugs prevention programme.
It is worth mentioning that, out of all the possible aims of Daphne, a number of important priorities have also been set, including the fight against domestic violence â worryingly, a problem that is constantly on the increase â and the scourge of genital mutilation.
Another important point has been to specify that the term âchildâ or âyoung personâ covers the age range from newborn to 18 years, although the measures may of course target young people up to the age of 25.
There has also been a concern to specify that violence prevention should be aimed not only at young people, women and groups at risk, but also at newborn babies: cases in which babies are mistreated or actually abandoned are growing exponentially and are often associated with situations of psychological and social deprivation.
Such occurrences could be prevented by providing mothers and families in extreme difficulties with assistance and support.
Clearly, these are ambitious aims for which, unfortunately, there is inadequate financial provision.
In conclusion, I hope that Daphne may be allocated greater resources than at present in the mid-term budget review; we are counting on your efforts as well, Commissioner, to achieve that.
Â Â  â Madam President, we must acknowledge that, with today's independent report, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in proposing the special programme to combat violence against children, young people, women and high risk groups, is correcting in the right direction the proposal for a decision on the overall programme which, in addition to combating violence and animal reactions between human beings, also promotes drugs prevention and public information as part of the general programme entitled 'Fundamental rights and justice'.
The rapporteur, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner, the chairman of the committee, MrsÂ ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, and all the members determined with sensitivity and almost unanimously the target of protection from violence, namely the most vulnerable groups of our fellow Members.
However, this does not mean that every category of persons wronged and subject to violence will not be protected without discrimination.
That is why our group, the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, does not agree with the amendments which contain lists of instances and categories of victims.
The majority of the committee's amendments develop the conclusions of the evaluation of the two generally successful previous programmes, namely Daphne Î and ÎÎ.
Given that funding of Daphne ÎÎÎ is, in our opinion, satisfactory within the framework of the agreement on the financial perspective, we must expect the results of actions to be spectacular and to eradicate violence from civilised European society, not only by 50%, as the rapporteur proposes, but if possible in its entirety, with systematic work and cooperation on the part of the authorities, local agencies, organisations and civil society.
The overall action is expected to be based on three principles: prevention with constantly updated information, addressing the root of the evil, remedy/care for victims and reintegration/rehabilitation of perpetrators.
Allow me, however, to observe that the success of the programme also depends on avoiding breaking the issue down into too many focal points and avoiding getting involved in the field of criminality in general.
That is why the European People's Party did not vote for AmendmentÂ 69.
The positive results are also expected through transparency in connection with the involvement of non-governmental organisations, which must take valued action and guarantee their positive contribution to healing the wounds of violence.
These agencies are the European Federation for Missing Children, which includes 19 organisations, and the European Children's Network, which is valued in the Member States.
We hope that the success of the new programme will safeguard the viability of the programmes once their funding ends and that we shall thus be able to ...
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner both on her report and on her constant efforts aimed at strengthening this programme.
As we all know, if this programme is not applied as broadly as proposed in MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner's report, we shall not be able to limit either superficially or materially the phenomenon of violence that is present at all social levels, violence which is spreading its social fabric and constantly extending to the large social groups now facing it and that is why I think that the European Union should step up its efforts.
I should like to stress that the Commission was right not to merge the Daphne ÎÎÎ programme with the drugs programme, a position that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner have firmly stood by.
However, I should also like to point out that, on reading the 2007 budget, we were surprised by the Council's position, which reduced Community resources for Daphne ÎÎÎ, compared with the Commission proposal.
If we are not to be hypocrites towards the victims of the violence spreading to immigrants and refugees, children and infants, we should invigorate and strengthen the budget for Daphne ÎÎÎ, because this policy of cutbacks runs completely counter to commitments to further strengthen and upgrade the programme and guarantee the efficacy of its actions.
In order for a policy of combating violence against women, children and young people to be effective and to constitute a priority for the ÎU, it must be accompanied, over and above the suitable planning and organisation of actions, by adequate resources to implement them.
Â Â  . Madam President, Daphne is the young woman in Greek mythology who was chased by the God Apollo.
His intention was to rape her, but he failed.
The moment Apollo touched her, Daphne was transformed into a laurel tree and she was saved from being raped.
In the European Parliament, the name Daphne stands for an important initiative.
Ten years ago, in the late summer of 1996, Europe exploded with the knowledge of what came to be known as the Dutroux affair.
The discovery of the bodies of a number of missing girls in a town in Belgium raised serious questions about what we do to protect women and children from those who abuse or exploit them for profit.
In April 1997, a large number of representatives from NGOs, the European Parliament, the European Commission, law enforcement agencies and other experts, gathered in Brussels for a hearing on these subjects.
Maybe the most important result of that hearing was a commitment from the Commission to launch the Daphne initiative.
What it amounts to is to put force behind the words; to give the campaign against violence a substantial budget.
The idea behind it was simple enough: to provide financial support for projects which would bring together NGOs from at least two Member States to cooperate in research, data collection and analysis, good practice identification and sharing, training exchange and networking, awareness-raising and information campaigns, but also direct action to support victims of violence and produce guidelines and protocols.
It seems simple enough, and who could possibly be against it?
But, as we all know, our society is characterised by a systematic devaluation of the things women say, do and decide.
That gender power structure affects everything and is at its most visible in the phenomenon of menâs violence against women.
Because of that, the Daphne initiative has been under constant threat ever since it started.
It should be obvious that we should not mix the fight against violence with the fight against drugs; they are simply two different areas.
It is the Commission that runs the Daphne project, but in this House it is Lissy GrÃ¶ner who should receive praise and support when we discuss the ârebornâ Daphne initiative.
She is one of the pioneers.
Of course, there is still a long way to go before we reach the necessary zero tolerance towards violence against women and children.
The long-term importance of the Daphne initiative is the way it can affect grassroots organisations, deeply embedded in all Member States of the Union.
Zero tolerance is the goal and Daphne is one of the means of achieving it.
Â Â  . â Madam President, we too are grateful to the rapporteur.
I see the prevention of Daphne and the anti-drug campaign being merged together as a tremendous success for women throughout Europe.
In bringing this about, this House has sent out a signal and re-emphasised the need for the programme to combat violence against women, children and young people to remain independent.
Daphne is a small, but very successful, programme, which has already enabled important progress to be made in combating violence against women.
Violence against women is not a private matter, but rather an issue of internal security.
The most dangerous place for women is the home in which they live.
âFamilyâ and âhomeâ may epitomise peace and security for many, but for millions of women, it is within the family and at home that they suffer, are abused, are tortured and even killed.
Human rights are an entitlement for all human beings of whatever gender, and neither culture nor tradition can excuse the violation of womenâs fundamental rights.
It follows that violence against women is not just a womenâs issue; it also affects men, who need to face up to their responsibilities and take action to deal with, and put a stop to, violence against women, not only in war zones but also in the bedroom.
Taking Daphne further cannot be the only thing we do to combat violence against women.
We would like to see the Commission produce a free-standing directive and thereby demonstrating that it attaches the highest political priority to the campaign against violence.
A proposal along these lines has been overdue for many years.
It is positively scandalous that the Commission should shut its eyes to the demand for one and should disregard the need for European legislation to be harmonised.
It really is quite essential that a free-standing directive be put in place, and, while I am on that subject, let me say that I would like to hear the Commission say something today about something concerning which we, in this House, have passed numerous resolutions, whether on International Womenâs Day or on other occasions.
We also hope that the Commission and the Council will be able to wrap up negotiations on Daphne as soon as possible, so that the programme can be refinanced in good time for 2007.
It is important to us, too, particularly at a time like this, when the womenâs rights campaigner Seyran AteÅ has been forced by vicious threats to give up her lawyerâs practice in Germany, that we should put the spotlight on the violations of migrant women's human rights, and affirm that there will be, for them, âzero toleranceâ.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner, for an excellent report and for the committed way in which she has tackled the issues involved.
I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for their committed approach when it comes to the fight against violence against women.
Those women and children who are subject to violence need the Daphne III programme.
Violence against women by men occurs in all social groups.
One cannot merely single out particular groups or particular factors such as drug and alcohol abuse â there is violence against women and children across the whole of society.
Despite the fact that study after study confirms that violence occurs in all social groups, many people still refuse to see the truth, which is that violence occurs right across the spectrum.
Myths about the involvement of alcohol or drugs continue to flourish.
If we are to fight violence against women, we have to banish these myths that it is âthemâ or âothersâ or âaddictsâ that abuse women and children.
It is just as likely to be our own neighbour, workmate or relative who perpetrates such acts of violence.
This is one of the reasons why the Daphne programme must be split into two separate programmes â one programme especially for the prevention of, and fight against, violence against women and children and another for the prevention of narcotics abuse and for providing information in that regard.
Having a joint programme for these two different social problems would be to perpetuate the myths that there is a connection between drug and alcohol abuse and violence against women by men. This then leads to the belief that if we solve the drug and alcohol problems we also solve the violence problem, but this is not the case.
These are both social problems that need to be solved, but they require different measures if they are to be so.
I am therefore pleased to see that the Commission has accepted division into separate programmes.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left gives its full support to this report.
We believe that it is particularly important that the programme also tackles the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes.
This is important because we must do everything we can to fight this modern slave trade.
It is also important in order to highlight the fact that this slave trade is another example of the violence to which women and children are subjected.
There are two terms in the report that I would like to see changed.
The first of these terms is âdomestic violenceâ, which I believe we should call âviolence against women by menâ, since that is exactly what it is.
Violence against women does not only occur within the four walls of a domestic household.
Women who live in abusive relationships live with this physical and psychological torture 24 hours a day.
The other term I would question is âprivate lifeâ.
There is no reason to make a distinction between public and private life.
The perpetration of violence against women is a criminal act, whether in public or in private.
Â Â  . Madam President, to begin with, I would like to mention the division of the Daphne document into two separate programmes.
This would be a positive step if the intention were to carry out a genuine investigation into the problem of drug addiction and violence, as well as their prevention, instead of a self-centered perception of the problem and the failure to perceive the real causes for these social ills.
Violence is a serious problem and, as with other disorders, the most effective means of combating it is to eliminate the causes and risk factors.
These include neurobiological indicators as well as traits such as selfishness, hostility, impulsiveness, irritability, anhedonia, low intelligence, poor responsiveness of the brain to stimuli, as well as a lack of respect for values and antisocial behaviour.
We have to be aware that the growing plague of aggression, mental disorders, underdeveloped personalities and addictions is a result not only of a hedonistic lifestyle but also stems from the dominance of a materialistic world view which does not appreciate the role of spiritual development in the individual.
The vast amount of knowledge gathered to date correlates poorly with the primary environmental factors influencing the development of a well-balanced personality. One of these factors is a healthy and loving family, preferably a complete one with many children, where the children are wanted, loved and learn to live together with, and for, others.
Â Â  â Madam President, every day millions of women are victims of abuse of all kinds, including violence from family members, intimidation at work, mental cruelty, sexual abuse and forced prostitution.
In the EU, one in five women suffers what is referred to as domestic abuse, that is, violence perpetrated by her husband or partner.
Let us not forget, however, that these figures only take account of reported violence.
Indeed, fear, shame and the limited access to public services explain all too often why some violence goes unreported.
What is more, some types of violence are not counted because they do not fit in with established definitions and are not considered as crimes because they are seen as taboo subjects.
The Daphne Programme to fight against violence against women proposed by Parliament and the Council more than six years ago covers all forms of abuse, other than domestic violence, suffered by women around the world.
In this regard, the emphasis should be placed on the fact that the large majority of such abuse is related to particular cultures and societies, in particular Islam and countries where Islamic law is in force, and in which stoning, genital mutilation, immolation and forced marriage are part of the culture, the religion and the customs.
The Daphne Programme should channel its efforts into the fight for the womanâs right to information, protection and punishment for the perpetrators of the abuse, and should help to change certain mentalities and barbaric customs that sadly still exist in many countries governed by Islamic law.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted at this measure.
I have been pleased to hear during this morning's debate in this House that many Members have mentioned a need that I wholeheartedly endorse: we have to move towards a European Union directive on violence.
The time has come to harmonise legislation on this subject and, until that happens, the Commission should use the tools that they say they are preparing and straight away set out a very clear-cut, rigorous position on the policies that the Union and its Member States should apply, so that we can take a clear stand on these issues.
It is true that a great deal has been done in recent years on the subject of equality.
The individual EU Member States have passed legislation in so many areas, but some black holes have been left concerning this very subject.
We must operate with clear, well-defined policies in this regard because, even though we all agree on proposing zero tolerance towards violence, we do not all agree on the tools to use to achieve this aim.
So as to obviate the risks of this policy, then, the programmes to be financed through Daphne must respond to clear-cut, rigorous policies defined by the Union.
Â Â  â Madam President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that separating the Daphne III programme from the programme on drugs prevention and information, as requested by this Parliament, was crucial to the proper operation of Daphne.
It has been a genuine success on the part of the rapporteur to achieve this separation; it has increased the strength and visibility of the Daphne programme, which is an essential instrument for supporting womenâs organisations combating gender violence.
As well as the budgetary increase already mentioned, I would like to stress certain important contributions made by MrsÂ GrÃ¶nerâs report: firstly, the specific inclusion of people trafficking and forced prostitution as forms of violence, and the absolutely clear reference to genital mutilation and honour crimes as forms of gender violence that have a serious impact on health.
Under no circumstances can violence against women be justified on the grounds of tradition or cultural practice, and I also believe that it is very important that children who see their mothers being abused should be included as victims of gender violence.
It is also very appropriate that the report asks that the programme pay particular attention to certain groups of women, such as refugees, emigrants, women living in poverty, disabled women and elderly women, as groups exposed to a greater risk of violence.
It is also very important that the report proposes including the definition of the legal basis for combating violence against women amongst the sections providing European added value.
At the same time, concrete objectives must be set, such as reducing the number of victims of violence and people trafficking by half over the next ten years.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against violence against women can undoubtedly help to promote awareness raising and the sharing of good practices, and it is therefore very important that this Year should also be supported within this Daphne programme.
Â Â  Madam President, I fully support the rapporteur's excellent proposal to split the financial framework programmes into two specific programmes.
This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves.
The Daphne programme has been an important instrument in helping to raise awareness of and to combat violence against women, children and young people.
In Ireland, as elsewhere, violence against women is a very significant problem, with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime.
Funding from Daphne has had a positive impact on the work of many Irish womenâs groups.
However, unfortunately, national funding for frontline services to assist women and children is still not adequate, with insufficient shelter accommodation for those at risk.
I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them.
I am pleased to see that in Amendment 14, along with other vulnerable groups, women with disabilities were specifically mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to violence.
It is therefore crucial to ensure that measures are put in place to protect those suffering multiple discriminations.
Amendment 14 also mentions women living in poverty in rural or remote communities.
Outreach services need to be put in place so that these women and children can access the necessary services and be protected from violence.
I am also pleased to see references in this report to trafficking and enforced prostitution, to children who witness violence, and to action specifically designed to prevent newborn children from being abused.
However, in the final analysis, whether you are new born or elderly, citizen or migrant, rural or urban, nobody should be at risk of violence.
Indeed, the fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.
Finally, I would like to give my full support to the promotion of the European Year Against Violence Against Women: awareness-raising is crucial.
Â Â  Madam President, a year and a half ago, Spain was in the vanguard of Europe in terms of combating male violence against women, when it approved an integrated law against such violence.
Nevertheless, so far this year 51 people have been killed as a result of this scourge, of this kind of violence.
We cannot therefore feel satisfied, naturally.
The law was necessary, and that is what we said, but, as we can see, unfortunately a law is not enough.
The essence of this kind of violence is deeply rooted in peopleâs mindsets and in the cultures that suffer from those mindsets, and one year, or one piece of paper, will not be enough to change that.
Daphne, the objective of which is to combat violence of all kinds, is therefore a fundamental instrument, and we cannot and must not give up on it.
Many forms of violence against women need to be combated: people trafficking, physical and psychological abuse, practices such as clitoral circumcision or the feminisation of poverty, and many others.
All of them require urgent action and resources. They will never be sufficient, however, regardless of how many of them there are or appear to be.
We must therefore once again call upon the governments to emerge from their European lethargy and to understand that it is not possible to do more things with less money and that, with regard to violence in general and male violence against women in particular, we cannot demand great actions unless we also provide the means and resources needed to carry them out.
To provide Daphne with resources and with political importance is not a purely bureaucratic process.
Let us not forget that its ultimate objective is to save lives.
Though, like the Spanish law against gender violence, it is not sufficient, it is nevertheless essential.
Â Â  â It is extremely important that this report by MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner be adopted, and I wish to commend her on her work.
The Daphne Programme can help prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and protect the victims, an area that must be strengthened.
In so doing, continuity will be provided for previous Daphne programmes and the scope of those programmes extended.
Violence against women, and the suffering, and in many cases the death, that it leads to, cannot be tolerated any more.
This is a fight that requires constant effort and action, and must not be confused with other actions.
For womenâs rights to be resolutely defended, the Daphne III programme must, as suggested in the proposal before us, remain separate, and increased funding is required if we are to counter physical, sexual and psychological violence more effectively, including the violence associated with the trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and domestic violence, and threats of such acts, of which women, young people and children are the main victims.
Preventative action must be taken in the form of awareness-raising campaigns, for example the European Year against violence against women.
Moreover, action must be taken in support of the victims.
In order to establish clear, credible targets for effectively reducing violence, public policy needs to be more proactive and greater financial support is required for the organisations involved in this fight.
Hence the reinforcement that we have proposed and that we hope will be adopted.
Â Â  Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner on her report which contains a number of very positive proposals.
I am mainly referring to the removal of all drugs-related topics.
Drug use and violence have, despite a certain overlap, been kept apart, with good reason.
The emphasis on the fight against human trafficking within this programme is, in my view, the other main gain.
I would, however, like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of real action.
The efforts many have made to take action against forced prostitution and human trafficking at the time of the World Cup have not been rewarded with constructive action by the parties involved.
It is hoped that this House and the Commission, in coalition, can persuade, and possibly compel, Member States, NGOs and citizens to respect the rights of fellow human beings in order to reduce exploitation of this kind.
I am less positive about the views on the distribution of responsibilities.
It is my deep conviction that it is no business of government to encroach upon the personal privacy of individual people without good reason.
There is only cause for this once the boundaries of criminal law have been crossed.
Since these boundaries vary from one Member State to another, it is up to them to guarantee enforcement in this respect.
Since it is impossible to find justification for an active role for Europe in this area, my group has applied for separate votes for a number of those amendments, which I will be in favour of once those elements have been removed.
Â Â  â Madam President, it is shocking that one out of every three women around the world should fall victim to violence at some point in the course of her life, and I should like to say a number of things about this.
In view of the violence committed by young people, it is intolerable that young people should be allowed to carry weapons, that they should use them to inflict wounds and worse, and that party drugs and other intoxicants should circulate among them; our teachers therefore need to be trained in the prevention of violence, theft, vandalism and drug-dealing.
Another promoter of violence is the Internet, which not only enables perverts to establish contact with their potential victims, but also offers, at various sites on it, detailed tips on the committing of violent acts.
This, I believe, is where criminal prosecutions need to be stepped up.
Finally, I cannot do other than address the violence that is current within immigrant communities.
People who come from cultural environments with a quite different attitude towards violence â by which I mean an archaic one â believe that they can retain their greater propensity for violence even within the EU; it follows that potentially violent elements must be prevented from entering it, and that the abandonment of violence must be made priority in integration.
Â Â  First of all, let me cordially welcome the delegation of women from the town of Lazio in Italy who are listening to our discussion from the balcony.
To begin with, I would like to recall the success we have jointly achieved.
Thanks to the close and good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, what was originally a two-part Community programme â combating violence against women and fighting against drugs â has now been divided.
In this way, we have emphasised how very important each of the two struggles really is.
I wish to express my gratitude to CommissionerÂ Frattini and his team, and particularly to our rapporteur MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner for her excellent work, as well as to all my colleagues from the committee for their cooperation.
I am proud of this achievement.
The Daphne programme, however, will not be effective as long as men â both those in the home and those engaged in politics and public life â do not actively participate in the process.
In this respect, I appreciate the actions taken by the Austrian and Finnish presidencies in support of the involvement of men in promoting gender equality.
Since 1946, dozens of regulations have been passed, and yet there is still growing violence.
I hope that this will not prove to be just one more regulation, since we all know that the problem will not be solved solely by administrative actions and the funding of short-term, one-off campaigns targeting violence against women and children.
It is not enough to deal only with the consequences.
We must focus on prevention and on systemic education and the promotion of respect and the dignity of the human being.
This and only this will be fruitful.
We must focus on the treatment of violent individuals as soon as they manifest inclinations to violence. Otherwise, the use of the Daphne funds will be ineffective, if not totally worthless.
I would like to conclude by mentioning violence against children, which is also addressed by the Daphne programme.
As we speak, a paedophile party in the Netherlands is promoting its agenda with the aim of legalising paedophilia and sexual activity with children â as long as children give their consent.
Almost everyone is silent on this matter.
I wonder whyÂ âŠ
Unless we are able to apply our legal tools and use the support of politicians to stop the abuse of minors, we will never win the battle against violence against women and children.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my satisfaction at the agreement reached between the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to split the content of the programme we are debating into two specific programmes.
This agreement was actually brokered by the Commission, and for that I thank CommissionerÂ Frattini.
Having said that, I should like to express my support, my full support, for the report by MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner, whom I congratulate, and in doing so I shall highlight an amendment that I consider particularly important, which is the one that specifically mentions national, regional and local authorities as targets of awareness-raising actions.
I shall also explain why: a few days ago in Milan there were some cases of violence against young women; naturally, these episodes of violence caused outrage, but some comments were also made that once again confirm an attitude that is quite widespread among the authorities, that the victims are also somehow partly to blame for violent acts.
You will all remember, I am sure, the so-called âjeansâ ruling; well, among the comments I shall quote the one made by the Prefect of Rome, who stated that the latest episode, when two French girls were raped after accepting a lift from two strangers, was due to imprudence more than anything else.
Even though the prefectâs intentions were undoubtedly good, this statement reveals a way of thinking according to which, if a woman is raped, it is at least partly her own fault.
Is being imprudent, however, a crime?
I do not think so, and I should not like to go back to the times when women were asked to stay at home in the evenings so as not to be imprudent.
Well, then, I should like to point out that we are talking about programmes to ensure that the European Union develops as an area of freedom, and I emphasise âfreedomâ, as well as security and justice.
Â Â  Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great defeat still, on this late summerâs day of 2006, to have to stand here and talk about gender-based violence, honour killings and genital mutilation.
That this is the case shows that such behaviour is, in fact, still in some way accepted within society and something that we have not yet overcome.
For as long as we do not agree that abuse, both physical and psychological, is also a violation of human rights for women and children, millions of women and children will be subjected to exactly that.
One way of showing that we are agreed to signpost this as unacceptable behaviour is to approve and highlight such international agreements as exist â the UN Convention on Womenâs Rights, the UN Convention on Childrenâs Rights, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and the tool that the Daphne programme represents.
I am appalled to hear that the Independence and Democracy Group will be voting against parts of this programme.
