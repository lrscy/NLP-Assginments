Three more negotiating chapters - economic and monetary policy, enterprise and industrial policy, and customs union - have been opened.
In addition, both parties' negotiating positions on Chapter 7 - intellectual property law - have been submitted, and this is expected to be opened shortly.
Croatia has submitted its negotiating position on five of the other chapters to the Conference.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, as rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the accession of Croatia, I hope it will be possible to conclude the negotiations by the next European elections at the latest, so that Croatia can participate.
My specific question is as follows: does the President-in-Office think it conceivable that a further eight or so chapters could be opened under the German Presidency, and can he really assure me that a tougher line is not being taken with Croatia than with other candidate countries?
Parliament sometimes has the impression that, with Croatia, an attempt is being made to make up for some of the precision that previous enlargements lacked.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Posselt, at the very least, you can be assured that Croatia will receive absolutely fair treatment.
If you are thinking of the framework conditions for the negotiations with Turkey, for example, you are right, of course, that the instrument of negotiations has changed over time; and, if you are thinking of the newly introduced benchmarks, for example, it is indeed true that the framework and the instruments have evolved.
This is not something that is peculiar to Croatia, however, but will of course apply to all future accession negotiations, including those with the Western Balkan countries - who also hope to see their negotiations opened at some stage.
This is not a case of applying a special law to Croatia, therefore, but instead reflects the evolution of the instruments for European enlargement as a whole.
Regarding the honourable Member's request for predictions, I have to say that predictions are hard to make.
I can only tell you in general terms that we have found Croatia, on the whole, to be a very conscientious, very committed negotiating partner, and that, regardless of any other ideas as to political framework or timing, we are endeavouring to make swift progress with the negotiations.
I have of course mentioned the state of play in the negotiations - which is excellent.
If you consider that Croatia made its application for membership as recently as 2003, attained the status of candidate country in 2004, and started negotiating last October, this is quite astonishingly rapid progress - even compared to the latest negotiation processes with the 12 countries that have now joined the EU.
We are assuming that both sides are interested in continuing this rapid progress.
(DE) The President-in-Office also mentioned Turkey - he even made a direct comparison.
Here, some negotiating chapters have been suspended, or it has been decided not to open any more.
Does the Council believe that the negotiation process is really progressing at a different speed, or is this basically just a formal measure whose effects will be felt at some stage?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Rack, as you know, there was a specific background to the suspension of the negotiations on certain chapters.
Solving this problem so that we can return to a normal rhythm is in the hands of the Republic of Turkey.
Of course, one thing is true.
The whole strategy of negotiations with Turkey is governed by different rules again from those for the other negotiations to date - including those now being conducted in parallel - in that a consensus decision must be taken every time a chapter is opened or closed.
The decision of October 2005 enables all Member States to play a particularly strong, even controlling, role themselves in the negotiations - which was indeed the basis for the consensus on opening negotiations in the first place.
Turkey, too, understands this and has approved this approach and procedure.
It cannot be said, therefore, that Turkey is receiving unfair treatment; it is more a case that a consensus could not have been reached otherwise.
Both sides have approved this consensus.
(DE) It is known that regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations form part of European policy.
The President-in-Office has mentioned that there are a number of problems with Croatia's relations with other countries, for example border disputes.
As the President-in-Office sees it, who bears greater responsibility for the fact that these border agreements have yet to be signed, Croatia or its neighbouring countries?
I would prefer to avoid apportioning blame, Mr Paleckis.
This has been our policy for all the other accession processes.
We have always said that there is a Copenhagen criterion that states that good neighbourly relations must be organised.
A precondition for this is that any problems with a country's neighbours must be resolved. As long as a country does not ask us to intervene in any way, we assume that the country is attempting to solve these problems itself, as this is a precondition for the enlargement process and the accession process itself.
We should not, at this stage, be pursuing a different policy with Croatia from the one we pursued in the past with the other 12 countries, who all resolved their neighbourhood and border problems on their own responsibility.
This also goes for the Baltic States, even though there are unfortunately some additional things to be regulated there now.
This is good practice, however, and should not be avoided.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Subject: Zimbabwe
Current EU sanctions against Robert Mugabe's regime end on 20 February 2007.
Following 'Operation Murambatsvina', the forced eviction of hundreds of thousands of people living in informal settlements across the country in 2005, the Zimbabwean Government has repeatedly hindered UN efforts to provide emergency shelter and subjected some of the most vulnerable people to repeated forced evictions.
Bearing this in mind, along with well-documented human rights abuses suffered by those who oppose Mr Mugabe's regime, is the Council able to give assurances that the EU's refusal to accept these violations will be demonstrated through a renewal of sanctions?
Subject: EU relations with Zimbabwe
Can the Council state what measures it is going to pursue against the Zimbabwean Government in light of the flagrant breach of human rights in this country?
Is the Council aware that Zimbabwe is on the verge of famine and is the Council aware that the Government of South Africa has been supporting the Zimbabwean Government in both a political and economic sense over the past number of years?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, many thanks for permitting me to answer these questions together, as they belong together in terms of their subject matter.
My answer is as follows.
The Council can confirm that the restrictive measures against the Zimbabwean Government will be continued in their present form.
On 19 February 2007, they were extended by a further year.
The Council monitored the situation in Zimbabwe closely throughout last year, but was unable to detect any improvement with regard to the criteria it had established as a precondition for the resumption of dialogue.
The Council is monitoring the humanitarian and social situation in Zimbabwe very closely.
Humanitarian aid, including food aid, is being provided where needed.
The Council is paying particular attention to the human rights situation in Zimbabwe.
In September 2006, following violent attacks on demonstrating trade unionists, a declaration was issued calling on the Government of Zimbabwe, 'to stop intimidation and assault and to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its citizens'.
In this connection, the EU made express reference to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights to which Zimbabwe, too, was a signatory.
The Presidency reacted immediately to the violent break-up of a peaceful, church-sponsored rally in Harare on 11 March 2007, during which one participant was killed, several were injured and many were arrested, with a statement.
It expressed its concern about the criminalising by the Zimbabwean authorities of this peaceful rally, and urged that the persons arrested be released immediately and that they be given access to legal assistance and medical care.
There is no doubt that the crisis in Zimbabwe has had a negative economic and social impact on the whole region for years.
Regarding the role of South Africa, the Council assumes that this country is monitoring the political, economic and social developments in Zimbabwe very closely and working on solving the problem with the means at its disposal.
deputising for the author. - Mr President, the extension of the restrictions in Zimbabwe is very welcome, but given the catalogue of human rights abuses, including the recent mistreatment of Morgan Tsvangirai and his colleagues, and given the possibility that the current regime may well remain in place after elections at the end of this month, how does the Council intend to handle the African Union's insistence that all its Member States participate in the EU-Africa summit, scheduled for Lisbon in December?
deputising for the author. - Thank you, President-in-Office, for your response.
Following the arrest of Morgan Tsvangirai last Sunday, it was not until Tuesday - yesterday - that he was arraigned before a court and given access to medical treatment.
We all know about the human rights abuses that have taken place - they have been well catalogued over the last few months - but there are also the effects on the human population: 3.5 million refugees have left Zimbabwe.
Furthermore, last Saturday the price of a loaf of bread was 3000 Zimbabwean dollars and today it is 9000.
There is 80% unemployment.
Is it not now time that neighbouring countries, like South Africa, took a firm stance with Zimbabwe and the corrupt regime of Robert Mugabe?
Minister, I think we would all welcome the renewal of the sanctions against Zimbabwe, but it is clear that much more needs to be done, not least in the light of the wanton abuses of human rights demonstrated by last week's actions against the opposition.
Will the Council in particular maximise pressure on Zimbabwe's neighbours?
Are they not the key to this matter?
You talk euphemistically about South Africa applying silent diplomacy, but is the truth of the matter not that South Africa has been propping up this regime for years, and that you are being far too timid in your response to South Africa and need to apply real pressure there?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I have just addressed this subject in some detail, admittedly in a rather descriptive form, by explaining the relevant sensitivities in the realm of African countries, particularly within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which has competence in the region.
We are conducting a dialogue with the SADC countries on the subject, which we shall continue.
In our experience, however, simply increasing the pressure is not conducive to improving the way African countries deal with Zimbabwe - almost the reverse is the case: it gives rise to instinctive African solidarity.
We have not yet found an answer to how to deal with this, but we shall of course continue our intensive dialogue with the SADC countries - including with South Africa, of course - as we have no idea as yet what the reaction to these recent occurrences will be.
This is against the background of Robert Mugabe's announcement that he may now run for office again.
No responses to this have been forthcoming from Africa as yet, but these responses will be very important in aiding a decision on how to react.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The European Union reacted immediately to the tragic news of the murder of Hrant Dink.
In its statement, the Presidency expressed its conviction that the Turkish authorities will identify and arrest the persons responsible for this abominable murder as quickly as possible, and that Turkey will steadfastly continue along the path towards fully realising freedom of expression.
As the author is no doubt aware, the Council has emphasised repeatedly how important it considers freedom of expression.
Further continuous efforts are required to ensure that there is freedom of expression in Turkey in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU has raised the particular issue of Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code and other imprecisely worded articles systematically at all levels within the framework of the ongoing reform process in Turkey.
At the most recent meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council, the EU made it clear that Turkey must alter the imprecisely worded articles in line with the relevant EU standards in case judges and public prosecutors adhere to a restrictive interpretation of these provisions.
We expect the tragic murder of Hrant Dink to mark a turning point that brings substantial changes in the Criminal Code.
The author can also rest assured that the Union will continue to monitor developments in this field attentively and if necessary raise the issue at all levels.
Progress in this key area is of prime importance for the general progress of the accession negotiations.
deputising for the author. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to inform you that just yesterday the public prosecutor instituted proceedings for denigration of Turkishness against Attila Yayla, a professor of political sciences, who was suspended from the University of Gazi in Ankara because he called Kemalism a backward ideology.
The prosecution clearly makes targets of the defendants.
In Dink's case, the fact that he was acquitted by the court did not prevent fanatics from murdering him.
Consequently, the Council cannot wait for court rulings in order to demand that the Turkish Criminal Code be amended.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Triantaphyllides, you will understand that I cannot go into detail here today on something that happened yesterday; although the things you say do unfortunately confirm the continued necessity of the things I have mentioned.
There is a clear need to conduct this dialogue at all levels - and I have explained that we are doing so - and also to put pressure on Turkey to adapt its standards and legislation on this to European standards.
This is crucial for the chances of success of the accession negotiations.
At present, this is the most important instrument at the Council's disposal, and we are using it.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The honourable Member's words further illustrate the problem of the imprecision of Turkish legislation.
This goes for not only Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code, but also the anti-terror legislation. This imprecision is not just a legal, but also a political problem, because it can suddenly be put to a different use depending on the prevailing mood or on political developments.
For this reason, we are urging our Turkish counterparts to make changes in these very areas, in order to establish some degree of legal certainty and to avoid a situation in which certain agitation or certain trends in Turkish politics lead to changes in people's legal certainty.
This is our important objective.
The honourable Member can rest assured that we shall continue to work towards this objective with great commitment.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Reform of EU trade policy instruments (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Commission Green Paper and public consultation on a possible reform of EU trade policy instruments B6-0009/2007).
deputising for the author. - Mr President, we have asked for this debate to examine the background and the purpose of the Green Paper adopted by the Commission on 6 December 2006.
With the Green Paper, the Commission intends to stimulate a debate over the use of trade defence instruments in Europe: countervailing, anti-dumping and safeguard measures.
I believe that this is a commendable initiative and I am convinced of the value of this debate.
We need to talk much more about trade policy and about the choices made by the European Commission and by the Council and we need to ensure that decisions are properly discussed before this Parliament.
We need to give this Parliament more power and to make trade policy more subject to democratic scrutiny.
We are all living through a moment which many view as some sort of crisis period.
We are living through a time when Europeans are asking themselves: what does Europe represent and why do we need such a complicated thing as the European Union in the first place?
And, when these legitimate concerns are raised, the importance of the role of a united EU in the globalised world and the importance of having a single voice to represent and defend the interests of 500 million citizens in any negotiation with other trade partners in the world market are vital factors to be considered.
Global trade and its impact on the lives of our citizens and on the future of our businesses, big, medium-sized and small, play an essential role in the anxieties felt by many over what we usually call 'globalisation'. And, while many of us believe that some of the criticism is no more than cheap demagogy, we must understand those anxieties and we must oppose pure determinism in the way this new world develops, in the way trade takes place, in the way wealth and poverty are distributed.
Europeans who lose their jobs when a company suddenly decides to move eastwards in search of higher profits cannot simply be told that times have changed and that they cannot stand in the way of progress.
They want to know what is going on and they must have their voice heard by those that ultimately decide.
We should not forget that there is more than one recipe for economic growth and trade development.
It is a matter of policy options whether the future of Europe belongs only to huge retail corporations and to importers or whether we can preserve a model compatible with our most essential social and environmental concerns.
Our strong belief in free trade is perfectly compatible with the need to ask for a level playing field.
Even the most peaceful countries in the world - and Europe among them - know that a full commitment to peace does not necessarily mean that armies are abolished and all means of defence are to be destroyed.
So, we say yes to the huge benefits of free trade in our open world and we say yes to the fair implementation of the rules on which this global trade is based.
We welcome the Green Paper, which has the merit of opening a debate on this subject.
Its text and the questions it raises already assume that something must be done to modify the current Community trade defence system.
This might be true.
The recent footwear case has shown that the risk of deadlocks is real.
They are clearly of no benefit to anybody.
Nobody here is blindly defending inefficient European production or supporting a protectionist approach to this highly sensitive matter.
Trade defence reform can be considered, if it is to be made more effective and more transparent.
The Green Paper can be a good starting point if all the stakeholders' views are properly taken into consideration and if the Commission and the Council do not entrench themselves behind preconceived ideological positions.
The decision-making process can also be improved and we need to ensure that decisions are taken by Member States based on the well-founded research carried out by independent Community bodies, rather than on the basis of national interests, or, if you prefer, national selfishness.
It is therefore important to improve and reinforce trade defence instruments instead of watering them down.
On the other side, a fresh approach can be made to less traditional threats to a balanced and free world trade.
Practices such as so-called social or environmental dumping need also to be confronted and, when necessary, new means of tackling them should be seriously considered as a matter of Community interest.
The following are the questions I would like Mr Mandelson to respond to tonight.
Firstly, the Doha negotiations have been restarted and I sincerely hope that they will result in a clear success.
In this respect, would it not have been better to wait for the successful conclusion of multilateral negotiations before starting this exercise, which might weaken our position in Geneva?
Secondly, can Mr Mandelson explain why his services are already applying quite a few questionable innovations mentioned in the Green Paper, even before the public consultation has come to an end and without any discussions either before the Council, or before this Parliament?
Thirdly, since the new trade defence system proposed by the Commission assigns a role to all possible interested parties, including those not related to the production of goods falling under the scope of the investigation, do you not believe that the time has come to allow trade unions to lodge a complaint, as foreseen by the WTO anti-dumping agreement?
I conclude by formally asking Mr Mandelson to provide assurances that the European Parliament will be kept informed at all stages of the process and that the views expressed by its members will be fully taken into account when discussing this highly sensitive matter.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I do not think I have ever been asked to reply, in any Parliament in which I have been President-in-Office, to an opening question or a speech with which I have agreed more than the speech I have just listened to.
In terms of its description of the spirit, purpose and context of this exercise, I must say I thought the honourable Member captured in every respect what we are doing most accurately and well.
The only stage at which, I have to say, I somewhat part company is when he asks me why our services - DG Trade - are applying new rules before the conclusion of the review.
I have absolutely no idea what instances or issues he is referring to, and I would be pleased to hear because I do not know of any.
On 29 May last year, I informed the European Parliament of the necessity to review our trade defence instruments.
I am pleased to be able to be back here and to update you on this process.
We are now coming to the end of the consultation that we launched in December.
That consultation solicited opinion from Member States, business, NGOs, individuals and, of course, the European Parliament.
What it did not do in any way was question the importance of trade defence instruments.
TDI is necessary to combat unfair trade in an international economy that has no international equivalent to the competition rules we take for granted in our own domestic economies.
TDI, in my view, is the flip side of an open economy.
It is the guarantee that others will not abuse that openness by trading unfairly.
The Green Paper asks if we could use TDI better, if our tools have adapted to a changing global economy and whether our rules could be clearer and operate more transparently.
I think the justification for such an exercise is pretty obvious.
The last review of our trade defence instruments was in 1996, and a lot has changed in the ways EU companies operate and as regards the role of global supply chains in our economy.
Many more EU companies now produce goods wholly or partially outside the EU for import into the EU.
These changes challenge traditional understanding of what constitutes EU production and the EU's economic interests.
They make a definition of European workers' interests harder to write, as cases are more complex.
Because these interests overall are those in which trade defence is rooted, that is good reason to assess the way we work and the way those rules operate.
But the Green Paper launched a consultation; it contains no recommendations for reform and is not intended to.
It puts forward a set of questions.
I have repeatedly emphasised that this is an open process and I have no preconceived ideas.
There was a question asked of me about the intentions behind the six categories of question in the consultation paper.
They are designed simply to put the various issues in context.
Some are linked to the impact of globalisation on our trade defence system.
Others, especially those related to transparency, were raised by stakeholders and experts with whom I had informal discussions in July last year.
So there are no intentions beyond the desire for intelligent debate and to rebuild the consensus and solidarity that has underpinned TDI and has come under strain in some recent cases.
I fully echo the honourable Member's initial observation: we need to replace national selfishness with European solidarity, and that is what I hope to rebuild through the process of this review.
I do not come to you today with substantive proposals because that is not my role at this stage.
Right now, we are listening.
The scope of any proposed changes will depend on what we hear.
Somebody asked how this review fits with our attempts to reform anti-dumping rules in the WTO.
The honourable Member reflected that question.
Actually, it is a rather good question.
It is vital to push through the WTO to ensure others match the kind of standards we apply to ourselves.
We are doing that and we will keep doing that in the DDA negotiations.
But EU legislation on TDI already goes beyond WTO requirements in many ways.
The most obvious examples are the compulsory lesser duty rule and the Community interest test which we apply in all investigations.
These are rules we introduced because they make the system work better in the wider EU interest.
Of course we will push others to adopt similar rules, but reform at the international level is difficult and some of our key partners are, frankly, stubborn.
So long as our refinements do not put us at a competitive disadvantage, so long as they reflect the EU's economic interests, why should we not pursue further reform?
That point relates to the question about the EU's general posture on anti-dumping.
Are we protectionist or do we follow a 'response and defence' approach?
In my view, protectionism is the shielding of a domestic industry from foreign competition, from fair competition - tough competition, yes, but fair nonetheless.
That is not the intention of EU TDI policy and I will, of course, remain vigilant on that.
We are not going to see our trade defence instruments turned into measures to protect EU industry from fair, legitimate competition.
A protectionist does not recognise the difference between tough competition and unfair competition.
We do.
Our system does.
That is the difference between protection and protectionism.
The EU process is complaint driven.
We act only when EU industry can provide sufficient evidence that they are threatened by unfair trade, but we defend European production only against unfair trade, and we are bound by law to ensure that any trade defence measure is truly in the wider European economic interest.
We are prudent and we are restrained but, above all, we are objective and dispassionate.
A number of questions have gone right to this issue of making sure that TDI is effective and serves Europe's growth and competitiveness agenda.
As you know, this review is part of the global Europe framework policy that I launched last year, which is explicitly intended to put EU trade policy at the service of this growth and job strategy.
Beyond saying that, I think TDI can and should be part of our wider strategy for ensuring that EU companies compete on a level playing field internationally.
I think it is for stakeholders to suggest how well the system is working to that end, and that is the purpose of the review.
The question about the effectiveness of our measures is a good one.
The possibility of review of trade defence measures always exists and measures cannot be extended without clear evidence that they are functioning as intended.
The Commission also undertakes internal analysis to ensure the effectiveness of its work.
DG Trade has recently started to analyse the impact of trade defence measures on certain companies and sectors.
A credible TDI system has to be based on this sort of analysis.
A question was asked about public information and about the results of the consultation process.
As you know, the Commission has very clear rules on the transparency of decision-making.
Some of you may have attended the seminar on the Green Paper that took place only yesterday in Brussels.
This event was open to the public and relayed on the website.
Unless a contributor requests anonymity, we are publishing all responses to the Green Paper on the website of DG Trade.
The whole process has been totally transparent.
Finally, on cooperation and dialogue with Parliament: you know that I have constantly appeared before you on all important trade policy matters, and I will continue to do so.
Parliament has a very important role in the TDI reflection process.
Your report will be central to the ongoing review process, and I will study its recommendations very closely.
I thank you for hearing me again today and I look forward to being back here again soon to discuss any and every issue of trade policy, on which I delight in remaining answerable to this House.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Mr Mandelson, trade defence instruments - the name is quite revealing: an instrument for defending ourselves against trade.
To protect ourselves against trade would be both expensive and stupid, however, and there are therefore few economists who make a habit of supporting the use of this instrument.
I myself have on more than one occasion here in Parliament talked, for example, about the way in which consumers are forced to pay astronomically high prices for a limited producer interest.
The fact is, however, that, in the future too, we shall have some form of trade defence instrument.
Until such time as we have common competition legislation right around the world, all countries will probably feel a need to protect themselves against what they perceive as unfair trade.
I therefore believe that we need to design the instrument now so that it is legitimate and viewed as such by everyone - producers, importers, consumers and all the Member States.
We must get away from the predictable conflicts pitting North against South and producers against importers and consumers, as the conflicts in themselves undermine confidence in the instrument and, in the longer term, in EU trade policy.
If we are to have any consensus surrounding these trade defence instruments, we must do more to emulate competition legislation.
Everyone I meet demands, for example, more transparency, more predictability and, above all, less political horse-trading on this issue.
I can understand them, as it is frankly ridiculous that the Member States should only be given a few days in which to assess thousands of pages prior to decisions on anti-dumping duties.
The fact that, in Brussels, we have an army of consultants who run around in pursuit of rumours of Commission proposals concerning new defence measures is ridiculous too, as is the political horse-trading whereby duties on shoes can be exchanged for exemptions from the working time directive - exemptions that, in turn, can be exchanged for duties on Norwegian salmon.
All this shows that a fundamental overhaul is required.
What is more, the world has changed.
As global duties become bound and lower, more of our trading partners use instruments to prevent the import of goods in the traditional way, and, given that Europe is the biggest actor in the world market, we must show leadership.
I should therefore like to conclude by asking you how we are to ensure that this reform does not, in actual fact, continue down the road of seriously becoming one that FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bastiat, for example, would characterise in terms of cutting off our nose to spite our face.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Green Paper as it is clear that our trade defence instruments are in need of reform.
The vast majority of stakeholders are unhappy with the status quo.
As they stand, anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations lack transparency, consistency, objectivity and are over-politicised and inappropriate to the realities of a modern economy adapting to the forces of globalisation.
While it is probably impossible to create a totally objective process, there can and must be improvements to the current investigation procedure in order to depoliticise it and ensure that the interests of all European citizens are best served.
In order to do this, as the Commissioner has indicated, we must redefine and give greater weight to the Community interest.
If the European Union is to become more relevant to people's lives, it must take genuine steps to look after citizens' interests.
This, of course, means the protection of jobs against unfair and anti-competitive behaviour.
However, too often the narrow interests of an outspoken group of producers have won out against the interests of the millions of consumers who stand to gain from the process of globalisation and whose voice has often not been heard.
Moreover, the potential damage to European companies who set up global supply chains in order to remain competitive in a globalised economy must also be given greater consideration when considering the Community interest.
In terms of the process of anti-dumping investigations, there is widespread dissatisfaction across stakeholders with the access they currently enjoy even to non-confidential documents and information.
The use of analogue countries must also be questioned.
I am referring in particular to last year's shoe case where the Brazilian economy was used to make comparisons with China, whereas in reality their two economies are as comparable as their football teams.
I would also be eager for the Commission to investigate the viability of expanding trade defence instruments to deter environmental and social dumping in order to ensure that an unfair advantage is not obtained through the abuse of the environment or through failure to ensure decent labour standards.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that we are debating, the content of which I support, is a strong appeal to the European executive to ensure that, without going back on its commitment to revive multilateral dialogue, to open markets and to lay down rules that encourage development rather than blocking it with non-tariff barriers, the Union does not take unilateral action that penalises us more than we would wish in relation not only to emerging countries but also to the major developed nations, primarily the United States.
Reviving competitiveness and consistency with the Lisbon Strategy, opening markets, protecting consumers, including by introducing obligatory origin marking on imported goods, the success of measures adopted to defend the effectiveness of free competition; these elements are all inextricably linked.
We emphasise that we are opposed to a distorted use of anti-dumping measures and to forms of disguised and non-agreed protectionism presented as fighting unfair competition, of which our global competitors accuse us.
We do ask, however, that reform of anti-dumping rules by the European Union should not act as indirect support for those in the world who have not come out in favour of liberalisation.
At this stage and for a good while yet, I believe, liberalisation and regulation must, more than ever, be strictly linked in the interest of the market itself.
The rules must however be objective, as was the case when drafting those governing competition, which are clearly defined, accessible, effective and easy to apply.
For this reason, we must minimise the element of discretion used in applying defence measures, and small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to actually uphold the rules when prices are subject to abnormal changes.
Commissioner, we hope that the European executive will take account of these considerations, in the knowledge that Europe's real economy needs to feel part of a strong community that encourages and urges it to take up the challenges of an ever more globalised world, yet defends it from those that breach the rules to unjustly pursue their own development at the expense of others.
on behalf of the UEN Group.- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the launch of the debate on the reform of trade policy instruments.
The current system of trade policy instruments, which has remained unchanged for several decades, is no longer effective enough to counteract the negative effects of burgeoning globalisation.
As this is too large a topic to discuss in any great detail here, I would like to draw attention to those issues where reform is needed.
Firstly, anti-dumping tariffs are imposed by the Commission on a product on the basis of proof that its price on the EU market does not exceed the cost of production.
To this end the Commission considers mainly production factors such as wages, cost of materials and energy for example.
The Commission does not, however, establish whether the enterprise bears the cost of social security for its employees, or of environmental protection measures.
It is therefore difficult to establish whether the costs submitted are incomplete, and consequently that the price of a product that does not take account of them has been artificially reduced.
Secondly, it is often the case that the relatively high prices of some products originating in the European Union, and hence their lack of competitiveness on the world market, arise from the very high standards demanded, regarding animal welfare, for instance.
The European Union must require that products from third countries sold on its market also meet these standards.
Thirdly, the European Commission is very cautious in applying so-called protective clauses whose aim is to prevent the European Union market from being suddenly flooded by a particular type of product.
These instruments, however, are much faster and easier to use than anti-dumping tariffs.
Finally, the Commission should also try to shorten to a minimum the period between the start of a particular procedure and the implementation of the relevant protection instrument.
Currently this takes many months, and for anti-dumping tariffs as long as nine months, which exposes European producers to huge losses.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, free trade is no good if it is unfair, and trade defence measures are an attempt to make it fairer.
I think that the Commission places a little too much emphasis on multinational companies, and I am uneasy about redefining the Community interest.
I wish to clarify the fact that, if an EU-based transnational company is involved in social or environmental dumping, either for its own part or through subsidiary companies or subcontractors, it cannot be regarded as a Community interest just because it is EU-registered.
It must be punished for engaging in such practices.
The Green Paper also addresses many interesting issues that we are to debate, for example increased transparency and more influence for small companies and non-governmental organisations.
One important dimension is missing, however: the Green Paper is insufficiently green.
The whole dimension of environmental dumping is absent.
Let me remind you of paragraph 11 of the Muscardini report from October, whereby the European Parliament 'invites the Commission to consider whether it would be appropriate to radically revise the rules on the use of trade defence ... measures under the WTO aegis', and this for the purpose of including non-compliance with global agreements and with conventions on the environment and social issues as forms of dumping or subsidy.
The fact is that countries that have weak environmental legislation or that lack the environmental taxes of their competitors must be seen as subsidising or dumping their production costs; in other words, as engaging in nothing less than traditional dumping.
This will become a growing problem when the global level of ambition increases.
There must, then, be no free zones for environmental destruction that undermines global environmental work.
We must, for example, introduce a Kyoto tariff for countries that do not comply with the Kyoto Agreement.
Other countries must be brought before the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and perhaps we shall win and perhaps we shall lose.
Many believe the WTO to be a powerful organisation, but one thing is certain: the climate cares not one jot for the WTO and, if we do not introduce climate measures into trade policy, will change irrespective of what the WTO thinks.
One final comment: if we are now to have solidarity and we have a one per cent limit, when is Malta to be able to apply these defence measures and when is it to obtain more than one per cent of internal trade?
(HU) Free trade works well if its rules are followed.
But this is not always the case.
Unfair trade practices and dumping are increasingly being used against the EU and its producers.
In several cases of dumping it has been demonstrated that it is the vendors rather than the consumers who profit.
There is no reason for the EU to water down the current trade rules.
It is unacceptable that we should punish those companies that have remained in Europe, that have retained European jobs, and reward those which moved their production offshore.
We need protection against unfair competition.
We should not loosen the rules against unfair trade, but rather enforce them.
This is especially true in the case of countries that are not market economies, where for instance the state is using complex and non-transparent means of giving aid to companies that are producing for export.
Moreover, China is using its increasing trade revenues not to expand democracy, reduce poverty, protect the environment or reduce CO2 emissions, but rather to purchase armaments.
This year, China is increasing its military expenditures by 18%.
According to official statistics, this will reach USD 45 billion.
Moreover, according to some experts on security policy, the true amount they are spending on armaments will be three times this sum.
Commissioner, there is not much point for us to support China's military build-up by cutting European jobs.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and Mr Guardans CambÃ³ for having taken the initiative in putting this oral question to the Commission.
The whole issue of our trade defence instruments is in fact of the utmost importance, not only in that they ensure that European producers are protected effectively against forms of unfair competition, but also when considered within the context of the broader debate on the place of the European Union in a globalised economy and on the rules that it wishes to promote for its governance.
Even though the European Union has always defended the WTO's multilateral system, I think it surprising to say the least that the Commission should launch a public consultation of this kind and be contemplating a potentially major reform of our defence instruments at a time when the WTO negotiations on anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures have not yet been completed and when the results of these will impact upon the way in which these instruments are used.
Let me, then, remind the Commission that it did itself commission a study evaluating the European trade defence instruments, the conclusion of which was that the status quo was both the most reasonable solution and the one best suited to addressing the concerns of all parties.
This study also lends support to the idea that there is, at the present time, no visible and pressing need to review or amend the Community's existing trade defence instruments.
I would like, therefore, to know just what concrete changes the Commission is planning and how this House is going to be involved in every stage of the process, and I call on the Commission to take account of these different factors within the framework of its forthcoming discussions at Council level, as well as taking account of the views of the Members of this House and of the results of the public consultation that it itself initiated for the purpose of drawing up its future proposals.
(PL) The Green Paper and the debate on trade policy instruments are extremely important to our economy and could bring us considerable added value.
European foreign trade policy must respond adequately to any change that takes place in the manufacture and sale of goods on the internal and external markets.
For example, in the framework of agreements, our market can promote the purchase of materials for biofuels, the sale of which has good development prospects, and restrict imports, thus reducing the output of the sugar industry, for instance.
Through our mutual relationships we should help those of our suppliers who could start up production in line with our needs within the scope of promotional or association agreements.
As far as dumping goes, our response is long-winded and indecisive, doing us more harm than good.
For example, in the case of frozen strawberries from China it took several years to put anti-dumping measures in place, by which time numerous farms had folded and gone bankrupt.
An analysis of operational efficiency, and radically shortening existing bureaucratic procedures could lead to clear working regulations and responsibilities which would allow applications to be processed quickly.
Another problem for the European Union is defining the principles of our common trade policy to avoid unfair competition on the external market.
The issues I have mentioned require constant monitoring.
I thank other Members for engaging in the debate on this issue.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU must think carefully about how to better defend its own interests.
The strategy of making early concessions in the hope of later benefits will certainly not work.
Instead, the rules must be observed in the interests of free, fair competition.
Unfair trade practices should not be tolerated, and therefore, without a doubt, effective trade defence instruments form an integral part of the European strategy for competitiveness.
In this sense, I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Glattfelder: the defence instruments must not be further watered down.
As I see it, Commissioner, the timing of the Green Paper is very unfortunate, as the results of the current multilateral negotiations on trade defence instruments should not be forestalled.
There should be no reforms in Europe before the conclusion of these negotiations, whether successful - which I hope - or not.
The second thing I want to say is that the present instruments have fundamentally proved their worth.
If there have to be reforms at all, these should be geared towards improving the existing system.
We need to make a clear distinction - as the Commissioner rightly mentioned - between real dumping on the one hand and pricing in line with competition law on the other.
Anti-dumping measures must not be abused for protectionist purposes.
On the other hand, however, the long-term preservation of European production should not be sacrificed to apparent short-term consumer interests.
From the procedural point of view, it must be ensured that the assessment of cases is as objective as possible, and not influenced by specific national interests in the Council.
It is my firm conviction that, whilst third countries are making intensive use - often abuse - of trade defence instruments against us, we must not relax ours.
All of this is possible under the existing rules if they are just applied correctly, and so I would ask the Commissioner to be very sensitive in this regard, and I would recommend to him the stimulating reading that is my latest draft report on external trade strategy, in which I also discuss the subject of trade defence instruments.
(EL) Mr President, my special thanks to Commissioner Mandelson.
I believe that this evening's debate highlights an internal strategic split in the European Union.
I believe that, as Mr Fjellner said in his speech, on the one hand there is the Europe of major commercial consumer protection networks and, on the other hand, the Europe of productive powers, of the protection of the productive and industrial fabric and of employment and of the defence of the workers.
We must reconcile these two strategic approaches for the good of the European Union.
Of course no one wants to turn the European Union into a protectionist fortress.
On the other hand, however, it would be an illusion to believe that the European Union can remain unarmed in the face of the challenges and the negative consequences of globalisation, that it can remain unarmed in the face of unfair international trading practices, in the face of social and environmental dumping by certain emergent economies in the developing world.
I believe that the Green Paper presented by Mr Mandelson can form a good basis for further discussion.
We need trade defence measures on the basic precondition that they will be effective, that they will help to defend the commercial interests of the European Union, that they will help to defend the principle of transparency and faster decision-making.
Provided, Mr Mandelson, that your proposal moves in the direction of improving the trade defence mechanisms of the European Union, we really can hold a debate and make a positive contribution to that debate.
(LT) Today for discussion we have the Commission's Green Paper, which focuses on Europe's trade defence instruments in a changing world economy.
In the communiquÃ©, concerns have been expressed about trade defence instruments which would not affect high productivity.
Also mentioned is the issue of coordinating the Community's interests and those of high productivity, importers, consumers and even the interests of developing countries.
The figures provided show that the USA and India, in protecting their markets, have initiated more studies on how to apply defence instruments than has the EU.
The EU is having difficulty implementing the Lisbon Strategy and creating new jobs, and there is a catastrophic lack of qualified workers in the engineering profession, and of scientists who could create new competitive technologies.
In the current situation, by no means should defence instruments be relaxed, as that would stifle current EU productivity, especially small and medium-size businesses, particularly in new Member States.
Furthermore, I would urge the Commission to quickly carry out anti-dumping studies, as delay on this has already bankrupted the Lithuanian telescope manufacturer 'Ekranas'.
(PT) Mr Mandelson, this Commission initiative straight away has the merit of promoting debate on a issue to which there are no simple answers.
There are sectors in Europe that lean more towards the demagogic and populist responses of those who feel they have simple answers to this question.
They may be simple answers, but they are wrong.
The key issue is how the EU should use the trade defence instruments at its disposal to guarantee compliance with the rules of fair trade and to take an active role in the process of regulating international trade.
The European economic and social model must be defended, but it must never overstep the boundary into protectionism.
This is currently the most important issue facing the EU.
We have already seen that there are natural differences of opinion and opposing interests within the EU itself.
The interests of the manufacturers do not necessarily coincide with those of the major importers, and the immediate interests of consumers do not necessarily coincide with each other.
What is needed is a guideline that always emphasises a key principle - that of how the EU will participate actively, seriously and intelligently in the process of regulating international trade.
In this context, it must seek to project onto an international scale, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, some of the basic values that identify it, namely a competitive economy and, at the same time, a society that shows greater solidarity and more cohesion and that is very alert to the preservation of certain key environmental values.
This is the challenge now facing the EU, and I therefore feel that the Commission has done the right thing in promoting this debate.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank the Commission for having opened this debate on the EU's trade defence instruments, and I should also like to congratulate Mr Guardans CambÃ³ on having offered us the opportunity to debate the subject today.
What I find striking about the Commission's questionnaire, or, more broadly speaking, about all its thinking about trade policy, is the lack of any reference whatsoever to the issue of the euro exchange rate against the currencies of our main trading partners.
I want to know from Commissioner Mandelson just how he thinks the European Union's trading interests can be effectively defended when the euro stands as it does against the dollar, the yuan and the yen?
If, then, I may take the example of the aerospace industry, which, with its plans for redundancies and cutbacks and its threats of farming work out and of moving it to other sites, holds the centre of the stage today, a ten-cent change in the euro/dollar exchange rate amounts to the loss or gain of a billion euros in Airbus' year-end figures.
Is it not the case that competitive currency devaluations on the part of our competitors are the most flagrant examples of dumping, the consequence of these being that Airbus, the flagship of European industry, now finds it does better to produce some of its aircraft outside the euro zone if it wants to be able to compete with Boeing?
Just what we always wanted!
I would encourage Commissioner Mandelson to look to the European Central Bank and do something, today, about making it responsible not only when the euro's value goes down but also when it goes up, for has the time not come for the Council and the Commission, by virtue of the powers accorded them by Article 111 of the Treaty, to at last discharge their responsibilities and enable us to equip ourselves with something we cannot do without - the general outlines of an exchange rate policy?
Member of the Commission. Mr President, by my reckoning 85% of those who have spoken have welcomed this review and therefore I feel gratified in having taken the initiative in proposing it to the Commission.
I hope that this fact and the very intelligent and, in the main, very balanced contributions that have been made to this debate will be registered in the Council and by the Presidency.
I do not know whether they are represented tonight.
It appears not.
But, nonetheless, I am sure that this fact will communicate itself.
Now, having welcomed the review, people do differ as to whether they want to use it to water down the existing TDI or not.
I am going to disappoint both those categories, both the water-downers and the anti-water-downers, by saying that the aim of the review is neither to strengthen nor to weaken our existing trade defence instruments.
Instead, the purpose is to make sure that we have rules that are clear, consistent and capable of commanding consensus across the Union.
I am not fully satisfied that we are striking the right balance at the moment.
Hence the controversy, hence the breakdown in consensus, hence the breakdown in solidarity amongst and between Member States that we have observed in recent cases.
It is my responsibility to do what is necessary, if anything can be done, to repair that solidarity and make sure that we have consensus rebuilt.
Of course, we are faced with constant dilemmas in exercising and applying these rules.
One person's legitimate protection is another person's protectionism and that is where judgement needs to be applied on the basis of the objective analysis undertaken by the Commission.
But I have heard the call of many in this House to ensure that our anti-dumping system is clear, transparent and objective.
I have heard the concerns expressed about the length and lack of efficiency of the process and I have heard those who have said that they want environmental concerns better reflected.
I am not sure whether I will ever be able to fashion a set of instruments that will enable us to use trade defence to tackle global warming or bring climate security to the world.
Of course, if this is a challenge that Members of this Parliament want to set us, then we will rise to it, but I am not sure that we will be successful, just as I am not entirely sure that we will be able to use trade defence instruments to address exchange rate policy either.
I am very grateful to those who have spoken and raised very important points.
My own view, just to go back to the opening speaker in this debate, is that if you want to make and sustain the case for economic openness in Europe, which I do, then the people of Europe have to feel confident that, when they are unfairly threatened or harmed by the anti-competitive behaviour of others, that they have someone on their side: that someone is us.
It is the essential and growing role of the European Union and of the European Commission in this global age.
It does not make our task easier, but it makes it all the more necessary and important and it is a responsibility that, for my own part, I intend to see discharged in a fair, objective and dispassionate way.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) The Commission has adopted a Green Paper and launched a public consultation on the use of the EU's trade defence instruments (TDIs) in a changing global economy.
This public consultation should prepare the way for proposals by the Commission aimed at reforming its trade defence instruments (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard clauses).
This reform project needs, however, to be considered with prudence.
The European Union must not act unilaterally or precipitately, for any revision of its instruments must be carried out within the legal framework of the ongoing negotiations on the multilateral disciplines applicable to TDIs, forming part of the Doha round.
Quite apart from the need to be in line with the WTO calendar, it is also imperative that the Commission should take into account the fact that the liberalisation of trade makes TDIs indispensable.
TDIs are typically used in moderation and are in no way the straitjackets for which free-traders take them, or the weaponry of protectionists.
As regulators, they are in fact effective as means of restoring the conditions of fair competition to international trading markets and of limiting illegal practices' adverse effects on industry, growth and employment in the European Community.
Compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Commission's legislative proposals: methodology for systematic and rigorous monitoring.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at prime media time this morning, in the course of the debate on the Berlin Declaration, we celebrated the Union as a common system of law, and we all agreed that what holds this system together at heart is human dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms.
At a late hour this evening we are now discussing the everyday business of this common system of law: the enforcement - an arduous task - and protection of these fundamental rights and freedoms.
Those who have long been working on the everyday business of fundamental rights in Europe will be aware of three irritations.
Firstly, for the achievement of its economic and monetary-policy objectives, the Union has hard law, specific objectives, penalties if need be, large amounts of money and tough action; whereas fundamental rights and freedoms at European level have only soft law.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is still not binding.
Some Member States are even calling for its removal from the Constitution.
The EU is not a member of the European Commission of Human Rights.
Organisations such as Europol, Eurojust and Frontex do not fall under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Police cooperation is still not Community law, and it evades scrutiny by national parliaments and the European Parliament.
A grey area of fundamental rights is emerging in Europe.
The second irritation - which I am seeing more and more in my debates on the Constitution - is that cracks have emerged in the original confidence of the European public in the will and ability of this Union to enforce fundamental rights and freedoms uncompromisingly.
The CIA affair, the illegal kidnappings, the illegal overflights and the lack of cooperation by governments have been contributory factors, as have the negative judgments of the European Court of Justice on the transfer of passenger data and SWIFT bank data and the lack of legal bases for Union action.
All of this has dented the original confidence of the public in the will and ability of the Union to protect these fundamental rights uncompromisingly.
The third irritation concerns the Commission's monitoring.
Commissioner, I do not know how often this House is supposed to carry on demanding that the Commission's work and proposals on the protection of fundamental rights be more systematic, less restrictive, more public; or that the Commission increase the involvement of civil society and of independent experts and organisations.
We did so in the report on Article 7; we did so in the reports on the Human Rights Agency; we did so with regard to the accession treaties.
Yet the Commission gives the impression of being unsure, indecisive, in this field.
Its choices are often incomprehensible, and its pressure on the Council and the Member States is often insufficient.
We welcome the procedure for enforcing the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Commission's legislative proposals: it represents progress.
Nevertheless, it is insufficient, and it suffers from all the things this House has pointed out so many times already.
Checking against the Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be smuggled in via social, environmental and economic criteria, but must be a criterion in itself.
Every one of the Commission's legislative initiatives must be checked against the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this checking must be substantiated and documented in all cases.
How often have we demanded - as we are doing again - that the Commission show greater respect for the particular responsibility of Parliament as advocate of the European public for the protection of fundamental rights?
We did this when we dealt with Article 7, the Agency and the accession negotiations.
We called for increased involvement of NGOs, international organisations and the Human Rights Agency.
How much longer do we need to go on doing this?
How much longer do we need to go on demanding continuous dialogue between the institutions?
The outstanding part of the Commission's proposal is its talk of the development of a fundamental-rights culture.
We share this ambition and support it.
Yet this development requires a systematic, continuous, open dialogue between the institutions; it requires reports; it requires that the institutions be given the right to point out abuses and wrong turns in the Member States.
It is also essential that the Commission's monitoring system be extended to the field of intergovernmental cooperation and to the comitology system.
Commissioner, we are repeating our demands.
We are doing so at a late hour, without public exposure, without anything.
I do think, however, that it is time the Commission responded to Parliament's wishes and demands in this field.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I warmly welcome this report and wish to thank Parliament for its positive reception of the Commission's communication of 27 April 2005 on a methodology to check fundamental rights compliance in the Commission's own legislative proposals.
Let me briefly recall why the Commission adopted this communication on a methodology for compliance with fundamental rights, the first product of the Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights, Anti-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities.
We, the Union's institutions, must at all times show that we cherish fundamental rights, not only in words but in actions and above all in our own legislative action.
This is crucial for the Union to be credible and legitimate in the eyes of its citizens.
The Charter, which the institutions subscribed to in 2000, must encourage us to enhance respect for individual freedom in all its facets.
This includes classic civil liberties to be upheld, precisely in our current efforts to combat terrorism.
It also includes economic and social rights and, last but not least, the new generation rights such as data protection, good administration and bio-ethical guarantees.
But, briefly, it must become clear to our citizens that the European Union locks a true fundamental rights culture into its own policy-making.
It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction and encouragement for the Commission to see that our communication of 2005 has found such a prominent echo in your resolution of today and that this Parliament makes the same commitment on its part to include internal rules for monitoring fundamental rights.
Taking rights seriously must be a common leitmotif for all institutions throughout the EU's legislative process.
I also wish to thank Parliament for some constructive practical suggestions which the Voggenhuber report offers to the Commission in order to develop further our human rights compliance methodology.
As you know, we have scheduled a review of our methodology to be launched later this year, and the Commission will present Parliament with the results of this review.
The Commission is very keen to share its experience with Parliament in that respect.
In the context of this review, the Commission will of course pay utmost attention to your suggestions.
For instance, we have noted that we should refer not only to the Charter as a point of reference, but also to European and international human rights conventions, and that Parliament emphasises the Commission's right to withdraw its proposal where changes are made in the legislative process which would violate a fundamental right.
We are also open to giving even greater visibility to fundamental rights in our impact assessments.
Finally, a major theme of the planned review will be how to involve the newly-established Fundamental Rights Agency when preparing new policy initiatives which are sensitive to fundamental rights.
As regards the call for a new annual report from the Commission on fundamental rights in the EU, we think that it could be useful to have a yearly general discussion on this issue.
This could take place in the context of our annual discussion relating to progress in the area of freedom, security and justice.
We are less convinced on having a new formal, specific annual report, in particular since the recently established Fundamental Rights Agency will, as perhaps its most important task, adopt such an annual report on fundamental rights issues within the EU.
That report, and thus our new Fundamental Rights Agency, should receive all the public attention it deserves.
That report should therefore be at the centre of discussions on fundamental rights issues in all three institutions and we should avoid any duplication of it.
But, with that caveat, I would like to say how much we commend this report on its content and how seriously we take it.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the Commission on this new approach to the protection of fundamental rights.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for having informed us this evening that a substantial part of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs' idea will be transposed by the Commission into the amended text.
We hope that the European Parliament will become ever more involved in protecting these rights and, above all, we are pleased to support the idea of continuous monitoring of all the legislative activities that will lead to such protection, which, as the Commissioner was saying, could culminate in a final report.
However, this becomes scarcely important if the monitoring is incisive, constant and continuous.
Secondly, as regards the involvement of the newly established Fundamental Rights Agency, I believe - as has already been said in committee - that its activities also need to be diversified, in order to prevent any pointless overlapping or duplication of effort.
I therefore believe that the full involvement of the agency, and of non-governmental organisations and associations, as the rapporteur was saying, should become ever more meaningful and significant, given that there are some very important associations that concern themselves with the protection of human rights.
Finally, in our opinion, systematic internal checks should be implemented at all levels during the stage of drafting legislation.
I therefore hope that these suggestions contained within the rapporteur's clear, lucid report - qualities that he has illustrated this evening - become part of the activities of the Commission itself.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Respect for our fundamental rights and for all human rights, and their implementation, is under all circumstances the cornerstone of every European democratic state, governed by the rule of law.
They cannot be circumvented or overriden.
It is when problematic, conflictual situations arise that it becomes especially clear that we need always to confirm anew these now seemingly self-evident rights, and that their observance is not automatic, and we need to struggle time and again for our fundamental rights to be respected.
The respect for and defence of our fundamental human rights was the starting point and the achievement of the European Union, but till now the declaration has been accompanied by few concrete legal and practical measures.
One of the concrete achievements is the birth of the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself, and although the Charter is far from complete, nevertheless adding legal force to it - let us say by subscribing to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights - would represent a much-needed step forward in the Community's defence of fundamental rights.
The problems involving human rights that appear daily, and the complexity of these issues, demonstrate that there is much to be done in this area.
For this reason, I can only welcome Mr Voggenhuber's report, that is, the initiative of the Commission, since it draws the attention of all of us to the key question that the effective respect of fundamental rights begins when respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights features among the Commission's legislative proposals, when regular and strict controls of human rights compliance have been developed, and when the Fundamental Rights Agency is able to work effectively.
And although there are a few paragraphs which are subject to legal debate, as shadow rapporteur I support the report, as will the People's Party at tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I confess, in a minute and a half, that, every time this House is asked to debate human rights, one has the worrying feeling that the debate will end up being nothing more than a rhetorical exercise.
I say this while also having in mind the fact that, although one month ago this House debated the outcome of a year's work by the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, this month neither the Commission nor the Council have in any way acknowledged the work done by the European Parliament and submitted for their opinion.
We do want to see the same thing happen with the precious communication before us which, as Mr Voggenhuber points out, is intended to clarify and enhance what has been standard practice in this House since 2001, namely guaranteeing the compatibility of all the legislative processes developed by the institutions with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Recognition for this practice was a long time coming, and we hope that its implementation will not be shelved.
One point must be made clear: we are asking the Commission for an annual report, to be submitted to Parliament, which summarises the implementation of fundamental rights in European policies.
It seems rather strange to us that annual reports on the application of Community law and on competition policy should be planned, but not a report on fundamental rights for the Commission to submit to the European Parliament.
We also take this view because of the impact that such policies have on 500 million European citizens and because we believe that this is a sensitive issue for which the European institutions must take responsibility if they are to restore dignity and substance to the human rights on which we are often asked to focus.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all, I will not dwell on Mr Voggenhuber's excellent report except to say that my group will support it wholeheartedly.
In principle, we very much welcome the Commission's proposals, but my problem is that they risk becoming the emperor's clothes.
They are full of good intentions but there is a big risk that they will be passive, bureaucratic exercises, because there is such a gap between reality and the proposals in your paper, Commissioner.
I have a problem, Mr Mandelson.
How do I explain your wonderful proposals to my voters, when the Commission does not speak out when a minister for education in an EU Member State is on a crusade against homosexuals?
Why does the Commission not speak out in the case of the CIA flights, as Mr Fava just reminded us?
Why does the Commission not speak out in the case of the flagrant discrimination and abominable treatment of Roma people?
There are so many cases where the Commission is passive and even in some cases hiding behind the rules.
Lately, every time we ask about these cases we are told: 'just wait and see when the agency for fundamental rights is set up'.
Commissioner, why does the Commission, the champion of fundamental rights, as Mr Barroso promised us in October 2004, not seek the limits of its powers?
Why do you hide behind the rules?
People expect you to protect and promote their fundamental rights.
I, too, would like the annual report, but frankly I consider it much more important that you should act and speak out.
That is political leadership.
One of President Barroso's favourite phrases is 'the Europe of results' and I very much like that phrase.
But why is it restricted to the economic area?
Why is it not applied to the area of fundamental rights?
Soon we will be celebrating 50 years of European integration.
After the Second World War the idea was that people would never have to fear for their lives again, that everybody would be free, safe, equal and live in a democracy.
So fundamental rights should be the first priority of the Commission and that should be the meaning of the 'Europe of results'.
I hope that this Commission in the next two years will create that Europe of results and of fundamental rights.
I see this proposal only as a basis for that, but I expect action now.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been around for over six years now and is vital as regards respect for citizens' rights, yet it is still not legally binding.
We can only hope, therefore, that the Council Presidency succeeds in giving the constitutional process new momentum, as there is no doubt that the individual rights of EU citizens belong to the substance of the Constitution; the Charter is its core substance.

In the light of this, in particular, we cannot but support the Commission's initiative.
We are talking here about the development of a genuine fundamental-rights culture.
I should like to declare my express support for this approach and highlight two issues in this connection.
Firstly, systematic monitoring of fundamental rights must at all events mean focusing on the specific fundamental rights concerned in each case, and also evidencing this checking in detail in every legislative proposal.
Secondly, scrutiny to identify any legal errors in weighing up the respective importance of the freedom of the individual and the requirements of the public interest is insufficient on its own.
What we need is an optimisation in terms of fundamental rights, which means a political analysis to ascertain which of the various solutions that weigh up these interests correctly produces the best balance between determination of the objective and restriction of fundamental rights.
Such an approach could characterise the fundamental-rights culture of which the Commission speaks, and this way strengthen the identity of the European Union as a union of citizens.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, in principle, guaranteeing the fundamental rights of all citizens is of major importance, although we have different opinions on how this should be done.
It is striking that the European Union is once again seeking to create a distinct profile for itself by means of fundamental rights.
Meanwhile, the Union now has a Charter and a Bureau for fundamental rights, neither of which have been established unanimously.
A reasonable minority, not least in this Parliament, have major objections to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the way in which it is being shaped further.
Could I draw your attention to the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an unnecessary duplication of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms?
The same, in fact, applies to the Fundamental Rights Agency.
Both duplications are avoidable, and citizens' rights would not thereby be affected.
This is something the European Court for Human Rights here in Strasbourg can guarantee, provided it can count on the necessary workforce and financial resources.
Moreover, it respects the individuality of the national legal system.
This strikes me as a sufficient guarantee for our freedoms and fundamental rights.
I would therefore argue in favour of the Union's functions in the area of fundamental rights being limited.
We should allow the Union to join the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; this will no doubt be followed up by a debate on compliance with, and monitoring of, the fundamental rights in respect of the Commission's legislative function.
Mr President, colleagues: you lost.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights would have been given legal force by the European constitution but that constitution, it seems necessary periodically to remind this House, was rejected.
55% of French voters and 62% of Dutch voters said 'no'.
Simply to disregard those results and carry on as if the Charter were in force would be outrageous, yet that is precisely what you propose to do.
Indeed, it is precisely what you are doing.
As the Voggenhuber report cheerfully admits, the various institutions of the EU are proceeding as if the Charter were already justiceable.
Indeed, this report may be summarised as an attempt to regularise an illegal and undemocratic extension of EU jurisdiction.
I hope we can take it as read that every one of us here believes in basic civil liberties.
We all support freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly and so on.
But some of us object to the way in which these vital matters are being lifted out of the hands of our accountable national governments and subjected to the whims of European judges.
The EU is wanting, not in its respect for basic human rights, but in its respect for democracy.
Paper entitlements, unaccompanied by democratic accountability, are meaningless.
The principles adumbrated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights could equally be found in, say, the constitution of East Germany or that of the Soviet Union, but as the peoples of those unhappy states knew, written charters are worthless if you cannot hold your rulers to account.
Do we really need to learn that lesson again in the EU?
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Voggenhuber on his report.
Saint Teresa used to say that the devil is the detail.
It is obvious that the European Commission is not one day going to approve a piece of legislation that blatantly violates fundamental rights: nobody expects that.
But, for example, we have situations, as in the case of restrictions on liquids in aeroplanes, where comitology has been used in a shameful way to impose, through a secret piece of regulation - and I emphasise, a secret piece of regulation - duties on citizens which cannot be reviewed by any court in Europe, national or European.
This is a case of the European Commission not being a witness to a violation of fundamental rights but itself legislating in a way that goes against respect for fundamental rights and the most basic rules on transparency.
These things happen, so let us stop the rhetoric and begin applying to ourselves what we pretend to apply to everybody else, to our neighbours and to our partners throughout the world.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for legislative proposals always to be compatible with fundamental rights may be a good route to a serious resumption of the debate on the real European constitutional process, with no clumsy attempts to revive a treaty that died on impact with the public.
I believe that, on the eve of the imminent and still mysterious Berlin Declaration, this may be a serious way of re-opening the debate and of making Europe stand for something once again, and for this I am grateful to Mr Voggenhuber.
In recent years, we have witnessed CIA flights and abductions by the CIA on European territory, the systematic monitoring of Europeans and the violation of their privacy, and the detainment of migrants in inhuman and degrading places.
All of this serves as the clearest example of the difficulty faced by the European Union when it comes to protecting fundamental rights.
We believe that the EU's legislative proposals should always be fully compatible not only with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also with the other European and international instruments in the field of fundamental rights: I am thinking of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and of the European Social Charter.
We feel that this is a good way to start a thorough debate aimed at the revival of Europe.
(PT) Mr President, fundamental rights are the very backbone of all of the EU's political action.
Since the Treaty of Rome, democracy has been a condition of this union of nations and the basis of consensus.
Democracy undeniably implies that all institutions must adhere to an ethic of rights; indeed, it is an ethic of rights that gave birth to democracy.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, formalised in the Treaty of Nice, is simply the clear expression of this genetic matrix of the EU, thus dispelling any possible doubt or ambiguity.
The EU has always had an intrinsic connection to fundamental rights, and it is only through this connection that the Union has been able to true to itself.
The methodology of self-monitoring that the Commission has brought before us - featuring respect for fundamental rights as an integral part of monitoring the legality of legislative proposals and a completely new assessment of the impact of this legislation on fundamental rights - is therefore welcome.
This will blow fresh air and bring transparency into the offices of the Commission.
This is a more structural and more positive solution than the new fundamental rights agency, because this method proposed by the Commission presupposes that human rights cut across the Union's policies, all the Union's policies.
This is its strength.
In a democratic society, the monitoring of rights begins with the institutions monitoring their own political practice.
Nevertheless, the virtues of this methodology are limited, as it does not encompass the Council of the EU or decisions on intergovernmental cooperation, in relation to which the Commission does not take initiatives.
If one were to name issues that nowadays lack specific attention from the point of view of a culture of rights, it would be issues under the third pillar - that of criminal law and criminal procedure.
Terrorist threats and public concern give rise to the temptation in the Member States to drift towards a disproportionate preoccupation with security, which sometimes oversteps the boundaries of freedom and justice.
The Commission's method has opened the door, but the window must also be open.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Voggenhuber on his report and also declaring my support for him in his fight for more rights for our citizens.
As a representative of the business community, I have to say that it is true that the rights of the European Parliament and the other European institutions have been fully enforced in the field of the internal market.
In that field, we have been able to implement a rationalisation process for our 27 Member States and 500 million citizens and ensure that, rather than 27 different regulations, a single one applies, which was adopted through constructive cooperation.
I should also like to emphasise, however, that the establishment of an equally solid basis in the field of fundamental rights is a genuine concern of mine.
When Mr Hannan says that France and the Netherlands voted against the Constitution, I can only counter this by saying that a direct consultative referendum in Spain produced a clear majority in favour of this project.
In addition, if we add up the population groups of the three countries, this makes a clear majority.
We have the support of most Europeans.
The vast majority in this House have pronounced their support for it, and Europe's governments have unanimously declared themselves in favour.
How many more votes do we need before we achieve democracy in Europe, rather than stopping at geographical boundaries and measuring democracy in kilometres when we should be judging it by its principles?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Negotiation of an EU-Central America Association Agreement - Negotiation of an EU-Andean Community Association Agreement (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Willy Meyer Pleite, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the negotiating mandate for an association agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the countries of Central America, of the other part, and
the report by Luis YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European Parliament's recommendation to the Council on the negotiating mandate for an association agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Andean Community and its member countries, of the other part.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the Fourth European Union-Latin America and Caribbean Summit, last spring in Vienna, gave the green light to the start of negotiations of a strategic association agreement between Europe and the Andean Community.
In this report I propose some thirty recommendations for the Council and the Commission to take into account when drawing up the negotiation guidelines.
We want this association to be ambitious, broad and wide-ranging, in line with the association with the twins, Mercosur and Central America, because we believe it to be a strategic requirement for both regions.
In view of their history, language, culture, beliefs and values, as well as their common view of the world and their support for multilateralism and the United Nations system, Latin America and Europe are destined to become strategic allies in a globalised world.
This is the case for the Andean countries in particular, where there are certain pockets of extreme poverty and the continent's greatest inequalities.
The agreement must have three pillars.
A political-institutional pillar, a cooperation pillar and a trade pillar.
In the political and security field, we should create a Euro-Andean Peace and Security Charter, implement a permanent political dialogue, promote the quality of democracy, social cohesion, support for governability, poverty reduction, human exchanges, combating terrorism, conflict prevention and coordination in terms of the reform of the United Nations, as well as civilian and military crisis management operations.
The second pillar is the promotion of sustainable human development and gradual access for Andean products to European markets, under competitive conditions, taking account of the immense economic imbalances and the degree of integration between Europeans and Andeans, which will require a review of the CAP and subsidies from the Union.
The third pillar is trade itself, but unlike other models with third countries, such as the Andean countries' agreements with the United States, they must not be free trade agreements in the strict sense, or free trade agreements pure and simple, but rather they must take account of the huge gulf separating the two regions.
Without economic measures to provide support, cooperation and funding, purely commercial policies would not be able to play their role of contributing to development.
The inclusion of labour rights, particularly for indigenous and tribal peoples, the protection of decent working conditions, non-discrimination and equality between men and women in the workplace and the eradication of child labour must be included in the agreement.
We must also stress in particular the importance of European investment as an essential factor in the development of those countries, as well as the need for European companies to apply the same standards with regard to working conditions as they do in European countries.
Immigration, as a phenomenon and as a source of opportunities, must be included in the agreement, with protection for the rights of immigrants, and transfers of money must be made easier, cheaper, more transparent and more secure.
The environmental chapter, which must have a prominent place in the agreement, must include the establishment of common policies aimed at energy saving, diversification, the promotion of alternative and renewable energy sources and the reduction of polluting emissions, in line with the approach taken by the last European Council.
In summary, Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the objective must be for us to be in a position to conclude this ambitious strategic association agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Andean Community and its Member States at the Fifth European Union-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Lima in 2008.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, it is clear to everybody that this debate that is going to take place in Parliament comes at a significant time for Latin America in general.
It comes at a time when its people seem to be forcefully questioning the policy that has impoverished them.
They are currently questioning the policy of neo-liberal formulae.
President Bush's visit to Latin America is ample evidence of this.
Specifically, with regard to the Association Agreement with Central America, the European Union owes an historical debt to that region.
We played a very significant role during the 1980s in Central America's process of pacification and democratisation - the San JosÃ© agreements, the Esquipulas agreement - in which the European Union detached itself from the United States, adopting an autonomous position, and played a crucial role.
Central America's current situation is abundantly clear: there is very weak economic growth - currently 0.6% - rates of poverty that remain similar to those of the 1990s, and increasing inequalities.
Peace agreements have yet to be verified.
The same is true in the fields of human rights, impunity and corruption, and regional integration is still very weak.
Within this context, this humble rapporteur opted for a certain kind of report with a view to determining what type of association we wanted.
I based it on three fundamental pillars: political dialogue with a view to good governance, development cooperation to contribute to eliminating the structural causes of poverty and inequality, and trade under conditions of fairness and mutual benefit based on complementarity and solidarity.
An agreement that seeks regional integration in order to contribute to the balanced and fair redistribution of Central America's income and wealth.
That was the context.
We wanted an agreement that did not turn into an agreement on a free trade area and on privatisation of public services.
In short, we did not want political dialogue and cooperation to be overrun by free trade formulae.
I am convinced that a trade agreement of a pronounced neo-liberal nature between unequal regions - unequal in all senses of the word - would simply increase that inequality and promote exploitation by a business elite, leading to an even greater cycle of dependency, exclusion, poverty and extremely high social and environmental costs.
I believe that trade and cooperation must be geared towards sustainable development at regional level, benefiting the people, rather than a series of projects benefiting transnational capital, such as the Puebla-Panama Plan or the European Investment Bank.
It was with that intention that I drew up my humble report, with the cooperation of many civil society organisations from Europe and Central America.
Parliament's Committee on Development and Committee on International Trade then naturally issued their opinions on the report.
I would of course like to thank you for all of the contributions that improved the text from the point of view of the approach I wished to maintain throughout this process.
I would like in particular to thank Miguel Ãngel MartÃ­nez for his always fair and cooperative contributions, in this case from the Committee on Development.
In the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Susta presented some very significant amendments to the text which truly distort the report that I intended to present to the House.
The true intention was to produce a balanced report, based on those three pillars that I mentioned before, but, in practice, the amendments as a whole created a document that essentially sought the establishment of a free trade area.
On that point, my intention was to try to tone down that approach as far as possible.
I am talking about the approach of trying to give Central America the impression that what we Europeans are seeking is essentially a free trade area.
We agreed on seven compromise amendments with Mr Salafranca, of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Obiols, of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and Mr Susta, of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I would like to thank them once again most warmly for their efforts to agree on a way to tone down the report and not to spoil it.
I would of course, however, like to thank Mr Obiols and Mrs De Kayser, of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and Mr Romeva, of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, for their amendments, because they improve and provide more detail on this desire to turn the mandate into a clear mandate for an association agreement of that kind, one that does not include a free trade area.
This has been a good thing to a certain extent because, as I have said, we have managed to tone down such significant points as letter v), which explicitly recommends that the free trade area should be a priority strategic objective, and makes references to the CAFTA Plan, and we have naturally managed to tone it down, but not sufficiently so.
I do not know whether this has happened before, but I am going to recommend to my group that it abstain from the vote on this report, because I do not believe that it has achieved my intended objective, which was to produce a balanced report.
In any event, I am very interested to hear the opinion of Parlacen, the Central American Parliament, and of Central America's political organisations, and my hope is that, when the negotiation begins, the European Commission will bear in mind that what Central America is asking for is not a carbon copy of the United States' position, but an equidistant, different and autonomous position.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, let me first welcome, also on behalf of my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the remarkable work of the two rapporteurs as well the constructive analysis and comments made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade concerning the different aspects and perspectives for future agreements with these regions.
The conclusion of association agreements with Central America and the Andean Community is a long-standing strategic objective for both regions, confirmed repeatedly by the Heads of State and Government at the summits in Guadalajara and Vienna.
With the negotiation of these agreements, the EU shows its commitment to the region and its determination to reinforce its relations with all Latin American countries.
Europe and Latin America are natural partners, and closer ties with Central America and the Andean Community will contribute to a stronger partnership, both politically and economically.
The agreements will be negotiated on a region-to-region basis in order to provide further impetus to the regional integration processes both in Central America and in the Andean Community.
As repeatedly emphasised, also by the European Parliament, regional integration is key to political and social stability.
It will also help to insert these regions more successfully into the world economy by developing larger and more stable economies able to attract investment.
Nevertheless, it is worth dispelling the idea that the EU tries to 'impose' its own model: regional integration should be developed by each region on the basis of its own ambitions and agenda.
The association agreements are envisaged as comprehensive agreements, embracing the whole array of the multifaceted relations of the EU with both regions: political dialogue, cooperation and trade.
The respect and promotion of democratic principles, fundamental human rights, the rule of law and good governance will remain at the core of our relations with Central America and the Andean Community.
In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that the association agreements should pay particular attention to the effective implementation of internationally-agreed standards in the human rights, social, core labour and environmental fields in order to enhance sustainable development.
Concerning political dialogue, these agreements will aim to tackle a wide range of matters, such as climate change, energy, migration and the fight against drugs.
These are vital not only for both our regions but also for the entire planet.
An enhanced dialogue with Central America and the Andean Community aims to seek constructive engagement towards effective multilateralism and international governance that may respond to the world challenges of the 21st century.
The political chapter of the association agreements will be accompanied by measures aiming to enhance bi-regional trade and investment in a balanced and fair way.
This should be pursued not only through the progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, but also by establishing a fair and transparent regulatory framework.
Asymmetries between our regions should also be taken into account.
The trade part of the agreement will be fully consistent with WTO rules and obligations, while going beyond its basic rules, so as to maximise the mutual and long-term benefits of bi-regional trade liberalisation.
Cooperation between the two sides is to be deeply rooted in the global objectives and principles established by our development policy, such as the European Consensus on Development, as well as by the international agreements to which we are party, including the Millennium Development Goals, and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
Social cohesion will be a priority.
The cooperation chapter should reflect the willingness to work jointly and to exchange experiences. It should also reflect solidarity towards the poorest and most excluded people.
Let me conclude with an overview on the preparation of these negotiations: the draft negotiating directives were adopted by the Commission on 6 December 2006 and are currently under discussion with Member States.
The Commission hopes to have the negotiating directives adopted and, if conditions allow, actually to start negotiating with these two Latin American sub-regions within the first half of this year.
If we manage to stick to this ambitious timetable, it will be largely thanks to your support and determination to enhance relations between the EU and Latin America, in particular with these two regions.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (ES) Mr President, the initial report presented to us by Mr Meyer on the Association Agreement between the European Union and the countries of Central America provided the basis of the opinion that we drew up in the Committee on Development.
We agreed in very general terms with his proposals and we also agreed on a series of recommendations from our Committee on Development with regard to them.
Mr Meyer proved to be very receptive and we jointly signed seven amendments introducing the specific concerns of the Committee on Development.
I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that I find the text being presented to the House to be very anaemic compared to the initial proposals.
They have been reworked in a largely neo-liberal vein, perhaps reflecting the thinking of the majority of Parliament.
The truth is that we can live with these texts thanks to the compromises.
We will vote for them, but we will not be voting with any enthusiasm, since they do not square with the needs of Central America or with the aspirations of its people and also because this text will not increase the European Union's standing within those societies.
Of the seven amendments proposed by the Committee on Development, three have been accepted.
They stress that the Association Agreement between the European Union and Central America must include the development cooperation dimension and therefore take up the priorities defined in the European cooperation consensus, as the Commissioner has said: the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Goals.
As a result of those acknowledgements and the importance we attach to producing this agreement, the text that we will vote on contains just the minimum required for us to support it.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive and balanced report, which is exceptionally significant in today's world.
It is a vital signpost and an aid to negotiating the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Andean Community at a crucial moment of political and economic change in the region.
The Andean Community is a productive and cohesive system integrating individual Latin American countries.
Both parties - the European Union and the Andean Community - will benefit from a deepening of mutual political and economic relations.
The guidelines drawn up for the Council are a cohesive and comprehensive document containing all the necessary elements for satisfactory cooperation.
The rapporteur highlights the key role of political dialogue, the promotion of sustainable development, education and human rights.
He also emphasises the importance of the fight against drugs, arms trafficking and organised crime, and stresses that this cooperation must be based on free trade.
The Association Agreement must gradually liberalise trade and develop political relations, whilst simultaneously promoting democracy and the social and cultural rights characteristic of the region.
I am pleased that the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the association process has been included in the negotiation guidelines, something which I stressed in my opinion for the Committee on International Trade.
As we are all well aware, the SME sector is one of the main sources of economic growth, and has a key impact on living standards and poverty reduction.
For that reason, I think we have to lay particular emphasis on promoting this sector by making access to loans easier for SMEs, eliminating unnecessary trade barriers, and implementing programmes aimed at innovation and development.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall focus on the Meyer report, which addresses an important initiative for the European Union, which must come to view Central America as an opportunity, encourage trade and gradually reduce tariff barriers over time, but not the freedom of movement of persons, goods or services, thereby making the most of the specific characteristics of these countries.
This means increasing cooperation and development, protecting the social and individual dignity of the weakest members of society and gradually opening up our markets primarily to these countries' local farming produce, which still accounts for a large proportion of their GDP.
The Committee on International Trade has, as usual, made a contribution in line with its area of expertise, but the growth in competitiveness of the countries of Central America is undoubtedly a prerequisite for the political stabilisation of an area that is still suffering the consequences of the violent clash between the tyrannical institutions and the revolutionary forces of some years ago, a clash that caused hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of deaths and that convulsed that geopolitical area.

The report's cultural and political approach is therefore positive, and I do not believe that it has been watered down by the Committee on International Trade's proposal.
Furthermore, the fact that some of its guidelines have been accepted in substance has helped to combine the issue of the creation of a free trade area with the more general set of issues linked to the development of democracy in that geopolitical area.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports presented by Mr YaÃ±ez and Mr Meyer respond to our Parliament's long-standing call for the Andean and Central American Communities also to have association agreements, like those that we have with other parts of the region, and hence to benefit from the most well-tuned and developed instruments that the European Union has in its relations with third countries.
These are clearly not the only areas with which the European Union is negotiating association agreements, Mr President.
Since the Trade Commissioner is with us here this evening, I would like to take this opportunity to ask him to make a special effort with regard to some negotiations that have been dragging on for too long now, which are the European Union's negotiations with Mercosur.
I appreciate the difficulties facing those negotiations.
They are not entirely due to the will of the European Union, of course, but I believe that we should make an effort to try to give them some impetus so that they can move forward.
Mr President, I would like to point out that, in the first and second generation agreements between the European Union and the countries of Latin America, the emphasis was placed on research and development, in the third generation the emphasis was placed on the democratic clause, and in this fourth generation of association agreements the accent is being placed on a gradual and reciprocal liberalisation of trade.
This does not mean that the commercial aspects are the most important, naturally.
As the Commissioner said a moment ago, this association provides the foundations for the relationship in terms of political dialogue, respect for human rights, for democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and the fight against corruption.

It is clear, however, that we cannot ignore the importance of free trade, which is something that the Central American and Andean countries are asking for, and in that regard, my only recommendation, Mr President, is that this ambitious timetable that the Commissioner has told us about, given that the Commission has approved the negotiation guidelines and Parliament is going to approve them tomorrow as well, can be given substance as soon as possible, because we have already waited too long for the Andean and Central American Communities to have association agreements, like those with Mexico and Chile, which have produced excellent results, by the way.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, our group has been seeking a consensus with regard to the reports by our fellow Members, Mr YaÃ±ez and Mr Meyer.
He has sought compromise amendments, because we believe that it is important to send a message to the Latin American sub-regions in question that what the European Union is proposing is not merely a free trade agreement, but an agreement with a broader scope that takes fundamental account of political agreement and development cooperation.
If I have understood the essential discussion that has taken place in this Parliament with regard to these two reports, it appears that the representatives of the European People's Party's position places more emphasis on the free market aspects of these negotiations, while others, including our Socialist Group, attach more importance to political agreement, solidarity, support for democratic institutions, the fight against poverty and the fight against violence.
If we consider the actual context of commercial relations between the European Union and Central America, for example, we will see that the European Union's trade with Central America represents around 0.3% of our external trade and that, in Central America too, trade with the European Union represents no more than 9 or 10% of their external trade.
If we apply the classic maxim primum vivere, deinde philosophare [live first, philosophise later], we will soon reach the conclusion that, given the situation in these countries, the most crucial aspect of our relations is not so much trade as fighting poverty, fighting lack of security, fighting violence and, in some countries, fighting the increasingly significant problem of drug-trafficking and organised crime.
That is the fundamental issue.
A short while ago, a great European journalist, the Pole Kapucinski, said that we only take notice of these countries when there is bloodshed, and he added, 'this is sad, but it is the case'.
We are clearly facing a situation in which, having stopped paying attention, after ten years of signing peace agreements in Central America, we must now begin to take more notice and take the greatest possible advantage of the possibilities offered by the opening up of negotiations on an association agreement which we believe must enjoy the greatest possible consensus and majority support in this Parliament.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs. Mr Pleite Meyer and Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, for their fine work on the association agreements with the countries of Central America.
Their reports fully address the political aims underlying expansion of cooperation.
The Central American countries, share our European and Latin culture.
They are close to us, it is only natural that we should negotiate association with them.
The agreement aims to strengthen the position of both parties in a globalised world.
At present our assistance to this region is mainly humanitarian in nature.
We are giving them a fish rather than a rod.
It is China, India and world capital that are helping these countries to help themselves, by building roads, mines, factories, creating jobs and successfully selling their products there.
Our association negotiations should secure economic links that will benefit both Europe and other Central American associated countries.
Only on this basis can we build a lasting system of economic and political relations between our societies.
It is to be hoped that European capital will play a greater role involved in the countries with which we want to enter into an Association Agreement, alongside Chinese and Indian support.
The Association Agreements between other countries and the European Union are of great political importance and if they prove successful in securing ongoing economic cooperation, they will pass with flying colours.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their efforts to seek a consensus amongst the groups with regard to establishing the mandate for negotiating the association agreements with Central America and the Andean region.
Nevertheless, as has also been said, the process of drawing up these reports has revealed that there are profound and significant differences between the groups.
Despite the efforts of the rapporteurs, the final text displays a real lack of balance in terms of the three fundamental elements of this agreement: political dialogue, cooperation and trade.
We do not believe that a free trade area is a realistic or appropriate objective for regions as vulnerable as the ones we are discussing here.
We therefore believe that we have missed a good opportunity to encourage bi-regional relations that make it possible to enhance the many dimensions of those relations and ensure the sustainable human development of the Andean and the Central American peoples.
Our group will therefore abstain from tomorrow's vote.
We regret this.
We wish to point out that we want to carry on working, but we regret that a better result has not been achieved for either report.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, these reports demand that developing countries deregulate, give European companies power where public procurement is concerned, protect European and North American patents and do everything to ensure that large European companies' investments are protected.
One of the reports even demands that a free-trade area be set up - in its own words, 'without excluding any sector'.
Give some thought to that wording.
No, it is not that particular road we should go down.
The more deregulation there is, the better it perhaps is for large companies but the worse it is for workers, the environment and local small companies - all designed to be protected by the laws that are being repealed.
Allow me to give two examples.
It is good for Monsanto if it succeeds in patenting crops in South America, but bad for farmers and the environment.
It is good for European health care companies if the health care sector is exposed to competition, but bad for those who cannot afford to pay for health care.
There is an alternative: fair trade instead of unbridled free trade, and cooperation and security instead of competition and a market free-for-all.
That is what the peoples of both Europe and Latin America require.
I shall now conclude by stating the position of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, namely that we are abstaining from voting.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, what is the best way of increasing living standards and human and civil rights in Central American and the Andean Community countries?
The question could equally well be applied to the whole of Central and South America and the rest of the economically developing world.
It is in the long-term self-interest of the economically developed and democratic world to use its economic strength to promote economic growth and democracy in the developing world.
The best way to do this is by reducing trade barriers worldwide and by concluding trade and cooperation agreements conditional on respect for the rule of law, respect for property and contract rights and respect for human and civil rights.
We have seen how China, even while under the yoke of a dictatorial communist regime, can nevertheless achieve staggering economic development when it embraces capitalist, free-market practices.
Capitalism, for all its faults, works.
It delivers prosperity, choice and the conditions required for democracy and civilised values.
Socialism, for all its idealism, does not work.
It delivers oppression, lack of choice and material and political stagnation.
So what the developing countries of the world need is not to follow the example of the quasi-Marxist European Union.
They do not need what these reports recommend, which is the export of the worst features of the European Union: economic and political integration and harmonised legislation.
The last thing that these countries need is to follow the example of the failing economic model and increasingly centralised European Union, with its increasingly undemocratic and unaccountable political institutions.
These reports call for free trade - which is good - but that must not be conditional on recreating the failing structures of the European Union.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, on the report on the agreement with the Andean Community.
Based as it is on the three pillars, it provides a framework that is not just limited to economic aspects.
It was, in fact, the intention of all the institutions to include in the forthcoming association agreement issues such as unemployment, security, migration, social development, the environment, sustainable development and, hence, political stability.
We are concerned to uphold the protection of human, civil, political, economic and social rights and even, in line with EU policies, biodiversity and the protection of ecosystems.
There is a need to combat child labour and to provide investment in education, research, science and technology.
The major differences within the Andean Community require a commitment to reduce poverty.
We should also all like to highlight the need to beat the scourge of narco-terrorism and to do everything possible to eradicate organised crime, corruption, impunity, terrorism, money laundering and arms trafficking.
By means of this agreement, we therefore need to promote employment and, above all, the cultivation of crops other than drugs.
We also hope that the association agreement will give a new impetus to the liberalisation of the market and of trade by means of the free trade area, as well as to the controlled customs tariffs and to the simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures.
Furthermore, we need to guarantee legal certainty for investors, by refusing point-blank to accept the enforced nationalisations that we have seen take place in recent times.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank Mr Meyer Pleite for preparing the report containing the European Parliament's recommendations to the Council concerning guidelines on the negotiation of an Association Agreement between the European Union and the countries of Central America, and Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a for his report on the guidelines for Association Agreement negotiations between the European Union and the Andean Community.
The recommendations of the European Parliament stress that association agreements, whilst aimed at the gradual liberalisation of trade as well as at political dialogue and collaboration, are also aimed at supporting continuous social development, social cohesion, strengthening democracy, the rule of law and respect for human, political, civil, economic and social rights, not forgetting the cultural and environmental dimensions of these rights.
The countries of the Andean Community and of Central America have in the past 20 years undergone a peaceful transition from authoritarian regimes to democracy.
In the 1980s, the European Union played an important role in this process.
Through its recommendations, the European Parliament is upholding this tradition.
Nowadays, trade liberalisation cannot be an end in itself.
I stress, it cannot be an end in itself, but only a step towards establishing democracy and the rule of law, social development and sustainable development in Latin America.
The association agreements with the countries of Central America and the Andean Community must incorporate politics, trade and development.
(PL) Mr President, in Central America, the term 'European Union' is gradually being consigned to the dictionary of rare expressions.
European political influence in the region is diminishing, even though in the 1980s those same European countries were instrumental in the democratisation of the region.
Over 11 years, trade turnover between the European Union and Central America fell by 11%, to its current level of 13%, despite unilateral preferential conditions on our part.
The Association Agreement should alter this situation somewhat.
The second Association Agreement with the Andean Community coincides with an intriguing political period in the region.
The victory of the anti American Left in Venezuela and Bolivia and the altered balance of power in the region is a challenge for the European Union.
It actually favours the process of economic and political integration for all of Latin America to a greater degree than MERCOSUR.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mr Meyer Pleite and Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, and only regret that we are debating such important questions just before midnight.
- (ES) Mr President, this time I would like to use my speaking time to lay out the position of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left, with regard to the report by Mr YaÃ±ez.
He will understand that we are going to vote in the way that we voted on the report that I had the pleasure of presenting to the House.
We are going to abstain.
We are going to do so for the same reasons, and in the knowledge that Mr YaÃ±ez has made a real effort to present a very balanced report with the emphasis on the fundamental thing that Latin America is currently calling for, which is political dialogue and cooperation.
With regard to the cooperation aspect, we can play a very significant role compared to the role being played by the United States in Latin America, but unfortunately other Members, essentially those in the Committee on International Trade, have altered this approach substantially.
We are going to abstain.
The truth is that our instincts sometimes urge us to go a little further.
But we are going to abstain because we also believe that we must listen to the opinion of Latin America and, in this case, its social organisations as well.
We are going to take care to ensure that our abstention in this case contributes to the fundamental debate on the Association Agreement with Central America, and we are going to be very critical with a view to producing an association agreement that does not mean a free trade area.
- (PL) Mr President, despite the European Union's undeniable contribution to strengthening the peace process and building democratic structures in the Central American region, its role there has diminished noticeably over the past decade.
As we have already heard, the same trend can be observed in trade, which declined from 24% to barely 13% in 2001.
This situation shows clearly how important it is to sign a new Association Agreement between the European Union and the countries of Central America.
Such an agreement, in addition to its indisputable economic benefits, will also impose certain obligations on the European Union, mainly concerning support for the process of democratisation and decentralisation, and improving administrative efficiency in combating violence, corruption and infringements of human rights.
These obligations are the reason why the future Association Agreement should be more than merely a trade agreement.
It must also incorporate political and social cooperation.
The fight against poverty and social inequality can become a very useful tool in strengthening democracy, establishing trust in public institutions and also in the political elite, that ought to be the guardian of these values.
Another very important element of a future Association Agreement would be establishing compulsory environmental protection standards.
The system of incentives tested in previous cases should prove useful in this regard.
All the elements I have mentioned should become part of a future Association Agreement, and at the same time pillars of the cooperation between the European Union and the countries of Latin America.
It is only by playing an active and committed role in this region that we can contribute to its genuine economic development, social and political stability, and to the establishment of democratic values.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Missing persons in Cyprus (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on missing persons in Cyprus.
In this respect, I should like to welcome the members of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus, who are present in the official gallery to follow the debate on this issue and, more specifically, Christophe Girod, Chairman of the UN Committee, Elias Georgiadis, a Greek-Cypriot member of the Committee and GÃŒlden PlÃŒmer KÃŒÃ§ÃŒk, a Turkish-Cypriot member of the same Committee.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission welcomes and supports the motion for a resolution on the Committee on Missing Persons.
Like the honourable Members of this House, we believe that relatives have a fundamental right to know what became of missing persons.
Since the unrest of the 1960s and 1970s, about 1500 Greek Cypriots and 500 Turkish Cypriots have been missing, presumed dead.
The Committee on Missing Persons is charged with finding and identifying the remains of the missing, of returning them to their families and of counselling the bereaved.
The Committee has the support of both sides on the island and of the international community.
It is currently the most important and successful bi-communal confidence-building and reconciliation measure in Cyprus.
Recent exhumations and the establishment of an anthropological laboratory in the buffer zone show that, if there is a political will on the side of both communities, much can be achieved.
The Committee on Missing Persons can count not only on the Commission's political support but also on the financial support of the European Union.
Under the aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot community, EUR 1.5 million has been earmarked.
This should come on stream shortly in line with the Committee's needs, and I hope that the work of the Committee will help prepare the ground for the overall solution of the long-lasting conflict in Cyprus.
I take this opportunity to recall that monitoring of the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights falls under the responsibility of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.
The Commission follows the follow-up given to such judgments closely.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the chairmen of the political groups who included the humanitarian issue of missing persons in Cyprus as an extraordinary item on plenary's agenda and all the political groups which signed the motion in question, which is expected to be passed tomorrow.
My special thanks also to Mrs Rothe, Mr Guardans, Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Kaufmann, who have supported my proposal to debate the question and issue the relevant resolution from the outset.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today we are debating a purely humanitarian issue: the issue of the missing persons.
We are not debating the Cyprus question this evening.
We are not debating the problem of the military occupation of Cyprus by Turkey.
We are not politicising the issue.
We are debating a human tragedy; the tragedy of our missing fellow human beings.
More than 2 000 people are entered on the register of missing persons, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and others.
More or less equal numbers of families, some of which have two or three missing persons, have been living for decades with the anxiety and pain of the loss of their loved ones.
The time has finally come for them to find out - and they have the inalienable right to find out, as the Commissioner said - if their loved ones are dead or alive and, if they are dead, where they are buried.
The time has come for all parties involved to put political expediencies, fears and guilt to one side and to cooperate with the Committee on Missing Persons.
Turkey in particular is called upon to give the information and data in its possession to the committee, to comply with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.
However, the time has come for the European Union to also take on an active role.
The resolution which is expected to be approved tomorrow renews the involvement of the Commission and the European Parliament in this humanitarian issue.
Finally, I would like to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Committee on Missing Persons for the difficult job they are doing.
I welcome their presence this evening in the European Parliament and I trust and hope that the human tragedy of the relatives of the missing persons will end as quickly as possible.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to say that I have the special honour of also speaking on behalf of my honourable friend Mrs Rothe, who is absent this evening.
I wish to congratulate Commissioner Mandelson on his statement, my honourable friend Mr Demetriou on his initiative and all my honourable friends from all the political parties who played a decisive part in putting this important humanitarian issue, the issue of the missing persons from the tragedy in Cyprus, on the agenda.
I believe that, in the vote tomorrow, all the members, regardless of their political group, will willingly attend to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, an act of confirmation of the defence of humanitarian principles and of the deep humanitarian problem of the missing persons in Cyprus.
In 1981 the Committee on Missing Persons was set up under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.
In 1995 we had the first resolution here in Parliament, an important step in raising the awareness of the European public and international public opinion.
In May 2001, the European Court of Human Rights returned its decision on the appeal by the Republic of Cyprus against the state of Turkey.
In its decision - and I think it is in the interests of all of us to study it - it confirmed the clear infringements of fundamental human rights and of the European Convention on Human Rights by Turkey, specifically of Article 2 on the right to life, of Article 3 on the right to freedom and security and of Article 4 on the right not to be maltreated.
Despite all this, it is now 2007 and, unfortunately, very few results have ensued from the investigation of this problem.
I believe that, as the European Union and, more importantly, as the European Parliament, we have at the very least a humanitarian responsibility to defend the fundamental - in Mr Mandelson's words - right of the families of the missing persons to know the fate of their relatives and we must express this responsibility tomorrow in the most absolute terms.
I think it is especially important for the European Parliament to remember everyone's obligations, because the missing persons are a humanitarian problem which concerns the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, it concerns Greeks and Turks.
It is the outcome of tragic events in Cyprus in the 1960s, from 1964 onwards following the clashes between the two communities and, of course, it is the outcome of the Turkish invasion in 1974.
I believe, as Mr Mandelson quite rightly said, that activating the Committee on Missing Persons is a very important step, just as the funding of its operation on the part of the European Commission is an important step.
I should like to point out here that the Member States also have an obligation to contribute funds for the operation of this committee.
I welcome the fact that Mr Mandelson backs the need for funding and has reconfirmed the European Commission's willingness to fund its operation.
I believe that, with this debate today, not only are we activating the historic memory, but also, more importantly, we are helping the two communities in Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, to become closer.
That is why I think that our debate may form a bridge for the creation of confidence-building measures leading to reconciliation and the reunification of the two communities within the framework of a united Republic of Cyprus within the European Union.
I also believe that all of us here, with the humanitarian sensitivity for which we are known, will continue to demonstrate our interest and, as the motion for a resolution states, it is very important for the European Parliament to contribute to developments or, if you like, to monitor them through the periodic reports which the committee must submit.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the problem of missing persons is a drama that is part of the history of many countries of the world.
Cyprus is not the only one, but it is certainly the closest country to us in which this drama is still absolutely part of the present and is not something consigned to the past.
It is therefore very important that we acknowledge the work of the Committee on Missing Persons created within, and recently given new impetus by, the United Nations, which is doing an extremely commendable job and one that must be recognised and supported.
That is the true purpose of the resolution that we are going to vote on tomorrow.
This work benefits the families of these missing persons and it goes far beyond the conflict, far beyond the political tension and the historic drama that has divided that island and that still divides it today.
This resolution is therefore intended to deal with this issue strictly from that point of view.
From the humanitarian point of view, geared towards the families and the suffering of people who have the right to recover the remains of the people they loved and who, as a result of the conflict, have no way of knowing, without the experts and the forensic scientists of the Committee on Missing Persons, either where they are or who they are, and they cannot be identified.
That is the intention of this resolution.
To call for the support of the institutions, including the financial support that we know the Committee on Missing Persons needs, and that is the message we intend to send.
This will not heal the wound currently being suffered by Cyprus.
That requires too much work.
We know that it will take a long time to heal, despite the recent actions that we have seen.
Nevertheless, it is important that, amongst all of us, we do not contaminate this debate on joint support from the two communities for this institution with the political tension which continues to exist, but which should in no way be mixed up with the support of all of us for the work of this committee.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the missing persons in Cyprus has been an open wound for over 30 years.
According to official figures, 2 000 people are still missing, from both sides.
Each side accuses the other of being uncooperative in the resolution of the cases.
I would ask the House to refrain from such accusations, at least in this Chamber.
Meanwhile, the families of the missing persons are still living in uncertainty as to the fate of their relatives.
The mothers' tears are the same whether their sons were of Greek or Turkish origin: they were all Cypriots, and died because of enosis (union with Greece) and taksim (partition).
This is one of the truths when we express our opinions about this conflict.
The work of the Committee on Missing Persons plays an important role in this context, and we cannot thank it enough.
This is primarily a humanitarian matter, and we should not make the committee's work any more difficult by politicising it.
The committee's work is not only important to the relatives of the missing persons, but also serves to bring the two communities closer together.
This bi-communal work on the mass graves stimulates a common culture of remembrance and understanding of the trauma suffered by the other side in the past.
That is why the financial support is so important - I agree with my fellow Members on this.
EU support for further bi-communal projects on the island is also desirable.
I am thinking of projects by filmmakers and intellectuals, such as Panikos Chrysanthou and Niyazi KizilyÃŒrek, and also of the bi-communal art project Manifesta 6 and many other projects, which we must support if all the dreadful images of Cyprus we have seen in the past are to remain in the past and not recur in the future.
The demolition of the bridge on Ledra Street is a sign of hope.
The response to this - the demolition of the wall running through Nicosia - is another sign of hope.
Let us work together to ensure that these signs of hope are followed by other such signs.
Both sides are required to behave in a constructive, European-minded manner to make this conflict in Europe a thing of the past.
We may not be able to bring back the dead, but we can ensure that nationalism is never given another chance in Cyprus.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, we have been living through the tragedy of ignorance about the fate of some 2 000 of our missing Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot compatriots in Cyprus for years now.
The competent Committee on Missing Persons, which is made up of representatives of the Turkish Cypriots, the Greek Cypriots and the UN, has already made progress on the question of the exhumation and identification of remains.
However, their work does need to be speeded up and an end needs to be put to the suffering of our compatriots as quickly as possible.
This is a purely humanitarian issue, which affects our entire people, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, and which no one should use to serve political or other ends.
We consider that the Member States should support the work of the committee by increasing their economic aid and we call on all sides to cooperate in order to establish the fate of all the missing persons.
The case of the young Greek Cypriot referred to who was taken to Turkey in 1974 is an opportunity to promote cooperation.
We believe that, in resolving this humanitarian issue, we shall have taken another step in our efforts towards finding a solution to the Cyprus problem.
(FR) Mr President, the issue of the missing persons in Cyprus illustrates better than anything else the human drama that was played out on that island over thirty years ago.
It is an issue for Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike and is not only about the missing persons themselves but also about their families, who are still there today.
Speaking as the coordinator of the High-level Contact Group for relations with the Turkish Cypriot community in the north of the island, I can assure the House that this is still a live issue in people's minds and that its effects are still widely felt on the ground.
I have also given notice of my intention to raise this issue, among others, at the Conference of Presidents when we present our written report to it tomorrow morning.
The issue of missing persons in Cyprus is part of the shared past that the two communities are now attempting to understand and to overcome.
Although the issue is a difficult and sensitive one, a joint project has been got up and running, symbolising the desire of both communities to build a shared future.
The project to which I refer is the Committee on Missing Persons; it exists under the aegis of the United Nations, and the humanitarian work it does is crucial in terms of the help it gives to both communities as they look for some 2 000 persons who are still listed as missing.
I cannot but be very pleased about the interest shown by my fellow Members of this House in the problem of missing persons in Cyprus.
I agree that political support at the highest level is indispensable to the success of this project.
Work on the missing persons problem must be seen primarily as humanitarian in character, as this House has always pointed out.
The project must rely on the goodwill of both communities and be a joint enterprise with, of course, the appropriate material, financial and human resources.
Since it came into being, this committee has come up against many obstacles, but it has now entered upon a new phase and has taken definite and useful action, which is what prompts me to welcome and encourage the efforts being made on both sides of the Green Line towards opening new border crossing points in various places, among them on Ledra Street in the historic heart of Nicosia.
It follows, then, that the Committee on Missing Persons is not merely symbolic, but a means of dialogue between the two communities and hence an essential contribution to the overall settlement of the Cyprus issue.
Mr President, I shall speak briefly only about the missing children of the 1974 Cyprus tragedy.
Christakis Georgiou, a five-year-old boy, was slightly injured after being shot inside his home by a Turkish solider during the 1974 invasion.
He was taken to a Turkish military field hospital, and that was the last time he was seen by his mother.
Evidence that came to light 33 years later - including eye-witness accounts by Turkish soldiers - strongly indicates that he was transported to Turkey, where he was adopted by a Turkish army officer who had no children of his own.
The mother, who is now elderly, desperately wants to see him again before she dies.
Andreas Kyriakou, a five-year-old boy, and his three-year-old twin sisters, Maria and Kika, were forcibly separated from their mother by Turkish soldiers who attacked their village.
They were taken, along with a group of other civilians, to a nearby field in the now occupied area of Cyprus, from where shortly afterwards gunfire was heard.
It is feared that they might have been executed in a frenzied reprisal.
The Turkish army has never given any information as to what happened to them.
Their mother hopes and prays that they might still be alive.
If not, she begs to have their skeletal remains given to her so that she can give them a proper burial.
The above are 4 out of the 30 children and the more than 1500 persons missing in similar circumstances after being taken into custody by the Turkish army in 1974.
The Turkish Government says nothing of their whereabouts or of the circumstances of their disappearance, despite the European Court of Human Rights ruling of 10 May 2001 condemning Turkey in the strongest possible terms for such behaviour, which, in the words of the Court's ruling, 'attains a level of severity which can only be categorised as inhuman treatment'.
Commissioner, the affair of the missing persons is not a necrology issue.
The relatives still hope that their loved ones might still be alive.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, not all the missing persons are Greek Cypriots; there are also missing persons from the Turkish Cypriot community.
Parliament's high-level contact group for relations with the Turkish Cypriot community has seen with its own eyes the exemplary cooperation taking place within the Committee on Missing Persons.
This is the only bi-communal initiative in Cyprus that is functioning smoothly.
It is very much in the interests of the Cypriot people on both sides to reappraise what is indeed a dark chapter in their common history.
Contemporary witnesses are advising the scientists on possible sites.
We have seen with our own eyes the professionalism with which the international team, headed by an Argentine, has been working on identifying the human remains.
It is good that we are now giving this committee our attention, and hopefully also additional funding.
I would caution against abusing this issue for political ends, however, as it would be all too easy for this to disturb the laborious, careful process of rapprochement between the two communities and do a great deal more damage.
It would not be the first time, as the urgently needed technical committees that were supposed to be set up long ago to ensure smooth cooperation between the two communities on essential everyday matters such as health, crime-fighting and trade facilitation have yet to show any success in three years.
Why is this?
The citizens of Cyprus are certainly not unwilling.
The reason lies in the spirit of the negative power politics, the obstructionist politics, that have been standing in the way of teamwork on both sides for decades.
At the end of the debate I have received a motion for a resolution on missing persons in Cyprus.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 10.05 a.m.)
(SV) Mr President, it is an issue of protocol that I am addressing.
Yesterday, when I was to talk about the report on trade defence instruments, I wanted to quote the Muscardini report from October, whereupon I discovered that an important bit of it was missing.
As a result, I do not know how we are to proceed now.
The report is from October 2006, but there is a serious error in the Swedish version, as the whole of the following text is missing from paragraph 11, and I wonder how we can remedy this. The following text is missing from the Swedish version: 'with a view to including non-compliance with global social and environmental agreements or international covenants as forms of dumping or subsidy'.
If the whole aspect of the environment and social dumping is missing from the Swedish version, the Swedish people will get a false picture of what it is that Parliament wants.
Mr Schlyter, this comment is very important and it will be taken into account.
It will be checked and the necessary action will be taken.
Documents received: see Minutes
Regional policy (islands and natural and economic constraints) (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the islands and natural and economic constraints in the context of the regional policy.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have contributed to the drafting of this report.
We believe that this is the first time that a complete study has been dedicated to the islands, taking account of their specific characteristics with regard to all areas of Community competence: although the 2007-2013 cohesion policy pays particular attention to structurally disadvantaged regions, no specific measures are provided for island regions.
Parliament has highlighted this gap several times and, although the situation in European islands is varied - there are 121 islands in all, with a population of roughly 15 million inhabitants - they share a series of difficulties that constitute a competitive disadvantage: higher prices due to additional transport costs and little competition; difficulty in accessing the single market, the need to import raw materials, higher energy costs, lack of infrastructure, immigration, limited diversification of economic activities and vulnerability to environmental risks.
It is no accident that the average per capita GDP on the islands is 72% of the European Union average.
It is therefore necessary to recognise their specific island characteristics when implementing Community policy, beginning with State aids.
We believe that greater flexibility is needed in order to offset the additional costs and, as regards energy, to compensate for fluctuations in the cost of fuel.
In the context of the Structural Funds operating programmes, particular emphasis must be given to carrying out infrastructure projects, especially within the framework of European maritime policy, in order to integrate the islands fully into the internal market and the Lisbon Strategy.
On the other hand, islands enjoy an advantage as regards the generation of energy using wind, sun and sea.
These represent unequalled potential value, which is why the Commission must support projects for renewable energy sources and energy security.
Tourism is another resource to be exploited.
We need a Community policy for promoting island tourism, a quality and origin label and an in-depth study on sustainable tourism.
Among other things, we propose 2010 as the European year for the islands.
The report also tackles the issue of illegal immigration, which we view as both a human tragedy and an unsustainable burden for the Mediterranean islands, for which the European Union must take responsibility.
We welcome the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and call for the establishment of a European coastguard body.
As a matter of urgency, the European Union must allocate the necessary resources to guarantee rapid and timely intervention in this field.
There are other proposals which warrant further development, such as the financial instruments JASPERS (Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) to facilitate access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises and to promote the diversification of island economies, or the distribution of broadband to bridge the technology gap.
Finally, it is essential that we revise the legal framework in order to take into full consideration the specific characteristics of islands and update the statistical indicators accordingly: taking account of the islands within the context of the European Spatial Planning Observation Network and setting up an administrative unit for the islands within the Commission Directorate-General for Regional Policy.
We hope that this report will represent a real turning point, once and for all, by producing genuine development and providing practical answers for new generations who intend to continue to live and work in the place where they were born, integrated into the European context.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, islands and other territories with natural or specific constraints are very important to the Commission in terms of ensuring territorial cohesion, developing cross-border cooperation - usually with third countries, tourism, culture and other issues.
While acknowledging that a cross-sectoral approach may be useful, cohesion policy aims to play a central role in dealing with the specific problems of these territories.
In the draft 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy General Regulation, issued in July 2004, the Commission specifically proposed granting a co-financing rate top-up to these regions.
Unfortunately, this proposal was not finally adopted by the Council in the final version of the regulation approved in July 2006 and which is now in force, as you are aware.
However, the Commission will ensure, during the ongoing negotiations on the Cohesion Policy intervention for 2007-2013, that the specific constraints of these territories are duly taken into account in the corresponding programmes and that suitable measures are programmed to tackle them.
In addition, the Commission is now preparing the Fourth Cohesion Report to be published in May, which will contain a comprehensive analysis of the state of play and trends in territorial cohesion in the EU, including islands and regions with natural handicaps.
Likewise the Commission intends to continue upgrading work within the ESPON programme in order to obtain more suitable indicators and more updated information on these territories.
At the same time, the Commission would point out that statistical data for islands or other territories that are NUTS II or NUTS III regions are already available.
Gathering statistical information for smaller territories is certainly more difficult, but in fact 95% of the European island population, outermost regions excluded, live in NUTS II or NUTS III regions.
Turning to the practical implementation of the notion of territorial cohesion, despite the lack of an explicit legal base as provided by the Constitutional Treaty, the Council already agreed in 2004 in Rotterdam to introduce the territorial dimension into the Lisbon process.
It also started to develop the territorial agenda and this document, which aims at presenting the challenges, objectives and policy recommendations for territorial cohesion, is due to be adopted in May 2007 in Leipzig.
Moreover, the Community strategy guidelines on cohesion adopted by the Council last October include a specific chapter on the territorial dimension of cohesion policy.
The Commission is now working to ensure their practical implementation in the programming documents that are now being negotiated.
The Commission is very much in favour of promoting Euro-regions or similar structures in order to manage cross-border transnational and interregional cooperation.
These bodies could be particularly suited to islands and other regions with natural handicaps and, in addition, the Commission encourages these territories to make use of the brand new European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation in order to facilitate the management of the corresponding programmes.
With regard to state aid, it may be that regional investment aid is not the best instrument to tackle local problems in islands.
I believe that the islands' main problems can be tackled more effectively with, for example, horizontal instruments.
Our state aid rules already allow for many forms of aid.
For example, our rules on services of general economic interest allow compensation for the provision of local public services, including passenger transport services.
Secondly, our new guidelines on risk capital and our framework for research development and innovation offer new opportunities to support young, innovative companies, with extra bonuses for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In some cases, the support levels needed by small islands will not be counted as aids at all.
Under the new de minimis regulation, aid of up to EUR 200 000, granted over any period of 3 years will not be counted as aid.
Investment for all kinds of public infrastructure can be financed.
They do not have an aid element.
Moreover, the specific situation of islands is effectively taken into account in the new regional aid guidelines.
Under the new form of aid to help business start-ups, a 5% bonus is given to small islands.
I think that these examples really show how, through our state aid reform process, we are making the rules more predictable and reducing the administrative burden of state aid notification, and that was what you were asking for in the interests of island regions and all other stakeholders.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Musotto on this report.
It is an extremely important report, especially for those who, like me, come from islands.
It is particularly important because it lends a voice to islands.
Islands deserve to be heard, because up until now the European Union has not paid them enough attention.
This report is therefore devoting the appropriate consideration to them.
I was also pleased to hear Commissioner Kroes state that islands are important for the European Commission.
However, Commissioner, we want islands to be considered in all the various policy areas within the European Union and not simply viewed through the lens of regional policy.
For example, you are Commissioner for competition and, as you rightly stated, there are rules on state aid that, as yet, are not sufficiently flexible in the case of islands.
The rules intended for the whole of the European territory are not necessarily flexible enough to apply to islands, and we would like you to examine these rules seriously, to dedicate more attention to islands and to ensure that the rules can be applied as flexibly as possible.
I would like to highlight paragraph 10 of the report.
It talks about the need for the Commission regularly to draw up a report on the requirements of islands and on how these can be addressed.
I expect the Commission to draw up such a report, and we will keep insisting that this be done.
Once again, I would like to say that this is a good report and, undoubtedly, one that all the islands involved will appreciate.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again the European Parliament has brought up the subject of islands.
Once again it has clearly stated in this report - and I should like to congratulate Mr Musotto on a job very well done - that island regions need special treatment.
They need more aid, in order not only to overcome the development problems they face, but also so that they can make use of the potential of the common market and the globalised economy.
For all of us who inhabit island regions, problems to varying degrees, such as geographical isolation, the lack of infrastructures, economic and demographic stagnation and limited resources and options are, I would say, a way of life.
At the same time, however, we are all - both permanent residents and the millions of citizens who choose European islands for their holidays - well aware of the advantages of island regions: their cultural wealth, their rich but sensitive ecosystems, their natural environment, their special way of life and their quality products and traditional methods of manufacture.
We must support these advantages, we must highlight them and we must promote them through the policies of the European Union, especially through the cohesion policy, if we really want fundamental economic and territorial cohesion between the regions of Europe.
It is in this context that I should like to refer to the particular importance of granting state aid to island regions, where the cost of fuel and energy has an adverse impact on their competitiveness and on the flexible application of both existing and future state aid in relation to the cost of transport, the application of an integrated policy on tourism, the application of an effective business policy and the immediate creation of an administrative unit for islands at the Regional Policy DG on the basis of experience acquired by the administrative unit for remote regions, the operation of which will safeguard all the peculiarities and needs of the islands and of their permanent and seasonal inhabitants which are taken into account in the development and application of European policies, especially in the transport, energy and water resource management sectors.
At a time when the Fourth Cohesion Report is being prepared and the debate on the future of regional policy is starting in the run-up to the review of the financial perspective for 2008-2009, the European Parliament should remember that the European Union cannot deal differently with similar situations or with different situations in the same way.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group thanks Mr Musotto for his very valuable report on the natural and economic constraints affecting islands.
All the topics covered merit full attention, but I should like to concentrate on issues relating to state aid and paragraphs 8, 9 and 19. The reason has to do with the realities of life on islands, particularly those remote from centres of population.
The examples are from my own constituency, but resonate across the whole of the EU.
To emphasise the problem of distance, it takes a friend from the Shetland Islands a 14-hour journey by car and ferry to reach the nearest cinema.
The price of petrol is some 11% higher in the Western Isles than in Scotland's central belt.
This rises to around 16% for the Shetland Islands.
A bale of hay costs five times as much in the Western Isles as it does just outside the nearest city of Inverness.
Facts like these only begin to illustrate how far matters of location alone can place islands at a competitive disadvantage.
I thank the Commissioner for what she said about state aid, but a more flexible regime is still needed simply to level the playing field.
I have particular concerns, as she knows, with the market investor test.
Again, the realities of life on islands and in other remote regions make this test very difficult to satisfy, as no appropriate comparator may be available and the small size of the market creates problems where the average level of return for a given sector is concerned.
All we seek in this context is for our islands to enjoy access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work done.
If we are honest with ourselves, we must today admit that not all citizens of EU Member States enjoy the same advantages.
In our Community there are areas where particular constraints exist because of distance or poor accessibility.
Those areas include islands, and they are often also ultraperipheral and mountain areas.
