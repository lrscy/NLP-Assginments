This agenda sets itself.
The European Union cannot ignore its responsibility.
I will, above all, ask the Council and Commission to reconsider the question of how it is possible, following such a success in Georgia, but before that in Serbia, and in Ukraine, that things are now at risk of going the other way again.
Have we made mistakes?
I think that this, too, is something we should analyse.
Â Â  Mr President,I should like to point out that, as it considers its common foreign and security policy, Europe would do well to review its guiding principles.
I believe that where security and consequently peace are concerned, it is essential for Europe to adopt the concept known as human security.
This involves tackling issues such as how best to cope with major diseases, starvation, infringements of human rights and attacks on democracy.
In my view, another key element of security policy the Union ought to have in place is a policy on energy security.
I should like to point out that Europe has so far failed to take into account the fact that energy supply could become a tool for an imperialist policy.
What is at stake is not a shortage of gas or oil, but the use of huge energy resources as a means of implementing an imperialist policy.
As I see it, this is a major challenge for Europe to which we have so far failed to respond
Â Â  â Mr President, I have read the report and listened to MrÂ Solana carefully.
I am not certain if they primarily serve Europe's interests.
I have a feeling that we are continuing to serve American interests and that is a problem.
They are dragging us into enmity with Russia, hostilities with China and the same with Iran.
We must not get caught up in the American mindset.
We must learn to say 'no' to the United States if we want to have a substantial foreign policy which, of course, I do not understand can be common to Sweden and Greece, Cyprus and Estonia, given that each State has such different issues to address.
Mr Schulz said that there is a threat to the underbelly of Europe.
Yes, there is a threat.
Î€urkey's against Greece constitutes a threat.
The constant, daily infringements of Greek airspace by Turkish military aircraft constitute a threat.
The wall in Nicosia constitutes a threat.
The wall in Jerusalem constitutes a threat.
Can we therefore say that all the occupying forces should leave the countries they are in?
That the occupying army should leave Cyprus, that Israel's occupying armyÂ ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, many issues have been raised in the course of this debate on the European Unionâs common foreign and security policy.
As I see it, three types of security are required if all Europeans are to feel genuinely safe.
I shall begin with energy security.
The whole Union is much troubled by the subject, as are individual Member States such as Poland.
There seems to be no desire to take common action in this field.
Germany enhanced the security of its own energy supply by signing an agreement with Russia for the construction of the northern gas pipeline.
Unfortunately, Germanyâs action did much to undermine the security of Polandâs energy supply.
The Union has so far failed to respond to this situation, although it is abundantly obvious that Russia is using the supply of raw materials for energy as an important tool with which to influence other countriesâ policies.
Russiaâs decision to shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and Georgia has shown just how effective this tool can be.
I shall now move on to food security.
The security of our food supply is based on the common agricultural policy but unfortunately this policy is coming increasingly under attack.
Finally, I would like to mention physical security, which is now under much greater threat due to terrorism.
There can be no meaningful common foreign and security policy without significant progress in the three areas I have highlighted.
I trust MrÂ Solana and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner will bear my remarks in mind.
Â Â  It is clear that the political situation around the world, from country to country and region to region, does not accord with our values, aspirations and expectations, nor is it becoming calmer or more democratic.
At the same time, however, we are getting explicit requests for more Europe from various parts of the world.
In Mongolia they say the European Union is our third neighbour.
And when I visit the Balkan states, Latin America, Transcaucasia or Central Asia, I hear the same thing â more Europe.
Yet while numerous partners want more Europe, we often find ourselves involved in our own unproductive concerns, and we are forgetting the fundamental ideas of Schuman and the other fathers of Europe in our desire to build more Europe with less money.
It does not surprise me that our partners and our citizens do not understand the jargon about the various pillars of our policy, but they can sense precisely when we are united and when we are divided and ineffective.
The experience with energy supply has taught us that national policies alone will not bring either greater internal security or greater external influence.
I have the impression that even now the course of events demands more common policy than the already ratified Constitutional Treaty would bring about.
If we truly wish to play a key role in the Balkans, in the east of Europe or elsewhere, we must find ways of expressing our common foreign and security policy more robustly.
Something that would certainly contribute to this is a greater regard for the role of the European Parliament, which has shown itself to be a dynamic and responsible player.
Â Â  Mr President, I can virtually carry on where Mr Peterle left off, for if, as you, MrÂ Solana, have said, many in Europe are bidding us to take action, then the time for action really has come.
Let me give just two examples of what I mean.
I am not rejoicing in the sufferings of others when I say that the great American initiative for the wider Middle East has, in fact, collapsed, and that the intervention in Iraq has done nothing to improve matters.
The inadequate and hesitant support for the peace policy and the peace initiative in the Middle East helped Hamas to victory in the elections; I mention only in passing the fact that Fatah itself must bear much of the blame for this.
As for Iran, we all know that more involvement on the part of the USA in security policy would play an important part in persuading Iran to refrain from developing its own nuclear weapons.
Now, then, is the time, for the European Union â working with the USA rather than in opposition to it, which would be absurd â to clearly define what a comprehensive foreign policy in the Middle East might be like, including everything from a determined peace policy to support for civil society in the individual countries.
The second example is that of energy policy.
As has already been said, we, being a major consumer, need to present a more united front on the world market; we need to mobilise and form coalitions with other consumers.
We have seen precisely what happens â in Iran, for example â when we do not make common cause with them.
If Russia starts to make its energy policy an instrument of nationalist policy, then we must make our own â or at least part of it â more European.
Commissioner, we await the report with eager anticipation.
This is an issue that I asked you about as long ago as your appointment hearing.
It is of the utmost importance that we should now have this report in our hands and be able to say out loud that, while we need our national energy policies, they must be supplemented and extended by a strong European energy policy which is also an essential instrument of foreign policy.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EUâs role as an international player is an important one, and it has strengthened in recent years.
The EU achieves results the gentle way, by which I mean through negotiations, discussions, persuasion and crisis management.
This is sometimes a slow process, but it creates a firm basis for lasting solutions and for a viable society.
In its foreign policy, the EU stresses the importance of democracy, and we want to take that forward.
In this connection, I would like the EU to emphasise more strongly that without literacy there can be no democracy, nor can there be democracy without respect for womenâs rights.
We should therefore do more to ensure that children, young people and women in different parts of the world know how to read.
This will create a lasting basis for democracy, peace and respect for human rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in the French and Dutch referendums (or referenda) has meant that the whole document is now no longer relevant.
It is proving very hard for some people to come to terms with the disappearance of a concept that has been promoted for so many years.
The common foreign and security policy was an important part of the aforementioned Treaty, but I would like to remind you it was rejected unequivocally.
We are therefore amazed to note that efforts are being made to refer to a document that is entirely meaningless and as good as dead.
Mr Brockâs report is an example of this approach.
It makes a laughing stock of the House and tramples the democratic principles advocated by the European Community underfoot.
The requisite period of reflection following the demise of this Treaty should not be devoted to getting specific chapters of the Constitution adopted through the back door.
The time should be used instead to reassess common action at an international level and to place greater emphasis on the importance of issues such as energy security and the threats posed by epidemics and terrorism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union is actually blest with one effective security policy, and that is the common agricultural policy.
For many years now this policy has guaranteed food security for the Community as a whole and for its citizens, nations and countries.
Food security is vital to them all.
Europe has now satisfied its hunger, but it has an unfortunate tendency to forget how this came about and thanks to whom.
The common agricultural policy is under attack and has become a testing ground for irresponsible reforms such as the reform of the sugar market, as a result of which Europe is soon to become dependent on the rest of the world for sugar supplies.
Protection of European agricultural markets is being phased out, as our farmers are all too aware.
In Poland, the fruit producers are the ones who have been most affected.
Ill-considered cuts in the common agricultural policy will result in the collapse of food security, which is crucial to security in Europe as a whole.
There is still time to prevent this happening, but the political approach to agricultural issues must change.
Banners carried by Polish agricultural workersâ organisations often feature slogans referring to the part food production played in the long struggle for Polandâs independence, as well as their willingness to fight.
As we debate and decide on agricultural matters we should always remember that it is the farmers who feed and defend us, and that they are the real guardians of Europeâs security.
Â Â  Mr President, I have been listening attentively and I thought I had heard it all, but when I heard Daniel Cohn-Bendit supporting nuclear power â albeit in Iran â I must say I was a little shocked.
Who says that Joschka Fischer changed?
I think âred Dannyâ has changed a little himself!
I will take an institutional perspective and make three points.
The first is that CFSP and defence are key areas for us in the future.
We are a superpower in trade and in aid, but we are very often nowhere to be seen in CFSP and defence.
Something needs to be done and I disagree with Mr Piotrowski.
The first thing we need is a constitution.
The second point I wanted to make was that we need three things: firstly, we need a common defence â we need the security guarantees that the constitution would give us.
Secondly, we need to speak with one voice.
For that we need a President and a Foreign Minister.
Thirdly, we need to increase the CFSP budget.
All of those should be packaged into one.
If we get some political will behind it, I think we just might get a common foreign and security policy.
The third point is that we really need to start thinking about the different elements of the constitution and look at it in two parts.
There are things that we are already implementing, such as the European Defence Agency, the battle groups and the clause on solidarity with terrorism.
But there are things that we need to start implementing as quickly as possible when the constitution enters into force.
Those issues include a President, a Foreign Minister, an external relations service and prior consultation with the European Parliament.
The final point I wanted to make is that instead of sticking to the institutional battle between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in CFSP matters, we need to get ready, put our working clothes on and do it together.
Â Â  Mr President, I could almost feel my good friend Mr Solanaâs pain when you outlined what happened in the first month of this year, imagining that if the rest of the year is going to be like the first month, then it is not going to be easy!
But I have another point to make.
I think that what you said in essence is that the world in 2006 will once again be confronted with a fundamental choice: the choice between pre-emptive wars or pre-emptive policies.
I am in no doubt that what you are saying and what is clear as a result of your experience, is that in 2006 we need pre-emptive policies.
The essence of the values of this European Union when it comes to foreign policy is pre-emptive policies.
When we look at the instruments which the Commissioner so nicely referred to, it is fair to say that yes, maybe it is the most difficult choice, but yes, it is also the choice which, in historical terms, has shown success.
We need to remember that at this difficult time.
I want to say to you, Mr Solana, that in Palestine right now there are so many who are taking the lead in the wrong direction and therefore the poor people in Palestine need to have a strong European voice.
What you said is correct: we need patience, we need wisdom and we need balance.
I was so happy to hear you say that we should not be those who just make Palestine bankrupt, because you and I know that there will be others who will ensure that this will not happen â Iran, Egypt and others.
This is not our case and therefore I trust you.
We will be on your side ensuring, together with the Commission and President-in-Office Winkler, that Europe will ensure open doors and dialogue and, hopefully, open doors once again over the next three months.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am grateful for everything that has been said on the subject of Ukraine.
However, we must keep our eye on the ball.
Events in the next two months will determine whether the fruits of the Orange Revolution will be able to ripen fully, or whether they will fall to the ground unripe.
Ukraine needs much more Europe over the next two months.
It is vital for the European institutions to make themselves felt there.
We must have a constant dialogue with Ukraineâs leaders and society.
A pro-European front has to be created in Ukraine.
There is unprecedented Russian involvement in the events currently taking place in Ukraine.
Gas has been used as a weapon.
A new constitution is to come into being, and the next parliament will decide if Ukraine is to go full steam towards Europe or go its own way, as it so often has in the past.
We must encourage the leaders of political parties fighting to be represented in the parliament to form a strong pro-European front, so we can count on a good partner for the next four years.
Â Â  Mr President, the implication of Mr Wurtzâs question to Mr Solana as to what had improved in the last two years is that decisive improvements in the state of the world are in some way within the power of the European Union to decide upon and bring into effect.
Those who wanted to see a multipolar world with the might of its only superpower reduced can hardly be surprised that this is the case.
What some Members have said tends to reflect their Eurocentric views and their disappointment at our place in this multipolar world.
I can do no other than bid them welcome to a world that has, alas, become no more pleasant for being multipolar and for being home to burgeoning new powers on a global and regional scale.
We Europeans are far from that badly off in this situation, and I join with those who have congratulated Mr Solana on reaching, with China and Russia, a joint decision on the issue of whether to make Iranâs nuclear ambitions a matter for the Security Council.
While I can only hope that that bears fruit, I am far from dissatisfied with the present approach.
Â Â  â In his opening remarks, Mr Solana alluded to certain events that took place last month and to certain challenges facing Europe, including the dispute over gas supplies from Russia, the elections in Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, the gloomy situation in Iraq, the crisis concerning Iranâs nuclear programme and the unresolved status of Kosovo.
All of these events and problems have one common thread: no European country, not even the very biggest, can handle such problems alone.
In other words, if we are to solve these problems we need to combine our strengths and to develop our common policies on foreign affairs, security and defence.
This is what politicians from many countries want, and, as previous speakers have said, what the people of Europe want, too.
Mr Brokâs report, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, refers to progress in the area of common foreign and defence policy, but also mentions a number of problems such as Parliamentâs inadequate involvement in the process of drawing up foreign policy.
I should therefore like to call on the Council to abide by ArticleÂ 21 of the Treaty on European Union and always to consult Parliament at the start of the year on its progress and plans, rather than simply presenting summaries from the previous year.
Â Â  Mr President, let me come back to a few questions that have been mentioned.
The most important issue, as many of you have said, is that today we need a stronger Europe in foreign policy.
In order to get a stronger Europe in foreign policy we have to work together.
We have to work together particularly on those topics that are now very topical.
One of them mentioned by many of you was that of energy policy.
As I have said before, we are working on that at the moment.
That means, of course, that we should have a better conducted energy policy, if not a common external one.
I know we have to head for this at the very least, and we already have quite a lot of valuable instruments with which to do so, including political dialogues and specific energy dialogues.
Then there are multilateral dialogues: we have to bring in OPEC; we have to speak more with OPEC and with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
As I said, the strategy of diversification will be crucial for all of us.
We have to look into the integration into the European energy market of the energy markets of our neighbouring countries, following the example of the South East European Energy Community, for instance.
We also have a lot of financial instruments to encourage energy topics to come together.
The security of energy supply, as I have mentioned before, is crucial.
Therefore I can promise you that we are working on it and as soon as the communication is out, we will come back to that.
As Mr Rasmussen mentioned, it is also very important to see pre-emptive diplomacy.
That is crucial. I agree with that.
Of course, such diplomacy sometimes needs patience.
You cannot eradicate poverty from one day to the next; you cannot work on all the different kinds of crisis management or even post-crisis management and have a change immediately.
For that we need a sustainable and cohesive way forward.
Migration is another very important new topic on foreign policy.
Again, we will all have to work together with the countries of origin, with the transition countries, with the European Union to find the right way of balancing out an internal and an external policy.
The fight against terrorism; the fight against drugs: all of that will take us many years, but these battles will increasingly have to be fought from a united front.
Weapons of mass destruction; the support for democracy, the rule of law and free and fair elections: this is all mentioned in our neighbourhood policy, so of course we will also take that very seriously.
We have a positive incentive on that in our Barcelona programme, for instance, but we also need every support so as to be able to make real progress with this policy.
Strategic partnerships with major powers, such as trans-Atlantic relations; relations with China, India, Brazil; and the very good relations with Latin America: these are all important because here we have the possibility to work together in a multilateral framework, also working with the United Nations, as has been said.
Of course, it is also is important that we are able to combine the work for our common values in the multilateral strategy.
The neighbourhood policy is an important part of the security strategy, because we really try to export stability by working together with Ukraine, the Southern Caucuses and the Mediterranean countries.
Therefore we have high aspirations to make Europe safer; we know we have many challenges ahead, but I do not see another way forward other than trying to enhance all our instruments and work for a common Europe built on common values together with the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, although I am unable, in the short space of time available to me, to revisit in detail all the many issues that have been mentioned in this debate, there are a few points I would like to address which I, as a representative of the Council, regard as important.
The High Representative was the first to say â and many of you echoed him â that there is a global demand for European foreign policy.
It is also something that matters to the European public, and we â that is the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament â must join together in working to meet that need; as MrÂ Watson said earlier, we must build the European Union on a foundation of values, and that is very obviously and specifically the case in foreign policy, where we have to be exemplary if we want to bring peace and stability to the world.
I can only agree with that wholeheartedly and assure you that the Austrian Presidency, like the presidencies that preceded it and those that will follow it, is committed, during its six months in office, to the values of the protection of human rights, to the fundamental freedoms, and also, to echo what Mr Geremek said, to what is generally termed âhuman securityâ â the striving for health, the campaign against weapons and rearmament.
The European Unionâs foreign policy is a peaceful one; we are not, in that sense, a military power.
Pre-emptive diplomacy is the essential thing.
Within our commitment to multilateralism, we endeavour to act in line with the United Nations Charter and in accordance with international law.
That is the only way we can maintain our credibility in the eyes of the world.
I would like to comment briefly on some of the issues that have been raised.
In response to the many speakers who mentioned energy policy, I would like to add to what was said by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
It goes without saying that the Commission is playing a quite essential and important role in this area, and the Council Presidency is working in very close cooperation with it.
The issue of a European energy policy will be a quite central one at the European Council in March, for which the British Presidency has already laid the foundation stone.
We want to continue what it has started.
Reference has also been made in this debate to the security of energy supply, which is a quite crucial issue, which involves the diversification of energy sources and networks, as well as the reduction of one-sided dependency on energy suppliers and networks and, in particular, the support for, and active promotion of, renewable energy and alternative energy sources.
This is, of course, a matter to which we will devote our attention.
Russia has been mentioned again and again in this context; the European neighbourhood policy in general terms and the European policy in relation to Russia are both of quite fundamental importance.
Russia is an important partner, and, in maintaining a dialogue with it, we need to highlight the values of which I have spoken; it goes without saying that human rights are another issue that needs to be raised with Russia, and they are, in a very wide-ranging dialogue.
I do believe, though, that we must be aware of the fact that Russia is just as important a strategic partner for the European Union as is the United States.
I am most especially grateful to Mrs Beer for raising the subject of the Balkans, as did Mr Solana in his introduction.
The Austrian Council Presidency will, over its six months in office, be regarding the Western Balkans as having the utmost priority in the interests of the stability of the region and hence in the interests of peace and stability in Europe.
Something else said on the subject of European foreign policy was that we should concentrate primarily on our own neighbours.
That is what we are doing, and it is important that we should do so, but there is, in todayâs world, no crisis or situation that does not also touch upon the interests and stability of the European Union; that is what makes the European Union a global player, and that, too, is why it must equip itself with the resources needed to perform that role.
Today, the High Representative is tireless â in the truest sense of the word â in jetting around the world in the service of peace, and he does so in the interests of a credible European foreign policy, in our own interests, and also in the interests of stability and peace in Europe.
I would now like to address an issue that is of particular importance to the general public and is also among the priorities for the Austrian Presidency of the Council.
By that I mean the protection of European citizens in third countries, for which, as recent events and crises have already demonstrated, we in the European Union bear responsibility.
The Austrian Presidency of the Council wants to help make consular cooperation better organised to protect citizens when they are abroad and also to equip it with the proper resources.
Finally, let me turn to what was said about China.
The only thing I want to say about the arms embargo is that there is at present, as you will be aware, no consensus in the Council on this.
The issue is not on the agenda, but, quite apart from how this decision may turn out, it is a matter of principle for the Council and for European foreign policy that there will be no increase in the quantity of arms exported to China.
Â Â  . Mr President, I just want to close very briefly, because much of what I said in general terms was a repetition of what we think.
We are trying to repeat in different words what the majority of people think about the foreign policy of the European Union.
I would prefer, instead of going through a litany of topics every time we meet, that we try to concentrate on some of the topics and go deeper.
At the end of the day we have gone through the all the worldâs problems in two hours or so, with I do not know how many speakers.
We want to make this debate useful.
For that I thank Mr Watson for his good recommendation that I appear less on television and come here instead.
I promise you that every time I go on television I will call you beforehand, so you can take note of how much time I spend on television and how many hours I spend here!
So take note of that!
But having said that nicely and kindly to my good friend, I would like, if possible, to organise a debate so that we can go deeper into the topic, which is very important.
I shall try to concentrate on a small number of topics, which are very important.
We can talk about common foreign policy, but if we fail, it will not be common foreign policy.
We may as well just close down if we fail.
Look at the Balkans: if we are not ready and willing to get the Balkans right, we can talk about Iran, we can talk about whatever you want, but we will fail, and I do not want to fail.
Therefore, you will always find me working.
That is what I am trying to do and that is what I will continue to do.
Thank you for the kind words some of you said about my work.
Thanks also to those who do not appreciate it.
I would also like to thank LeÃ¯la Shahid for the kind words she has said about me over the last few days when I defend, and as she should defend, the position of President Abu Mazen, whom we should try to help as much as we can.
I think he is the most important person we should now support.
On the other issues let us see how things happen.
In the coming hours we will probably have some very important decisions to take.
I will be ready and willing, if time permits and you are ready to come, to make a statement to explain if something of great importance happens.
Mr President, I leave it to you.
If you want to take it up, do so.
If you do not, then do not.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  We now come to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the Palestinian elections, the situation in the Middle East and the decision by the Council not to make the report on East Jerusalem available to the public.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a great deal has already been said under item 4 on the order of business about the elections in Palestine, the consequences resulting from them, and the way forward in their aftermath, I would like to raise a number of points that were the theme of the Council meeting on Monday.
The first thing to be said â and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs De Keyser and all the Members who have participated in observing this election â is that the elections went according to plan. Everyone is agreed on that, and I believe that they were an unambiguous and democratic expression of the popular will.
That is beyond question.
The response from the Presidency and practically all the foreign Ministers of the European Union Member States was immediate, and they acted independently of each other, in a manner indicating that they were, in essence, guided by the same principles.
I would refer the House also to the statements made by the Middle Eastern Quartet between 26 and 30 January, which make it clear that the international community continues to regard a lasting and peaceful solution of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as conditional upon non-violence, the acknowledgement of Israelâs right to exist, and compliance with all current bilateral obligations.
It was and is particularly important that the statements by the Council and the Member States of the European Union were almost indistinguishable from those made by our partners in the Quartet.
What both the Quartet and the European Union expect of any future Palestinian government is an unambiguous commitment to the principles I have enumerated, and they stress that international support for the new Palestinian Autonomous Authority will very definitely be conditional upon adherence to these principles.
Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority have again been reminded of the obligations imposed on them by the Roadmap, and, in taking this line, the Quartet has received substantial backing from the Council, which also expects of the newly-elected Palestinian Legislative Council that it will endorse a government committed to the principles of a peaceful and negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel founded upon agreements already reached and on the Roadmap, to the rule of law, to reforms and to proper management of its finances.
If all these things are in place, the European Union will be prepared to continue to support the Palestinians in their economic development and in their building of a democratic state.
To come to decisions at the present time would be premature, and, as we cannot do that, we must instead spell it out loud and clear that the European Union, like the other partners that are making their own contributions, is prepared to continue giving its support subject to certain conditions being met.
This debate was, of course, originally prompted by the subject of East Jerusalem, and I would now like to say a few things with specific reference to that.
What emerged from the previous debate was the very clear expectation that the European Union should take an even-handed approach, with a coherent policy in the Middle East that is guided not merely by the interests of either Israel or the Palestinians, but for which balance is an absolute requirement.
The European Union is, moreover, concerned about Israelâs activities in and around East Jerusalem, including the continuing settlement and extension of the dividing wall, as well as the destruction of Palestiniansâ homes.
These activities are contrary to international law, make a final settlement of the Jerusalem issue less likely and threaten to make impossible a solution founded upon the coexistence of two viable states.
These considerations have prompted the Council to ask the relevant Council offices to produce for the EU a detailed analysis of the East Jerusalem situation, drawing on data supplied by the EUâs missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah.
However, the Council decided on 12 December, in view of the change in the situation, notably the prospect of elections to the Knesset in Israel, not to publish this study, but instead to inform high-ranking representatives of the Israeli Government of the European Unionâs concerns in this area.
Since then, there have been two â one by the EU troika to the Israeli foreign ministry on 19Â December and another by the presidency to the principal Israeli political parties on the 23rd of that month.
The European Union has noted with approval the decision by Israel to allow some voting to take place in East Jerusalem, which will contribute to the successful conduct of the elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, as we mentioned in the previous debate, we are indeed faced with a new reality.
On Monday, the EU Foreign Ministers and the Quartet met to discuss our reaction to the entry of Hamas into the Palestinian national political arena, and the implications for our assistance to the Palestinian Authority.
Let me bear three elements in mind.
The first are our principles, which should be absolutely clear.
We supported these elections by providing financial support of 18.5Â million EUR.
In addition, we have heard about 240Â election observers under Mrs De Keyserâs great leadership.
We also demonstrated our commitment to building democratic institutions.
I think this is clearly a principled position.
Should we now abandon this position today because we do not like the result of the elections? I think that would also clearly be a mistake.
On the contrary, we should call for all to respect the outcome of a democratic election.
When I visited Gaza, I clearly said that we were ready to work with a government that seeks peace by peaceful means.
As the Quartet reiterated, that means cooperation, a clear commitment to non-violence, a recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous commitments including the roadmap and the Oslo agreement.
Secondly, the responsibilities: the ball is now in the camp of the Palestinian leaders.
It is their responsibility to behave like partners and to meet the criteria set by the international community.
It is not yet clear how Hamas, under its change and reform platform, will exercise the responsibilities that a new Palestinian government will need to assume.
This will take time to become apparent.
In both these discussions, I have advocated a clear message from the international community as to what we expect.
I have also said that the European Commission stands ready to work with any government that is really seeking peace by peaceful means.
However, we are mindful of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, which are indeed considerable.
We are also mindful of the legitimate Palestinian aspirations for statehood.
We must bear in mind that donor funding is crucial in alleviating the plight of ordinary Palestinians and in preventing the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism.
But we are also mindful of our own commitment to a two-state solution and to Israelâs security needs.
Therefore, first and foremost, we expect future members of a Palestinian government to commit to these three principles.
This applies to the EU-Palestinian Interim Association Agreement.
This clearly states that freedom of democracy, the rule of law and human rights have to be respected.
In addition, the Neighbourhood Action Plan also clearly provides that the roadmap has to be the path to peace.
While the conduct of Hamas, as an organisation, will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny, the new Palestinian government must in the first instance be judged on its actions, including the provision of security and stability.
The stabilisation of public finances is a major and immediate challenge.
I am ready to be constructive in reacting to the fiscal problems of the Palestinian Authority â especially now for the interim government and for the caretaker government â by easing their liquidity problems.
But others, too, must play their role.
This includes Israel, which has been called upon to continue to transfer customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority.
I, as well as other Quartet members, will also personally speak to the Israelis about this issue.
The role of the Palestinians themselves, will also be crucial.
The World Bank is sending a mission to see what it can do and how the Palestinian Authority could meet the benchmarks, maybe retrenching the budget.
They have to find a possibility of lifting the suspension on World Bank Trust Fund payments.
USD 35Â million are still lying there.
They have not been disbursed because they could not be disbursed.
I hope I can count on the support of Parliament to find a short-term solution.
However, it will also be important for the new government to get essential reforms back on track.
This should be done in the same spirit as when we worked with the Palestinian Authority in the past.
In the meantime, the Commission intends to continue those aid programmes which provide for the basic needs of the Palestinians, including the infrastructure facility, food aid and humanitarian and refugee assistance.
In closing let me say that the peace process is â as we all know â at a very critical juncture.
The year 2005 was dominated by unilateral Israeli actions and Palestinian institutional paralysis.
The international community must now provide a tangible perspective of progress, using our efforts on both sides, with the Israelis and with the Palestinian Authority.
In this context, I agree, we have to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas and his authority in order to provide stability and demonstrate that the negotiations will bring positive results.
It is for this reason that I would like to underline the importance of avoiding all unilateral actions which threaten to prejudice final status negotiations, including terrorist attacks, settlement expansions and the routing of the separation barrier.
Now, therefore, we have to work together very closely: the days and months ahead will be absolutely crucial in determining stability in the Middle East, as well as our own stability.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was my privilege to be the chairman once again of the largest elected observation mission to the elections in Palestine: that of the European Parliament.
At the outset I would like to thank the other 26Â Members of the European Parliament on the delegation for their work, particularly my deputy chairman, Mrs Napoletano, and, of course Mrs de Keyser, in her capacity as chief observer of the European Unionâs team.
I would also like to thank the staff of the European Parliament who came with us and who did an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances.
Last week on the streets of Palestine we heard the clamour for choice and change.
We heard the noise of democracy.
We found out, as one of my colleagues put it, that the process was perfect.
Voters went freely to the polls, men, women, young and old.
The polling stations, usually in schools and administered by teachers, were efficient and well organised.
By and large the Israeli forces kept out of the way.
The process was perfect and there is no doubt that the result reflected the wish of the people, but the product more reflects their despair of Fatah than their love of Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas people we met were not very loveable.
Not just in Palestine, but elsewhere in the Arab world â including in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood did so well in November and December; in the Moroccan parliamentary elections to come â we are about to see the emergence of fundamentalist Islamist politics across the Arab world, an Arab world of 250Â million people.
That is the challenge to all our institutions.
We must work together, because in my view, although we imparted the process of democracy, we did not impart the values of democracy that we are so used to in the European Union.
Democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the protection of minorities: these are the values we need to impart.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, my first thoughts go to the members of the mission who are still on the ground.
I have received many words of thanks that I should like to share with them: they did an extraordinary job.
I also received a great deal of help from the Council, from MrÂ Marc Otte, who was there in Palestine, and from Jeanette.
However, I should like to thank you, in particular, Commissioner.
You had to guide me through some difficult decisions.
I will mention two of them.
Firstly, the deployment of our mission to Gaza amid hazardous security conditions.
From the beginning, we were the only observation mission deployed in Gaza.
Next, the delicate decision, Commissioner, to meet the candidates of âChange and Reformâ, Hamasâ list of candidates.
Obviously, we chose the candidates that we were going to meet; they were moderate candidates.
I should also like to say, however, that we were the only mission to meet candidates from the âChange and Reformâ party and that history proves us right to have done so, since 44% of the Palestinian population voted in favour of them.
I should now like to point out that we are faced with three challenges.
The first challenge â which I too find difficult â is to respect the Palestinian peopleâs choice, which was, as MrÂ McMillan-Scott said, one in favour of change and not necessarily of radical Islamism.
It is not a case of all Palestinians, or indeed of half of the population, having become radical Islamists.
They want change both inside and outside Palestine, together with the peace that is a long time coming.
The second challenge, Commissioner, is not to give in to the temptation of unilateralism in the quest for peace.
Not since the time of Yitzhak Rabin have we seen any hint of bilateralism in the decisions and negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
The withdrawal from Gaza was a unilateral decision.
The presence of Hamas in the Palestinian Government today would strengthen that unilateralism and would not lead to peace.
I hope that the European Union will work along those lines.
The third challenge consists of making a distinction, irrespective of the circumstances, between the Palestinian Government, which will have to face up to its responsibilities, and the Palestinian people, which cannot be taken hostage on account of the choice it has made.
Admittedly, the people made this choice, but it has basic needs that we will have to ensure are met whatever the future holds; otherwise we will be heading for a catastrophe.
To conclude, let me tell you what a Palestinian woman said to me just after the elections.
In response to my question: âare you not afraid of being governed by Sharia law?â she said: âNo, we were not afraid of saying no to the Israelis, who are stronger than us.
We were not afraid of saying no to Fatah because it let us down.
We will be able to say no to Hamas if it subsequently lets us downâ.
There you have the entire lesson in parliamentary democracy that the Palestinians have completely understood.
Â Â  . Madam President, elections are like a picture.
In fact, they are like an x-ray of a society at a precise moment in time.
These elections are a call for realism for all of us and a call for an end to hypocrisy in the international community.
Millions of Palestinians are desperate.
They have nothing to lose and they vote for those who promise any change, any reform, and an end to corruption.
We speak too much about the Middle East and too little about the real situation of men, women, children and elderly people who, along with their families, are desperate.
We must respect this will.
We must deliver a message of respect to this new majority.
It must, however, be combined with a message pointing out that our support is conditional upon the end of violence, violent resistance and terrorism.
But we must respect the will of the people.
Let us not pretend we will keep showing the same movie and keep the same script, but simply change one of the characters.
That would be a recipe for failure.
We are faced with a new scenario that requires new proposals, a new commitment and new pressures on both sides.
The current situation has arisen precisely because we have not done this.
There must be new pressure on both sides of the conflict.
We must search for peace, but we must never forget that we are talking about real people.
Â Â  Madam President, I believe that the European Unionâs mediating role is more necessary now than ever.
Now would be the worst possible time to abandon the region and the Palestinian people, and at the same time we should learn the appropriate lessons.
What have we learnt from our involvement in the region and our aid to the Palestinian people?
What have we learnt from saying for years that the solution was elections and democracy, that they were a step forwards and a condition for peace, when we are now seeing that those elections have become a problem rather than a solution?
I have heard no self-criticism from the Council or the Commission with regard to what we have done wrong, after investing billions of euros.
I believe that this Hamas victory reflects a situation in which Israeli policy has managed to realise a self-fulfilling prophecy.
For years they have said: there is no Palestinian partner for peace.
Well, in the end that is precisely what they have achieved.
The European Union must now make it abundantly clear that, if Hamas wants to continue, it must accept the rules of the game and the agreements already reached by the Palestinian Government, it must recognise Israel and it must disband its militias.
And at the same time we must work very hard to open up a prospect for peace.
One of the fundamental reasons for Hamasâs victory is that there is no hope, there is no hope of a definitive agreement in the Middle East.
Furthermore, the Palestiniansâ quality of life has continued to deteriorate year after year.
The Quartetâs commitments on the ground to improve the well-being of the Palestinians have progressed at a snail's pace, very slowly, and the complicated procedures and obstacles have not been convincingly overcome.
I believe that we must mediate and work as we have never done before to open up this prospect for peace.
Â Â  â Madam President, first of all I too should like to take my turn in thanking VÃ©ronique de Keyser and Eduard McMillan-Scott for the effort they made, together with the other MEPs, during their mission.
The election count confirmed Hammas as the first political power and this result must be respected.
At the same time, the result should not come as a surprise. It is the consequence of numerous factors both local and international.
The Palestinians, despite the pronouncements of the West, have unfortunately not yet seen the objective of creating their own independent state being promoted.
However, they have seen the racist policy of the wall and settlement being legalised.
The result constitutes a message both to the Palestinians themselves and to the international community, especially us, about our inadequate policy, which failed to exert pressure on Israel to apply the road map and the UN resolutions in order to promote a political process and was content merely to support the Palestinians financially.
Unfortunately, I am not sure if we were able to receive these messages, given that today a resolution which is one-sided and unilateral is being promoted in the European Parliament.
Our reaction to the new government cannot be to stop efforts to restart the peace process, as announced by the United States.
At the same time, Hammas needs to denounce violence, recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist and cooperate with President Abbas in continuing the peace process.
At the same time, reconfirmation is needed, both by the European Union and by the other members of the Quartet, of the undertaking to create an independent Palestinian state next to the state of Israel with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is reaping what it has sown: the billions lavished on Palestine â money that has been ill used and not properly accounted for â have resulted in the Hamas tsunami.
A terrorist organisation has thus come to power, one whose declared strategic aim â as confirmed by the countless ambiguities with which the organisationâs leaders answered our questions during the mission â is the creation of a state, waving goodbye to peace, human rights, and the rights of women and religious minorities.
Hamas has given us a very clear response by rejecting all the requests made by the Middle East Quartet.
The Socialist International, through MrÂ Schulz, has already said that it is in favour of negotiating with Hamas, although it has never spoken out against the scandalous use of the aid given to the Palestinian Authority.
The truth is, however, that anyone who bets on Hamas becoming in any way more moderate is handing Palestine to the extremists for good, and that is a destiny that the brave, humble, intelligent, hard-working Palestinian people certainly do not deserve.
Â Â  Madam President, quite apart from the question as to whether or not the notorious report by the European diplomats is official in nature, we have to conclude that the effect of this document, which has been the subject of much debate, is, if nothing else, to provide yet more evidence of the far too one-sided pro-Palestinian stance of the official bodies of the European Union.
The European representatives constantly claim, as Bismarck did, to be honest brokers, but in reality, they mainly defend Palestinian demands, which is detrimental to the EUâs independence.
While we are at it, we might as well own up to the fact that the many billions of European tax money that have been channelled to the Palestinian Authority over the past few years by way of aid, have mainly served to support a wholly corrupt regime.
I have put many questions about this to the Council and Commission, which have each time been rebuffed, and now we are left dealing with the consequences.
The corrupt have been wiped away by the election victory of the terrorist Islamic movement Hamas.
The EUâs responsibility in this respect is crushing.
Â Â  Madam President, although the recent results of the Palestinian elections hardly inspire optimism, I believe that one of the greatest mistakes the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, could make, would be to rush to hasty conclusions.
What I do believe we can say without any mistake is that the presence of the European Unionâs electoral observation mission has been a notable success for the European Commission and that â as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said â it increases the Unionâs visibility and contributes to the consolidation of democracy throughout the world.
We must therefore congratulate the Commission and also our fellow Members Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser, as well as the other Members of this Parliament who accompanied them.
Madam President, I believe that it would be premature to draw the conclusion that the spluttering peace process in the Middle East will be buried as a result of these elections or that these elections herald the death of the Oslo agreements.
I believe that we must allow a little time to pass and see what moves are made.
In particular, despite the mistakes made, we must treat the President of the Palestinian National Authority as a legitimate interlocutor, wait until the new government is formed, remembering â as Mrs De Keyser said â that 75% of the citizens who have voted for this political formation do not want the destruction of Israel and, finally, Madam President, assess what impact this electoral process will have on the Israeli elections.
Sooner or later, Commissioner, however, regardless of the urgent short-term issues, the European Union will have to give its opinion on something that is fundamental: whether the immense needs â as you have said â of the Palestinian people are compatible with the existence of Hamas, whose founding convention calls for the liquidation and destruction of the State of Israel, and the fact that it appears on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations.
In this regard, Madam President, the European Union's action must not show double standards: it must renounce terror and violence as a means of political action or renounce European Union action and aid.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ McMillan-Scott and MrsÂ De Keyser: the elections went smoothly in every way.
Over and above that, these are historic elections: this is the first democratic change in the Arab world.
The Palestinian people did not vote in favour of Hamas, it voted against Fatah.
Hamas won on the basis of a programme centred on the fight against corruption and on the reform of the PLO, the only organisation authorised to negotiate.
Above all, it won on the basis of a social programme to be implemented specifically within Palestine.
Those were my specific impressions when, away from our mission, I met the Palestinian mayors and their association, which is dominated by Hamas.
As for aid, we must continue helping the Palestinian people, make sure that officials are paid and, above all, prevent the State from collapsing, otherwise the Palestinian Authority will fall into the hands of another country.
It is imperative that we wait, ladies and gentlemen, but let us not become naively optimistic.
Read the Hamas Charter: it is despicable and disgraceful.
It must be rendered null and void so that the new government can become a discussion partner.
We have to set a date â a schedule â so that Hamas faces up to its responsibilities, because it has become a legitimate party in a democratic country.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I will be quick as I only have one minute in which to express my disappointment at seeing that, in this Chamber, our Parliament has chosen carefully to avoid âspeaking the truthâ.
There are six references, seven recitals and twelve articles in this text on the Palestinian election result, and not once do they manage to mention â even mention â Hamas and the Charter of hate underpinning its ideology and its action.
MrÂ Schapira just said how despicable â I think that that was the term used - the Charter is, and MrÂ Cohn-Bendit spoke of a repugnant charter.
Clearly, I share these opinions.
I would say that we deserve a Nobel âClichÃ©â Prize at a time when, despite the Charter, we have actually heard the Middle East Quartet, Europeâs ministers, the media and MrÂ Solana, only a few moments ago, asking themselves the crucial question: how can we cooperate with Hamas and continue providing our vital assistance to the Palestinians if Hamas does not renounce terror and does not recognise Israel?
Mahmoud Abbas, for his part, does not pull any punches when it comes to setting out his demands faced with the Islamists.
Yes, the ballot was democratic â at least in terms of the way in which it was carried out.
Yes, Hamas won.
Yes, we want to continue helping the Palestinian Authority.
Yes, in the end it is up to Hamas today to take the crucial decisions and to change.
This is what needed to be said no less clearly and directly to the pragmatists on both sides: a democratic ballot has just brought to power an undemocratic ideology.
That is the persistently difficult equation that we need to resolve today.
Â Â  Madam President, the election in Palestine was conducted in an exemplary fashion.
I should like to congratulate the Palestinians and say a big thank you to my colleagues.
There are still problems in Israel and Palestine, however.
Palestine is occupied.
The fact is highlighted in a list of UN resolutions, which criticise Israelâs ongoing breaches of international law, as well as the settlements, the dreadful Wall and the attempt to annex East Jerusalem â just to mention the worst problems.
The difficult situation in Palestine is mentioned in the common motion for a resolution, which contains a number of constructive points.
The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas.
We must keep a careful watch to ensure that Hamas does not again have recourse to terrorism, it now having kept the peace for more than a year.
Certainly, we must not take away the right they have under the Geneva Convention to armed resistance to the occupation, but we must make determined and carefully considered efforts to ensure that the situation does not get out of control.
All non-governmental groups should be disarmed both in Palestine and among the Israeli settlers.
We must discourage any form of radicalisation in both Palestine and Israel.
The motion for a resolution that is before us might well be read as a unilateral recognition and, if we are to help bring about peace, that would of course be dangerous.
I would therefore call on Members to vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, especially the amendment to paragraph 10, which contains a very clear formulation of the Councilâs decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem, prepared by the Heads of Delegation in Palestine.
Once this reportâs criticism of the situation in East Jerusalem, together with the attendant recommendations, have been clearly withdrawn, the motion for a resolution will be a tool well suited to making further progress towards a just peace between Israel and Palestine.
I would call on us to be consistent now.
We do not have sufficient credibility among the Palestinians, and it is time we did so.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say how grateful I am to the Commission, as well as to MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser, MrÂ McMillan-Scott and our whole delegation, for their sensitivity and intelligence.
I believe, however, that the failure to publish the report on East Jerusalem â which in actual fact is the focus of the debate â and the failure to adopt appropriate measures effectively gave Hamas a helping hand, because there is no doubt that certain truths should not be left unspoken.
I think it was on the cards that Hamas would win.
Much of the responsibility for that lies with the international community, which, after the Oslo agreements were signed, was incapable of ensuring that international law would prevail and be respected.
Thus it neither implemented the âtwo peoples, two statesâ principle, nor guaranteed Mahmoud Abbas sufficient support, since funding alone is not enough â what the Palestinians want is political support.
Nor did it, at the same time, exert the necessary pressure on Israel to prevent the growth of the settlements and the annexation of land.
In particular, although the international community had the strength needed to exert pressure, I feel that it did not succeed in ensuring that negotiations would effectively be resumed.
Nonetheless, the Palestinians managed to respond with a democratic electoral process in which the people did take part, expressing their need for life, justice and peace.
For me as a woman, the Hamas victory is a terrible outcome; I see it almost certainly, however, as a protest vote against al-Fatah, which held sway over Palestinian society for many years but was unable to keep its promises, and also against corruption, although that is a somewhat demagogical issue.
In my view, it really is the European Commissionâs and the international communityâs task to rekindle the dialogue and to keep it alive, thus ensuring that both Hamas and Israel can put a stop to violence and acknowledge the âtwo peoples, two statesâ principle in practice.
Â Â  Madam President, Hamas is evil: it is responsible for some of the most vile terrorist attacks ever witnessed.
The fact that it now has attracted a democratic mandate does not alter or dilute its terrorist persona.
Coming from Northern Ireland, I can speak from an experience of a like terrorist organisation â the IRA â also securing an electoral base.
There, fundamental mistakes were made in the hope of encouraging them away from the paths of terror.
The values of democracy were distorted, unwarranted concession after concession was made, but as each was pocketed, new demands appeared.
That is how terrorist organisations think and work, as they fight their long, multi-faceted war.
I therefore urge that a firm and resolute stand be taken, with no fudging and no budging from the principle that no aid can flow from the EU to an authority run by the terrorists of Hamas.
Bend that rule and we and democracy will be the losers.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must have a basic goal for establishing peace in the Middle East and for combating terrorism, including by political means.
That goal is to guarantee both the existence and security of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state.
Significant steps have recently been made in that direction, thanks to the work of Ariel Sharon and Abu Mazen.
Is the electoral success of Hamas likely to be a setback for us?
Is it likely to turn Palestine into a new theocratic, fundamentalist regime?
The words of Mahmoud Zahar, the Hamas spokesman, who promised a new Palestinian Government without secular members because âthey bring in AIDS and homosexualityâ, certainly do not bode well, and nor do other statements about Israel.
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard, through strong political initiatives to force Hamas to keep to the path that has already been embarked upon.
Europe will have to make the new government realise that if it were to think of threatening Israelâs existence it would lose the funds intended for Palestine.
If Hamas chooses the path of intolerance, it will cause its people great harm and have a negative effect on the outcome of the Israeli elections.
Let us therefore support Abu Mazen and welcome the idea of his visiting the European Parliament.
Let us also stand up for the rights of Christian Palestinians: they are a minority threatened with extinction in the Middle East, but are an important factor for peace and stability.
Let us work confidently so that the ideas of Anwar Zaboun, who said that negotiations with Israel are , or forbidden by religion, do not prevail.
I am certain that the Palestinian people do not see things in that way.
Â Â  Madam President, the new Palestinian parliament is one that has emerged from elections that the international community has internationally recognised.
We respect this result and will support President Abu Mazen as he tries to put together a government that will be strong in its defence of international law and in its opposition to violence.
It therefore appears perverse that the threat should today be made to turn off the flow of European funding to the Palestinian Authority.
If that were to happen, there would be a risk of aggressive states and groupings taking the EUâs place and of unemployed Palestinian soldiers and police officers being recruited by Al-Qaeda.
Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, on 13Â June 1980, at the Venice Summit, the EC recognised the PLO.
It went on, through dialogue, to guide what had once been a terrorist organisation along the path that led to it recognising Israelâs right to exist and participation in the peace process.
Hamasâ election victory now presents us with a similar challenge.
It is worthy of note that the USA, before the elections, made it known that there had to be talks with Hamas, despite its being on the list of terrorist organisations.
The European Parliament must now make its own constructive contribution and, as soon as possible, invite a delegation from the newly-elected Palestinian Assembly to Brussels, for it is now that confidence-building measures â rather than threatening gestures â are urgently called for.
Â Â  Madam President, in the past weeks we have seen the cycle of contrasts and contradictions that has come to characterise the EUâs relationship with the Middle East.
We call for legitimacy and transparency from our partners, yet we suppress the truth when it legally obliges us to act.
We facilitate democratic elections in Palestine, yet we question the peopleâs voice when we hear it.
We aid the corrupt Fatah for years, yet within days we doubt the stated humanitarian intentions of the participants of the coming new Palestinian Authority.
We doubt the new Palestinian Authorityâs wish to build bridges of confidence and cooperation, yet we overlook Israelâs continued construction of the separation barrier.
We rightly fund democratic institutions in Palestine, yet we impede the right to self determination of the people annexed in East Jerusalem.
We rightly call on Hamas to renounce violence or face consequences, yet stand by while the Israeli army shoots innocent children in Gaza and Ramallah with no consequence.
We rightly call for Hamas to recognise Israel, yet stay silent while Israel flouts international laws.
Fundamentally, Palestinians ask: is the EU about democracy or suppression?
Is the EU about bridges or barriers?
Is the EU about respect or defiance of international law?
Hamasâ decision to swap bullets for ballots potentially marks a strategic shift that could lead to talks with Israel.
The EU must match that shift and demonstrate the crucial equality and equity required to the creation of a Palestinian state, living in peace with Israel.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we must stop at once the flow of money to Palestine, where Hamas has taken power.
This is clearly a terrorist movement, which does not recognise the state of Israel, which does not want to disarm and which lives by Sharia law.
How will Hamas make use of EU taxpayersâ money?
Will it burn out peopleâs eyes, stone women or cut off peopleâs hands?
How many people will Hamasâs weapons kill?
Ladies and gentlemen, we must admit that the Union has to take its fair share of the blame for the powder keg of the Middle East, having buried its head in the sand and pursued an ambiguous policy.
I am Czech and my country was one of the first to supply weapons to the new state of Israel in 1948, so that they could defend their territory.
At the time, the current EU Member States expressed horror at the holocaust and supported the establishment of a Jewish state.
How have they acted since?
Whom has the Union unequivocally supported â Israel or Palestinian terrorists?
Please let us put a stop to this double-speak and say loudly and clearly that Hamas, which for a number of years has been receiving money indirectly from the Union, pursues iniquitous policies, and that EU citizens will not pay for them out of their taxes.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, here we are, reacting with astonishment to something that is actually self-explanatory: an election being won by a party that gave people the feeling that it cared about them, while the others could be written off as a crew of corrupt crooks.
There are conclusions that we have to draw from this.
We have to work even more to make EU aid visible, for by so doing we will get the message across to the public that peace and democracy are worth supporting.
I believe it is not just governments that need to hear that.
This election result is a disaster for the region.
One can certainly talk in terms of a five-year rhythm here: it was about ten years ago that Rabin died, and terrorist acts meant that Peres was not elected; five years later saw the start of the Intifada, and now here we are again.
Things keep starting over and over again from square one.
Even so, I do not believe that we should abandon hope of Hamas playing its part in development, but we do have to spell out the conditions under which that is possible.
If, on the basis of the seats won in the parliament, Hamas takes over the Palestinian Authority, it must agree to renounce violence, to acknowledge Israelâs right to exist and accept the agreements already reached, or else everything will have to start again from the ground up.
My hope is that this will happen before the Israeli elections, so that we can avoid the sort of adverse occurrences that would make it harder for us to get back together.
During this period, the quartet will need to make it clear that, if it works, financial aid will be forthcoming and security will be guaranteed.
It is for that reason that I am so glad that the quartet responded so quickly at the weekend.
I would also like to express my gratitude to MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser and her team and also to our parliamentary delegation, led by Mr McMillan-Scott, for their work.
Â Â  â Madam President, I too should like to take my turn and start by congratulating my honourable friends VÃ©roniqueÂ DeÂ Keyser and Edward McMillan-Scott on their important contribution to the monitoring of the Palestinian elections.
The Palestinian people voted in a democratic manner and I believe that all of us today should respect the democratic will of the Palestinian people and formulate the new European strategy based on the new political reality in the Middle East and Palestine.
Unfortunately Mr Solana is not here today for me to tell him that his statement a week before the Palestinian elections that economic aid to Palestine should be frozen if Hammas won was a very serious mistake.
This statement by Mr Solana was used by Hammas and basically functioned as a boomerang for the moderate Palestinian progressive forces.
This being so, I see a serious deficit in the European Union.
I have seen no statement, no declaration of awareness about the unilateral policy of the Israeli Government, I have seen no statement about the policy and decision by Mr Olmert to freeze the USD 50 million paid back to the Palestinian authority.
I have one thing to ask of the Commission: to request the prolongation of the truce by Hammas.
This is an important issue, rather than various conditions which are unilateral towards the Palestinian side.
Â Â  Madam President, I had the deepest misgivings about allowing an unreformed Hamas to run candidates for the Palestinian elections.
Perhaps the calculation of Mr Bush and others was that Hamas would not win, or that it would significantly modify its rhetoric and policies if brought into the electoral process.
I beg to differ.
Hamas remains a terrorist organisation with links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah.
It is committed to the extermination of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Indeed, its charter suggests it is committed to global Jihad, including using suicide bombers and establishing a theocracy and an Islamic caliphate everywhere.
Clearly, if it held these views anywhere in an EU Member State, it would have been banned as a political party.
I have always criticised the rampant corruption under Chairman Arafat and tried to investigate this in the last Parliament, but regrettably my working group findings were never debated in plenary.
We now see a massive protest vote by ordinary Palestinians.
Nevertheless, it is clear that an organisation banned as a terrorist organisation, such as Hamas, cannot be a legitimate interlocutor for the EU, nor receive a penny of our taxpayersâ money until it forswears violence and recognises the state of Israel.
I have always supported the security fence on the basis that it has saved human lives from the evil of suicide bombers.
It has, regrettably, truncated communities, but it does not constitute the final border of a future Palestinian state.
Nevertheless, a Hamas victory will make a land-for-peace deal much more difficult to realise.
Also, the final settlement of the East Jerusalem question, as well as the right of return questions, will be almost impossible with Hamas in government for the Palestinian Authority.
Â Â  Madam President, Hamasâs election victory is certainly not good news for democrats and progressives, nor for people on the left, but that victory has been the result of fair elections, and we must acknowledge that.
There is therefore one thing we must be pleased about: Hamas is now in the political game, and that is progress.
And in order to draw it further into the political game, we must be able also to incorporate it fully into the relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the European Union.
I would like to point out that the first time that a Hamas representative elected at these elections meets with the European Union may well be within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly which will take place on 26 and 27 March.
And then the new Israeli Members of Parliament following the elections in that country will come there.
Let us all therefore contribute in that shared forum to dialogue and a democratic modernisation of Hamas which will benefit everybody.
Â Â  Madam President, the statistics are clear: one more Hamas seat at national level means many more at district level.
People trust Hamas locally and we have to respect them in an intelligent, transparent and responsible way.
Do we have a plan to do so?
We have a strategy: non-violence, disarmament and the existence of Israel.
In relation to non-violence: if on the one day we have a declaration denouncing violence and the next we suffer a terrorist attack, what will we do then?
Hamas is a resistance movement.
If occupation continues, the government will not exclude violent resistance.
What will we do then?
In relation to the existence of the State of Israel: is beginning negotiations after the Israeli election enough?
In relation to disarmament: do we want to include Hamas militias in the Palestinian security and police forces?
Under which conditions?
Do we have any plans?
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is, of course, no doubt that mistakes were made in the past, but now is the time to look forwards.
The conclusions we come to must not be premature and the strategy for the next stage must be properly thought through.
In the course of the debate, it was said â and rightly â that we do still, of course have a partner in the person of President Abbas, who is someone with whom we can still talk and with whom we must continue to negotiate.
We can continue counting on him as a partner, for the new government neither will nor can alter the constitution that is coming into force.
We must not abandon hope; on the contrary, we must look to the future.
One thing is clear, though â the Council spelled it out on Monday, and so did the Quartet â and that is that there are principles from which we must not deviate, and let there be no doubt that among them are non-violence, recognition of Israelâs right to exist and the continuation of the peace process.
It has also been said, time and time again, that European policy must be even-handed, and with that I can only agree; indeed, it is a self-evident truth.
I also made clear in my introductory statement what the position of the Council is as regards our relationship with Israel and our criticisms of it.
What matters is that Europe should speak with one voice.
If we want to have any influence, we also need to speak in the same language as our partners in the Quartet, and that is important too.
I am particularly grateful to the Commission for having developed, with careful consideration and without undue haste, a strategy for helping the Palestinian people.
As was said by several participants in the debate, the Palestinian people have suffered a great deal and continue to do so, and we cannot let them down.
I know, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commissionâs policy with regard to them is a very good and very coherent one, and one in which we should give them our support.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen,
First of all let me thank you all for the kind words on the elections and the observations.
All credit goes to Mrs De Keyser and her team as well as to Mr McMillan-Scott and his team.
Credit also goes to the Palestinian people, who have shown that they can elect in a free and fair way, even if we are not always satisfied with the result.
We now have to agree to respect the will of the Palestinian people.
As we said in the Quartet statement, the Palestinians have now voted for change.
We know why.
At the same time, they desire peace.
Polls show that there is a slight majority in favour of peace with Israel.
This has to be the way forward.
We are ready to continue to support the Palestinian people.
We wish to do so, just as we have done until now.
There is no other organisation other than the European Union, and particularly the European Commission, that has done so much for the Palestinian people for years.
However, being elected and taking office is also a matter of political responsibility.
That is why we ask â and even expect â that a new Palestinian government confirm its commitment to peace through peaceful means, in particular though the three conditions that were mentioned in the Quartet statement: non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the respect of previous obligations, namely the Oslo agreement and the roadmap.
These clearly show a commitment to peace, to a two-state solution, but also to an ambitious reform agenda for the Palestinian Authority.
I very much wanted to mention this.
I would also like to say that the policy of the Quartet â and here we are really working together â is a very balanced one.
I heard a few Members say that we were one-sided: those who have not yet seen the latest Quartet statement should please look at it.
I would like to refer to the last paragraph where we say: âthe Quartet reiterates its commitment to the principles outlined in the roadmap and the previous statement, and reaffirms its commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict based upon UN Security Council resolutions Nos 242 and 338â.
I think this, per se, reflects our support for mutual obligations.
Let me reiterate that our first objective must now be to ensure that Israel transfers Palestinian tax revenues to the Authority.
More precisely, this is Palestinian money.
We do not think it would be constructive for Israel to withhold it at such a crucial time.
I will also speak to the Israeli Authorities about this and I know other colleagues in the Quartet will also do so.
I very much hope that funds will be transferred soon, because they would cover a good proportion of the salaries of the Palestinian Authority employees and would also provide much-needed income for the families.
That would be a humanitarian gesture that Israel could make at a crucial time.
I am also reassured by the President of the World Bank, who is of the same opinion.
I met Mr Wolfowitz yesterday in London.
Today he has been quoted as saying that âit will help the whole process if the life of the average Palestinian improves; we ought to be the last people to disengageâ.
I very much welcome this statement and hope it will help.
However, this is also why the members of the Arab League should honour their pledges of support as soon as possible.
Yesterday, at the London Conference for Afghanistan, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik and I both took every opportunity to talk to the different Arab representatives, in order to make that possible.
We therefore have to be very vigilant in this period.
It is a crucial period because we also have elections in Israel.
We want the peace process to be able to continue in the future.
I therefore invite Members to remain engaged with us.
Despite its difficulties, we would like to make the path to peace less bumpy in the future.
Â Â  Six motions for a resolution(1) for the closure of the debate have been submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â Having overcome its initial shock at the outcome of the Palestinian elections, Europe must now acknowledge the legality of the poll and the legitimacy of the new government and, indeed, welcome the high turnout of Palestinian citizens in the poll.
Only by showing complete trust and continuing to cooperate can we demand the necessary commitment from the new government to carry out the roadmap.
We must, of course, be more watchful, precisely because of the serious tensions that have arisen in recent years between the party now in power and so-called Western society, but I am sure that clenching our fists is not the way to eliminate that kind of friction.
On the contrary, Hamas needs to be given a chance to show that it can respect the commitment made more than once by President Abbas himself to stick to the schedule, to respect existing agreements and obligations and to pursue a negotiated settlement of the conflict with Israel.
Cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority is therefore not the solution.
What is needed â and we must not be moved on this â is for the monitoring system to be enhanced, including through greater international cooperation, so as to ensure that the resources are used exclusively for the economic, political and social development of Palestinian society, and not for the destruction of our own.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the EUâs position in relation to the government of Cuba, put by Graham Watson, Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, Emma Bonino and Marco Pannella on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0112/2005 â B6-0675/2005).
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ President-inâOffice of the Council, somewhat overshadowed by the dramatic events in the Middle East, there is, in Havana, a bearded dictator who has mocked the world for decades.
He rules over a country in which human rights are violated, in which the people live in great poverty and in which dissidents are imprisoned and persecuted.
After China, Cuba is the worldâs biggest prison for journalists.
In the spring of 2003, a wave of oppression swept over the island.
Leading figures in the democracy movement were arrested and, after farcical trials, 75 of them were sentenced to long prison terms.
Last year, a large group of young people were arrested as a preventative measure, the idea being that they might cause trouble.
That shows just how much fear there is on the island.
When, immediately before Christmas, the European Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize to the Ladies in White â the wives and daughters of the imprisoned dissidents â representatives of the movement were not allowed to leave the island in order to travel to Strasbourg.
Cuba is a horrendous dictatorship, and the facts I have just mentioned are well known.
In recent years, the situation has deteriorated.
For political prisoners, the situation is very serious.
My friend HÃ©ctor Palacios, who was given a 25-year prison sentence, is very ill, and the doctors fear for his life.
He is not receiving help for his high blood pressure and the complications surrounding his heart condition.
To cite another example, Adolfo Fernandez Seinz too â a journalist sentenced to 15 yearsâ imprisonment - is in poor health and has lost 20 kilos in weight since he was imprisoned.
Outside prison, dissidents too are being persecuted, for example the Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo JosÃ© PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as and the blind human rights activist Juan Carlos Gonzalez Leiva, who has been under house arrest since April 2004.
It is, of course, completely unacceptable that people should still be kept imprisoned in Cuba because of their views.
It is equally unacceptable that these prisoners should not receive the help they need when they are in a very poor state of health.
When, a year ago, the Council of Ministers made up its mind to change the common position it had had for many years and, instead, began to talk with the regime, it imagined it could see some kind of opening up in Cuba, with possibilities there.
A majority in this Chamber criticised that policy and, a year later, it has to be acknowledged that the policy has had no effect.
It was a wrong decision, and it should be reviewed.
What does the Council intend to do now in order to support the dissidents in Cuba?
How are we constructively to support the democracy movement and the Cuban people?
We must increase the pressure on Fidel Castro and, at the same time, find a strategic way of identifying the positive forces of democracy that exist.
Why is it so difficult to support the forces of democracy in Cuba when it is possible to do so in Belarus?
There is still an embarrassing kind of romanticism surrounding Castro.
I should very much like to have some answers from the Council to these questions.
Â Â  .
Madam President, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, the Council welcomes Parliamentâs ongoing interest in the improvement of the situation in Cuba, and we will be unstinting in our joint efforts at bringing about peaceful change there.
Let me quote from the common position arrived at in December 1996, which is still applicable, and states, among other things, that âThe objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.
A transition would most likely be peaceful if the present regime were itself to initiate or permit such a process.
It is not European Union policy to try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing the economic hardship of the Cuban people.â
With the aim of fostering peaceful change in Cuba, the European Union has entered into dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sections of Cuban society, in the course of which the Cuban authorities are regularly reminded of their fundamental responsibility as regards human rights, principally the free expression of opinion and the freedom of association.
Since there is no point in taking political action if it remains without any effect on people where they live, the Council has altered some practical details of its policy in order to make it really effective, particularly in stepping up dialogue with the peaceful opposition, which has given a very warm welcome to these close contacts.
Following on from the final conclusions of the Council of 31 January 2005, both the Luxembourg and British Presidencies and, above all, the European Unionâs delegation in Havana have reinvigorated relations with the opposition and with independent elements and have, in so doing, focused on essential medium-term issues associated with transition, including, for example, the development of dialogue with important members of the peaceful opposition with particular reference to their practical plans for the future, and on other means whereby independent organisations and those belonging to civil society may be supported.
At the same time, the Council has forthrightly condemned unacceptable conduct on the part of Cuban officialdom not only in the country itself but also to European politicians and visitors.
The presidency has raised the issue of access to ministries in Havana and made the Cuban Government aware of the fact that it can expect no dialogue if it refuses such access to embassies from the European Union and refuses to recognise or speak with representatives from the EU.
The Council has also underlined its willingness to continue with constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities, on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, concerning, , the grant of visas for visits by representatives of the governments concerned.
The Presidency of the European Union has given voice, in an official statement, to its regret at the action taken by the Cuban Government to prevent the so-called âLadies in whiteâ â from travelling to Strasbourg to receive the 2005 Sakharov Prize for intellectual freedom awarded to them by the European Parliament.
Such occurrences, like also the governmentâs refusal to allow Osvaldo PayÃ¡ to travel to take part in an NGOsâ forum on the free expression of opinion in December, make it clear that the Cuban authorities disregard their own citizensâ right to freedom of movement, as set out in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The Council also regrets the lack of further progress as regards the release of political detainees, and has denounced the detention, last summer, of more members of the peaceful opposition and the action taken by the Cuban authorities to restrict the free expression of opinion, freedom of assembly, and the freedom of the press.
The Council continues to demand of Cuba that it release all political detainees.
The EU has intervened in respect of the situation of those detainees who have protested against the condition under which they are being held by going on hunger strike.
Furthermore, and in conclusion, let me remind the House of the active and ongoing part played by the EU, with the open assistance of your House, in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, where it was, last year, one of the co-signatories of a resolution tabled on the subject of Cuba.
Â Â  . Madam President, Cuba is the only country in Latin America that is not linked to the European Union by means of an association or cooperation agreement.
This is not the fault of the European Union, nor of many Members of this Parliament, who have worked hard to preserve the channels for dialogue with the Cuban authorities and people.
Regrettable events, such as not allowing the Women in White to come to the European Parliament or the increased repression â as referred to in the text of the resolution that this Parliament will approve tomorrow â suffered by independent journalists and as recently condemned by Reporters without Borders, peaceful militants and human rights activists, demonstrate clearly that the most fundamental rights on that island are being systematically ignored.
The resolution therefore states that these events are frustrating our aspiration to improve relations between the European Union and Cuba, which is the main objective of the changes to the common position made in January 2005 by the Council, and calls upon the latter, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to act accordingly.
I would like to remind you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that when you approved the lifting of the measures that accompanied the Council's common position, you called for the immediate and unconditional release of the people who had been detained, and now their situation has worsened.
Madam President, Andrei Sakharov said that the voices that count most are often those that are not heard.
And I believe, Madam President, that this Parliament has once again had to speak out in this Chamber, which represents the citizens of Europe, in support of the cause of freedom and in order to defend, and expose the plight of, those people in Cuba who are fighting for their freedom and dignity.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our group is pleased that the context in which this debate on Cuba is taking place is likely to ensure a broad consensus for a motion for a resolution.
We have always believed that in this Parliament and in the Unionâs institutions there is a broad basis for agreement and for moving relations with Cuba in the right direction.
As a group, our position is very clear: firstly, in the current context, we can only confirm that the Cuban authorities have not sent out the hoped-for signals with regard to improving human rights in the country.
Secondly, we are not finding it possible to present the Sakharov Prize to the Women in White and we must therefore urge the Cuban authorities to allow this group to visit Europe in response to the European Parliamentâs invitation.
At the same time, I believe that we must call upon the President of Parliament to do everything in his power to ensure that the Prize is properly presented.
Nevertheless, our view is that, in the current climate of relations, the prospects for progress are better now than under the Councilâs previous policy, which led us up a blind alley, as did, to say the least, the policy which for decades insisted on sanctions and an embargo.
We believe that the Council's current policy should be maintained, with two objectives: firstly, to continue to call strongly for human rights to be respected in Cuba, the release of prisoners of conscience and of the peaceful opposition and respect for democratic freedoms and, secondly, to maintain and increase relations and dialogue with all of the political and social sectors in Cuba that are involved or interested in relations with Europe and the development of the country and the inevitable changes that we are going to see in Cuba in the near future.
Â Â  I agree that there are many alarm signals indicating that the Cuban regime is still implementing a policy of repression of dissident opinion, of arbitrary imprisonment of opposition groups, of constant harassment of anybody expressing opinions contrary to the government line.
Also of concern is the repression of sectors which have been stigmatised by the regime, such as homosexuals and certain intellectuals.
In the specific case we are dealing with, the regimeâs refusal to allow the Women in White to leave the country to receive the Sakharov Prize is a further example of this worrying situation.
Nevertheless, as has already been said, the policy of blockade and isolation to which Cuba has been subjected by several western powers for decades has only toughened the position of the hard-line sectors of the regime.
I am therefore pleased that, in June 2005, the Council of the European Union decided to offer Cuba an opportunity for political dialogue once again.
The intention here, amongst other things, was to begin to prepare the ground for what many of us hope will be an imminent transition to democracy.
Those of us who have endured a dictatorship know how difficult it is to create a democracy, especially when those people who should be your allies on the outside turn their backs on you.
In this regard, the appearance of more and more community, university and scientific groups, both in rural areas and in cities, within churches or in educational or social centres, groups that did not exist before and whose work may make a valuable contribution to political development in Cuba, is a hopeful sign.
The time has come for the Cuban regime to accept that their future does not lie in maintaining the status quo, but in tackling in a serious and credible way the transition which the Cuban people themselves, above all, are calling for.
We in the European Union must therefore make it very clear that our intention is simply to help Cuba to enter the modern world via the path of democracy, and we must therefore continue to demand the release of all of the people sentenced to many years in prison for their peaceful opposition to the regime.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my opposition to the joint initiative which will be voted on tomorrow.
This initiative is based - and the text exudes this from every pore - on a position which is exceptional, a position that the European Union has held for some time.
It is the only country in the world in relation to which the European Union maintains a situation of exception; there are no other cases.
I believe that this is unjust and that, furthermore, it has no effect whatsoever.
It is clear that that position will be voted for tomorrow and will have absolutely no effect.
I would call for an end to this situation of exception.
The European Union must treat Cuba in the same way as any other country in the world.
We must maintain a position that allows for an agenda for joint debate, which deals with all of the issues.
We must, of course, demand firstly that the United Sates lift its blockade of the island of Cuba.
Naturally, we need to debate the whole issue of the request for the extradition of the terrorist Posada Carriles and, of course, to include in the Ibero-American Summit everything related to what was debated at the Ibero-American Summit between the European Union and Cuba.
Cuba certainly has many faults, but it is exemplary in terms of South/South cooperation.
Cuban society is also exemplary with regard to all public services, given that it is a poor country.
I believe that the European Union must not be governed by the dictates of the US State Department.
It must not do that.
I would therefore naturally call for an independent position that puts an end to the situation of exception between the European Union and Cuba.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
This Parliament has often â all too often â debated the lack of respect for human rights in Cuba.
âWords, words, wordsâ, while we wait for positive signs from a dying regime that has no intention of changing course.
In January 2005, the Council made some concessions, in the hope of encouraging a different attitude.
All its expectations were promptly dashed: freedom of expression is still, unfortunately, just an illusion, as also demonstrated by the refusal to allow the Women in White to come here to receive the 2005 Sakharov prize.
We can wait no longer.
In this situation we, the European Union, have an obligation and a duty to do more, and to do it better and more quickly.
I am a reformist socialist, and therefore I dream of a society based on the values of freedom, participation, democracy and social fairness.
I am also the youngest Member in this House, and in my heart and mind I share the aspirations of Cubans of my age, who want to be able to look forward with optimism to a country that is at last more open, more modern and more just.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have addressed this House on a number of occasions to warn of the suffering in Cuba, in particular that of people who continue to fight peacefully for democracy and human rights.
Unfortunately, the sad reality dictates that we must issue fresh condemnations and protests.
During the last plenary session of last year, we saw the levels of intolerance to which Fidel Castroâs regime had sunk.
A group of women whose only crime has been to ask for freedom for their husbands and sons, political detainees since the crackdown of March 2003, were prevented from coming to Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize, along with our suitable tributes and messages of respect from the people of Europe.
Regrettably, this decision and the attitude giving rise to it comes as no surprise.
Oswaldo PayÃ¡, winner of the Sakharov Prize in 2002, has also repeatedly been banned from coming to Europe to tell us in his own voice what is actually happening in Cuba, and to discuss the situation with us.
Parliament has therefore kept an open invitation for him to come here as soon as he is allowed to do so.
We should now extend that invitation to the and campaign for them to be able to come and receive our warm tributes and words of solidarity in person.
It might be possible to award the prize in Havana, but that should not satisfy us.
That should be our minimum requirement, but we should always seek more.
We must not accept any fleeting or underhand gestures, and nor must we bow to the whims of the dictatorship.
Oswaldo PayÃ¡ and the must be given a public forum in which to express the message of their peaceful campaign for freedom and justice.
The people of Europe, and especially the young, must be made aware of their story and their exemplary fight for human rights.
I hope that the outcome of this debate will be that nobody can be in any doubt when condemning a brutal dictatorship.
Hopefully, the Council will finally acknowledge its mistake and stop deluding itself, which, as we have seen, only leads to tougher repression and greater injustice.
We will continue to fight for Europe to act more firmly.
Let nobody say that Parliament has wavered in its unequivocal condemnation of a dictatorial regime.
This is my appeal, from democrats to democrats.
Â Â  I would like to thank my group, which is allowing me to speak despite knowing that I do not agree with their position.
I am not going to vote for the resolution, which seems to me to be unbalanced, pointless and harmful to the European Unionâs image in the developing world.
Furthermore, the fact that there are just twenty Members in the Chamber demonstrates the degree of priority the Members of this Parliament attach to this debate.
I preferred the socialist proposal, but then fundamental aspects such as the United Statesâ blockade and GuantÃ¡namo, the most scandalous violation of human rights taking place on the island, have been lost.
The imbalance is all the greater given that the resolution does not acknowledge some of Cubaâs actions, in particular the work it has been doing in terms of cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean, Latin American, Africa and even Asia.
Last week, when discussing disability and development, we highlighted the fact that, in 2005, 208 000 blind people from those countries had had operations in Cuba free of charge.
That does not appear to be important here, but it is very important for the people whose sight has been restored and for their countries.
The fact that there are more than 20 000 Cuban doctors and almost as many sports instructors and teachers working in this same field of Southern solidarity illustrates something that many people here deny or keep quiet, but their sectarian approach, which leads to resolutions like this one, damages the European Unionâs image amongst the countries and peoples of the South who feel respect and gratitude towards Cuba.
Finally, all this resolution will achieve will be to confirm the Cuban authoritiesâ conviction that the European Union is not an independent interlocutor, but simply an extension of the interests and strategies of the Bush administration, and it will not persuade it to do a single thing to move in the direction in which many of us would like to see things progress in their country; in other words, in this regard as well, this resolution is essentially pointless except for those people in this House whose aim is simply to discriminate against Cuba and carry on treating it as an exception and in a manner that is different to the way it treats other countries with similar regimes.
The most regrettable thing is that, by taking this approach, Europe is becoming less and less relevant on a large part of the international stage.
For all of these reasons, I would repeat that I am not going to vote for the resolution and I hope that my fellow Members will at least listen to my arguments, regardless of how they vote tomorrow.
If they vote like me, all the better.
Â Â  Mr President, to some people, including in Europe, Cuba is paradise, while to others, it is hell.
Measured against Europeâs current yardstick of a multi-party democracy and individual human rights, that country leaves a great deal to be desired.
For nearly half a century, the same movement and the same leader have been in power.
The Cubans are not free to travel abroad, not even to receive a prize that has been awarded to them.
Oppositions are given little opportunity to organise themselves and if, despite everything, they succeed, they are not given the chance to measure their public following at election time.
Like its big neighbour, the United States, Cuba still practises capital punishment, and that is something that can, and indeed should, be condemned.
With all this criticism heaped on Cuba, I do not think that we are dealing with your everyday dictatorship.
The country makes great claims for itself and has, for years, served as an example to the rest of Latin America in the areas of education, health care and other public services, as well as the protection of the most vulnerable sections of the population.
In terms of democracy and human rights, it was certainly not worse off than the rest of Latin America used to be.
It still serves as the source of inspiration for those voters â a majority â who favour modernisation in Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.
Europe has never followed North Americaâs tactic of isolating Cuba, and rightly so, for much of what is wrong in Cuba is being fostered by this very tactic.
If we want Cuba to improve, we need to work at building an open relationship.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the human rights situation in that museum of Stalinism, the Communist dictatorship that is Cuba, has deteriorated still further, is of course a disgrace, but I should like to draw Parliamentâs attention to our own European Commissioner, the Belgian European Commissioner Louis Michel, who is at least partly to blame for this.
It was Louis Michel who, not so long ago, following a congenial four-day visit to Havana, advised the European Council, in strong terms, not to consider imposing any diplomatic sanctions.
It was also Louis Michel who retorted to the human rights organisations that Fidel Castroâs regime should not be provoked.
Whilst, for example, Human Rights Watch urged the European Union not to normalise its economic relations with Cuba at least until political prisoners had been released and democratic reforms implemented, Mr Michel stated that he was in favour of an unconditional extension of the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba.
The fact is, of course, that Louis Michel is on friendly terms with the Adolf Hitlers, the Stalins and the Maos of our time, for that is what Fidel Castro is like.
Â Â  The situation in Cuba is very serious.
People there are increasingly being denied fundamental human rights, and the number of political prisoners is increasing.
Europe could set a good example.
As a Member of the European Parliament, who, together with my colleagues, Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ and Mr GaÄŸa, has adopted a Cuban political prisoner, I am keen to see greater pressure exerted on Fidel Castro through international public opinion.
I would like to believe that one of the first decisions made under the pressure of public opinion would be to release political prisoners who are mistreated and exposed to inhumane conditions in prisons.
This is one of the reasons why I support the draft resolution concerning the European Union position vis-Ã -vis the Cuban Government, paragraph 9 of which refers to sanctions being re-imposed on Cuba by the European Union Council.
I do not know why the sanctions were temporarily suspended on 31 January 2005, since paragraph 1 of the draft clearly states that Cuba has not achieved any significant improvement in human rights since 2003.
Was it a reward for ignorance or were there other interests involved ?
I would like to believe that this time the Council will re-impose sanctions more effectively.
To ensure this, cooperation is required.
Ideally, this would mean working primarily with the UN and the US Government.
I understand that reaching a consensus in the UN is almost impossible, but sanctions coordinated with the United States, and perhaps Canada, might bring about the necessary outcome.
Mr President, the European Union and its institutions cannot, and will never be, indifferent to the destiny of millions living under conditions of repression and to the many people suffering horrific prison conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, it was in 2005 that Castro and Mr Roque themselves first raised the subject of post-Castro Cuba.
Meanwhile, the Cuban people are sick and tired of fighting to keep their heads above water, and the lives of the small groups of Cubans who have the courage to become politically or socially active are made hell.
Europe must speak with one voice in Havana against the serious human rights violations and in favour of a dialogue with the authorities on political and economic reforms to prevent the achievements in the areas of health care and education in the first years of the revolution from going to waste.
That dialogue must also, however, put an end to the totalitarian regime and the blockade on economic reforms.
Only in that way can Cubans, by means of their own initiatives, agriculture and small markets, regain a prospect of the better and violence-free times ahead that will not come from Miami.
Europe must now give thought to offering post-Castro Cuba a social, economic and democratic perspective.
Mr Solana, the Commission and the Council must enter into dialogue with it.
We have to combine all our efforts and focus on human rights and a dialogue that offers plenty of new perspectives.
It is up to Castro and Roque to show what they are made of and join in it.
I was in Cuba in January, from where the âDamas de Blancoâ send their warmest greetings and are delighted with the prize we awarded them.
Â Â  Tyranny is most afraid of those who practice freedom' â the words of JosÃ© MartÃ­n, a hero of the 19th century fight for Cuban independence, are still as relevant today as they were when he uttered them.
We can also add that apart from its own opposition, a dictatorship is also afraid of those who practice freedom in other countries.
Therefore we, the representatives of European democracies, must be aware of our especially great responsibility when discussing one of the last Communist regimes.
As a personal thought, please allow me to add that as a young Hungarian politician, I am extremely aware of this responsibility, because my generation was brought up by our parents and grandparents against the background of a Socialist dictatorship similar to that in Cuba.
We also owe it to them to stand up firmly for our principles.
By now it has become clear that last yearâs lifting of the coercive measures taken against Cuba failed to bring the desired results, and it only prompted the Cuban Government to step up oppression.
Arrests have been on-going, and in 2005 approximately 30 members of the opposition were imprisoned, which means that by now the number of those detained for their political views in often inhuman circumstances has exceeded 300.
Therefore, depictions of a comic-opera dictatorship led by a jovial parlour revolutionary are false.
In the meantime, foreign observers are not allowed to travel to the country, a fact that I have recently experienced myself.
Last year, like several other fellow MEPs, I was refused the entry visa to attend a meeting of the opposition.
In case we have not known it so far, we can now learn the fact that a dictatorship â be it rightist or leftist â does not allow compromises.
This is another reason why we cannot support the lifting of coercive measures.
History is an unequivocal witness: the opposition movements of the former Socialist block could not have reached their goals without the stimulation of the Western European democracies.
Today it falls on the reunited Europe to give strength to all those who are representing the values of democracy in the shadow of dictatorship.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a Polish saying that a rich man cannot understand a poor man.
Nonetheless, those of us who know how it feels to be denied oneâs freedom find it easier to understand what is happening in Cuba at the moment.
Those opposed to adopting a hard line towards Cuba argue that there would be negative consequences for the ordinary people.
I wonder if they have bothered to find out what the people of Cuba think?
Does Castro bother about what Cubans think?
In the 1980s the Polish Communists responded to US economic sanctions that were also supposed to have negative consequences for ordinary Poles by announcing, by way of retaliation, that they would send a thousand sleeping bags to the homeless of New York.
What was the reaction of ordinary people in Poland?
Small adverts began to appear in the press, offering to exchange spacious flats in Warsaw for sleeping bags in New York.
Many Cubans seem to be thinking along the same lines, and Havana is much closer to New York than Warsaw.
If major revolutionaries like Fidel Castro are treated gently, they interpret it as a sign of weakness.
Surely the time has come to demonstrate that Europe is not weak?
It is time to understand that Cuba cannot be dealt with like an untouchable totalitarian fortress.
If Castro continues to refuse to allow the recipients of the Sakharov prize to travel to Cuba, then we should not travel to Cuba as if nothing had happened.
In my view, we ought to persuade Europeans not to make Cuba a holiday destination, in other words, not to go there as tourists.
Cuba is not an appropriate place for a holiday.
Nobody goes on holiday to Auschwitz or to a gulag.
It would be absurd.
It is just as absurd to contribute to a tourist industry that is helping prop up a regime where violation of human rights is the order of the day.
Â Â  Two events dating back to December 2005 characterise the situation in Cuba: the Ladies in White were awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.
The Cuban authorities forbade them to leave the country and receive the prize in person.
Freedom of thought is not rewarded in Cuba.
This is strong proof that the prize had been given to the right people. The Sakharov Prize was awarded to the wives and mothers of Cuban political prisoners who were guilty only of free thought.
The release of all political prisoners in Cuba remains the central demand of the Ladies in White movement.
Nowadays, when many parts of the world are shaken by violence, war and terror, it is very encouraging to see a group of unarmed women being able to exert great moral pressure through non-violent means.
Coming from a region that only a few years ago was ruled by a communist regime which also imprisoned people for thinking freely, I can confirm that support from democratic countries has immense significance.
Therefore, I would urge democratic European institutions to use all peaceful means at their disposal to bring pressure to bear on the Castro regime and to force it to release people imprisoned only because of independent thinking.
The policy of prevarications and concessions pursued vis-Ã -vis one of the least democratic regimes in the world only prolongs the suffering of the people there and the infringements of human rights.
By supporting the democratic opposition in Cuba and applying constant pressure on the Castro regime, Europe can secure respect for democratic principles in this socialist country.
If EU efforts to bring about democratic changes are to succeed and be effective, we need to formulate an unambiguous position on how to achieve these changes and how to establish democracy in Cuba.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate: I have listened attentively and taken on board a number of points for myself and for the Council.
It seems to me that we are called upon to continue to defend actively the values that the European Union represents â respect for human rights, and the defence of the fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly.
I have also noted the Houseâs desire that we should continue to provide active support to the peaceful opposition and that we should press for the release of prisoners.
It is nevertheless a fact âÂ and we must acknowledge thisÂ â that our options are limited if Cuba does not show at least a minimum level of goodwill.
And, to be honest, the confrontation and embargo policy that has sometimes been proposed in the past has also not brought the desired results.
We therefore think that we should continue with our policy of critical dialogue, involvement and encouraging reform.
Â Â  To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on national management statements â Member States' accountability for the implementation of the European Union's budget, by Szabolcs Fazakas, Terence Wynn and Jan Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control (O-0102/2005 â B6-0347/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, the oral question includes six specific questions to which I hope the President-in-Office will respond.
However, there is also an equally important seventh question: it is the old issue about national declarations.
Will the Council actually sit down and discuss this issue with Parliament, so that we can seek a common objective?
That is the one aspect in this old debate that has been missing since we voted on the discharge in this Chamber.
At the time, we made the recommendations which this oral question refers to.
We asked the Member States to get their house in order, to give us an assurance that the control systems they were putting in place were adequate and sufficient and that when EU money was being spent, it was being spent correctly.
The problem we have is that when the Court of Auditors reports every year and cannot give a positive statement of assurance, it is because of problems within the Member States.
Unless we are going to have a Commission official monitoring just about every item of European expenditure in the Member States, we are never going to solve the problem.
It is incumbent upon the Member States to help us ensure that European taxpayersâ money is being spent correctly.
I have to thank Commissioner Kallas in particular for the way he has encouraged Parliament by persuading the Commission to take on board those recommendations and to produce the roadmap towards getting a positive statement of assurance.
In that process, we had a two-day hearing organised by the Commission and the previous Presidency on how this could or could not be achieved.
I attended that hearing on both days.
I was saddened at the negativity of some Member States who just wanted to continue with the status quo.
They claimed nothing was wrong and nothing needed to be changed.
Two things were clear from that hearing: there might have been other minor problems, but there were two major problems.
The first major problem was that the supreme audit institutions of the Member States feared that somehow or other this was a takeover by the European Court of Auditors.
Hopefully that fear has been allayed.
I attended the annual gathering of the supreme audit institutions along with the European Court of Auditors in Stockholm, and I am led to believe that there is an acceptance that it was not the intention.
I am also led to believe that the supreme audit institutions are prepared to play their part in helping us to solve this problem.
The other major problem that occurred from that two-day hearing, and probably the biggest one, was the fact that we had asked for a political signature from the Member States to actually give these national declarations.
For some Member States, such as the Netherlands, that is not a problem.
This task falls on the Minister, and no one else would argue that it should be anybody else.
However, for a lot of Member States it was a major problem.
On reflection, I have to say that if we had left out the words âpolitical signatureâ in our discharge report we may not have scared the Council as much as we did.
We are now in a situation where we need to come to an agreement with the Council on how to get national declarations that can actually satisfy not only the European Court of Auditors, but the Commission and the Member States themselves, to ensure that we can show European taxpayers that their money is being spent correctly.
I would hope that the President-in-Office gives us clear answers to the six questions listed within the oral question and that he does not give us the answers that Ecofin gave us on 8Â November 2005.
Quite frankly, that was not leading us forward.
I should also like him to answer the seventh question, which I shall put orally: will the Council sit down with Parliament to discuss this matter in the hope that we can get a resolution to it?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Council's opinion on this important issue, the statement of assurance (DAS) to be issued by the European Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget.
I would like to begin with the rather obvious comment that the management of the Community budget is very complicated, and is unique in the world.
It covers many levels of government, from the various Commission services, via central, regional and local government in the Member States, to the individual final beneficiaries.
It is in the interests of all those involved, including the budgetary and discharge authorities, to contribute to the proper management of budgetary funds.
As you have in this House, so likewise we in the Council have repeatedly expressed our disappointment at the situation, particularly in connection with the discharge procedure.
Following detailed discussions in the Council and in the Council bodies, the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on the roadmap on 8Â November, and I can assure you that it was not easy.
This document summarises the discussions held by a group of experts from all the Member States, representing the ministries of finance, the operating authorities and the audit authorities, in a two-day hearing held jointly with the Commission.
This preparatory work formed a good basis for the detailed discussions in the Council bodies, and proved to be useful in that we reached agreement on the aforementioned Council conclusions.
I assume you have already had an opportunity to read this document, so I need only mention the most important points here.
I would like to leave the aspect of the declarations to be made by the individual Member States to the end of my comments.
I know that this issue is particularly important to you, but I would ask you to be patient.
The Council emphasises in its conclusions that numerous efforts have already been made to improve sound financial management: the introduction of internal audits, stricter requirements regarding the accountability of the Commission's accounting officer and implementation of the integrated administration and control system, to name just a few.
In view of the importance of the Structural Funds in the European Union's budget, I would like to draw your attention to the efforts that have been made to set up paying authorities and to further extend the internal and controls of the structural measures.
One of the first points mentioned in the Council's conclusions is the balanced relationship between the competences of the Commission and the Member States in implementing the European Union's budget in accordance with the Treaty, which must be taken into account when it comes to improving the relevant controls and assurances.
Furthermore, the Council considers it to be extremely important that these improvements should build on the existing control structures and that we should aim to improve the cost/benefit ratio and to simplify the systems.
The Council believes that an effective integrated internal control framework based on the principles set out in the Court of Auditors' opinion on the single audit will provide assurances regarding the management of the risk of error in the underlying transactions.
One of the most important points in the Council's conclusions relates to improving the control systems.
The Member States and the Commission need to optimise the effectiveness, economy and efficiency of current control systems.
Despite the differences in administrative arrangements between the various Member States, the Council advocates that general common principles and elements regarding internal controls should be drawn up.
In the Council's opinion, the Member States should continue to work with the Commission to implement and improve controls in relation to funds for which they have joint responsibility for managing.
This should take account of the competences pursuant to the Treaty, the Financial Regulation and the relevant provisions of the sectoral regulations.
For example, some Member States are prepared to take precautions within the framework of the Confidence Pact, as provided for in connection with the Structural Funds programmes.
As the Member States are in agreement in the Council, I am speaking for all the Member States, not just for the Council itself.
As you know, the Commission's services have published an initial analysis of the deficiencies of their internal control framework in comparison with the control principles set out in the Court of Auditors' proposal for a Community internal control framework.
In connection with the shared management, the Council has requested the Commission to assess the implementation of the current regulations concerning sample checks on operations, paying authorities and winding up bodies' activities.
The Council conclusions propose that the Commission, working with the Member States, should provide an assessment of the present controls at sector and regional level and the value of existing statements and declarations.
I will now turn to the subject of the audit.
In setting up the internal control framework we must make a distinction between internal controls and the external audit.
Any form of cooperation between independent supreme audit institutions can only be based on the Treaty, as these authorities are not part of the internal control framework.
This is an important point.
Some audit authorities are willing to discuss with the Court of Auditors how they might strengthen their contribution.
I can assure you that all the Member States have expressed a willingness to do everything they can to reduce the risk of error and to improve controls.
The Commission and the Member States should ensure that their approach to the integrated internal control framework is based on common control standards, and to confer with one another on how these standards can most effectively be implemented.
To that end, the Council encourages the Member States to hold bilateral discussions with the Court of Auditors on the results of their DAS audits, in order to solve systemic problems.
It requests the Commission to provide it with a report on solutions for problems common to several Member States.
FinallyÂ âÂ and this is particularly importantÂ âÂ the Court of Auditors has proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should come to a common understanding regarding the risks to be tolerated in the underlying transactions.
The Council's conclusions place considerable importance on this common understanding, and the Council eagerly awaits further progress in this regard.
I now come to a subject that is very important to all of us: simplification.
There is a need for simplification regarding harmonisation of the control principles, of legislation and of the control requirements in connection with the regulations to be adopted for the programming period 2007-2013.
In the Council's opinion, simplification must under no circumstances lead to an increase in the current administration and control costs.
What is more, it should ensure elimination of multiple internal controls by the various parties involved in the control framework.
Finally, I would like to talk about the extremely important subject of the declarations associated with the decentralised management of EU funds.
The Council sees the existing declarations at operational level as a means of providing the Commission, and ultimately the Court of Auditors, with assurances.
They must be useful and cost-efficient and can be taken into account when it comes to achieving a positive statement of assurance.
It must be ensured that the existing balance between the Commission and the Member States is not threatened.
I am aware that you expected more in this connection, but I am sure you will agree with me that the text itself can be regarded as a significant and important step forward.
In order to make further progress in this matter, the Council has agreed, on the occasion of the 2004 discharge process, to examine the Commission's Action Plan to fill the gaps in the present control framework.
The Council conclusions of 8Â November will, of course, be followed by further steps in 2006.
A positive statement of assurance is, as has already been said, an important and very ambitious goal, which cannot be achieved overnight.
I think, however, that the Council conclusions are an important step towards reaching this goal.
They also confirm that the Council continues to support the Commission in its efforts to make an active contribution to financial management at all levels.
Some of you perhaps take the view that the Council should have gone a step further, and I can well understand that.
You should bear in mind, though, that on this topic the Presidency was restricted by the need for unanimity.
Thank you for your attention!
Â Â  . Mr President, already during the entire period of the work of this Commission we have a common concern to get a positive DAS.
It has not been possible.
This is a very technical issue with a very bad political outcome, which seems to give good reason to whoever wants to say that money in European Union has been spent improperly.
Of course, this is completely untrue.
We have worked together to find solutions and ways of joining all our efforts to provide enough evidence for the Court of Auditors to give an assurance that the transactions are reliable.
We do not deny that Member States are doing a lot of work to secure the proper control systems.
I have just come from one Member State where I met the national audit authority, and huge work has been done to secure the proper use of national and European money where there is shared management.
The Commission does not deny its responsibility for implementing the budget, including in shared management.
But we have a missing link: how to make all the results of the control and audit work readable finally for the highest level, for the Court of Auditors.
So, the Commission strongly supported the proposal to the Council made by the rapporteur Mr Wynn and the Committee on Budgetary Control to have a political declaration, a signature on the national level, which, in our view, could cover this missing link.
This proposal was rejected last November and now we have to think about what to do next, because the problem will continue to exist.
The Commission adopted an action plan on 17Â January and has sent it to the Council and Parliament.
The action plan designates 16Â concrete actions at all levels and in all sectors.
ActionÂ 5 specifically addresses the topic for this eveningâs debate and reads: âMember States should designate a national coordinating body per policy area which can (âŠ) provide all stakeholders with an overview of the assurance available in respect of Community actions under shared and indirect management in their Member State.
The cooperation of Member States is necessary when ensuring such a provision in forthcoming legislation, and steering its implementation via implementing rules and guidanceâ.
Maybe this can be a solution or a least an intermediary solution that can link together the technical levels, the paying agencies and the audits and provide good evidence for overall discharge.
Â Â  Mr President, we expected more from you in fact, Mr Winkler.
We expected more from the Austrian Presidency in this regard.
This is not the first time that this Parliament has seen the Council fall short with regard to what we ask.
Now we Europeans have a serious problem: in the financial perspective, this Parliament wanted us to spend 1.14%, but the President-in-Office, Mr Blair, lowered this to 1.04%.
From this it would appear that Community policies, which are so effective and which have done so much to move Europe forward, are being badly managed by the European Union and that, therefore, the best thing we can do is reduce the budget, because things are not being handled properly.
In that case, what we should do is see to it that there are no European policies, but national policies: let us renationalise the common agricultural policy, let us spend in the Member States.
Behind this lies the fact that for 10 years the Court of Auditors has said that it cannot approve the European accounts.
But what European accounts, if 80% of the Community budget is managed and spent in the Member States; if just a fifth is managed in Brussels.
What is happening?
Some national authorities, which want to pay less and want Community policies to have less fuel, now that we are in a Europe of 25 and are about to be a Europe of 27, are telling us, âyou are spending badlyâ.
What is the Committee on Budgetary Control asking for?
We are asking to be told where money is spent badly; if a Member State is spending badly, we want it to be said that that State is spending badly, that it is not Brussels.
We want to be told whether the problems have arisen here in Brussels or there in the Member State.
And to this end, it would be helpful for us if the Member States confirmed the way in which Community money is spent.
I believe that Community money is spent better and more effectively in Brussels than in the average Member State.
Nevertheless, as a result of the system we have, Brussels is blamed for bad management, rather than the Member States.
I know that the Council has to defend the good name of the Member States.
We would ask for co-responsibility, an approval, by whichever authority, whether it be the Finance Minister or the appropriate Court, which confirms that the accounts are managed in each Member State in the way that the European citizens want, so that Vice-President Kallas or Parliamentâs Committee on Budgetary Control are not always to blame; that the blame be shared out and the parties responsible exposed.
I would therefore ask you to confirm how each Member State spends the European citizensâ money.
Â Â  . As President of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the representatives of the new Member States, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity of discussing the issue of national declarations with members of the Commission and Council.
I very much hope that as a result of this debate, we will not only receive a previously prepared statement from Mr Winkler, State Secretary, but also concrete answers to the questions submitted by Terence Wynn and ourselves.
We very much hope that we will have the answers, as the European Parliament is politically responsible to assure the citizens of the European Union of the lawful and proper utilisation of European Union funds.
In view of the fact that the European Court of Auditors is unable to issue a positive declaration of assurance (DAS) in the absence of national assurance declarations, a negative public opinion is beginning to emerge, namely that European Funds are used in a non-transparent manner, not always in compliance with the regulations.
This is why the report prepared by my colleague Terence Wynn, supported by the great majority of this Parliament and also confirmed by the BÃ¶ge report on the financial perspective of the European Union, pressed for the introduction of the national assurance declaration in the course of the exemption procedure last year.
Additionally, we are delighted that this has also been included in the roadmap to an integrated internal control framework, announced by the European Commission, namely by Vice-President Siim Kallas.
This reform, involving Parliament, the Commission and the European Court of Auditors, is based on mutual trust and close cooperation, but in addition to this, we also need the support of the Council and the Presidency, because some Member States are still resisting the introduction of the national assurance declarations.
As a representative of Hungary, I would also like to call attention to the fact that new Member States have not only prepared themselves for the acceptance of the and the reception of structural funds, but were also aware that they had to set up their payment and control systems according to the principles of legitimacy, lawfulness and compliance with regulations.
Therefore it would not cause them any difficulty to comply with the expectations of the European Parliament and Commission, because by doing so they would serve a Europe that works more efficiently, as well as in a more regulated and transparent manner.
Â Â  . Mr President, the resolution we are discussing this evening is self-explanatory.
It is a direct result of Mr Wynnâs discharge resolution of 2003.
It is important that we should gain better control over EU funds.
We all know that the Court of Auditors has failed to issue a positive statement of assurance during the last 11 years.
It is to the Commissionâs credit that it has adopted Parliamentâs recommendations almost in their entirety. That is to be welcomed.
The Member States, unfortunately, take a different view, and a much dimmer one, and that is why this evening is mainly intended as a debate with the Council.
I have to say that I am not entirely won over by Mr Winklerâs responses and observations this evening.
In actual fact, what we demand in this resolution is not that different from what is already happening in some cases.
We would like to refer back to the previous statement in which we ask the highest political authority to sign that statement.
In that resolution, we go no further than statements at a lower level.
If we study current practice in agricultural spending, certification bodies are already in place that monitor payment bodies independently and that carry out independent checks.
It is beyond me why Member States can accept this in the area of agricultural spending, but not in the other areas of budgetary spending, such as structural spending.
This eveningâs discussion does come with some strings attached.
I assume that the Council is familiar with the BÃ¶ge resolution on the financial perspectives.
Not only are we asking for more funds following the Councilâs decisions, we are also asking for better financial supervision, which is the very purpose of the resolution that we will â it is to be hoped â be adopting tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is indeed, first and foremost, a debate with the Council.
I have to say that I found the Ministerâs performance a disappointing one; he has not really answered our question, and that at a time when confidence in the European Union is at an all time low.
Tomorrow, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m will be presenting a White Paper on communication as a means of boosting confidence in the EU, but, in my view, a thousand white papers, or a thousand measures, will make no difference if the European Union fails to spend its funds wisely.
That is why I ask you, once again, why you are organising organised irresponsibility here.
Why are you, the Council, getting Member States to spend 80% of the European funds instead of ensuring that the individual Member States and regions, where they are responsible for doing so, can say that the funds they are spending are being monitored properly and funds are being spent wisely?
I cannot fathom why the Council cannot do as Parliament requires in this respect.
I think that you are creating an enormous difficulty for this House.
Â Â  . National management declarations!
Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Kallas, will these be like the EUâs own accounts, in which the directors-general of the Commission sign off their respective departments with reservations, because they have not got a clue where the money has gone?
Because if it is so, it strikes me as a little like trying to repair a severed artery with a band aid: too little too late.
As everybody knows, I do not believe in the European Union; I regard it as an enemy of democracy, and I approach this from an opposite direction.
No nation should be pouring taxpayersâ money into a corrupt system.
After 11Â long years in which the EUâs accounts have been rejected by its own auditors, this weak-kneed attempt to change the system seems to me like pouring huge amounts of gold dust through a sieve, thinking âoh, perhaps we better try and stuff up a few of the holesâ.
No one thinks about the wisdom of pouring the dust through the sieve in the first place and quite simply the way to stop the dust being lost is to stop pouring.
Therefore I call on the Members here present to go back to their various countries and make urgent representations to their own governments to pull the plug.
Simply stop paying this monstrous bureaucratic dictatorship, which has no respect for either the governments or the people of Europe.
We have a saying in my country: âcharity begins at homeâ.
Save the money you are currently wasting on the EU, a large part of which is lost simply by fraud and corruption anyway.
Â Â  Mr Titford, I would call you to order.
On two occasions you have accused the European institutions of crimes.
You have said âfraudâ and âcorruptionâ twice.
I would ask that, in the future, you bear in mind that, in this House, accusations against persons or institutions of crimes must be backed up by evidence.
Otherwise, you are abusing a Member of Parliamentâs freedom to speak.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when this House discusses financial matters, it is not very often that I am much less forthright than those who have spoken before me.
Although this national responsibility is something I dare not even dream of, I have not forgotten, MrÂ Winkler, what your ChancellorÂ âÂ and mineÂ âÂ said, standing in this Chamber where you are now, regarding the issue of subsidies using EU funds.
ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel's words, in his capacity as President of the Council, were: 'It is only right that such information should be published so that people know who has actually benefited'.
I will repeat that: 'It is only right that such information should be published'.
So publish it!
In some Member States, where they are much more critical about many things, such as the United Kingdom, for example, that goes without saying.
Let Austria be a shining example to follow, and finally tell us what happens with the 80%!
Who gets what, how much and when?
My second request, which you might find rather easier: side with your own political group, namely with MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle.
She is introducing reforms in the new Financial Regulation with which we will really be able to work, and with which you will very easily be able to ward off unjustified criticism â provided, that is, that you become more transparent.
