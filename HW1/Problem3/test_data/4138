I believe there are no age limits for this type of illness.
Madam President, together with the other MEPs who were present during the moments after our colleague fell ill, I must say in all fairness that the time that passed between the incident occurring and the arrival of the doctor would be classed as admirable for any of the world' s institutions.
And when the official doctor, who came equipped with all the appropriate resuscitation equipment - and in this respect I agree with my colleague - ordered the stretcher, the stretcher arrived.
I am very satisfied with the time that was taken and the action of Parliament' s medical services.
Madam President, maybe at long last we will decide that the Medical Services should not be placed in the basement.
They would prefer to be on the same floor as the plenary session and maybe we could actually look into that.
Ladies and gentlemen, we trust that the Quaestors will look into the matter.
Madam President, I very much hope that Mr Staes will get well soon, but I believe that we should also remind and ask the media to inform our co-citizens that our life is not a bed of roses, and that coming and going like nomads is not the best thing for our health.
However, we have all made a free choice.
I will return to the issue we were discussing: my Group' s request for this House to express its opinion in accordance with the regulations.
I was reading Article 12(2) of the Act of 1976, which is the legal basis cited by the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee in her letter of Monday.
This paragraph says: "Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the European Parliament, which shall take note of the fact" .
France is a constitutional state.
There has been a legal judgement, a government decree, which has been communicated to us and I believe it falls to the European Parliament to take note of it in accordance with the Treaties and with parliamentary law.
I have heard - because I do not have first-hand knowledge of the letter - that precedents are cited.
There certainly are precedents and my Group believes they should be respected.
However, in this case, we should not cite the precedent of Mr Tapie for two reasons: firstly, he was ineligible for reasons of bankruptcy, and, secondly - and this is important - he had used his right to appeal.
Here we have a case of ineligibility for one year and the right to appeal, recognised in the French decree, has not been used.
I do not wish to enter into a debate on French law, since I have no knowledge of it.
I believe that, in accordance with the Treaties and our Rules, Parliament must take note of the decision of the French State.
This is the correct procedure and I think that, although I was not present in the Committee on Legal Affairs, the proposal does not reflect it.
In any event, I believe that this proposal should not be ratified by the European Parliament, I am going to request that it be put to the vote and I would like to say that my Group will vote against it.
Madam President, I am speaking as coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I was very surprised by the letter which you have just read from the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Yesterday, I received a letter from the chairperson, which faithfully reflected what had happened in the Legal Affairs Committee: following a discussion, it was decided not to recommend that Parliament take note, leaving the issue on the table for further discussion.
The letter which you have read reflects the personal motives which the chairperson and perhaps other MEPs put forward, but which does not reflect the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Specifically, the Socialist Group' s position was that, in view of the Act of 1976, all this Parliament could do is what Mr BarÃ³n just said, that is to say, take note (prendre acte) of the decision of the French Government, with no other condition.
The possibility of giving an explanation was raised, and I argued that that would mean a new vote.
No new vote took place and therefore - I repeat - the views expressed in the letter which you have just read reflect Mrs Palacio' s personal position and not the position of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Madam President, firstly I would like to say that, in any event, we are all aware that we are facing a situation in which we have to find our way with few specific points of reference and therefore, we must resort to analogy, precedent, common sense and, in general terms, the general principles of the law.
This is because in our statutory law, in our Rules of Procedure, there is no explicit mention of how to proceed in a situation such as this.
Secondly, I wish to point out that there is doubtless confusion here.
Madam President, you have consulted the Legal Affairs Committee on the basis of a purely formal decision.
As on other occasions, such as, for example, when the Legal Affairs Committee examines whether or not to lodge an appeal in the Court of Justice, we are talking about a purely technical assessment by an internal body of Parliament, which makes a recommendation to the President, the external body of Parliament, who is expected to take the decision.
I respect what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo says.
His views were discussed and examined in depth by the Legal Affairs Committee.
Allow me to refer to what was said in this committee.
Firstly, Mr BarÃ³n says that there is no similarity with the Tapie case because the ineligibility in that case stemmed from a bankruptcy and in this case it stems from a criminal conviction.
I do not personally share that view, and I believe that, according to the relevant law, there are reasons not to share it, because, in any event, we are talking about two sentences, both from French courts and both leading to ineligibility.
It makes no sense now to look into the reason for the sentence.
The sentence exists.
The fact that it involves ineligibility is what concerns us.
Mr BarÃ³n' s second argument concerning the difference between the cases related to the fact that Mr Le Pen has not lodged an appeal and that Mr Tapie had.
I do not share this view either, and nor did the majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, because Mr Le Pen is still within the time limit for lodging an appeal.
We therefore cannot go against something, to which he is entitled under French law: to lodge an appeal within a certain time limit.
Please allow me now to refute Mr Medina' s statement on his interpretation of the matter.
I would like to do this calmly, although I consider it to be absolutely unjustified and to warrant a more forceful response.
However, in my capacity as chairperson, I must point out that the two letters are complementary.
In the first letter, Madam President, you were informed that the Legal Affairs Committee had taken a decision not to take note of the judgement for the moment, bearing in mind that it is not final. It is enforceable but not final.
In the second paragraph it said: "tomorrow we will continue to discuss this issue" .
The second letter refers to what happened at the second meeting and all the members of the Legal Affairs Committee know that that was how I presented it.
In no way was there any intention to hold a vote, but simply a discussion. I personally, as rapporteur, was going to propose a basis for discussion.
There was therefore no place for a vote on the issue and I had stated that on the previous day.
The vote had already taken place in the Legal Affairs Committee.
Madam President, I did inform you of what happened in that debate and why it did not continue, and it did not do so basically because there was insistence on the issue of the Tapie case.
Clearly, the Legal Affairs Committee can vote on anything, but since it was not laid down and since it was dealing with such an important and serious issue which did not appear in the agenda, it did not seem to me to be reasonable to hold a vote if we were taking a route which all the speakers - and this is recorded in the Minutes - for one reason or another, rejected.
Furthermore, the Minutes also show that I said that a committee chairperson rarely obtained such a degree of unanimity with regard to a proposal.
I say this in order to refute these statements.
I would now like to make a comment in relation to the Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, Rule 7(4) is being cited.
That paragraph - in the event that we had to resort to it, which I do not believe to be the case, and I will explain why - states that Parliament may express its opinion on a proposal.
Madam President, there is no proposal to the plenary here.
I believe that, in order to vote honestly, on an issue as delicate as this, if Parliament has to vote, a report should be produced in accordance with the rules, so that everybody may vote as they see fit, and not be influenced by allegations from one side or the other, bearing in mind that, in actual fact, the majority of MEPs are not aware of the background to this issue.
Therefore, if the President wishes to take this route, a report by the Legal Affairs Committee is absolutely essential and it would be irregular not to proceed in that way,...
(Noise)
... for Parliament to express its opinion on an issue for which there is no written document or anything whatsoever, and which requires legal consideration at the highest level.
It is absolutely irregular and contrary to the Rule that has been cited...
(Applause)
... because, Madam President, a majority in the Legal Affairs Committee considered, on purely legal bases, that we could not take note of this loss of MEP status.
(Protests)
Madam President, in my opinion, furthermore, this article is not applicable, and I will tell you why: Parliament is asked to take note. It does not have the option of making a political assessment.
It is in the nature of all decisions in plenary that they be taken from a political point of view. In this case we are talking about a purely formal legal assessment.
Madam President, I believe that it falls to the President to take this decision, and you may consult the Rules of Procedure, which states that you must consult the Legal Affairs Committee.
An analysis could be made of the reasons why the Legal Affairs Committee should be consulted, as the internal advisory body in this case. I am prepared to make this analysis, because I have done so before.
(Protests)
Madam President, you can consult any other internal body and, in particular ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
... the Conference of Group Chairmen. However, the House cannot consider this proposal in these circumstances.
(Protests and the President cut the speaker off)
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to repeat the discussions of the Legal Affairs Committee.
However, it was totally proper that we should hear the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee which has carried out some extremely difficult and meticulous work on a very delicate issue.
I accept full responsibility in this matter.
Under the terms of the Treaty I could no doubt have quite simply noted the decree.
However, and I take responsibility for this, I preferred to refer to Rule 7(4) and obtain an opinion from the Legal Affairs Committee. This was because I regarded the problem as being legally very delicate.
I therefore wanted it to be considered regardless of any political considerations so that the case of the Member in question was dealt with as that of any other Member would be.
This is how Parliament must always act, in a very rigorous manner.
It appears in this case that the person concerned has the option of appealing and that this appeal may be accompanied by a stay of execution.
However, from the moment when the European Parliament officially takes note of the decree, the decision will immediately become enforceable.
In other words, the option to appeal and the stay of execution will not be possible. This situation cannot be reversed since, if the appeal were successful, we could not tell the new Member to leave in order to allow the former Member to come back.
You can imagine the problems this would cause!
This is therefore an extremely important responsibility for both your President and this House.
I therefore referred to Rule 7(4), which seemed wholly appropriate to the situation, and asked for the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Once again, I thank the committee for the long hours which its chairperson and members have devoted to this matter.
Now that I have this opinion, I could ignore it.
However, although my decision may be disputed, I have decided to abide by the committee' s opinion.
This being so, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo was right to read carefully the paragraph to which I referred which states that: "He [the President] shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter" .
This, effectively, is what our Rules of Procedure say.
When we have heard from the Members who wish to speak - and I would ask you not to repeat the discussions on this issue - it would be appropriate to consult the House as to whether it wishes to adopt a position on the committee' s opinion. If so, this vote would be included in voting time at midday.
This is my proposal.
There is no perfect solution so we must all try to act with the greatest rigour and fairness.
We are not going to spend the whole morning on this.
I would ask you to be brief and we will then take whatever seems to be the best decision.
This decision is yours to make as this is a very serious issue.
I would remind you that it is in fact Parliament which will officially take note of the decree and not its President.
Mr President, the representatives of our group in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have familiarised themselves thoroughly with this matter, and I too represent our group in this Committee.
We are fully aware of the political sensitivity of this issue.
We do not, however, want this issue to be used against us for political purposes.
Supported by a majority, our Group concluded that the opinion of the majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was justified.
We must make it clear, however, that if there is to be a vote in the part-session on this matter, i.e. on whether the mandate of Mr Le Pen should be terminated, the majority of the French delegation in our Group will vote in favour of this termination.
Mrs Hautala, we must be very clear on this.
It is not a question of voting to waive anybody' s immunity.
We are talking about Rule 7(4) based on which I asked the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a proposal.
We now have this proposal and Rule 7(4) itself states that: "On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter" .
I have received a request for Parliament to adopt a position. In my opinion, I must logically, as a result of using this Rule, not put the committee' s opinion to the vote, but hold a vote to find out who wants us to vote on this opinion.
Is this now clear to everyone?
(Interruption by Mrs Pack) Quite right, Mrs Pack, it is not a question of voting on the substance but of finding out whether or not this is an issue to be placed on the agenda.
The House wants Parliament to adopt a position at midday on the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee and it is understood that at that point we will see ...
(Mixed reactions)But the letter will be provided to you.
I speak as the coordinator of the ELDR Group on the Legal Affairs Committee.
The House should realise, from the fact that this matter has occupied our Committee for a period of three very long and exhaustive meetings, that it was felt to be a very complex and difficult issue to deal with.
I for one would feel it wrong for this House to try to look at this matter in a hurry, which seems to be the proposal being put forward by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules.
As I understand the rule in question, which, Madame President, you are carefully trying to construe, there is at the moment an opinion before you from the Legal Affairs Committee but there is not a proposal as such.
The rule talks about Parliament having a right to give a view on a proposal, but it seems that you have merely an opinion, not a proposal.
If we were to take a view as a full Parliament, then we should have something more in front of us and a great deal more time and careful consideration before we enter into such a hasty vote on an issue such as this.
Madam President, this matter has been very badly handled from the start. This is to be regretted given the political impact it will have.
You can get an idea of the confusion which reigned within the Legal Affairs Committee during the examination of this issue when someone like Mrs Hautala is under the impression that this is a question of waiving parliamentary immunity.
This is not at all the case and it is in this climate of confusion within the committee that a roughly equal number of votes for and against were cast, hence this proposal.
(Mixed reactions) This is what happened.
I completely agree with Mr Poettering that the law must be respected: French law is what it is, however, whether you agree with it or not.
In this situation, French law stipulates that the government must assume its responsibilities based on a judgement from a tribunal. In other words, it must publish the decree withdrawing the mandate and we unfortunately have no choice but to take note of this officially.
Whether this is a good or bad thing, it is a situation which I felt I had to clarify.
Madam President, I wish to raise a procedural motion.
I must remind Mr Wurtz that a tribunal does not deliver judgements.
A court delivers judgements.
He should brush up on his legal knowledge.
That apart, the Legal Affairs Committee rightfully discussed this issue and Mr Wurtz was not there.
As a result, he is ill-placed to criticise a confusion which did not exist.
There was political confusion but no legal confusion.
The position of the Legal Affairs Committee was simple.
The decision is not final and therefore cannot be accepted.
That apart, if the President wants to consult the plenary, this should at least pertain to a specific report, as pointed out by the committee' s chairperson.
We cannot properly discuss and vote at midday on such a politically complex issue when this complexity is based on an internal contradiction between texts in French criminal law, which is not easily accessible to the Members of this House, including the French Members.
If you decide that a vote must be held in this Parliament, this cannot occur without a committee report.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have received many requests to speak.
We absolutely must find the best solution.
I will read to you the letter that Mr HÃ€nsch sent to Mr HervÃ© de Charrette, the then French Foreign Minister, at the time of the Tapie affair.
The most important paragraph states that: "Due to the irreversible nature of the withdrawal of the mandate, it seems to me appropriate to wait for the Council of State to rule on this appeal.
It appears that the Council of State' s decision on the stay of execution will be taken imminently" .
As you can see, and we cannot get into a discussion on this, I too looked at what my predecessors did in similar situations because case law does, rightfully, exist.
We are now in a difficult position.
I propose that we decide whether or not we want the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal, as some of you seem to think that the letter written to me by Mrs Palacio is not a proposal within the terms of the Rules of Procedure.
Personally, I must abide by the Rules of Procedure which state that: "On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter" .
If Parliament, therefore, wants a genuine proposal, we will ask the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up this proposal on which we can calmly vote, not at midday, but a little later perhaps.
We must resolve this situation.
I will therefore immediately put the two possible solutions to the vote.
The first is that we keep to the current position which is to abide by the terms of Mrs Palacio' s letter and await the outcome of any appeal lodged with the Council of State by the Member in question, before officially noting the withdrawal or otherwise of the mandate. The second solution is that the plenary asks the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal on which Parliament will adopt a position in accordance with Rule 7(4).
Madam President, I am sorry I need to ask to speak again, but we cannot vote on anything at all here today, because we have clear and proper procedures.
If we refer a matter to a committee, then we must have a basis for doing so, that is to say we need a document defining that referral.
We do not have such a document.
That is why I urge you not to hold a vote on this matter now in any way whatsoever.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and the Socialist Group.
We have reached an impasse. I fully understand that you want Mr Le Pen to lose his mandate.
Fortunately, however, this issue does not depend on our political desires but on the law and on the fact that, at the moment, we are faced with a legal situation which goes against what you are proposing and which is forcing us into a stalemate.
The President is right.
Either this is a legal proposal from the committee and we can vote on this basis or this is not a legal proposal, in which case you are asking for one to be drawn up.
If you want a vote as an indication of our position, that is entirely up to you, but it would be wise to reject this as I believe there is a contradiction.
I do not often agree with Mrs Garaud but in this case she is right.
There is a contradiction in French law which states that a decision is not final and not suspensive.
Understand that if you can, but it is up to the French Parliament to reform this law.
In our opinion - and on this point, Mr Wurtz, I cannot agree with you - the French State, the Italian State and the German State are sovereign.
The European Parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision.
This is my conception of Europe.
In the current situation, I would simply ask you to say that we will wait and press for a decision by the Council of State as to whether or not Mr Le Pen' s request is suspensive.
This can happen very quickly.
This would not be a decision on the substance, even though it is purely a legal matter, but on the form.
If the Council of State decides today that its decision is not suspensive, the European Parliament can, within 48 hours, take the necessary decision.
I would therefore ask you to withdraw your request for a vote so that we do not reach a total impasse.
Madam President, the first thing I wish to say is that I think it would be unworthy of the European Parliament to be at loggerheads over this issue.
We should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind.
My second point is that you decided, on the basis of Rule 7(4), to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That is your right.
However, if I have understood correctly, we do not have a proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee as a basis for a vote, but you did ask the Committee on Legal Affairs for its opinion.
There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up.
I have in mind the difference between Article 12 of the Act on the election of Members by direct universal suffrage and Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure.
There is a discrepancy here.
My advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy.
That is your task, Madam President.
There is nothing we can vote on until you have cleared this up with the Committee on Legal Affairs.
(Applause)My advice is therefore that we should not hold a vote today, but that we should await your decision, Madam President.
(Applause)
I agree with Mr HÃ€nsch.
I see that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is applauding Mr HÃ€nsch. I therefore assume that he agrees with Mr CohnÂ­Bendit and will withdraw his request as this is not a genuine proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee.
This is the best solution for everyone.
Equal treatment
Madam President, the agenda features an extremely important report by Mrs Buitenweg, yet, with all due respect, we are going through it rather quickly.
Especially given that we only voted on her report this week in the parliamentary committee, we have since had very little time to work on amendments for the plenary.
But to make matters worse, I have to say that, in this case, Rule 115 applies, which states that, except in the cases of urgency referred to in Rules 50 and 112, a debate and vote shall not be opened on a text unless it was distributed at least 24 hours previously.
The latter, Madam President, was unfortunately not the case.
As I understand, the French version was still not available this morning.
I suggest postponing the debate and vote on this extremely important report to the next part-session.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I wish to make three brief points.
The first concerns the point of procedure addressed by Mr Oostlander, namely that various colleagues felt, because of the sensitivity of the issue in hand, that they should like to have in their own language, as is their right, the text of the report and all the amendments to it.
This matter was signalled clearly at the Conference of Presidents last week - on more than one occasion, I understand.
I myself was absent, but I have had this confirmed to me.
In that case, when the sensitivity of the availability of documents was clearly signalled, why was it not prioritised by the services in such a way as to avoid this?
That is my first question.
Given the sensitivity, the Bureau, the House and the Conference of Presidents should be given a detailed account of this breakdown in the system.
My second point is that Mr Oostlander is perfectly within his rights to say that, under Rule 115, proceeding with the debate or the vote can be questioned as the documentation was not available 24 hours in advance.
He is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule, if he should so wish.
It is my understanding that all the documents and amendments in all languages were finally available about 3 p.m. yesterday.
I should like to have that confirmed.
If that is true, I should then like to suggest that we change our order of business for today and, respecting the 24-hour deadline, I would ask the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, to introduce her report at 3 p.m., followed by a debate, urgencies and then the vote, which would fully respect the 24-hour deadline.
There is one point that, to many of us, is the issue of substance in this report.
We have under the Treaties the power now to bring in new anti-discrimination legislation.
Of all the areas of political sensitivity in contemporary Europe, that dealing with racism and xenophobia should be given the highest priority in this House.
The Portuguese Presidency will organise a Social Affairs Council which we can engage with if we deliver a view.
I appeal to the House to make creative use of the possibility open to us, in setting our agenda, to recognise this substantive political requirement and to facilitate a debate at 3 p.m. and a vote at 6 p.m. or thereafter this evening.
Thank you, Mr Cox.
Before giving the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, I can tell you that the report was available in all languages yesterday afternoon and that the amendments have only just become available.
It is quite clear that we are not within the time limit established in Rule 115.
Madam President, I am delighted with Mr Cox' s proposal and I think that it is also a viable compromise.
I regret that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have quoted Rule 115, because the last version of the text, which was the French one, was actually issued at 1.02 a.m.
It is now 23.5 hours later.
Maybe they need this last half hour to prepare for their debate, but it does seem that they seized on this as a rather lame excuse.
However, I am in favour of the compromise of starting this debate at 3.00 p.m., and I also hope that we will be able to finish it this afternoon.
I would like to point out once more that it is indeed extremely important to finish it during this sitting because, otherwise, we will lose all authority which we can still exercise in the Social Affairs Council, to be held on 5 and 6 June and, in that way, the report' s significance will be seriously undermined.
Mr Poettering, the law affecting any given issue is subject to interpretation.
I believe that the position adopted by Mr Cox - who formed a strategic majority with you in order to have Mrs Fontaine elected - is a compromise that makes it possible for everyone here to vote for a report on racism with their head held high.
Opinions may be divided about Austria, but when it comes to making it clear what our position is on racism in Europe, we should not get bogged down in a formal debate as we did just now, we should make it plain that we are clear-thinking people.
So I appeal to you to accept Mr Cox' s compromise so we can proceed with the debate with our heads held high. Please, I beg you!
Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to insist on Rule 115 and it is essential that it is checked how and when the translations were provided.
However, in line with Mr Cox, I deem it slightly inconvenient if, for that reason, this text will be debated on Friday morning, because this will surely cause a moral dilemma for a number of people.
That is another issue.
Mr Oostlander, this situation clearly comes under Rule 115 and Mr Cox' s proposal takes account of this rule.
If I have understood correctly, and the proposal is accepted by the rapporteur, he is proposing that we discuss this issue this afternoon and vote tomorrow, in which case the deadlines in Rule ...
Mr Cox, please restate your proposal as the deadlines in Rule 115 must be respected.
Madam President, the proposal which I have made and I shall repeat is that we should consider holding the debate at 15.00 hrs followed by the urgency debate, followed by votes on the report, other reports that are completed in debate and urgencies this afternoon.
We agree.
I am now looking to see whether the deadlines would be respected in this case.
They would.
I therefore put Mr Cox' s proposal, as accepted by the rapporteur, to the vote.
Madam President, yesterday my Group presented a request that all procedural questions related to this report should be subject to roll-call voting.
I would ask you to accept this request.
A roll-call vote is possible on this issue as the compromise proposed by Mr Cox respects the Rules of Procedure.
(Parliament gave its assent) The debate on Mrs Buitenweg' s report will take place at 3 p.m.
Mr President, just one specific question: when will the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance start, given that it was quite definitely and firmly set for 3 to 5.30 p.m.?
This really is a mess!
At what time will it start?
I have a right to know.
Mr Posselt, considering the time necessary for the debate on Mrs Buitenweg' s report, the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance will take place at approximately 4.30 p.m.
Trafficking in women
Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report, that is to say, all collaborators, but also the people from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the interpreters, who have worked very hard.
This report is also a reaction to the excellent communication by the Committee on new measures to fight trafficking in women.
By way of preparing for the report, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities organised a public hearing which involved experts and the presence of a victim who came to give her story.
A delegation of this committee, together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, visited a shelter for victims of trafficking in people.
Moreover, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Member States and candidate countries received a questionnaire on how they tackle trafficking in women, the results of which will be made available to the European Commission.
The report primarily aims to fight trafficking in women, but also in children and men, that is to say in people in general.
Trafficking in children does exist, but they are used as adults.
Men, too, are victims of trafficking in people and are sexually abused.
In fact, the sex industry is not the only market on which the victims of such trafficking are sold.
In Belgium, 40 percent of the victims end up on the labour market, in the textile, hotel and catering and fruit-picking industries, bakeries and the construction industry, or as house staff or au-pair girls, obliged to work as slaves in degrading conditions.
Victims are also recruited for the marriage market, as well as to sports clubs and football clubs.
According to estimates by the United Nations and the International Organisation for Migration, the IOM, every year four million people throughout the world fall victim to trafficking, 500 000 of whom end up in Europe.
All the signs are there that the number of victims is rising and that the influx from Central and Eastern European countries has exceeded the existing stream from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.
In a report by the United Nations, it is stressed that trafficking in people is one of the fastest growing forms of organised crime.
The huge profits and relative safety for the perpetrators who generate this type of crime will undoubtedly have something to do with this.
The penalties for smuggling narcotics, for example, are far higher than those for trafficking in women.
Victims are often unable to speak out on account of the illegal situation they are in.
Since there are clear indications that these problems are developing within the framework of international networks, it is important that these problems are addressed and tackled at European level.
In order to tackle trafficking in people adequately, we first of all need a clear definition of trafficking in people.
Priority must also be given to the fight against organised networks which are not only involved in trafficking in people but which are also involved in all kinds of other criminal activity, such as the trade in narcotics, arms and such like.
I therefore applaud the new Community initiatives concerning money laundering where the income from trafficking in women plays a major role.
Various initiatives have already been taken at European level.
Efforts to increase public awareness have got off to a good start in the form of activities on the part of Interpol and Europol, initiatives in every individual Member State, Habitat projects, etc. However, the harmonisation of the different national legislations in this field and the ensuing discrepancies in methods of investigation and prosecution have to be tackled at European level as a matter of priority.
From a survey organised in connection with this report, it is quite clear that there are considerable discrepancies in this sphere between the Member States and between one candidate country and another.
Some countries which have strict legislation on prostitution do not even have any legislation at all on trafficking in people.
By introducing the STOP programme, Europe is striking while the iron is hot, and opportunities for collaboration have opened up.
Last year, the Council adopted the DAPHNE programme. This is a new policy tool intended to prevent all kinds of violence - physical, sexual and psychological - against women and children.
It is encouraging that, in the first half of this year, the Commission wishes to submit detailed proposals for harmonising criminal legislation in the Member States on trafficking in people with a view to their sexual exploitation and, specifically, proposals for granting temporary residence permits to victims who are prepared to cooperate in the investigations which are necessary if legal action is to be taken against the traffickers.
Scanning the amendments, I have the impression that some people want to hijack this report, which is about victims of trafficking in people, to start a debate on prostitution.
In the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, a clear decision was made to discuss trafficking in women, or forced prostitution, within the framework of this report.
A debate on whether or not to ban or legalise prostitution may be pressing, but cannot be held at this point in the interest of the victims of trafficking in people.
As I said, trafficking in people is not just about the problem of demand for prostitution.
Victims of trafficking in women also find it extremely difficult to re-integrate into their place of origin and even within their own families.
Once they have, as victims, worked in prostitution, they are labelled prostitutes for the rest of their lives or, as the saying goes, once a prostitute, always a prostitute.
The initiatives which have been taken are the first step towards a solution but the number of victims continues to grow.
A great deal therefore remains to be done.
We have submitted proposals on prevention, reception of victims and legislation.
A society faced with such a phenomenon has a moral duty towards the victims and must give a high priority to the fight against trafficking in people and to victim support.
. (FR) Mr President, this report is vitally important.
We are profoundly affected by the tragedy of trafficking in women which is a modern form of slavery.
Our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims.
We must fight to eliminate all the links in the chain, namely recruitment, transport, managers, middlemen and clients.
By holding this debate today in the European Parliament, we are helping the victims to regain their dignity and integrity.
Women and children are being traded like goods and doomed to prostitution.
Trafficking in women is an important type of trade for organised crime which regards human beings as goods to be bought and sold.
Misfortune, misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries.
They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married.
They have no idea of the miserable conditions in which they will be exploited, beaten, tortured and threatened.
Over half of the victims are under the age of 25 and around 10% are between 15 and 18.
Even if these very young girls seem willing, because they are being threatened or are in love, we cannot, at any price, allow prostitution to continue freely when you see how these women are terrorised and traded.
This is why, in our opinion, we cannot use the term 'forced prostitution' in this report.
Trafficking in women involves terrible sexual exploitation.
We must help these victims to speak out and denounce their living conditions.
We must welcome and help them.
The pimps are very violent and victims must pay off large debts to cover the cost of their journeys and the various identity documents which they must acquire.
When they resist the pressure of traffickers and pimps, they are threatened either personally or through their families.
The traffickers belong to a Mafia-like criminal organisation and control several links in the network that has power over the victim.
There is no way out for victims and the very nature of the environment in which they work often reduces them to despair and drug addiction.
Some even go as far as committing suicide.
Fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this.
It is therefore vital to establish a system of information and preventive education for both young people in the countries concerned and also clients who are often what we would call 'family men' .
We should not forget that trafficking has economic roots.
Inequalities and relationships of dependency between privileged and disadvantaged countries mean that it is still always the weakest in society, particularly the women, who pay the price.
We demand a coherent European policy which is why this report is so important.
Trafficking in women is a crime. Trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation are unworthy of humanity.
Mr President, it has already been said.
We are touching upon an important topic here, namely that of people' s dignity.
As has been said, it is not just about trafficking in women, although that is the subject of the communication, but it extends to trafficking in people generally.
Men, girls and boys, are also involved.
It is a growing problem in the EU, too.
Trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative.
Not only do women from Asian countries fall victim, but also more and more women from Central and Eastern European countries, including women from candidate countries.
They are lured under false pretences - through job advertisements, for example - into becoming hairdressers or into working in bars or as dancers, or else they are enticed via the lonely hearts columns.
Women are often easy prey, given the poor conditions they live under.
Trafficking in women is increasingly linked with international criminal organisations.
A great deal has been done, but still more needs to be done, especially when it comes to aligning different countries' legislation for the purposes of tracing and prosecution and when it comes to providing information to the police and courts.
This is why I welcome the European Commission' s initiative, as well as the specific proposals in the report, for example, with regard to the further harmonisation of legislation which may facilitate the tracing of victims and prosecution of offenders and make these activities more efficient; with regard to cooperation and coordination, especially during investigations, at police stations and in the courts; and also specifically with regard to the reception and protection of victims.
I hope it will be possible to adopt the amendment on non-governmental organisations, tabled by our group and amended in consultation with the Greens.
Whenever new needs arise, emergency help is often provided by people or groups of people who feel compelled to do something about these on ideological grounds or out of religious conviction.
These groups do not always get the recognition they deserve.
The amendment states that NGOs can also include ideologically-based organisations.
Finally, I would like to state that this is an important communication from the Commission.
It is a sound communication and a sound report on which I would like to congratulate Mrs SÃ¶rensen.
I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it.
Mr President, the shameful truth is that our prosperous and free Europe is tolerating a lucrative trade - the trafficking in women - which involves torture, inhumane treatment and flagrant violations of fundamental rights.
The victims have described savage beatings, rapes, abductions, death threats and, on occasions, murders.
The real scandal is that we not only tolerate it in Europe, but we contribute to its expansion.
Every time members of the public purchase the sexual services of a woman trapped in a trafficking ring, they are adding to the abhorrent wealth of these criminal organisations, which employ increasingly cruel methods.
Unfortunately, the institutions' search for solutions is progressing very slowly, and the problem is growing.
In any event, we should recognise that the European Commission' s proposals are, on the whole, reasonable and hopefully useful.
Nevertheless, and given the cross-border nature of this crime, we need to harmonise its classification in all the Member States, including cross-border aspects and universal jurisdiction.
The receiving countries should grant the victims a temporary residence permit for the duration of legal proceedings, regardless of whether or not they wish to testify.
Furthermore, the extremely harsh conditions in which the victims live more than justify the Member States granting them permanent residence permits for humanitarian reasons.
Furthermore, persecution on the basis of gender and, specifically, the trafficking in women, should be considered appropriate grounds for the granting of refugee status.
If we really want to help the victims, we must guarantee their safety as well as that of their families and compensate them through the seizure of the networks' assets.
These victims should also have free access to shelter, medical and psychological assistance, social services, help in finding work, etc.
All of these considerations have been approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, but they will not be enough.
Combating the trafficking in women and immigration policy must become a priority within the political agenda of the European Union and the Member States.
Immigration policies which revolve around the consequences and which are not aimed at tackling the causes will do nothing more than exacerbate this terrible pattern of exploitation which is tantamount to slavery.
Poverty, social inequality and armed conflict explain migratory flows.
Until we find overall solutions to the question of development, the number of people searching for a better life will be unstoppable and migratory pressure uncontainable.
So let us analyse, assess and implement genuine development and integration policies.
At the end of the day, the fight against the trafficking in human beings, as well as being essential to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, is an unavoidable ethical duty.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs SÃ¶rensen.
Not only is she proficient, she is also extremely committed to the subject matter.
The fact that she managed to put this important topic on the European agenda is a huge achievement.
Trafficking in women has been overlooked for too long, and politicians underestimate its importance.
A good illustration of this is that it is now three years since the Justice Ministers declared that it was important to appoint national rapporteurs to monitor trafficking in women.
This actually happened in the Netherlands, not least thanks to the efforts of Secretary of State Verstand.
Unfortunately, many Member States still do not have national rapporteurs and they really should remedy this as soon as possible.
At the same time, legislation as well as cooperation are inadequate.
This report offers many ideas and specific proposals and therefore has the backing of the Liberal Group.
There are, however, two points which may seem commendable, but to which we are unfortunately unable to subscribe.
The first concerns automatic refugee status for victims of trafficking in women.
In our opinion, this is a bridge too far, because this would require the entire Geneva Convention to be overturned.
We do find it important, however, that it should be possible to grant residence permits on humanitarian grounds.
We will therefore continue to support this proposal.
Our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof.
What is required here is tantamount to surrendering an important and fundamental part of legal protection, namely the fact that one is considered innocent until proven guilty.
This principle is important in a constitutional state.
The concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace.
To incorporate this principle into criminal law would be a huge step.
Liberals attach great importance to legal protection and we are not prepared to take that step now.
Finally, the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency.
This is why it would be wrong to weigh down this discussion with moral judgements on prostitution, as certain people here are attempting to do.
If we do this, it will make the discussion infinitely more complex and will get in the way of effective measures against the trafficking in women.
This should not happen.
The problem is urgent and effective measures are required.
Not just words, but deeds are what are needed now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to speak on behalf of the Greens as my colleague has had to accompany the Member who was taken ill.
In my opinion, it is very fortunate that Mrs SÃ¶rensen should have been given the responsibility of preparing this report on trafficking in women.
There are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for Mrs SÃ¶rensen has been concerned for over 20 years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution.
We should therefore place our full trust in her proposals. I myself totally support her report.
However, I should like to comment briefly on the discussions held on this subject in committee and also in the Member States, given that the United Nations Conference on the situation of women throughout the world, to be held in New York in June, is now approaching.
In these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women, prostitution and pimping.
They have therefore encouraged a certain amount of generalisation and are, as a result, opposed to any form of debate on these issues, hiding behind moral considerations such as the inalienability of the human body and its treatment as a saleable commodity.
To this end, they have attacked the latest report by the International Labour Office on trafficking in women and prostitution, and the work of Mrs Lin Lean Lim highlighting the need for a statute to protect prostitutes. They have also decried Europe as a pimp on the grounds that certain countries are trying to establish non-abolitionist legislation in this area.
We surely cannot leave an issue such as this in the hands of associations of which some, and only some, having fought against abortion, are now refusing the distribution of condoms to prostitutes, which they see as encouraging prostitution.
There is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate.
The only solution for prostitutes is to be integrated within a common law system, to look after themselves, to live decently, to defend themselves against the violence to which they are subjected by pimps, clients and institutions. The only solution is to recognise prostitutes as such and, as a first step, to give them a voice.
Recognition of their professional activity, full social rights and police protection from any form of violence are what they are demanding.
We must listen to them.
Whether legislation is abolitionist as in France, prohibitionist as in Sweden or even sometimes regulatory, if it fails to recognise a whole population this can only reinforce discrimination against forced immigrants and also prostitutes, irrespective of whether they are immigrants or not.
The ineffectiveness of the law reinforces the enslavement of male and female prostitutes by pimps, for some, and the impossibility for others of living with dignity or of getting out of prostitution.
This leads to a breakdown in any fragile solidarity and further damage to their self-image. Mrs Roure is right in her analysis of this problem but we accept that different solutions must be examined and that various proposals must be made and considered.
The Commission absolutely must examine all forms of common legislation on prostitution which would give real status to prostitutes in order to protect these women and men from pimping, violence and marginalisation.
Mr President, to begin with, I want to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen for a very good, interesting and tremendously readable report.
We are almost one hundred per cent in agreement in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
We would emphasise not only the cooperation from the police which has fed into this report, but also the importance of contributions at all levels of society.
There are nonetheless two things we do not entirely agree with.
The first concerns the role of the sex industry in this issue.
We are, all of us, right across the political spectrum, completely agreed that it is poverty that is the major cause of prostitution and trafficking in women.
I nonetheless believe that the sex industry, which is now moreover beginning to register some of its activities on the stock exchange, must be called into question and, in future, also held to account.
The other disputed issue is - as always where this subject is concerned - the view to be taken of prostitution.
Almost throughout the report, the term enforced prostitution is used.
However, the use of this term implies that there is an opposite, that is to say voluntary prostitution.
That is very strange, especially when we are talking about slavery and trafficking in women.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has tabled a few amendments, some of them on this subject and in connection with which we naturally hope that we shall receive support.
I would again thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen and all our colleagues.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the last time we debate this issue, even though it is so far only the second time we have done so.
Mr President, trafficking in women is not just a women' s issue. It also falls within the wider global context of international crime and trafficking in human beings.
Raising such an issue today might seem anachronistic but slavery will indeed be a part of the 21st century.
It is a potent force which takes advantage of the misery of the displaced who travel the world against their will, who are sold, bought and then brought to Europe.
Nothing is preventing these global pimps from pressurising families to sell their children and luring girls to Europe to make them work and become prostitutes.
During a conference organised jointly by the United States of America and the Philippines in March, the very lucrative aspect of this new market was also raised.
Trafficking in human beings is, after drugs and weapons, the third largest source of income for organised crime.
Yet trafficking in human beings is, above all, a violation of human dignity and human rights.
Our societies are demanding the right to happiness, pleasure and freedom, and the removal of taboos.
It seems not to matter if people, women and children in particular, are paying the price by being dragged down into the underworld.
Prostitution is a form of slavery which we like to make out to be exotic and romantic in order to hide its tragedy and sordidness.
Yet it is actually a denial of freedom.
These crimes are committed solely for the sake of pleasure and are treated with widespread indifference by a society which accepts prostitution as the oldest profession in the world. This is also true of pornography which is found in the daily papers, on television and on the Internet, where everything can be bought, even girls.
Prostitution, trafficking in human beings, sex tourism and paedophilia are all issues highlighted by the media which are gradually becoming less taboo.
So much the better, for the resignation shown towards what society has deemed to be irreversible is intolerable.
We must now help these people whose bodies are being exploited for commercial purposes, both in our countries and in their countries of origin, by increasing aid for development, education and cooperation between countries.
The European Union must wake up to this situation and, rather than giving lessons to the women of the world, five years after the Beijing Conference, it would do better to clean up its own backyard.
Trafficking in human beings is incredibly widespread in our countries because the demand exists and because the European Union is adept at showing itself to be a greedy customer, disdainful of the distress caused to these adults and children who have been denied any choice.
To conclude, I will refer to the slogan of the seminar organised in Paris on 15 May under the patronage of the European Parliament which says that the humiliation of human beings through prostitution represents an intolerable attack on human rights.
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report on the tragic issue of trafficking in women.
We are sure that Parliament will adopt this extremely well-balanced report by a very large majority, for no one could tolerate the current violence perpetrated against women who are abducted or forced by deception and threats to enter the European Union, where they are compelled to live a life of forced prostitution or do some other sort of job under coercion.
We are all familiar with the horrific stories of prostitutes, often minors, who are abducted from their native countries, forced to enter the Union - we are told - illegally, raped and threatened with retaliation against their relatives or even killed if they have the courage to denounce their pimps.
The report recommends possible solutions which have already been successfully implemented, such as issuing victims with residence permits and providing protection and free healthcare.
These measures, which have already been successfully implemented in some States, must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union.
I would, however, like to draw your attention to a matter of paramount importance: is it not the direct and indirect prohibition of prostitution and the restrictive laws on immigration which are responsible for trafficking in women and forced prostitution?
Is it not the case that the victims of prostitution-related crimes are compelled to enter that profession because of their illegal immigrant status and their vulnerability, caught between the violence of their pimps and the forces of the law?
Is it not the very fact of prohibition which renders the phenomenon it is intended to control uncontrollable, tragic and inhuman?
And why should those people who, of their own free will, want to be prostitutes have to suffer from what is essentially a ban on related activities and the subterfuge which, in practice, criminalise the practice of voluntary prostitution, even though prostitution is formally legal in many Member States?
Moreover, would the legalisation of voluntary prostitution not also allow foreign prostitutes to improve their situation in that they would no longer be obliged to work illegally in violent conditions as they are now?
For this reason, we have tabled two amendments: the first amendment calls for the preparation of a cost/benefit analysis of the various laws and policies currently in place and those which may be adopted in the future; the second amendment proposes measures to protect adults from criminal exploitation and violence, adults who, in all freedom from direct or indirect coercion, choose to work as prostitutes, accepting to run their business in accordance with legal procedures.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, simply raising a problem is an admission of its gravity.
Some 500 000 victims of the traffic in human beings arrive each year in Western Europe.
It is imperative to tackle trafficking in women because, having shown its determination to fight money laundering, drug trafficking and organised crime, the European Union has forgotten that trafficking in human beings is one of the major aspects of organised crime.
I must congratulate Mrs SÃ¶rensen on her report which has come on the eve of the enlargement of the Union to the CCEEs, which are often singled out as the countries of origin or transit in prostitution and modern-day slavery.
As for the method, I must say that the fight against trafficking in human beings does not necessarily need full communitarisation but rather close cooperation between Member States under the aegis of Europol and Interpol. These inter-state structures have proven their effectiveness on the ground.
Our aim is to ensure that trafficking in human beings is regarded as a criminal offence to be severely punished in all Member States. In doing so, examples must also be made of those responsible for instigating such networks.
Given the current state of legislation, we are faced with a wide diversity of penal traditions in our Member States.
Establishing specific offences at Community level would therefore lead to an impasse.
Instead, we must take inspiration from the method in the Schmid report on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment.
The Council of Ministers could, on a proposal from the Commission, draw up a list of criminal behaviour to be combated, which the Member States would be responsible for converting into criminal offences in accordance with their legal traditions.
To conclude, I am sure that this would render the action we are taking to combat this scourge more effective and that we would avoid the pitfalls of a harmonisation which would delay the measures which must now be adopted.
The debate on this report looks set to run into the afternoon, but more specific information on the continuation of the debate and the organisation of business for today' s sitting will be provided later on.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mr President, there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence.
The events last night in Copenhagen underline the importance of the European Parliament having this debate, as it decided to do earlier in the week.
Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000, the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it.
On the other hand, the British delegation, which is now 36 members, has retabled the resolution in its original form.
Mr President, I ask you to rule it admissible for this debate to now take place, as was the wish of the House earlier in the week.
The debate will take place as proposed.
The exact time will be announced later.
Vote
Mr President, I am very surprised at the order of voting here.
I would ask you to reverse it so that the compromise resolution by four groups, including the two biggest groups, comes first.
Mr Purvis, the way we work is that the first resolution tabled is the first taken.
When a compromise is created, if it contains the first resolution, that compromise is taken first, no matter how many groups are involved in the compromise.
Mr President, the resolution by the Green Group was tabled first.
It is perfectly correct that we should vote on that text first as we reached a compromise with a number of other groups.
Indeed, Members throughout this House have supported it. I hope they will do so during the vote - even some Members of political groups who have not supported that compromise - because the situation at Sellafield is serious.
Let us proceed with the vote and not reopen the debate.
(Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0414/2000) by Ms Ahern and others, on safety problems at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)

Report (A5-0094/2000) by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Fifth Report on the Implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package (COM(1999) 537 - C5-0112/2000 - 2000/2072(COS))
Mr President, I had requested the floor in relation to the vote on Zimbabwe, when we voted mechanically on 12 amendments presented by the so-called Technical Group of Independent Members, and having noted that in no case have they voted in favour of their amendments, they have systematically forced us to vote.
I say this in relation to the Provan report and the reform of the voting system in Parliament.
I believe this is an unacceptable way to proceed.
Mr President, I have an interest in a sector affected by the Commission communication which is the subject of this report.
As a result, I will not take part in any vote on this report.
I must do likewise with regard to the following report by Mr Alyssandrakis on radio spectrum policy, unless you can immediately formally acknowledge my declaration.
Mr President, Mrs Flesch quite rightly declares an interest in matters in which she has an interest. I suggest that such a declaration is not necessary when voting.
When Members are speaking in debate, either in committee or in plenary, they should declare an interest, but that should not prevent them from voting on a subject.
I do not want to have a debate on this.
I do not want to dig the rules up.
My own memory of the Rules is that you should do it before votes as well.
I also have a financial interest in telecom and space so I will not participate in the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0122/2000) by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on: "Next Steps in Radio Spectrum Policy - Results of the Public Consultation on the Green Paper" (COM(1999) 538 - C5-0113/2000 - 2000/2073(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0119/2000) by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission working document: "Towards a coherent European approach for space" (SEC(1999) 789 C5-0336/1999 - 1999/2213(COS))
After the adoption of two amendments:Ford, Glyn (PSE).
Mr President, on a point of order.
These two amendments are very similar to those which were rejected in committee.
Could we be clear that the rapporteur is giving the committee's view and not his own?
I think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0131/2000) by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions "Towards a European research area" (COM(2000) 6 - C5-0115/2000 - 2000/2075(COS))
Mr President, I wanted to make the following suggestion.
A number of amendments have been tabled which were, in fact, already in the text when the vote was taken in committee.
With your help, I would like to try to tidy up the report a little and remove a number of redundant items.
In addition, I have an oral amendment to paragraphs L, M, N and O which I have distributed to the different coordinators who assented to it.
This is a tidying-up exercise.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Mr President, in these circumstances, an own-initiative report and all this confusion, I propose that it be returned to the competent committee and that they do the work properly.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, is this a formal request on behalf of the Socialist Group?
Mr President, this is not a formal request, it is an unavoidable comment about the way this House deals with important matters.
We can only vote here on things that have really been worked through in committee.
It really is unacceptable to work like this in this Chamber!
Mr President, with great respect to the rapporteur, she is making a point which was not made at all in the debate last night.
This is a report which had to be produced in great haste.
Two committees made substantial input to it.
It may be that, in the end, there will be some redundancy, but there are different points being made.
Last night the Commissioner gave no indication that he found anything ambiguous or difficult.
It is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list.
I would like to thank everyone for their comments but I agree most with the comment made by Mr HÃ€nsch.
Maybe it is useful occasionally to look at how we set about things here in Parliament.
This seems a very enjoyable exercise.
I do not want to start another debate.
The Bureau is looking at the working methods of Parliament.
You will all receive a copy of Mr Provan' s excellent discussion document in the near future.
Mr President, the paragraph 13 which emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, states that the Legal Affairs Committee agreed to request biennial reporting, that is to say, reporting every two years.
Whereas, perhaps owing to my curious accent, it was transcribed as "biannual" , which would require two reports a year and would be over-egging the pudding!
I therefore request that this be orally amended to "biennial" .
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0125/2000) by Ms Smet and Ms GrÃ¶ner, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform (2000/2020(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
Before the House adjourns you might like to hear the proposal for the organisation of business for the rest of the day.
We are proposing at 3 p.m. to have a debate on the Buitenweg report, followed by the debate on items of topical and urgent debate.
At 6 p.m. we will vote firstly on Buitenweg and then on the urgency resolutions and then after that, on all the other votes on which the debates have closed.
That will be the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Twice this week we have been in a situation where groups have made requests for a roll-call vote on the final vote of a report and, just before the final vote, the Chamber is told that the roll call has been withdrawn.
What is the situation, because if, for example, a request for a roll call has been made, other groups do not actually make a request so the opportunity to hold a roll-call vote on the final report is denied us?
Could you explain what the situation is?
I accept that it is unsatisfactory that groups can withdraw their requests at any stage.
All I can suggest is a belt-and-braces approach.
If you want to ensure that there is a roll call, make a request on behalf of your own group as well.
I accept that it is not a very satisfactory situation.
Mr President, I think there should be an opportunity for someone else to take over the request for a roll-call vote.
There must be a chance to do this if another group withdraws its request.
That was the point here!
This is a matter for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Under the present rules there is nothing to stop Members withdrawing their requests for roll-call votes.
Mr President, I did not understand what was to happen with Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report.
Will the debate continue following the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance?
Otherwise, when is it intended that the debate should take place?
According to the information I received earlier, we were to continue the debate on Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report today, following the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
You did not say that this was to be the case, however, and I should therefore like to have it confirmed.
That is correct.
As normal after the votes, we will continue with the debates and the first two are SÃ¶rensen and Karamanou.
So we will carry on with the debates.
Mr President, I would also like to say a few words on the order of business for this afternoon.
You have indicated that we will start with the Buitenweg report at 3.00 p.m. and that we will vote at 6.00 p.m.
On our desks, we have found an anonymous document which states that we will be voting on the Buitenweg report and also dealing with any remaining votes at 6.00 p.m.
Secondly, the document lists the urgency, debate on which has been concluded, and thirdly, contains urgencies which have not been debated due to a lack of time.
I would like you to confirm whether the third point is being considered and I would like to register a protest against it, because that would mean that we would have to vote on urgencies that have not been debated.
This seems unacceptable to me.
That is correct and that is what the House has agreed to, so that is what we will be doing.
Mr President, I rise on a similar point, because I am not clear what the House has agreed to.
We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m.
What we could do is reduce the amount of speaking time for urgencies so there will be an opportunity for a debate on each of them.
It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed.
Mr Ford, that is not a matter for the President.
What we have decided is to allocate the first hour of what normally would have been the urgency debate to the Buitenweg report.
The house did that earlier.
That was a decision for the House.
The House is sovereign in these matters.
It is then up to the groups to decide how they allocate speaking time for the urgency debates.
If we have enough time we will do all the debates; if we do not, we will not.
It will depend on how the groups allocate speaking time between the different subjects and that is a matter for the groups, not for the President.
Mr President, we agreed that we would take the debate on Buitenweg, not that we would spend one hour on it.
For example, I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate, so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least.
It was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate, let us be clear on that.
You are right.
I said an hour.
It was a slip of the tongue.
I believe it is scheduled for an hour and a half.
Again, it will depend on Members' discipline, something that this House is renowned for.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building.
In the interests of transparency and information to Members, we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella.
Could you provide us with information on that?
What procedures have been put in place?
Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off?
Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system?
Could you confirm this and, indeed, could Parliament' s presidency confirm that there is no problem with asbestosis which, of course, would be in breach of our own EU directive passed over a decade ago.
I personally am not in a position to answer any of your questions.
I have no information on this subject.
You will have to refer the matter to the President and to the Quaestors.
I will certainly draw attention to your remarks.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Ferber report (A5-0121/2000)
Mr President, I was unable to assent to the Ferber report.
From Parliament' s viewpoint, there is always a reason to ask for more money for our own operations.
But the European Union will not become more democratic if the European Parliament receives more funding.
Public opinion within Europe requires us to be frugal.
The money that is available should be spent on the needs of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment, not on the European Parliament as an institution.
I am of the opinion that we could save ourselves a great deal of cost and unnecessary effort if we were to replace the system of reports and rapporteurs by getting the groups to react directly to the planned proposals, as is the case in most national parliaments.
Finally, I am also against donating tax money to European syndicates of political parties and against filling vacancies for interpreters in a way which offers newcomers a poor legal position.
Mr President, I was happy to vote for the Ferber report on the budget for the financial year 2001, but I am not very happy with the minimal amount of space, money and European Union funds it allocates to supporting activities benefiting pensioners and the elderly.
I do not mean that we have to allocate to pensioners, the elderly and their problems the same proportion of our budget as they occupy of society, i.e. approximately 32% at the last count. I am not saying that 32% of our budget should be allocated to activities related to the elderly, but I would, nevertheless, be very happy with at least 3%, or even 0.3%.
- (NL) I am 100% behind the proposal to in fact allocate 35 vacant posts, funded from the enlargement reserve, to the language sector, provided, however, that all languages of the candidate countries are represented.
This is why I have voted in favour of Amendment No 2.
It is essential that the European Parliament be well prepared for the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe.
This should coincide with the timely training of professional and highly skilled translators and interpreters.
As previous enlargements have shown, it is not viable to wait for this to happen.
Multilingualism is a prerequisite for the smooth running of the European Parliament for three reasons.
Firstly, on account of the principle of equality, according to which all Members must be able to carry out their work under the same conditions.
Secondly, due to the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament.
The European Parliament is the democratic representation of the people.
Thirdly, because of the requirement of usefulness.
Multilingualism boosts the efficiency of parliamentary work.
In order to give concrete form to this requirement of multilingualism, we need a debate as a matter of urgency.
In this connection, I would refer to the final report of the working party on "multilingualism" , compiled under the guidance of Mr Cot, in which various specific options have been suggested.
Whichever is adopted, it is clear that linguistic preparation for enlargement should not be postponed any longer.

Mr Ferber' s report, which we are debating today, highlights the need for a more rigorous budget policy for our institution. We are in favour of this.
The limited increase of 2.28% in Parliament' s budget proposed for the financial year 2001, which works out at EUR 987.8 million, seems acceptable, all the more so as this proposal uses a realistic inflation rate of around 2%.
The amount proposed corresponds to 20% of the appropriations for heading five and therefore respects the ceiling which the European Parliament itself set for 2001.
However, in view of the need to deal with the consequences, including linguistic ones, of future enlargements, this limited increase in the budget of our institution more than ever requires rational and responsible management of this budget.
In terms of staff policy, an analysis should therefore be carried out, as requested in the report, of the current profiles of the institution' s staff, in the light of Parliament' s clearly changing needs, in order to make the best possible preparations for the necessary structural adaptations.
With regard to the Court of Auditors' comments on the expenditure of the political groups, the resolution seems to be heading in the right direction by inviting the Parliament' s Bureau and Secretary-General to achieve complete transparency in the use of appropriations.
The French delegation of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot, however, accept the idea of entering appropriations intended for European political parties on a separate budget line. We have absolutely no doubt that this would eventually favour the alliances, associations and groupings of European political parties with an essentially federalist and integrationist aim.
With regard to language, this is by nature one of the most sensitive issues as it affects our identity, culture and pride. We are all more or less aware that the current situation cannot continue, even less so given the imminent enlargements.
As a result, it is up to us to reflect and to act wisely and carefully, without upsetting any sensibilities, but also without wasting any time.
One of the possible ways forward could be to recognise for each of us, as the elected representatives of our people, the inalienable right to speak in our own language. This would then be interpreted or translated into one of the three most widely used languages according to the demographic, cultural and economic factors which prevail in the European Union.
These three languages are clearly French, German and English. In this way, respect for the identities, nations and cultures of Europe and cost-effectiveness in the daily work of the European institutions could be combined.
This solution would also have the virtue of recognising the three main cultures and origins of the European Union in its current composition, namely the Latin, Anglo-Saxon and Germanic components.
This solution would also offer the undeniable advantage of benefiting all the European candidate countries whose first foreign language is French, German or English.
Finally, whereas one of these languages is particularly important in Europe, the other two are used worldwide.
- (NL) Democracy inevitably costs a great deal of money.
We are voting on a Parliament budget to the tune of nearly EUR 1 billion!
A huge sum, although it remains within the agreed 20% of the estimate for all European institutions put together.
We owe it to the citizens of Europe - the taxpayers, who have to produce this kind of capital - to keep the costs in check.
Reading in paragraph 18 about the buildings which Parliament needs, we can only conclude that a considerable amount of Community money is being squandered.
Indeed, the European Parliament has no need at all for the building in which we are meeting this week!
We have everything we need in Brussels in terms of facilities.
Let it be clear that we have no need to buy this glass palace, whatever - I am sure - necessary conditions are being met.
Recently, more than 400 Members once again stated that we want to decide for ourselves where we meet.
We are hardly blaming the rapporteur for overlooking this in his report, which certainly deserves appreciation, for example, when he calls on the Council and European Parliament to agree on the statute of the Members.
This Parliament should be deeply ashamed of the fact that, one year after the elections, this is still not even in sight.
The budget line suggested by the Court of Auditors for European parties is really not necessary.
All-embracing budget lines of this kind blur our cultural and political diversity and increase the distance between ourselves and the citizen.
As far as the many thefts in the buildings are concerned, it is unacceptable that, despite an extensive security service, these can take place more or less on a daily basis.
With our vote against this budget, we want to send out a signal that a radical change is required in the priorities we set.
- (NL) I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Ferber, on his report, although I did not agree with everything and voted - against his recommendation - for Amendment No 2 and against Amendment No 8 of his draft resolution.
I have done so with great conviction because I am of the view that we as the European Parliament do not send out a political signal or pre-empt a political decision by adopting the Secretary-General' s proposal (and filling 35 vacancies in the language sector) but accomplish this by doing the exact opposite.
As long as the House rules on language use are not amended, the candidate countries and ourselves can assume that the language arrangement will stay as it is, that is to say: first of all, that each MEP can use his own language at official meetings.
Secondly, that each MEP has documents in his language at his disposal.
Thirdly, that we in this way are not only treating the Members equally but above all, the citizens we represent.
- (DE) I voted for Mr Ferber' s report on our budget for 2001, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without protesting in the strongest terms against what can only be described as the blackmail practised against certain categories of officials, particular more junior ones, so that they find themselves 'voluntarily compelled' to transfer from Luxembourg to Brussels, on the pretext that they are in Brussels or Strasbourg 'en mission' , i.e. on business, for more than 50 working days per year.
The European Parliament now has three places of work: Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg.
This was agreed by the Heads of State and Government at their summit in Edinburgh years ago.
We have to live with this, and with its financial consequences, which are not so great, and which are certainly justified by avoiding unhealthy centralisation in Brussels, as is unfortunately practised by a good third of the present Members of the European Parliament.
We are now suffering from an example of this centralisation at the hands of certain Green Members, who prevented a number of important votes on the Friday of the April Strasbourg part-session, because the quorum of one third of the Members present was not established.
I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1965, with a break between 1974 and 1989, so I have 20 years' of attendance behind me, during which time I was present at every Friday sitting in Strasbourg.
The flimsy arguments put forward by those who want to reduce the European Parliament' s five-day week in Strasbourg to four days, and who would also prefer not to turn up here on Mondays, are part of their salami tactics, which are obviously aimed at sabotaging Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg for 12 sittings each year, not to mention their objective of transferring the offices of the Secretariat from Luxembourg to Brussels.
The Bureau now intends to present a working paper by a British Vice-President which proposes moving all the services and Directorates-General from Luxembourg to Brussels.
The idea is to keep at most the specialist services such as the printing and translating services in Luxembourg.
This cannot and will not happen.
It would be a clear infringement of the letter and the spirit of the decisions made by the Heads of State and Government about Parliament' s places of work, and this needs to be said here in the clearest possible terms.
I have a word of warning for those people who are using these salami tactics against Strasbourg and Brussels.
We will thwart your highly undemocratic machinations against democratically reached decisions about Parliament' s places of work and about the calendar of meetings - because we have right on our side.
Katiforis report (A5-0134/2000)
I voted for the Katiforis report on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States because of the important points contained therein, but I did so unwillingly.
This was because this report repeatedly states that we must react to the fact that the population is ageing and control it - the number of elderly people is constantly increasing, making it difficult to maintain pension systems - and that we need to be vigilant and call upon the Member States to spend increasingly less money on pension payments for the elderly.
In my opinion, it is absolutely unacceptable that the elderly continue to be blamed for national budgetary difficulties.
Mr President, as the rapporteur rightly mentions in the second point in his report, budget consolidation must be given the highest priority at present.
We can only increase the confidence of the public and, above all, of the financial markets in the euro by means of consistent budgetary discipline. I say all this bearing in mind that the euro yesterday sank near to its historic low of 3 May.
The rapporteur was unable to include the stability programme which has now been presented by the Austrian Government in his report.
I would therefore like to point out that the new government is determined to overcome the problems that the previous government left behind.
The old government led by the Social Democrats certainly did not bequeath it an easy task.
However, all the commitments in the Stability Pact should now be fully met for the year 2000.
. (EL) Despite the objective of increasing productivity, investment and employment levels in the Union, the Commission' s broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community are a set of negative guidelines: continuing budgetary restrictions which go beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact, wage restrictions, tax reforms for the benefit of the better off, further disintegration of the labour market and the crucial importance of competition policy, which brings pressure to bear on the principles of social justice.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy, despite the sensitivity of its rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, has maintained the spirit of the Commission' s recommendation, which is why I shall vote against the motion for a resolution.
The Union should promote a policy which combines quantitative development with a reduction in working times, increased productivity, tax reforms to support society and development and the modernisation, not the eradication, of the public sector.
The Katiforis report is a crude apology for the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States.
Of its 29 paragraphs, eight start by showing approval and four by being self-congratulatory.
For the working population and just about everyone else in the countries of the European Union, there is really nothing for which to congratulate oneself.
What good is the economic growth vaunted by the report when it is recommended that 'reasonable attitudes in wage negotiations' are adopted, by employees of course, or when it is presumptuously claimed that 'a drastic revision of pension systems' is needed with the aim of 'safeguarding their financial soundness' ?
This is simply a way of acknowledging that, in this 'growth' which the Katiforis report asks Parliament to congratulate, there is no room for employees or pensioners.
Once again, the Council and Commission are acting on behalf of employers and are asking Parliament to give its backing to this.
As far as we are concerned, we were not elected to congratulate governments which help employers and major financial groups to get rich by exacerbating inequalities, leaving 18 million men and women unemployed, making flexibility and precariousness widespread and drastically reducing the wage bill in order to ensure continued growth in capital income, including in its most parasitic and speculative forms.
If, as the report states, it is true that growth is returning, it is simply disgraceful that only a small minority in Europe will benefit from this.
As a result we have voted against the report.
I approved Mr Katiforis' s approach and arguments in committee.
I was due to say this yesterday during the debate in plenary but a technical problem prevented me from doing so for which I apologise.
Like Mr Katiforis, I am delighted to see renewed growth in Europe.
However, also like the rapporteur, I know that this will not be enough to enable a return to a situation of full employment without the Member States adopting a proactive policy and, I would add, without a reduction in working hours.
Finally, I too would say that employment cannot be generated by unbridled liberalisation, accelerated privatisation and a reduction of social and labour protection.
I am not satisfied with everything on which we voted at midday but I have supported the rapporteur in the final vote.
- (PT) In its broad economic policy guidelines for 2000, the European Commission makes it clear that it advocates neo-liberal policies, emphasising as it does the Stability Pact and monetarist policies, faster liberalisation of the telecommunications, energy, postal services, transport and financial services sectors, together with an increase in flexible working arrangements and in the modernisation of social protection systems.
This means that despite referring to the need for active employment policies to combat unemployment and to achieve full employment in the medium term, the Commission continues to prescribe the same solutions, which have not brought any net improvement in employment, since the current unemployment rate is even higher than it was at the start of the decade, as the Commission recognises.
In this European Parliament report, the rapporteur makes some criticisms of the acceleration of the convergence and stability criteria objectives, insists on the need to increase investment and accepts the adoption of global fiscal measures in order to combat financial speculation. This is a positive step.
Nevertheless, he accepts faster liberalisation of the transport and energy sectors, an increase in flexible working and the process of budget consolidation already under way, thus highlighting his own contradictions.
We have presented various amendments with a view to improving the content of the report. In particular, these are designed to strengthen the position of small and micro-enterprises and their associations, to advocate jobs associated with proper rights and reduced working hours, and to call into question the Stability Pact and the consequences of implementing it.
Unfortunately, with the exception of support for SMEs, we were unable to have any of these amendments adopted, and have therefore voted against the report.
I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work.
The broad guidelines of European economic policy developed in this report seem to be heading in the right direction.
Full employment and the transition to a knowledge-based economy form our common aim for the first decade of the 21st century.
Whether or not the pessimists like this, all the economic lights are on green.
We must therefore be bold in order to continue the growth now being witnessed at European level.
The prospects for the years 2000 and 2001 are encouraging, with growth forecasts of over 3%. This will reinforce social links, increase solidarity and equal opportunities and, in particular, eliminate the inevitability of the mass unemployment which we have been enduring for too long.
This last point clearly poses the main problem.
Although unemployment has already gradually reduced, it is still at an unacceptable level throughout the Community, given the forecasts for 2001 of 8% unemployment among the working population. This is particularly true at the outer edges of the Community, in other words in the most remote regions.
As I have said many times before, the fruits of growth must be shared equally by all European citizens, both mainlanders and islanders.
This is the price of constructing a 21st century Europe with a human face in whose collective development everyone is involved. In this way we will all be able to make progress in our own individual areas, but still be heading in the same general direction.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Katiforis because I believe in this Europe.
The Katiforis report is an incredible demonstration of the lack of awareness among European capitalists.
It is based on a total misunderstanding of the reasons for the current recovery which is in no way the result of neo-liberal policies favouring wage austerity and a strong currency.
On the contrary, current job creations are due to an economic context characterised by an increase in consumption among wage-earners and a weak euro favouring exports.
Despite this convenient denial, the report proposes to plunge further into social regression.
It proposes increased flexibility in the markets, starting with the labour market.
It calls for 'wage stability' and exhorts the unions to adopt 'reasonable attitudes' in wage negotiations.
So as not to appear to be the direct spokesperson for employers, the report tries to include some social clauses.
Yet the contradictions are striking. How, for example, can it propose the reform or 'modernisation' of social protection, which in practice means replacing solidarity with financial products, and yet invoke a 'spirit of social cohesion' ?
How can wages be restricted 'in a spirit of fairness' when profits reveal unashamed exuberance?
The only other argument in the report invokes the use of new technologies to bring about modernisation.
But why should these automatically be allowed to threaten the European social model?
This crude materialism, sometimes attributed to Marxists, has now been adopted by cynical capitalists whose only aim is to extend the rule of trade regardless of social needs.
We have therefore voted against a text which is both foolish and repugnant.
Mr Katiforis' s explanatory statement is clearly better than the main body of his report which contains no hint of the criticisms that were set out on the Commission' s recommendation.
I and the National Front Members have voted against this report as we feel that it recommends the same old ineffectual and even harmful recipes. There is still too much emphasis on the markets, which regulate nothing, on ultraliberalism, particularly in the public services which the Commission would like to see dismantled, on sacrificing social protection for public investment to ensure budgetary stability, and on price stability, whereas inflation was curbed ages ago.
For workers there is wage moderation, a reduction in unemployment benefits and a relaxation of employment protection legislation.
Two points have particularly shaken us.
The first is that the Commission recommends that my country, France, which is struggling under the weight of tax and social security contributions, should not take advantage of this growth to reduce taxes. The reason given for this is to avoid stimulating with the budget a level of economic activity which is already vigorous.
Can you believe it?
Since when has growth been rejected in the name of outdated economic dogmas?
The second point is the almost total absence of any reference to the euro. This famous single currency which, it was said, would bring us a prosperous future and be snapped up by the whole world eager for competition with the US dollar, has been cold-shouldered, not only by investors who are investing in dollars in the USA, but also by the central banks.
No one has any confidence in the euro, which is no longer a floating currency.
Rather, it is a sinking currency, and nor do they have confidence in the European monetary authorities.
Wim Duisenberg is not Allan Greenspan, the ECB is not the Federal Reserve and the euro is not the dollar.
Europe has neither the employment rate nor the growth rate of the USA and it will take more than futile gestures to change this reality.
PomÃ©s Ruiz report (A5-0108/2000)
- (PT) The PomÃ©s Ruiz report rigorously defends the principles of the Solidarity Pact, particularly as regards fiscal consolidation as a means of ensuring the sole objective of price stability.
The analysis of the nominal convergence criteria is silent with regard to its consequences in terms of the risk of economic deflation, the adverse effect on public investment, economic growth and policies to combat unemployment.
However, the rapporteur goes even further in supporting the Commission' s recommendations.
He believes that it is necessary to anticipate in good time the objectives put forward in the stability and convergence programmes, so as to take advantage of the current 'much-improved economic environment' .
He therefore proposes swifter acceleration of fiscal consolidation, of structural reforms and of privatisation, and the "modernisation" of social protection, recommendations which have, in fact, already been made by the European Commission, particularly with regard to Portugal, in relation to the liberalisation of transport and energy and labour market flexibility, which is unacceptable.
We have accordingly voted against the report.
Goebbels report (A5-0135/2000)
Mr President, I have already declared, during the debate on the decision to allow Greece to enter the European single currency, that I am totally in favour of Greece' s immediate entry, for it has met all the criteria required by the Treaties of the European Union.
I would stress that I particularly welcome the fact - and that is why I voted for this decision - that no more budgetary restrictions are to be imposed on Greece, for, sadly, the brunt of this could not fail to fall upon pensioners and the elderly, in this case Greek pensioners and elderly people, who would be the victims of the exacerbation of the situation as regards the country' s budget, for Greece is willing to further reduce the negative elements of the Maastricht criteria and we have recommended that it do so, even though it does already fulfil these criteria, as has been stated.
- (EL) The legislative proposal of the European Parliament merely accepts the proposal by the Commission of the European Union, which confines itself to finding that "Greece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.
The derogation of Greece is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2000" .
On the surface, Greece does indeed meet the budgetary and monetary indicators required for EMU.
To this extent, and taking account of the position of my party, Synaspismos (the Coalition of the Left and Progress), in favour of Greece' s accession to Economic and Monetary Union, I have voted in favour.
Personally, however, I have strong objections to and reservations about the policies of EMU, which tie the Member States into rigid budgetary austerity, rising unemployment, worsening social conflict and unbridled competition, without being able to offer a strong European currency which is able to stand up to the dollar worldwide.
I am also totally opposed to the way in which the Greek government has achieved our accession to EMU, pursuing nominal rather than de facto convergence, making Greece one of the countries of the Union with the highest rates of unemployment and continually selling off the state' s assets in order to cover treasury deficits.
Unfortunately, these policies will not end when we accede to EMU; on the contrary, they will be institutionalised, consolidated and set in stone.
The Left and Progressive Forces of the Member States of EMU must extend their collaboration so that they can radically reform the way in which EMU is structured and so that priority can be given to social criteria and promoting the fight against unemployment, real convergence policies and viable and fair development policies.
- (EL) The European Parliament is being called upon today to give its opinion on the adoption by Greece of the single currency, now that the Commission and the European Central Bank have given the go-ahead.
We would start by pointing out that, as far as we are concerned, the matter is not technical, it is highly political.
It is precisely on the basis of the ideological and political aspects of the entire process of EMU and the single currency that we shall be voting against the admission of the drachma to the euro zone.
From a technical point of view, Greece has undisputedly managed to fulfil the criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third stage of EMU.
The problem, however, is how we got here and what happens next.
The nominal convergence criteria have been achieved at the cost of intolerable sacrifice on the part of the Greek people and as the result of a harsh austerity policy, the main features of which were, and still are, reduced social spending, a highly restricted budgetary policy, wage freezes, limited protection for workers, deregulated markets and greater privatisation.
Unfortunately, this policy, which has reduced large groups of the population to despair and has resulted in a dramatic rise in unemployment, a mass exodus from farming and the closure of factories throughout the country, will not be repealed when we enter the single currency; on the contrary, it will be stepped up.
Both the obligations imposed by the Stability Pact and the strict recommendations accompanying the reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank prove it.
Both demand that we continue the austerity policy, dismantle labour relations even more quickly, rush in measures to repeal the social security system and continue and accelerate the process of privatisation.
It is obvious that the workers have nothing to gain from Greece' s accession to the single currency amidst disorientating celebrations; on the contrary, they are even more certain to see a continuation, on stricter terms and with increased "supervision from on high" on the part of the EU, of the dead-end austerity policy which has been exercised for the last ten years.
Besides, those who speak of the need to safeguard the "sustainability" of the criteria seek solely to ensure that it is easier to harden the present policy and support the anti-grass roots measures yet to come.
The experience of other countries already in the euro zone proves that one new measure after another is introduced in order to reverse what has been achieved over previous decades and the "American model" is now the example to be followed by the famous European social model.
We, the MEPs of the ÃÃÃ, who stand by the positions to which we subscribed when the Maastricht Treaty was signed and which only the ÃÃÃ voted against when the time came to ratify it in the Greek national parliament, will be voting against Greece' s accession to the euro zone on the grounds of the workers' and Greece' s interests.
At the same time, we and the workers shall continue to fight against this policy and to promote an alternative development policy which focuses on man and his needs and which takes the opposite line from the reactionary policies of the 'democracy of the monopolies' .
- (NL) I have voted in favour of the Goebbels report and, as such, for Greece' s joining the single currency.
I have voted with just as much conviction for the amendments to the PomÃ©s Ruiz report.
These amendments specifically underline a sensitive issue which gave us plenty to talk about, not only in the plenary debate, but also in the Economic Committee meetings.
Many MEPs have expressed doubts about, in particular, the sustainability of the convergence and stability policy of the Member States.
We have all been able to see how the pleas addressed to Greece to make further efforts to reduce its debt and to obtain lasting stability do not only pertain to the situation of Greece itself, but also to the discontent about the way in which other Member States with a very high debt ratio have behaved, not making sufficient use of the options available to them, as a result of economic growth and low interest rates, to reduce the debt.
Let us hope that Parliament' s subdued criticism gets through to the relevant parties. This includes the Belgian government, which has already made so many pledges that even the press is starting to question the viability of this spending impulse.
Precisely because the hesitation expressed on the occasion of Greece' s joining the euro does not so much concern Greece as represent a general criticism, I am of the opinion that Greece should not be allowed to become the victim of this hesitation.
Greece is welcome in euroland, and all Member States in the euro zone must respect the letter and spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Sellafield resolutions
Mr President, the vote on Sellafield was a first for the European Parliament.
I think it is the first time that the European Parliament has spoken in favour of uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations.
I believe that the Council should, as a matter of urgency, and before the first accessions take place, resolve to draw up and implement such safety standards.
Randzio-Plath report (A5-0109/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Randzio-Plath report on the distortion of competition where public undertakings are concerned.
When Commissioner Monti gave his response at the end of the debate, he declared that the aid provided for public undertakings must not be out of proportion with the quality of the public service provided.
So I wonder: there are public and private television broadcasting companies in Italy, for example, where a great deal of money is allocated to the public television services. However, this is, in actual fact, excessive, for there is no difference between the service provided by the private broadcasting companies and that provided by the public broadcasting companies.
This is a distortion of competition.
Let us take another sector: state and private pensions.
State pensions are heavily financed but provide services which are inferior to those provided by private pensions: this is not true competition.
The report indicates the need for financial transparency between Member States and undertakings.
However, it is only interested in transparency with regard to public undertakings and only in terms of finding out whether state aid distorts competition between public and private undertakings.
The fact of an undertaking deciding to lay off some of its staff, leading to further unemployment, when a small part of its profits could be used to keep these jobs, is of absolutely no interest to the European Commission.
It is also not interested in the damage to the environment and to the safety and working conditions of employees caused by the race for maximum profits.
More generally, the Commission is totally unconcerned about the complete lack of transparency which surrounds the fundamental decisions of all undertakings, such as the way in which they make their profits and the way they use these, even if to the detriment of society.
We will vote against this draft directive and reaffirm that, in the interests of society, we must have total transparency in the operation and accounts of all undertakings, both public and private, and the abolition of secrecy in business.
The first step in this area should be to repeal all laws which threaten to punish the employees of an undertaking who tell the public and users everything they know about the workings of this undertaking.
- (PT) On the grounds that it is necessary to identify and prevent the granting of subsidies that distort competition and to increase transparency in relations between the State and public enterprises, the Commission is creating bureaucratic arrangements and real restrictions which may undermine the delivery of high-quality public services.
By taking as its basic philosophy the need to ensure competition between the public and private sectors, the Commission has, in fact, ended up undervaluing the important role of public enterprises which provide public services, and this is unacceptable.
The rapporteur' s original report recognised the value of "services of general economic interest" , but her report was subsequently amended, particularly with regard to public broadcasting systems.
We believe that it is right that the directive does not apply to public broadcasting organisations, in view of their specific nature, which cannot be divorced from the democratic, social and cultural needs of the various Member States, and the negative impact that this would have on their ability to fulfil their public service mission.
This was the reasoning behind our amendment, which was unfortunately rejected.
Resolution on poor countries' debt
The external debt of the developing countries poses a major challenge.
The 50 poorest countries spend twice as much servicing their debt as they receive in aid.
The UNCTAD report on sub-Saharan Africa shows that African countries have not received any benefit from structural adjustment programmes for over ten years.
The proposal is very restrictive and is limited to the poorest, highly indebted countries.
It imposes far too many conditions on the countries requiring debt relief.
I regret any conditions which are imposed, particularly any link between debt relief and the application of structural adjustment measures.
This is why I have abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution.
I am in favour of very substantial debt relief for all the countries concerned and debt cancellation for the poorest ones.
- (IT) I abstained from the vote on the joint resolution on poor countries' debt because I feel that it is wishy-washy and ambiguous in the face of the financial mechanisms known to us all which plunge the greater part of humanity into the most abject poverty.
Today, even the multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF are talking of reducing the debt, for the mechanisms stifling the economies no longer make sense, even from a neoliberal perspective.
At the June 1999 G7 Summit, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries talked of reducing the poor countries' debt to 90%.
If we look closely at these proposals, we see that they would not really be a solution, for if these measures were to be applied, they would only affect 8% or, at most, 10% of the debt of the 41 countries involved, which is, at the outside, 1% of the total Third World debt.
But these same measures are given minimal application, which has tragic consequences for the indebted countries, but which benefits the creditors themselves in terms of export loans, financial bodies and multinationals, for example.
First of all, we must acknowledge that the Third World debt is illegal.
Therefore, the European Union should promote an international, bilateral and multilateral action cancelling the Third World debt with no conditions attached.
The Member States must cancel the debts of the poor countries in practical terms and urge the international bodies which represent them to take similar steps.
We must ensure that the cancellation of debts is not conditional upon cooperation, as is often the case, or linked to any sort of structural adjustment measure.
We have to influence the financial mechanisms which caused this debt and the structural adjustment policies which continue to contribute to it, spreading poverty throughout these countries.
Resolution on Zimbabwe
It is in the nature of things that the extreme right should put forward crass arguments to defend the right of 4 500 landowners of European origin to monopolise the best land in Zimbabwe.
Yet the fact that the joint motion for a resolution calls for law and order to be enforced and condemns 'the illegal occupations' and accompanying violence is pure hypocrisy.
We might have more faith in the sincerity of the authors of this motion in 'deploring the recent murders, beatings and intimidation associated with the ...occupation' if they at least deigned to recall the past massacres in which a handful of colonists dispossessed the indigenous population of its land and the decades of colonial violence and apartheid used to preserve this situation.
The Mugabe regime is authoritarian and corrupt.
Yet neither this authoritarianism nor this corruption bothered the defenders of the wealthy minority and the old colonial power until this authoritarianism was used to attack their interests and privileges.
We have therefore not only voted against this motion but must also denounce the cynicism and hypocrisy of those who defend the interests of the privileged whites in Zimbabwe.
It will be up to the poor population of this country to settle its account with Mugabe and his regime, and certainly not the political servants of those who have grown rich by pillaging this country.
Paasilinna report (A5-0094/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Paasilinna report on the telecommunications regulatory package but I found it unsatisfactory as well.
Not enough effort is being put into these European Union directives on telecommunications, if it is true that the result is that, sadly, we are still without a European television frequency and we do not yet have a European television channel or even a mere radio station. Neither Parliament nor our meetings are broadcast anywhere in Europe.
European Union telecommunications directives ought to relate to the European Union.
In 1993 the European Union and the Member States undertook to liberalise the telecommunication services sector.
This undertaking led to the adoption of a series of directives.
Behind the regulations was a political objective of ensuring growth, employment and competitiveness and of giving everyone access to the information society while ensuring adequate legal protection.
The Commission has played a supervisory role in this which has resulted in a series of reports since May 1997.
The Commission communication before us today is part of this process and the assessment presented is balanced to say the least.
Approximately two years after full liberalisation, the telecommunication services markets in the Member States are characterised by a rising growth rate, many new arrivals and falling charges.
However, major problems remain.
A 'digital divide' is apparent between both regions and citizens.
The reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services.
The exclusion of some citizens from the new information technology society cannot be tolerated.
The preservation of universal service must therefore ensure the inclusive nature of this society.
We must make certain that the regulations being prepared, which have been submitted to this Parliament, adopt this approach.
Due to a desire to see the cost of access to the Internet lowered and for this to be accessible to all citizens, Parliament insists in its report on the need to open up competition in the local loop.
This measure must be thoroughly discussed with the national authorities in order to respond to the relevant objections.
A major effort must be made in terms of harmonisation and simplification of rules.
I am thinking for example of the rules on consumer protection, those governing the operation and role of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the licensing systems.
To conclude, I would say that the telecommunications liberalisation process is not an end in itself but a step towards ensuring the transition to the information society.
There is still a long way to go and we must not forget that the jobs created must be lasting and of a high quality.
- (PT) We feel bound to criticise the assumptions underlying this report, in particular those concerning faster liberalisation of the telecommunications sector, which are founded on the basic premise that this process has brought benefits to the users of these services.
We only need to look at Portugal' s experience in this respect.
Portugal Telecom, a public enterprise which has received billions of escudos of public investment, has been partially privatised, which has led to an increase in charges to what are called 'residential users' - the majority of the population - who today face the 'highest charges in Europe' .
As regards the workforce, thousands of jobs have been cut, stricter working conditions have been introduced, and in many cases workers are poorly paid and have few rights.
In other words, the overriding aim has been to maximise profit in a sector which is already highly profitable, and this has led to cuts in investment which have affected the quality of the overall service provided for the majority of users.
We do not think this is the right way to proceed.
We need a modern public telecommunications service which embraces technical and scientific progress.
We need an affordable public service based on equal access and guaranteed users' rights - a service that forms part of balanced development.
We also want to see improvements in conditions of employment for the workforce in this sector.
- (SV) It is extremely important that the EU' s legislation and accompanying rules in the area of telecommunications should be updated concurrently with the explosive global development where digital and mobile communication is concerned.
It is also important that this should take place within the framework of the conditions of the internal market and with a view to safeguarding free competition.
In this context, the report illuminates a number of important aspects.
What the report does not discuss, and what the Commission' s report does not take account of, either, are the different conditions prevailing in the EU' s Member States when it comes to developing and maintaining different types of network.
When it comes to Sweden, which is sparsely populated and where there are significant distances between one locality and another, the public service element has a relatively larger role to play than elsewhere when it comes to the functions and investments of the telecommunications industry.
Where society' s opportunities for investment and decision making are concerned, together with citizens' ability to access functioning communications networks of equal quality, the consequences of completely opening up the markets for telecommunications networks in the way described in the report are unclear.
I therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Alyssandrakis report (A5-0122/2000)
Mr President, I voted for this report, which is the first Alyssandrakis report on radio frequencies, which are nowadays used chiefly to advance mobile phone communications technology.
This directive also has some shortcomings, for there is insufficient focus on adaptation, teaching, refresher courses and the use of these new communications systems by pensioners and the elderly.
I am not referring to pensioners and the elderly in general, but, in this case, I am referring to my mother.
My mother lives in Rome. She is 85 years old, it is true, but I have not yet managed to persuade her to let me give her a mobile phone because she would not know how to use it.
She would find it extremely useful and also a saving, but she will not be persuaded.
I offered to teach her, but she refused.
This means that the elderly are not able to benefit from progress.
Alyssandrakis report (A5-0119/2000)
Mr President, in relation to the second Alyssandrakis report, I must mention my daughter.
When I met her this morning - I did not see her last night for I was here, in this Chamber, speaking on this report - she asked me: "But Daddy, is it true that you want to become an astronaut and go to the moon?
That is what they told me when I arrived here this morning."
I had to reply: "Yes, it is true" , for when I took the floor yesterday - and I repeat the request again now - I called for progress to be made in European space research and I mentioned the fact that, in the United States, there was an astronaut, a politician, who went into space at the age of 69, that is when he was a pensioner. I would like there to be a European astronaut, also a politician, who will become an astronaut in 15 years' time at the age of 69.
I therefore put my name forward to become the first European Union astronaut.
Maybe you should give your mother the spaceship and your daughter the telephone.
Mr President, although I voted for the report, I would like the following point to be minuted. Coordination of European research activity must not result in competition between research institutes disappearing.
The limits on communitarisation imposed by the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be kept in mind.
The standardisation of rights concerning intangible assets has already proved its value in the case of trademark law and copyright.
The present system for filing patent applications obliges the applicant to file a patent application separately in each Member State, which inevitably results in an undesirable fragmentation of the European market.
The logical conclusion is therefore to create a Community patent.
Decision makers at national level will have to be sufficiently far-sighted if this ambitious project is to succeed.
The competitiveness of the entire European Union must be taken into account when research contracts are being awarded.
Plooij-Van Gorsel report (A5-0131/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Plooij-Van Gorsel report on the communication "Towards a European research area" , although I would have been very pleased if the decision had at last been taken to place all the research carried out throughout Europe at various levels of government under the same umbrella. Town, provincial and regional councils all spend money on research, the individual State governments spend money on research and so does the European Union.
All this money should be managed by a single expenditure centre: the European Union.
I am concerned because I would like to see more research in the field of science which aims to prolong human life.
I am concerned because I would not like the State budgets and pension agencies to try to hold back this research, which would have negative implications for them because of the greater expenditure they would incur.
- (EL) Although there are certain positive aspects to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s report, it is driven by the perception that the purpose of research is to serve corporate interests and produce new knowledge - mainly of commercial value - on demand, within the framework of the liberalisation of the market and of competition.
Any research policy based on this sort of perception and which serves this sort of policy is bound to distort the nature of research as a procedure for producing new knowledge and as a productive power.
What research basically needs is an increase in its funding, which is unacceptably low for the European Union as a whole (1.8% of GDP compared with 2.8% in the USA and 2.9% in Japan), while countries such as Greece, which is at the bottom of the EU league, spend a miserable 0.5%.
Increased funding will allow new research activities to be developed and use to be made of the plethora of unemployed, highly-specialised young researchers, of which there is an abundance, at least in Greece.
Funding must be provided by public agencies within the framework of research activity programmes which will support both basic research and applications, the final purpose of which should be to improve the quality of life for all mankind and not swell the coffers of the monopolies.
International collaboration plays a primordial role in the research process, and its further development, both between the Member States of the EU and with other countries, would be both desirable and welcome.
However, ensuring that overall research efforts in the countries of the EU serve the interests of big business, solely with a view to increasing their profits, is undesirable and constitutes a repulsive prospect for the future of mankind.
This is why the MEPs of the ÃÃÃ shall be voting against Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s report.
- (PT) It is important to note that despite all the declarations of intent made by the European institutions about the new economy, and despite the trend towards a digital, knowledge-based economy driven by the existence of new goods and services, the European Union' s total research effort as a function of its GDP has been in continuous decline for ten years.
On average, the EU devotes just 1.8% of its GDP to research, compared with 2.8% in the USA and 2.9% in Japan.
According to the Commission communication, the gap between total public and private expenditure on research in the USA and in the EU is continuing to widen, having grown from EUR 12 billion in 1992 to some EUR 60 billion in 1998.
Similarly, in terms of employment, there are just 2.5 researchers for every thousand workers in European companies, compared with 6.7 per thousand in the USA and 6 per thousand in Japan.
Yet we know that research and technology contribute between 25% and 50% to economic growth and play an important part in the competitiveness, employment and quality of life of Europe' s citizens.
This being the case, how can the Heads of Government of the 15 Member States of the European Union pledge to achieve a new strategic objective for the next decade, that is to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledgeÂ­based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, unless they significantly change their research policy, and particularly the budgets earmarked for this?
It is in this way, through public investment and guarantees to respect workers' rights, that we will achieve better levels of development, not by insisting on the liberalisation of key sectors and of essential public services or on flexible labour markets.
Smet/GrÃ¶ner report (A5-0125/2000)
The recognition of women' s rights as an integral and indivisible component of universal human rights requires the adoption of accompanying measures which will allow this recognition to be transposed into concrete actions.
It also requires a subsequent evaluation of those measures, above all, so that they can be adapted in the event that they are not sufficiently effective.
This is why the Smet-GrÃ¶ner report, and the proposals contained in it, are so opportune and correct. I have therefore voted in favour of it.
Of particular importance is the request for specific preventive measures and measures to promote women' s health and guarantee their right to genetic health, as long as this right is not understood to mean the right to abortion but rather the right to the protection of the health of the expectant mother and the unborn child.
With regard to the promotion of equal opportunities in the context of policies on cooperation with development, I would like to point out that, in my view, efforts in this area should concentrate especially on guaranteeing girls' access to primary education, which means at the same time ensuring that it is free.
However, I regret the fact that the amendment that I presented on behalf of the PPE has not been accepted.
The prevention of adolescent pregnancies demands, above all, that we educate the young in the values which stem from their essential sense of self-worth and teach them to enjoy their freedom in a responsible manner.
. (PT) We voted in favour of this report because it highlights the most important aspects of our analysis of the follow-up to the Beijing Declaration and Action Platform.
We also think that the 2000 review process should in no way lead to a renegotiation of the commitments entered into in Beijing.
All the 12 key sectors are important and they must be tackled, given the sexual discrimination which exists in all areas, and since lack of progress in one sector will inevitably have repercussions on the other sectors.
We also believe that it is important to hold a further conference in five years' time with a view to assessing progress for women in the fields of equality, development and peace.
It is also of fundamental importance for the Council, the Commission and the Member States to do everything possible to combat violence against women, especially in the home, at the workplace, in society in general and in armed conflicts.
The report by Mrs GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Smet gives me the opportunity to look again at a questionable action platform.
As well as containing a Malthusian ideology, the Beijing Action Platform uses means of implementation which we condemn.
The UN already intends to rule the world by imposing a uniform vision, based on the western model, on all the regions of the planet, regardless of their existing cultures and laws.
In addition, in order to bypass the rules arising from its intergovernmental nature which subjects it to approval by its Member States, the UN is using the NGOs which it finances in order to implement its programmes everywhere and with much fewer constraints.
Where countries are reluctant, it is using blackmail based on financial aid to obtain the application, for example, of birth control measures.
Although it is vital for the specific role of women to be recognised in all societies, this must occur with full respect for the local traditions and regulations which are commonly accepted and which do not in any way prevent the dignity of women from being respected.
Such an approach ensures that the people concerned have a better understanding of these broad international texts.
We have also discussed and voted on Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report which deals with trafficking in women.
These two debates should make us stop and think about the real scope and aim of these major international platforms.
While they have succeeded in their aim of weakening still further the demography of western countries, they have not responded in a logical way to the more urgent question of protecting those women who are really in difficulty.
Once again, it is the ideology and egoism of some which have prevailed over concern for the common good. The culture of death has taken priority over the defence of life.
- The British Conservative Members decided to abstain in our vote on this report.
This should not be construed at all that we are not opposed to discrimination.
We are opposed to discrimination, we do believe in equality of treatment between men and women.
We do not accept, however, that the imposition of legal quotas is the way to achieve equality of treatment.
Quite the reverse.
We think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination.
We believe that women the world over and especially here in Europe are making a valuable and positive contribution to the democratic process.
We are convinced that role will develop fully and effectively without 'progressive' or 'artificial means' .
On the issue of making contraceptives more widely available we voted against the amendment because we believe these are issues of personal morality and conscience and not an issue where the European Union should be making a political stand.
For these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote.
- According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of the term "Reproductive Health" includes the term "fertility regulation" which contains "interrupting unwanted pregnancies" , i.e. abortion on demand.
In the interest of subsidiarity, paragraphs and related amendments dealing with reproductive health should not be included in an EP document, unless clearly and honestly defined.
There is a worldwide commonly agreed terminology which is "Primary Health Care" defined at the WHO conference in Alma Ata, 1978, which deals with Women and Mother' s Health without including abortion on demand.
Furthermore, in paragraph 18, the use of language leaves the meaning unclear and open to interpretation; prevention of "girl pregnancies" has the unfortunate double meaning of specifically seeking to prevent pregnancies where the conceived child is a girl.
Ambiguities such as this should not be allowed to stand in a report conceived as instructions for the negotiating team in New York for the remainder of the Beijing +5 session.
Regarding paragraph 26, which states that "the respect of women's rights should be one of the main conditions for the granting of aid and should be closely monitored in all external relations and cooperation" , the European Union must not tie any specifications to its distribution of aid nor impose any conditions for the reception of aid amongst women, realising that women are extremely vulnerable to the use of coercion and coercive techniques in order to realise their basic human rights such as shelter, nutrition, education and basic health care.
The EU must exercise extreme caution that current definitions should be consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as women are not a minority group.

The UEN Group decided to vote against the GrÃ¶ner-Smet report for several reasons, one of which is the ideology behind Beijing +5.
We do not reject the whole report but we refuse to accept the ideological vision of women which it aims to impose on the world.
This vision which we reject relies on empirical assumptions. Firstly, we disagree with the principle of women being a factor of peace and we reject this image of a dove superimposed on that of a woman to become as one.
This makes men into hirsute and aggressive beings who are the source of all the world' s problems.
Furthermore, we do not believe that women can, by nature, be a factor of economic development.
Clearly, they can contribute to this and we must give them the means to do so.
However, we believe that, in the context of this debate, the absolute priority must be to provide education.
We also cannot accept the individualisation of human rights to be found in this report.
The UEN Group, although attached to the whole European tradition of human rights, cannot accept the individualisation of these rights where they represent only specific needs to which suitable responses must be provided.
A restrictive international instrument certainly cannot be based on false assumptions.
The report on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform notes that the situation of women, although improved, still involves major inequalities.
In terms of work, it would appear vital to do more than just evaluate 'the impact of part-time and atypical forms of working on [...] the increase in poverty among women' .
Women often actually do not have the option of choosing a properly paid full-time job, yet 85% would like one.
Being forced into part-time work is clearly a source of poverty which is why we oppose this.
The wage gap between men and women of around 30% still remains.
On this issue, the report should have introduced coercive measures to eliminate this state of affairs.
This would, of course, require a political will.
Finally, over one thousand women' s associations in 140 countries are this year organising a world march to fight against continuing violence and to fight for equality.
It is our duty to support them.
We have therefore voted in favour of this report despite its limitations and we will demonstrate in Paris on 17 June together with all those who are fighting for equality and women' s rights.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Equal treatment
The next item is the report (A5-0136/2000) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (COM(1999) 566 - C5Â­0067/2000 - 1999/0253(CNS)).
Mr President, it was fifty years ago last week that Robert Schuman, with his speech, laid the foundation for the ECSC.
Meanwhile, coal and steel have ceased being the cornerstones of the integration process.
Over the past six months, it has become evident that values are increasingly at the centre of the debate.
Europe as a Community of values.
The importance of the directive which we are debating today threatens to become lost in the commotion about the time of issue of the French translation, the deadline for the amendments and our Rules of Procedure, whilst its very content will probably explain why we are all fighting so hard.
A couple of months ago, when the content had still not been specified, all parties agreed to a swift passage of this directive.
During the Portuguese Presidency, there has been a political momentum within the Council of which I, as well as other MEPs, would have liked to have made use.
Technical problems were deemed subordinate to political will at the time, and this is still true for the majority of MEPs.
Therefore, in addition to the draftspeople of the opinion, I would also like to thank a number of people by name for their extremely constructive contributions to the report.
They are Mr Richard Howitt, rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Anne Van Lancker, Mrs Joke Swiebel, Mrs Sarah Ludford and Mr Arie Oostlander.
I would now like to move on to the Commission' s proposal.
It embodies a sound minimum level of protection against racism by means of sanctions and independent bodies, by which we set great store.
The Commissioner has done justice to the wide range of areas across which discrimination can manifest itself.
The directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, as well as the term "harassment" .
My report also calls for the inclusion of incitement to discrimination.
This is, for example, the case if an employer asks a headhunting agency to be selective on improper grounds.
I hope that this addition can be adopted by the Commission.
Parliament has also looked very carefully into the areas to which this directive applies.
