I would add that, in any case, monitoring is undertaken by Parliament by means of its presence within the inter-institutional working party on general and specific information.
Lastly, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has also expressed its support for maintaining, and even increasing the financial support given to the European Movement.
We know that this Movement' s actions are effective, and it would be surprising if the European Union withdraws its support for the European Movement at a time when we need, more than ever, to encourage dialogue with the citizens.
Furthermore, all Member States should support European Union day, which is organised for 9 May, as this would greatly contribute to developing the rapport with the public that is severely lacking.
Mr President, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, both the powers of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and, in particular, European Union policies that promote equality of the sexes, in which particular emphasis is given to the Community programme for equal opportunities as a fundamentally important instrument in the struggle for equality, have been strengthened, as have the Daphne programme against domestic violence, and the Equal programme to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and compliance with the employment objectives of the Lisbon Summit, to name but a few.
Social exclusion is another concern of the Committee on Women' s Rights, given that we are unfortunately witnessing the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty' .
In order to achieve these priority objectives, we have put forward a series of amendments to the budget, which have been well received, and I would like to give special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his support in obtaining a majority in the Committee on Budgets.
A small proportion has been rejected, because it was already included in other budget lines: information actions in the common agricultural policy; methods to combat exclusion; the information society; the fight against poverty and the illnesses that arise as a result of it: malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS; care in the field of health and welfare; consolidation of democracy and human rights, etc.
Aid for women' s organisations that work for the promotion of women in the European Union should also be pointed out, not only the women' s lobby, but also other organisations that monitor the respect for pluralism in our society.
We cannot affirm that one sole organisation represents all of Europe' s women.
This action is therefore intended to promote justice and recognition for many other European organisations that have been working towards the equality of the sexes for a long time now, which also have a right to receive financial aid from the European Union.
The Committee on Women' s Rights is therefore very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets has accepted its proposals.
Mr President, I apologise to the rapporteurs that I was not able to be here at the beginning of the debate, but I would wager a euro that nobody has yet touched on the subject that I will raise on behalf of the Committee on Petitions.
Deep in the Buitenweg report is Amendment No 2022 on Budget Line 250 and this makes a new proposal to allow in certain circumstances, individual expenses to be paid to particular petitioners if they feel it appropriate to come to Parliament to put their case.
I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting this report and the committee for passing it.
Parliaments, you know, have various responsibilities.
They decide who is to be the government, of course, that is not a responsibility of this Parliament.
They decide budgets, but you know, we have only partial budgetary powers.
We have no powers over taxation, we have no powers over 50% of the expenditure more or less devoted to agriculture.
Parliaments decide legislation: that is a power we have to share with the Council of Ministers and we have no powers of legislative initiative.
But parliaments also have a responsibility to protect the rights of the individual citizens in dealing with the bureaucracy and that is a responsibility that we discharge in this Parliament through the work of the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman.
I would say to Parliament this afternoon that the money spent on petitions and the EUR 3 million that we make available to the Office of the Ombudsman is money that is extremely well spent.
It works out at less than EUR 0.1 per person per annum, so it cannot be said to be a great deal of money, but it is money that is being spent on real European democracy and we want to ensure that we keep that up and that we see that we do more in future years.
Mr President, I shall concentrate in particular upon the remarks on the ECSC' s operating budget, in which context I shall talk about the report issued by Mr SeppÃ€nen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
We are pleased about the role played by the ECSC as a pioneer in the European integration process and about the way in which the ECSC has made a positive contribution to peace in Europe.
We note that the ECSC was financed by means of revenue of a fiscal nature which facilitated the development of economic and social intervention measures associated with sectoral industrial policies.
At present, the coal and steel sector employs 357 000 workers and, as we enlarge the EU by means of the candidate countries, enlargement will mean that coal production in the EU will be doubled and that steel production will be increased by a third.
We can note with pride that, thanks to the ECSC, something was constructed and further developed that led to the European Union as we know it today.
The Committee has approved the Commission' s draft operating budget of EUR 151.8 million in 2002, and it is of course on 23 July 2002 that the ECSC Treaty expires.
We might have wished that, when it came to both operations and research, there had been a little more money for future energy needs relating to clean coal technologies, and we call upon the Commission to take account of this in the other programmes.
Mr President, I would like to put a question to you.
I do not understand why, when I am the official draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, when I prepared the amendments tabled by my Committee, when I arranged the vote on these in my Committee, when I defended them, rather vigorously at times, in the Committee on Budgets - where, in most cases, I also managed to obtain the approval of my fellow Members - why, therefore, my name is not on the list of draftsmen due to speak.
I, therefore, ask permission to take the floor now, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms.
Mr Deprez, your name does not appear on the official list of Members allowed to present committee opinions and I am, therefore, unable to give you the floor at this time.
I shall therefore request permission to take the floor now, Mr President.
Mr Deprez, the list of speakers is produced from the official requests presented by the various committees on behalf of which one can speak.
Since your name is not on the official list and as I see no reason for this to be changed, I shall give you the floor later, when you do have the right to make a speech.
President, our spokesman will be speaking for our Group later, but I also have a few comments to make at this stage.
As other speakers have already done, I should like to congratulate our two main rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg.
It is never an easy job to steer something through this House, as I know, and I think that they should be warmly applauded.
With the Commission budget this year, we have a proposal in front of us which, at 1.06% of GDP, is one of lowest budgets we have seen proposed in this House and therefore well below the ceiling as foreseen in the Financial Perspective, but I guess that with enlargement on its way, the Financial Perspective could well be tested before we reach the end of 2006.
In referring to the Costa Neves Report, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur on having focused on the progress report, on what had been done in terms of following up on the Joint Council/Parliament Declaration at the end of last year which has shown its worth in our budgetary procedure.
It may well be a useful idea to think of continuing this on an annual basis, because where we have gained is looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the European institutions, and this for us in Parliament is a point of major importance which I shall come back to at the end of my speech.
I should like to raise a few points on the particular matters of the Commission budget where we would, as a group, be looking for value for money - a tried and tested position with us.
Firstly, in terms of agriculture: we do not believe in having a reserve - we already have some money which has already been made available and a letter of amendment on its way, and I feel that it is quite sufficient.
But we think there should be an enquiry into the management of foot-and-mouth by the Commission and the British authorities, and we will be pushing for that.
Secondly, we believe that in information policy there is a continuing problem: every time we see Commission proposals come through without the interinstitutional working groups, we as a Parliament have to put them back on the information policy lines.
I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals - this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued.
Thirdly, in terms of the food safety agency - I noted that was raised in the European Council in Ghent - I would remind the President-in-Office (instead of laughing, he might listen to parliamentarians when they are speaking) that Parliament's position is that the money will stay in reserve until we are satisfied about the operations and the location of this agency.
I therefore assume that you will consult Parliament before any final decision is taken.
Fourthly, as regards Afghanistan - and I turn to the Commission again here - there is an amendment down to create a 'pour memoire' entry for aid to Afghanistan, and we will be asking the Council with Parliament to put this into the budget on second reading because we want to see in our Group that there will be an international alliance to help the reconstruction of Afghanistan once the conflict is over, and initial thinking on this issue is already under way in the United Nations.
Lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the posts which we have put in reserve and we would like to ensure that the conditions for the reserve are met before the posts are released - including the fact that the Commission has the capacity to use the posts during the next year in terms of the vacancies.
There is, however, one more very critical point, and I turn again to the Council of Ministers here.
Rumour has it, Mr President, that the early retirement package which is being negotiated in the Council at the moment is not open to Parliament.
I would like you to confirm in any future remarks that it will be open to us - that is a critical point for our Group as we wish to see it applied across all institutions.
I conclude, Mr President, on a point for our institution.
Yesterday evening, the Bureau decided, in opposition to the resolution of Mr Harbour, to go against the idea of having a linear career structure - I quote paragraph 38 of the Resolution which we voted in this House last November - "urges Parliament's administration to introduce a linear career structure in parallel to the Commission allowing for easy interinstitutional transfer".
It is unacceptable that Parliament's Bureau seems to have gone totally AWOL and decided for itself: under pressure from Parliament's administration, Parliament's Bureau has chosen to ignore what this Parliament has voted for.
Therefore, you will have to answer three questions, and I end on this.
Why is the organisation and the function of Parliament so distinctive from the Commission as to require a different career structure?
Secondly, how can a career structure retaining four different categories meet the objectives of a linear career structure with progression on merit as strongly supported by Parliament?
And lastly, how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures?
The Bureau has to come and justify before this Parliament the decisions it has taken as they are not in line with our resolutions.
Mr President, I do not want to repeat things, so I will stick to just a handful of points - although James Elles has stolen some of the thunder from my speech with his last two points.
I congratulate the rapporteurs.
Their work is never easy.
This year they have done a particularly good job under difficult circumstances.
I welcome the President-in-Office's statement that at the next conciliation he hopes we can get an agreement with the Council.
I hope so too because on 20 July, at the last conciliation, we agreed virtually nothing.
There is no point in having conciliation meetings if that is the level we are going to reach.
Hopefully, in November we may get something more positive.
As for the situation regarding the margins, which the President-in-Office also mentioned, there will not be much of a margin left by the time we vote on Thursday.
One of the reasons for that is because, once again, we could not get into any discussions with the Council; we could not get any agreements with the Council.
I made the point on several occasions in July that the three institutions must seriously discuss the problems of trying to finance categories 3, 4 and 5 for the future.
The Council cannot ignore these categories as though there were no problems.
At times it seems it is like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand trying to ignore all the problems around it.
When the Council takes that attitude, we are left talking to the backside, although sometimes we get more sense out of the backside of an ostrich than out of some of the people that we do have to speak to!
That is not a reference to you President-in-Office!
There are times when it is so frustrating trying to get the message through that we waste our time having conciliation meetings.
Hopefully, in November we will get something a lot more concrete.
On the issue of reform, James Elles has just touched on a very significant point.
I was going to refer to the concern that we have about the progress that is not being made, but Parliament has not helped itself with that decision last night by the Bureau.
One has to hope that can be changed rapidly.
Realistically, it is now left with the Council: almost three years have passed since the resignation of the Commission, and we still have not seen the reform that everyone is looking for.
The general public, the taxpayers of Europe, are looking for the reform which we promised almost three years ago.
Where are we?
It is stuck in the Council.
President-in-Office, you are aware, because I have discussed this issue with you, that the message must get through that we need a solution to this as quickly as possible.
Otherwise the whole process will be bogged down in the mire.
Hopefully, Parliament can play its part and unravel last night's decision and continue on the track of getting a speedy process going so we can get the whole issue sorted out, not just for the Commission but for all the institutions.
I want to turn to the Global Health Fund which we have a budget line and a relatively small amount of money for next year.
As we are all aware, the Commission will be bringing forward proposals to finance that from this year's budget, taking EUR 60 million from the general budget and EUR 60 million from the EDF.
I need to ask the Commission a question: on the monies from the EDF, once that budget is agreed, it is agreed with the ACP states, so can we be assured that the ACP states have agreed to the use of EUR 60 million for the Global Health Fund?
Several of my colleagues have asked me that question, and quite frankly, I do not know the answer to it.
So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that, I would be grateful.
Let me turn to the contentious issue of the A-30 lines.
It seems that whenever we vote on the A-30 lines, we please very few people and displease a lot of people.
I would hope that the situation that we found ourselves in this time will give us the courage for next year to make proposals which envisage a more transparent system.
We are concerned that if we hand the whole process over to the Commission, it will be no better.
The Commission will take the decisions instead of Parliament.
I hope we can get some sort of an agreement within Parliament on how we handle A-30 in the future.
Finally, I want to make a plea to the Council and to repeat what I said in conciliation and at the recent trialogue.
What we need is a working group of the Council and Parliament at a political level to start looking at value for money within the European Union, to look at the institutions, to look at the activities and to make sure that we can persuade the taxpayers that they really are getting value for money.
I hope you will take that on board.
Mr President, firstly my sincere thanks and congratulations go to Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr SeppÃ€nen for their excellent work.
At the same time I wish to thank Terence Wynn, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has proved a competent leader in the work of the current year.
The job of general rapporteur is a tough and demanding one, but Mr Costa Neves has managed well and my group supports his policy on the Commission' s budget.
The budget' s general lines include cancelling the cut in agricultural expenditure, attending to arrears in payments, and the Commission' s reform.
The strengthening of the policy on the northern dimension in the budget' s explanatory statement may also be regarded as a positive move.
The handling of the budget is based very much on last year' s financial statements, which showed a surplus of EUR 11 billion.
Expenditure was EUR 8.5 billion less than anticipated and EUR 6.5 billion of the Structural Funds remained unspent.
For that reason, we now have to pay special attention to improving administration and not producing such large estimates for expenditure.
Otherwise, the bottom will fall out of budget policy altogether.
One particular focus in the budget is the reduction in payment arrears.
At present they stand at more than EUR 60 billion.
My group supports this goal.
It also supports the reform of the Commission, which is one of Parliament' s most urgent priorities.
It will increase efficiency and the importance of personal responsibility.
It is being proposed that a part of the appropriations should be placed in a reserve, so that the Commission may quickly propose a reform of its staff regulations and clarify its ideas on the early retirement scheme.
Heading 4 is difficult.
The Commission and the Council are proposing EUR 125 million for the Moroccan fishing agreement, although this agreement is not forthcoming.
This is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which, indeed, contravenes the Financial Regulation.
It must be dissolved.
As a counterweight, it is being proposed that a flexible instrument should be used to modernise the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets.
This could be partly acceptable.
On the other hand, our group cannot accept the cut of EUR 84 million in the CARDS Programme.
We, as liberals, like participating in joint agreements to carry through the budget in Parliament, but we cannot be party to this idea.
The CARDS Programme has been an undisputed priority with Parliament, and, for that reason, we are hoping for similar cuts in the budget for other programmes where payment appropriations have not been used to the extent they might have been in any case.
Of the small programmes, the most considerable is the A-30 appropriations, which are earmarked as assistance to organisations.
These appropriations take up a totally unreasonable amount of Parliament' s time in relation to their importance.
For that reason, the whole system should be clarified.
In addition, the way the organisations are selected is very rarely based on objective criteria.
We particularly support Mrs Buitenweg' s recommendations concerning discipline in Parliament' s budget, as mentioned in her report.
They remain beneath the ceiling we, ourselves, set, that is to say 20% of all administrative costs, even though it includes the costs relating to enlargement.
The question of eastward enlargement itself is one that must be dealt with in such a way that Parliament' s work is not made any harder and that in the future we may congregate in our own united assembly.
Mr President, I, too, would like again to express my thanks to the rapporteurs, and also to the Chairman of the Committee.
If you consider the conflicts that arose from attempts to pass budgets in the past few years, it seems as if greater calm prevails this year, as if the conflicts were not so evident to the public eye.
But it must be recorded that, this year too, the Council is not actually facing up to its responsibilities.
As a component part of the budgetary authority, it has the task of supporting a Budget with real commitment and in a politically explicable way.
Whilst Parliament worked very carefully for a balanced budget, in long debates, discussions and negotiations with most of the interested parties, weighing needs against the duty to budget prudently in the taxpayers' interests, the Council again merely cut lump sums without any underlying political thought.
At any rate, its political thinking is not clear to us, and the question arises of whether it ever engaged in any.
Problems are needlessly exacerbated by the way the Council acts, for, this year too, the Budget is below the margin, far under 1.27% of Gross Social Product, despite special tasks, preparations for enlargement and many other problems.
This year, the Council has cut payments by 10% across the board, something made all the more incomprehensible by the delay in implementing programmes in many areas.
Parliament is now reinstating these figures.
We cannot, on the one hand, build up expectations in areas such as the Structural Fund or overseas aid, but then live up to them only with great hesitation.
This undermines trust in the institutions of the EU.
So the Council must bear its share of responsibility for this if its action is to be approved.
This action is particularly problematic in Category IV, foreign policy.
Whilst the Foreign Ministers and Heads of Government make great speeches about the Common Foreign Policy, the Finance Ministers narrow-mindedly cut the supply of funds, without considering the prestige lost by the EU institutions.
It is far from clear why the instrument of a flexible reserve is not fully available to us this year.
We still have major problems in the Balkans, new tasks await us in Afghanistan and in its neighbouring states and more new tasks await us in the Middle East.
We need a response from the Council too on the way that the EU is losing its capacity for flexible reaction.
The Council must explain how the EU is to continue to be flexible and capable of political action.
We, as a group, are more critical of the A30 lines procedure.
The great number of individual motions - including those from Parliament - has led the two major groups to attempt a solution by dealing with them en bloc.
Our committee would then no longer be able to do any fine-tuning in this area, and we would thus be inadequately performing our monitoring function.
Now Mr Wynn has clearly mentioned that changes are to be made to the Budget process next year.
I hope we will be able to work together to produce an intelligently thought-out procedure which will also enable Parliament to perform its function of monitoring the A30 lines.
We must not lay ourselves open to the accusation that we are engaging in economics for the benefit of special interest groups.
This really is not what we should be doing in the Budget.
No, I do believe there must be a certain amount of self-criticism.
I am perfectly aware of the fact that there is a great deal of pressure on the time available to us, but every individual item in this field in particular must be politically justifiable even to people outside this Parliament.
I would like to sum up and end my speech by referring back to what previous speakers have said and, again, challenging Parliament to push ahead with its own reforms.
Our demands to the Council and the Commission for reform will only be credible if we strive credibly for reform ourselves.
Yesterday evening's decisions from the Chair did not, I believe, take sufficient account of that.
Mr President, a very strict budget policy has been adopted in the drafting of next year's budget.
As the GNP for the EU Member States has grown faster than the increase in payment appropriations, the amount the EU budget represents in the figure for combined GNP has shrunk to 1.03%.
That indicates that next year' s draft budget will not exhibit any special areas of focus.
The permitted ceiling in the EU budget is 1.27% of the combined GNP for the Member States.
There will consequently be room in the budget for areas of special focus, but the Council and the Commission do not seem to have the political will or the ability to prepare any such areas.
Examples of them might be employment or healthy food.
The EU political Ã©lite no longer even debates the matter of the prevention of unemployment, let alone try to combat it with appropriate policy.
Our group has traditionally stressed the importance of preventing unemployment.
In most cases unemployment is not the fault of the unemployed person him or herself: that person is at the mercy of the economic situation as it happens to be at any one time.
We must have a policy against unemployment.
The political Ã©lite and EU officials certainly look after their own interests.
We are to have an early retirement scheme that will generously reward those who no longer, even through retraining, can be made into functional tyres to go on EU wheels.
If there are hundreds of officials no longer needed, that shows just what a bad state EU staff policy is in.
The Commission' s ability to implement Parliament' s political decisions is nothing less than wretched.
The gap between the budget that has been decided and the budget implemented by the Commission is always much too wide.
There are no delays in payment when it comes to issues that are important to the Commission, whereas there often are in issues important to the Parliament.
The EU budget is a political document, as it channels money to the EU Ã©lite bodies, and now also to the European political parties and for EU propaganda.
That is not the way to make a citizen' s Europe.
If an illegal war was waged in the bombing of Yugoslavia, assistance for the country' s reconstruction should not be the object of cuts.
Let us hope that the CARDS vote does not take the large groups by surprise.
Mr President, we note that, for the first time, the Commission' s preliminary draft budget exceeds the symbolic EUR 100 billion mark and is firmly dominated by crisis spending on agriculture and external commitments.
In this first reading, our group supports many of the choices made by the rapporteur, such as the horizontal amendments, in principle, and particularly when this involves a systematic reduction of the RAL and the desire to prevent further RAL from building up.
As for agriculture, almost all of the appropriations for this sector have been restored, and this can only reassure our farmers, who are greatly in need of these funds.
The package of EUR 180 million approved by the Committee on Budgets in favour of other agricultural interventions also helps, even if we must condemn the obvious lack of appropriations for the emergency fund for veterinary complaints, for the distribution of agricultural products to the less wealthy sectors of the Community and for the setting up of young farmers.
With regard to cross-border regions, it is worthwhile reiterating that these regions already benefit from extensive financial support, and we might well consider whether, in view of their diversity, a unique instrument could be the appropriate response.
As far as internal policies are concerned, the interests of small- and medium-sized businesses are safeguarded, and Parliament can welcome the increase in appropriations that aim to combat violence against women and children, such as paedophilia and misuse of the Internet.
In our view, however, the reduction made by the Council concerning advertising for the euro, and which was increased by Parliament, is sufficient.
This advertising, for which the citizens of our countries pay a high price, seems to be nothing more than propaganda.
Furthermore, the French delegation of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is opposed to the appropriations included on a multitude of headings in Chapter A 30, which do nothing more than to encourage federalist presuppositions and these alone, whereas other tendencies are not recognised, in spite of the choice of the electorate.
With regard to Europol, and this thinking also applies to Eurojust, all our energies must of course be channelled into the fight against terrorism in all its guises, as reiterated by our Chairman, Charles Pasqua, who has relentlessly pursued this fight. However, the necessary strengthening of solidarities and police and judicial cooperation between our nations would only serve as a pretext for the rampant communitarisation of policies and actions that fall fully within the remit of national sovereignty.
Furthermore, Europol is funded by national contributions, and, in our view, has no place in this budget.
As far as external actions are concerned, whilst our group appreciates that the appropriations in favour of the MEDA 2002 programme have been doubled, we condemn the drastic reductions in appropriations for the fishing agreement with Morocco. You cannot achieve good policies from figures alone and this decision by the Committee on Budgets is the worst message that we could send our counterparts in Morocco, particularly during this difficult time when there is an international crisis.
Lastly, Mr President, although we are able to welcome the method used by the rapporteur, we must admit that the excessive level of payment appropriations put forward by the Committee on Budgets will certainly not help to control public spending, as this would represent an additional cost of some FFR 27 billion, even for France alone.
Mr President, Commissioner, the budget must be the perfect instrument for choosing the EU' s political priorities.
And those choices, I should like to underline once more, must serve the interests of all European citizens.
The on-going debate on the final form to be taken by the Union indicates that there are many different opinions on the subject.
I am alarmed by the fact that this diversity of opinions is not reflected in many European projects.
The fact that a unilateral propaganda megaphone is resounding from Brussels across the Union, and at the citizen' s expense, concerns me greatly.
Those concerns were recently intensified when the Committee on Budgets rejected an amendment tabled by our Conservative English MEPs to inject impartiality into the Commission' s information policy.
There is more.
The Commission, as well as the majority in this Parliament, want to press on.
Driven by the intense desire to bring about political Union as soon as possible, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for making contributions to European political parties from community funding.
This is highly peculiar, for those European parties hardly exist.
The citizens are not familiar with them, yet we are expected to sponsor them.
Once again, the EU' s political diversity is being overlooked.
In this way, only mainstream European parties qualify for European subsidy, while the national political parties - which are closer to the citizen - do not.
Time and again, polls illustrate that the citizens in the Member States are not keen on interference from Brussels.
Promoting European political parties will only further alienate the citizen from European politics.
This is why we warmly recommend our amendment which proposes scrapping these contributions.
The Commission' s and Parliament' s urge to stress the distinctive features of the European political parties does not end at the Union' s borders.
I should like to quote one example by way of illustration. More than EUR 180 million is pledged annually to the Palestinian Authority.
If the schools paid from that budget use inflammatory school books full of racist and anti-Semitic language, the Commission washes its hands of the matter.
Why does the Commission continue to ignore this evil and keep running away from its political responsibility?
I have to say that the Union is punching above its weight.
The Union should confine itself to those areas of policy where European action has an obvious added value.
The fundamental choice which I, apart from all the positive things, miss in this budget, is that of prioritising the EU' s core tasks and leaving the other tasks where they belong: with the Member States.
Mr President, this Budget has again committed substantial sums of money to the planned enlargement.
We must not, though, in doing this, forget the 23 frontier regions which will be particularly - even adversely - affected by the accession of these countries.
Being a Member for one of these regions, Carinthia, I am disappointed.
I am sorry that the Commission, the Council, and also the Committee on Budgets are not giving these regions adequate support by allocating sufficient budget resources.
To cut resources for these regions is to play a dangerous game with popular feeling.
If the population of these regions suffers overwhelming disadvantages, as is to be feared, the possibility cannot be excluded that they will vote against enlargement and thereby jeopardise the whole undertaking.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, we are discussing at first reading stage the Community budget for the coming year, we are of course talking about politics coated with figures.
A lot of the European Parliament's initiatives can be seen in that way.
We want to exert pressure on the Council - those who have spoken before me have pointed out how urgently that is needed - but also on the Commission, because many points have not yet been given the consideration they deserve.
I will push on with the subject on which Mr Ilgenfritz has just finished speaking, that is to say, the frontier regions.
It is just not the case that we have cut something, rather we are of course waiting, Commissioner for a rather feeble communication to be followed up by the presentation of something more from the Commission for the frontier regions, as the Commission has a monopoly on initiative.
You were perfectly well able to propose legal foundations for other things in quick order.
When it comes to the frontier regions, though, you cover yourself with modesty.
But it will not do for you to tell us that you observe Parliament's intentions with great interest.
The Commission is being called on to produce an initiative.
That is your duty - it is an honourable one - and you cannot evade responsibility for it.
So I hope that we will succeed, here in this Parliament on Thursday, in adopting the inclusion of EUR 10.8 million in the reserve for the PRINCE programme.
I think this will motivate the Commission to present a corresponding proposal on the frontier regions.
The same goes for the issue of the 317 new posts that the Commission has asked for.
I think it high time to synchronise the Budget procedure and the Commission's legislative process.
We cannot have the situation where we briefly discuss the annual reports on the legislation in preparation if the Budget has, in principle, already been passed.
Here, too, it is a matter of ensuring synchronisation of these two activities.
So it is right to keep these posts, and the resources for them, in reserve.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same is true of the common foreign and security policy.
It is enough to make me weep when I hear your disquisitions on how we would be making savings here in an important area.
Please bear in mind that we have an interest in dealing with these things as part of the Community Budget, where, to a large degree, they rightly belong.
Correspondingly, of course, cuts must be made in the relevant Budget line.
The Council cannot get itself a savings tin for this and thus develop activities independently of the Commission and Parliament.
There are papers to this effect in the Council.
You may be sure that Parliament will not let that go through.
The same goes for Europol and Eurojust.
I do not propose to go into further detail about this.
I wish to extend heart-felt thanks to the rapporteurs, in particular to Carlos Costa Neves and of course Mrs Buitenweg as well, for making our work together so pleasant.
We got a bit further with the Parliamentary budget in terms of truth and clarity.
It makes little sense to put funds in reserve for the purposes of a law, and then end up spending it on buildings.
It is therefore more right and proper to put it straight in the Budget line for buildings where it will be used at year-end anyway.
We will, though, have to ensure - and this is a lesson from this year's Budget procedure - that all proposals for our Parliamentary budget are presented by the Bureau as early as May.
A procedure such as today's, with many important decisions being taken only in September and immediately before the discussions in the Committee on Budgets, is something we cannot accept.
I still have grave concerns about the state of health of our colleagues in the various institutions.
We had requested a report on sickness absence for this year.
Working in certain institutions is indeed very dangerous, as a lot of people in them are off sick.
We will have to get to grips with this and take steps to improve the health of our colleagues in the institutions in question.
In conclusion, I really would like to ask - and Terry Wynn has already mentioned this to great effect - that we should now make progress in November on the issue of cooperation, so that, in December, we can adopt a proper and orderly Budget for 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking most sincerely the three rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Costa Neves and Mr SeppÃ€nen, for the work they have put in.
Anyone who follows the process as intensively as the coordinators sometimes do, can see how much work is actually involved.
Hence my special and wholehearted thanks on behalf of all my group.
I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council is still here, as I think every year's Budget process must bring with it the opportunity to point out one thing: this Budget process is not complete.
Its ability to contribute notwithstanding, this Parliament is not yet in full and complete possession of the power that citizens' Parliamentary representatives must have when the budget for the coming year is at issue.
I have hinted that I will say that over and over again.
I will do as Cato the Elder did to the ancient Romans - he was the one who wanted to see Carthage destroyed - but perhaps I will not go quite that far.
I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that.
This Budget process, even as regards the agricultural budget, is complete only when it has got us well and truly on board, and when we have complete responsibility for receipts and outgoings.
I know that I am not meeting with much resistance on your part, but of course we have to develop this further in discussion and argument.
Only then will the citizens of the European Union be able to decide by their votes whether we, this Parliament, have done well or not.
The Council and the Commission must of course have a part in this process in future.
We will accord them high honour for it.
I believe, though, that Parliament, being composed of elected representatives, is the primary partner in dialogue.
We will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here.
We are working on Budget matters in a very restricted framework, which itself is prescribed by the Financial Perspective, to which we adhere, even though we see that additional demands are made on us which were not recognisable as such at the time the Financial Perspective was adopted.
We must adapt to this and facilitate further developments within our Budget framework.
At present that is surely still possible, for we see from the backdraughts at the end of every year that there is still enough air.
So, either there is not proper implementation - a fault which will have to be tackled - or the items really were estimated too high.
Even there it is still possible to let some air out.
I will tell you though, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, that we will in the foreseeable future - in other words by the expiry date of this Financial Perspective at the latest - have to talk about further developments.
When it comes to the further development of the Financial Perspective, we will have to do some thinking about much more intensive and definite ways of meeting new challenges.
Up until then, we will have been letting air out all over the place.
We will be back on the launch pad, and will have to discuss what appropriate terms for this House's budget and the Budget as a whole might look like.
We will be ready to energetically dispute over further developments with you.
On the road to this destination, we will give the Commission the support it needs when it comes to modernising its administrative procedures.
We will be at its disposal when needed staff are to be taken on.
But, on the contrary, we will also be making quite massive demands.
We will be demanding a great deal so that our programmes, which we cast in numerical form in the Budget, actually come into being in the course of the year.
No longer will we stand by and watch payment arrears being built up.
Progress is being made - I will admit that here and now.
I certainly would not claim that we are where we were two or three years ago.
But despite this progress, there is still a need for a massive amount of further work.
As I have said, we will support you, but we will also make demands.
In the area of individual Budget lines and categories, too, we will hold fast to that which has proved its worth.
The people who rely on us to give support when it is needed, will be able to rely on us in future too.
That starts in Category I, with the farmers who cannot change everything around from one day to another, but need a certain headstart.
These people must also know that there is to be a change in this European Union. We, as a Parliament, will help to bring it about.
In future, we will take an intensive look at Category I and bring in modernisation.
We will introduce innovation.
If there is no discernible development in these areas, which are in Category VII rather than Category I, but still affect agriculture, if SAPARD is not implemented, we will ask you to take the innovative resources that made LEADER such a success and transpose them so as to provide rapid short-term help.
We will bring this in, and we will also take care that all the security for farmers will not prevent the consumers, too, being certain that produce will be safe for them and not injurious to their health.
At first reading, we will vote to add the necessary resources to the reserve, resources that formerly seemed to be needed in order to properly treat BSE and foot-and-mouth disease.
We are aware that these diseases have recently appeared among sheep and elsewhere.
I do not know whether appropriate steps will be taken on this front.
We will act accordingly in the first instance, until the letter of amendment has been presented and we have an overall view of things.
We will make it our concern to meet and overcome the two great challenges presented in Category II.
The reconstruction of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets is crucial and of the utmost importance.
People there have relied on being able to pursue their livelihood subject to certain restrictions.
The failure of the Morocco Agreement means that will no longer be possible.
I am now addressing both the Commission and the Council when I say that we found that provision of these EUR 125 million, even though it was clear at the beginning of this year that the money could not be used, hardly a serious way of doing things.
Despite this - or indeed because of it - the fishermen have a claim on help from us, and we will ensure in the Budget process that appropriate action is taken.
The same applies to the frontier regions, which are not always rich and able to help themselves.
I think, for example, of Bavaria; regions like that are a bit better off.
There are other regions which really need more aid, with which we will be concerned.
What we will be developing in Category III will be oriented towards the future.
Developments following 11 September have shown us that developments are needed in this area.
Europol and Eurojust must be developed further, and national sensitivities must be overcome.
If terrorism is to be combated, all its advantages in the game must be done away with.
We must not stand on old rights.
There is room for progress here.
What we want is to continue with what was begun last year, that is to say, the inclusion of people in society by means of access to the labour market.
We must not simply forget this a year on from it having been a crucial point in Mrs Haug's Budget report, now that new problems are in the offing.
People also have a right to social inclusion through training in modern information and communications technologies.
This applies not only to cultivated and highly educated people, but also to those who perform very simple work.
Thank you very much for your attention.
I again thank the rapporteurs and hope that, in cooperation with the other two institutions, we will be able to bring this process to a successful conclusion.
(Applause)
Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Costa Neves.
It is, in my experience, the first time that the rapporteur has not tampered with the financial perspectives.
I welcome this, especially since we have ended up with a budget surplus of some EUR 11 billion.
I should like to make some observations concerning the different headings.
I will start with the first heading. I am in favour of the reserve for foot-and-mouth disease.
I do not know what other disasters could be heading in our direction, but I believe that the end is not yet in sight.
I repeat once again, but I have said it so often: in my opinion, the Commission should not stop thinking about possible alternative ways of funding the fight against crises of this type.
We can look into insurance systems.
We can put all kinds of restrictions in place, but I do not think that we can rely on the fact that, in the years to come, there will be an annual surplus of one to two billion in the agricultural budget.
I should particularly like to recommend the amendments on further foot and mouth research, tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Council of Ministers.
Can we develop marker vaccines, or new testing methods?
Can we examine whether a vaccinated animal is still infectious?
With regard to heading 2, I endorse the gist of the rapporteur' s policy designed to achieve an improved expenditure and commitment policy.
I am thus in favour of the amendments which he has tabled in this connection, with only one exception: the increase in payment appropriations is rather extreme in my opinion.
Along with the Commission, I fail to see how this can be spent in a reasonable manner.
Consequently, I will in this connection vote differently from the way in which many of you will probably vote.
Concerning the proposals to use the flexibility instrument in order to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal, I am anxiously awaiting the Commission' s proposals.
On a final note, I think we ought to bolster Eastern Europe.
The SAPARD payment periods must be extended to 2003.
The fact that the payment bodies have not yet been approved should not put those countries at a disadvantage.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my capacity as Chairman of the EP delegation for relations with Central Asia, I shall confine myself to a few comments concerning those budget lines.
What are they about?
In the first instance, they are about aid to the partner countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Central Asia is an unstable region and has, since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, really been at the epicentre of world politics.
We all know that military action on its own will not bring a sustainable solution in the region and that we will need to invest in democratic institutions, in a civil society, in socio-economic and ecological reforms, in the fight against drugs and poverty and in sound education.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the key aim of our efforts in Central Asia.
Hence our call to increase that budget line by 5% for commitment appropriations and by 20% for payment appropriations.
Secondly, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the aid for victims of radiation, particularly in the Semipalatinsk region in Kazakhstan.
In that region, the Soviet army carried out 607 nuclear arms tests between 1949 and 1999, the bulk of which were above-ground.
The Soviets obliged the population to come out of their houses and watch the huge nuclear mushroom.
The effects are catastrophic: the incidence of cancer is five times higher than the national average, birth defects are three times more common than the national average, many young men are impotent and twelve-year old girls suffer from breast cancer.
Psychological disorders and suicide are very common, and the average life expectancy is around 52.
That is the reason why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like to increase the payment appropriations in budget line B7-524 from EUR 45 million to 60 million.
Mr Vande Lanotte, you are visiting our House and attending the sitting. You said you have come to listen, rather than make any comments, and I can understand that.
However, I should nevertheless like to draw your devoted and kind attention to these two important amendments and maybe, upon completion of this 2002 budgetary procedure, we could visit Semipalatinsk together to witness the disastrous effects of the nuclear insanity and to see how European money could be spent in a effective and useful manner.
I would be much obliged.
Mr President, the proposals for 2002 confirm the trend of recent years to reduce the relative value of the Community budget, as can be clearly seen from the fact that the proposed amount is the lowest in the last decade; only 1.03% of GDP.
Because of the restrictive guidelines of the Stability Pact and also because of the problems resulting from a major economic slowdown, the Council is continuing to suggest cuts, which creates real problems for the budget' s implementation.
This year' s procedure once again betrays true budgetary chaos, with new needs arising and the number of priorities increasing and appropriations becoming smaller and smaller, leading to cutbacks that can only be overridden by revising the Financial Perspective, which is what we have always advocated.
Hence, by subscribing to the Council' s way of thinking, the European Parliament is doing no more than vainly attempting to disguise these needs, which are undeniable.
This also clearly highlights the absence of clear priorities and a coherent strategy for guaranteeing the proper funding of Community policies in various fields, specifically those of cooperation, agriculture and employment.
This is a concern that increases yet further with the creation of considerable reserves which, in the current context, can only give rise to greater doubts.
With regard to category four, the only chapter of the budget that continues to show a consistent reduction in sums, the lack of appropriations is striking, particularly if we take account of the needs of and the commitments given to the Balkans, to Palestine, to Afghanistan, on the World Health Fund or for the conversion of the fleets operating in Moroccan waters.
The rapporteur' s idea, which is not new, seeks to cut spending, particularly on the Balkans, in order to be able to increase the remaining aid for cooperation and to force the Council to negotiate.
Let us hope that this does not lead to further cuts in cooperation such as those we saw last year.
We shall see in December what happens.
These are some of the reasons why we do not support this budget.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur as well as the rapporteur for the other institutions.
I think that they have both done an excellent job.
They presented a proposal to the House that is, on the whole, acceptable and which, in any case, the radical Members will support.
I would also like to highlight the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council in the overall debate, to thank him for taking part and who demonstrates a willingness for dialogue.
I hope that his participation will bear fruit at second reading and even that, looking beyond the budget, it will have a positive effect on other very important budgetary issues, particularly the financial regulation.
I would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur' s overall strategy.
The first comment concerns the RAL. I fully support the strategy used to attempt to reduce their levels, which are becoming rather unmanageable, and to send a clear message to the Commission for its help in trying to do this.
I ask myself, and I ask the rapporteur, the following question: how do you know it is right to apply this strategy to a very specific situation, that of Afghanistan?
The RAL are obviously related to the issue of providing aid to refugees, of providing humanitarian aid.
I therefore wonder whether or not this could be the time, perhaps - and I put this to the rapporteur, although I understand that it may be difficult at this late stage - to put money - and, in doing so, send out a political message - in the reserve for Afghan refugees.
Of course, this should be part of an overall strategy, which is perfectly justified, but I wonder whether or not, for this specific message, we could possibly change the strategy, in any case, at second reading.
My second comment concerns the reform of the Commission.
I strongly deny what James Elles said.
Furthermore, I believe that yesterday' s Bureau meeting and the Conference of Presidents unanimously supported the proposals from the parliamentary group responsible for this dossier.
I reiterate that this group suggested - or indicated in any case - to the Commission, and in particular to the Vice-President charged with reform, that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised.
Furthermore, given the misunderstandings regarding the number of non-assigned posts, I even question whether the previous system, with one commissioner responsible for both budget and staff, was not the best approach, insofar as the overall picture can be seen.
I therefore reiterate that Parliament supports the proposal that runs counter to the proposal outlined by the Vice-President, Mr Kinnock.
Mr President, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I would like to thank the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, and the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr SeppÃ€nen.
From a budgetary point of view, by 2002, the rhythm of implementation of appropriations must have reached cruising speed: there is no overlapping with the previous programming period and there can be no delay in the implementation of programmes.
It is a year in which the forecasts contained in the financial perspectives can be fully achieved.
In order for the two powers responsible for implementation (the Commission and the Member States) to achieve this fully, the rapporteur offers us a strategy for reducing the backlog; in order to support his strategy, he uses the performance targets identified by the Commission at the request of an initiative presented by the European Peoples' Party for the 2001 Budget.
It is important that this House accepts the Costa Neves strategy in the field of payment appropriations.
Without decisive action by the European Parliament, it is going to be difficult to achieve an interinstitutional political commitment on improving the quality of expenditure, which has always been our priority.
We also support the strategy of the general rapporteur in relation to the new demands, the Commission' s letter of amendment, where it refers to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance the new structural needs, the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets which fished in Moroccan waters, which is awaiting the proposed funding the Commission has promised but has still not presented.
The rapporteur has also presented both pro memoria in the budget lines for that restructuring, and also in relation to a programme for increasing the competitiveness of the border regions with a view to the enlargement of the Union.
Let us hope that between the first and second readings, the Commission will clarify the situation of this programme and the possible funding proposals.
Furthermore, we have the insoluble problem of the lack of financial resources in Category 4 for external action.
This problem threatens to tarnish budgetary procedure after budgetary procedure.
The Union takes on more and more external commitments, often without consulting this House.
Later, unilateral cuts are decided on in the traditional external action lines under the pretext of deficient implementation, responsibility for which is always attributed to external factors and never to the functioning of the Commission or the Member States themselves.
Parliament must therefore, year after year, become embroiled in a pointless fight to remove the cuts which both the Commission, in its preliminary draft, and the Council, in its first reading, carry out.
This prejudices the role which must be played by such important committees as Foreign Affairs, Development and the Committee on Budgets itself.
A very good example this year is the EUR 125 million for the never-signed fishing agreement with Morocco.
It has never been explained why the Commission included these appropriations in the reserve, but the true consequence is that the rapporteur has had to employ (and the political groups support him) a strategy of cuts in order to achieve the mobilisation of these fishing appropriations which were never used.
Honest interinstitutional cooperation must be based on recognition of the budgetary prerogatives of each of the institutions.
To wait for the November conciliation to resolve fundamental issues weakens the role of the parliamentary negotiation and the role of the tripartite dialogues for the whole year.
We in the European Peoples' Party consider essential to the good operation of the budgetary procedure, amongst other things, the harmonisation of legislative and budgetary procedures, the genuine participation of the European Parliament in the creation of the rules of the game, that is, the Financial Regulation, prior knowledge of the Commission' s working programme, more active involvement by Parliament in the budgetary element of the Commission reform, etc.
All these aspirations are contained in our amendments, which we will put to the vote on Thursday, and which we hope will receive majority support.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many others, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves.
The cooperation has been really good.
As 'shadow rapporteur' for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have also encountered a very constructive attitude, and that is something for which I am grateful.
By this time, almost all practical proposals from Parliament have been dealt with, and I must therefore concentrate on a number of more theoretical points of view.
The budget is the ultimate expression of democracy and social development.
It is through the budget that we decide that our public institution needs to use tax revenue in order in some way to influence society, and it is the EU' s budget that is relevant when it comes to transnational European issues.
It is always difficult to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the desire to do important things and, on the other, the need to respect budget discipline and to ensure that taxpayers genuinely get value for money.
In the EU, this balancing act is unusually complicated due to the fact that it has to be carried out both by two budget authorities in tandem and by each authority in its own right.
In the case of the Council, it even has to be performed within each and every one of the fifteen governments.
Unfortunately, the problem is often that, with one voice - for example that of the agricultural and foreign ministers - the Council pledges a whole lot of money to, for example, agriculture and the fight against BSE and foot and mouth, to the transformation of poor regions, to fishing fleets, to the Balkans and to Afghan refugees etc, while, with its other voice - that of the finance ministers - it says no to increased expenditure.
The problem is not made any easier by the fact that those who promise aid do not so often ensure that the Commission, which is to implement all these measures, has the resources needed to turn the promises into a reality.
There are often considerable commitments made, but the level of implementation is low and the funding insufficient.
In spite of this criticism, I believe that, for the most part, taxpayers get value for money.
I am an MEP for Sweden, the EU' s most Eurosceptic country and, at the same time, the country in which the individual taxpayer contributes most money to the EU.
This situation means that it is not always so easy to persuade people to believe that the money is in actual fact used well.
The myth of the EU as a hopeless colossus is so strong that I am scarcely believed at home when I say that, even for Sweden, the net cost of the EU amounts to only 1 per cent of the State budget, that the budget is not increasing in real terms and that it is implemented in such a way that the Swedish exchequer gets back a large part of its contribution each year.
Indeed, a tenth of the whole budget is in practice paid back to the Member States.
I believe, as I say, that we get value for money, but there are still a lot of shortcomings.
We need to do quite a lot in the future in order to convince people that the funds are being properly used.
First of all, I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent.
The new budget regulation and activity-based budgeting should contribute to this.
Secondly, we must speed up internal reform.
We have certainly now placed a number of services in the reserve, but the aim of this is not to slow down, but to force the pace of, reform.
I am also convinced that, as Commissioner Schreyer pointed out in his speech, we are going to have to make the budget more flexible and increase our ability to respond to new events.
In order to achieve this, I also believe that a new spirit of cooperation is needed between the two branches of the budgetary authority.
Most obvious, perhaps, are the deficiencies in category 4, that of external expenditure, to which the Council has added new expenditure year after year on, for example, aid to Kosovo and Serbia, new fisheries agreements etc. This year, we have had far-reaching discussions on assistance to refugees, the Global Health Fund and other efforts to combat AIDS etc.
In both 2000 and 2001, we solved this problem by means of the flexibility instrument, which gave us a further EUR 200 million per year.
The problem this year is that the programmes for Kosovo and Serbia which necessarily gave rise to this flexibility instrument must still be implemented at a high level but without our being able this year to use the flexibility instrument' s EUR 200 million.
In spite of this, the Council will prevent us from using those funds that are not needed for the fisheries agreements, and that is something I do not understand.
Why are we not allowed to use them when we, in actual fact, have major costs for the programmes to which we have agreed?
This does not hold water.
With this policy, the Council is forcing us to do something I should preferably have liked us to avoid, namely to say no to a proportion of the major expenditure on the Balkans, even if we are obviously using this to protect the most sensitive areas, that is to say Serbia and Kosovo.
Let us conduct an open dialogue in this area, characterised by trust.
We understand the Council' s priorities when it comes to the Balkans, AIDS etc, but then we should also ask for a certain amount of understanding for the fact that we cannot prioritise away all the issues closest to our hearts.
We want to rescue aid to the Balkans.
Let us get around the negotiating table.
Mr President, the 2002 EU Budget, amounting to EUR 51 billion, appears at first sight to be balanced and straightforward.
The increase of 5% over the outgoings of the Budget year 2001 corresponds to the Berlin agricultural guidelines.
That is not only good but also inevitable, as no other policy is as thoroughly submitted to Community methods as agricultural policy.
I note with particular concern, however, that this great chunk of agricultural expenditure is increasingly the object of covetous desires on the part of not a few politicians who see it as a sort of disposable object which can be moved around at will.
If this intention is to be countered, the Financial Perspective will have to be qualified by the Commission, any kind of speculation eliminated and the across-the-board cuts that are always being sought in the agricultural budget not in fact implemented.
The appearance of foot-and-mouth disease eleven months ago has meant a very unbalanced situation in animal husbandry, especially as regards food safety, animal protection and the internal market.
Distorted competition in markets leads to the loss of jobs and income.
Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why.
So I wish to advocate a temporary increase in the financial allocation to the market organisation for animal husbandry.
I urge that the so-called interim balance sheet of Agenda 2000 should not be put off simply to do a favour for a particular country.
I urge moreover that the reserve should be kept until an explanation is given of the contradiction by which we were talking about EUR 1 billion last year and only EUR 400 million now.
Mr President, at the first reading of the 2002 budget, we would like to express our reservations about a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament and which put increasing pressure on spending in order to meet, as explained in the motion for a resolution - and I quote 'the legitimate expectations of citizens, regions and governments of the European Union' .
Go on, blame the citizens!
In the few minutes' speaking time that I have, I will give one example; that of the B3-500 budget line, to which the European Parliament would like to allocate EUR 7 million in order to fund the so-called European political parties.
This appropriation is without legal basis and has no moral justification.
Of course, the citizens have never given their opinion on this, but if we asked them if they want to pay more taxes to fund political parties in Brussels, they would obviously say no.
On the other hand, the MEPs would say yes, as this is of great interest to them.
These European political parties are inter-party organisations that have no militant base to speak of. Their funding - provided thus far by the parliamentary groups of this House out of their administrative appropriations - has been the subject of a recent report published by the Court of Auditors.
Because of this, the so-called European parties are seeking other sources of funding.
And since the citizens do not seem to want to pay of their own accord, we are going to make them pay by means of tax and social security deductions, so that they have no choice.
For reasons that I have already explained during our debate on the Schleicher report on 17 May 2001, and in my explanation of vote given on the same day, the B3-500 budget line has no legal basis, no more than the draft regulation on the status and funding of European political parties. The Council has still not reached agreement on this regulation.
Admittedly, the Treaty of Nice provides the possibility of a legal basis by adding a second sub-paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but there is no need to remind you - especially in the wake of the negative outcome of the Irish referendum - that there is still a long way to go before this Treaty can be ratified.
Lastly, the draft regulation without legal basis and currently being examined by the Council aims to put in place an underhand funding system that runs counter to freedoms.
To cap everything, the chairs of the five European parties have recently written to Council and to the Commission to demand that the funding from Europe is increased to EUR 15 million instead of EUR 7 million.
Such is inflation!
We believe that the political parties in Europe must be freely financed by citizens and by the national political parties, who are themselves funded according to national regulations in line with their respective legal system and constitution.
That is why, Mr President, the MEPs of the Mouvement pour la France group, along with the Members of the SOS DÃ©mocratie group, will vote against the B3-500 budget line.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Budget process has many problems which we know of old, and new challenges which we cannot yet, in the course of this first reading, conclusively evaluate and deal with.
I wish at this point to return explicitly to something about which there are some rather vague conceptions in this House, namely that, since 1992, there has been a fundamental change in the common agricultural policy.
Commissioner, in announcing a letter of amendment, you reminded me that this is the same procedure as every year, with, first, the spectre of a budgetary crisis being conjured up, and then the discovery of room for manoeuvre in the agriculture budget.
At this point, I say an emphatic 'Yes' to a contingency reserve, but when there really is a crisis, this reserve must actually be used, for many sectors currently find themselves fighting for their very existence.
I would very much like to take up the debate on the eastward enlargement, in order to make one thing clear: I have no problem whatever with the full integration of the acceding countries' agriculture into the Common Market by 2004, if at the same time the free movement of persons, capital, services and goods, which is part of full membership, is also made a reality, so that there can at last be a fair debate on the whole context of this topic.
The conclusions of the Heads of State and of Government at Nice have, on the one hand, highlighted the need to start restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets.
I support this, but would point out at the same time that we cannot, on the other hand, let a very restrictive approach in the next two years keep the remaining European fishing fleets at arms length and wasting away.
We must have discussions with the Commission about this.
Let me say quite explicitly that the 25 July communication from the Commission on the frontier regions was held by Parliament, in its resolution of 5 September, not to comply with the requirements laid down by the European Council.
For that reason, Commissioner, we call upon the Commission to produce definite proposals for a regulation on the frontier regions.
Let me now address one further point.
We made 400 posts available in the 2001 Budget.
We are now talking in terms of 317, which are still being kept in reserve.
Commissioner, please just take a look at the posts in the Commission which have not yet been filled.
I will remind you, in addition to the points we have mentioned in connection with the release of the reserve, that we spent last year reiterating that reform includes the simplification of the acquis communautaire, without the Community patrimony being substantially affected thereby.
There is, in my judgment, a need for further negotiation on this point.
One final point, Mr President: We expect, before the second reading, to have a comprehensive report by the Commission on the re-examination of the fundamental concepts of foreign policy, so that we have, with reference to current demands, a conclusive plan for combining conflict prevention, decisive humanitarian aid and the alliance against terrorism in a rational Community package, which we will be able to adopt at second reading.
Mr President, I will start by focusing primarily on the SeppÃ€nen report.
This is a comprehensive report which addresses all the problems of the final stage of the ECSC' s life, but it also takes into account the problems of the future, if it is true - which it is - that, although the ECSC is dying, the coal and steel industry must continue to develop in Europe.
The sum set aside for the ten remaining months of the ECSC budget is sufficient, and the increased appropriations for research are in line with the forecasts for after the Treaty' s expiry.
Parliament wants to play a leading part in our endeavours to give a reassuring response to the 357 000 workers who are employed in the sector and to provide a secure future in terms of the growth and restructuring of the sector.
I would now like to focus, in the last part of my speech, on the Union' s general budget.
As the members of my group have already said, starting with the coordinator, Mr Ralf Walter, our opinion of the work carried out by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg is positive.
There are many elements which deserve a mention here: the undertaking to improve the quality and speed of expenditure, and here I refer to the Structural Funds, which require an extraordinary measure from the European institutions to motivate, coordinate and carry out prospective and retrospective assessments so that European federalism does not fail this major test; the attention given to the issue of border regions, mentioned by Commissioner Schreyer - I, too, agree with Mr BÃ¶ge when he says that it is right to clarify the concept of a border region - not least in relation to the enlargement process: regions which must not be the only ones to benefit, Commissioner, and I would stress this point, for the pilot project approved last year does not and must not, as it progresses, just concern the border regions.
We have got off to a good start: the negotiations will take place and I feel that, ultimately, we will achieve a sound budget, but when I think of this great asset which is Europe, an asset which is ours and ours alone, a supranational political entity which others look to for guidance, as they will have to in the face of fresh challenges, I wonder whether we really ought not to review the financial mechanisms of the European budget if we want to consolidate a great supranational institution which is the envy of all and which needs more resources and a role that is more clearly defined.
Mr President, the 2002 budget for the European Union mirrors its anti-grass roots and arbitrary policy.
It is a budget for managing interests which presents no central objectives for resolving the problems being created by the recession, not even as a propaganda exercise.
The draft budget makes no serious or fundamental attempt whatsoever to redistribute income to the less developed areas or to the working classes hit by unemployment, underemployment and poverty.
The austerity imposed on the Member States and the European Union as a whole means that even the budget lines available in the past have been cut back.
Agricultural spending is being constantly eroded, with tragic consequences for farmers, in a bid to make national budgets pay for the anti-farming policy decided in Brussels.
On the contrary, following the terrorist attack on 11 September, the European Union is being called on to fund intergovernmental cooperation in the so-called area of justice, that is, to keep files on and prosecute citizens who go beyond the bounds of resistance and reaction tolerated by the system.
Finally, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the budget because, instead of resolving the current problems, it will create new problems for workers, farmers and small enterprises, instead of contributing towards peace in the world, it promotes war and an imperialist hegemony, instead of protecting individual and collective democratic, political workers' rights, it suppresses them.
Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking Mr Costa Neves for his very good work on next year' s budget.
It is with satisfaction that I at least observe that, for the first time in quite a few years, there has been no serious talk about revising the budget ceiling.
That is, for me, the sign of a rapporteur who, in a real sense, chooses to respect and apply the budget as a ceiling of expenditure and not as a target for expenditure.
That is something I think bodes well for forthcoming negotiations.
In spite of this, there is nonetheless good cause for warning against an unduly expansive budget, especially when it comes to categories 3 and 4.
The limited margin in both these categories is cause for concern, especially when, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September, we see an approaching need for measures of humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, as well as a need for measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
The European Union is already expensive for taxpayers.
I believe it to be obvious that we must ensure that it does not become still more expensive.
I see it as self-evident that, at this stage, Parliament should create room for negotiation in relation to the Council.
There is, however, reason for calling for a general tightening-up, on the parts of both the Council and Parliament, before the second reading so that, from a purely budgetary point of view, they are able to handle the situation that has arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
Finally, just a few brief words about Mrs Buitenweg' s report.
The rapporteur has made progress in the preparatory work before enlargement in 2004.
That is good, and there is cause to thank her for this.
I must however note that a very great deal remains to be done in order to prepare and adapt the administration before an enlargement that will soon be only two years ahead of us.
Mr President, at this stage in the litany of speakers, I feel I should focus on and scrutinise a couple of items in the budget.
I will firstly mention an issue which I had not included in my notes: the Council is pleased that Parliament shares its concern about the backlogs, the RALs.
If I had not lived through 17 European budgets, I would be amazed.
In fact, it is the governments who have the greatest responsibility for the creation of RALs and the Council could make a more useful contribution to the reduction of the RALs by renouncing the systematic underbudgeting of payment appropriations, which do most damage to the pockets of the Finance Ministers.
What really concerns me most in this budget, however, is that, in real terms, in euros, aid to third countries has decreased since 1999.
If one thing became clear after 11 September it was precisely that it is going to be necessary to maintain and develop humanitarian aid and our contribution to development aid.
And this is in no way guaranteed by the Community budget, despite the efforts of the rapporteur, and I salute those efforts.
The financial perspectives are clearly not sufficient and we have a TV-addicted Council of Ministers, that is to say that their external priorities are led by the latest TV headlines.
We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo.
We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia.
We have Afghanistan: we have to help Afghanistan.
And the next headline will become the priority.
And what price do we pay?
The price of having to make cuts in previous policies.
We still have problems in the Balkans.
We still have a serious problem in Africa.
We still have problems of underdevelopment in Latin America and Asia.
But we have to make cuts.
The other question I wanted to raise, which is related to the last point, is whether there are first- and second-class European Councils.
Why is Berlin more important than Nice, in terms of expenditure?
Why?
In Berlin, financial perspectives were set which had to be agreed with Parliament, but in Nice, the same European Council, composed of almost the same people, said that we had to create a special programme for the restructuring of the fleet that fished in Morocco.
Why is that not budgeted for?
Why has the Council, with a Commission proposal valued at EUR 197 million, not budgeted for it?
It should have done so.
And I regret that Parliament has not fulfilled its obligation, because what we have to do on first reading is budget in the way we want.
The Council will then come in at the negotiation at second reading.
I regret that we have not been able to do this, but I trust that we will be able to resolve it between now and December.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to reiterate that I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, and not on behalf of my political group, and that, consequently, I would like to know exactly what has happened and why I was not included on the list of draftsmen.
I apologise if I have made a mistake, but if not, I would like to receive an official explanation.
Having made my point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the Members of the Committee on Budgets and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for the attention he has given to the requests and concerns of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights.
We asked a great deal, Mr President, and we received a great deal in return, and this is something I welcome.
We only made legitimate requests.
We asked for an increase in the funding granted to the European Refugee Fund, and this was given.
We asked for an increase in the resources for measures to combat violence towards women, children and teenagers, and this was given.
We asked for an increase in the resources to combat child pornography on the Internet, and this was granted.
We asked for no less than six new budget lines, and these were given.
We have a new European Migration Monitoring Observatory to enable the European Union to anticipate the arrival of waves of migrants and to be better prepared for these.
We have a specific research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights of the European Union, so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes an operational reality and not just a reality in words alone.
We have a new budget line that should enable Eurojust to become operational.
We have funding for the Schengen line with a view to adapting the Schengen Information System to the realities of enlargement, and, lastly, we anticipated - and this, Mr President, is an urgent request to the President-in-Office of the Council - we anticipated, given the current situation, exceptional appropriations for use by Europol in the fight against terrorism.
We are well aware of the limits of Europol' s actions, we also know that it is founded on conventions, and thus we could experience legal difficulties in using these appropriations.
However, we would like to address a formal appeal to the Council not to allow these appropriations to escheat, to create the legal basis, which will enable Europol to become fully operational and will allow Eurojust to develop to its full potential.
Thank you very much, Mr Deprez.
You did not appear on the list on behalf of the committee.
We will try to give you an answer when we can.
Mr President, I am going to follow Mr Colom i Naval' s advice by speaking on the problem of reform, for which I am the permanent rapporteur.
This problem is quite fundamental, because we have to reiterate on a regular basis that the European Parliament is firmly in favour of administrative reform of the institutions.
The polemics that are currently raging between those with differing views should be less important than the fundamental problems, and the fundamental problem is to make the Union' s action clearer and more effective in meeting the public' s expectations, so that citizens start to trust the European Union again.
You know that, in this budget, we noted several delays in implementing this reform, particularly as regards the Commission' s response - which we have yet to receive - on the rewriting of the financial regulation, and also with regard to setting up base management.
The report's fundamental concern is with the reform of the status and organisation of a career in European civil service.
We had to take a precautionary measure and put funds into the reserve for creating the new positions that were requested.
This is nothing more than a precautionary measure, and I would like to reiterate that, for the time being, this is only at the first reading stage as we asked the Commission to provide clarification on the implementation of the single Statute, so that we could have very precise and realistic answers, particularly on the problem of early retirement schemes for civil servants and temporary staff, but also on the problems caused by absenteeism and vacancies.
We believe that the Commission will be able to provide us with the answers to all these issues, but, nevertheless, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that hypothetical positions will not help this reform to move forward.
We have 15 countries and seven institutions, but we have only one European Union, for which only one statute is needed.
We must not take refuge behind the reports published last year, because the linearity is no longer what it was.
We therefore want a clear budgetary framework in order to adopt a position, and I shall repeat the request made by all the Committees of Parliament to the Council: the Council must start talking and give us answers on a regular basis so that all our procedures - and reform, in particular - progress within a framework that is efficient in terms of budget.
This reform is vital: it must not just look good on paper, but should also be realistic and applicable over time.
Nothing will stop when we reach 2004.
Everything must continue.
The reform process must provide renewed motivation and must modernise the way we work, but it must retain a European civil service that has one objective: to implement the political plans of the European Union that restore citizens' confidence.
Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market devoted a great deal of attention to market integration in connection with the eastward enlargement.
The effects that will be manifested by this integration must also be taken into account when planning the Budget.
We see, looking at the Four Freedoms, that there will be no difficulties in some areas, but problems with adaptation in others.
There will be no great changes to the movement of goods, because substantial liberalisation has occurred, nor in freedom of establishment, because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves.
We will, though, have problems with integration as regards the free movement of labour and the freedom to provide services, for the precise reason that there has been to date no competition in these areas, and these markets are only regionally oriented unless they choose to be otherwise.
The frontier regions will therefore come under particular pressure when the freedoms in question are introduced.
Specific aid measures are therefore needed.
The recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it clear that it advocates endowing the frontier regions programme that you, Commissioner, mentioned, with additional resources.
We are grateful to the Committee on Budgets and especially to the rapporteur for their accepting these suggestions and, in part, adding to them.
One point in particular is of importance to me: the instruments proposed by the Commission are not sufficient to strengthen competitiveness in the frontier regions, as they promote only cooperation between East and West rather than the specific situation of the frontier regions themselves.
A specific programme is therefore needed, and so we request the Commission to present a legal foundation for it; I take their statements to mean that they are prepared to do this.
Mr President, to begin with, I should like to protest against the fact that the offices did not actually consider our opinion as such, for the reason that it mainly consists of amendments.
They apparently considered our opinion as individual amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I hope that this kind of procedure will run more transparently in future.
With regard to the budget, thanks partly to a tremendous effort by our rapporteur, this has become a budget of consolidation.
There are, of course, always disagreements about all kinds of sections of the budget, but we have been through worse.
I also have to say that there are clearly fewer disagreements at the level of our committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Also, the Council has made far fewer attempts at scrapping sections than has previously been the case, so, as far as that is concerned, my congratulations to the Council.
In my view, the problems that remain are at the level of open coordination.
The Council is still tempted to say that that should be financed from the coffers of Parliament.
However, Parliament must rubber-stamp this budget, yet it is not allowed to let its voice be heard fully on that score.
We will need to hold extensive discussions on this matter once again in the years to come.
We have a number of differences of opinion on this, and I hope that those can be settled in the next couple of years.
There is another problem concerning EQUAL, one of the components of the Social Fund.
Once again, the Council has made some serious cutbacks in that area too.
Despite this, I hope that it is possible to restore the Commission' s preliminary draft in this respect.
That seems extremely important to me.
I gather that the Commission has thought very carefully about how precisely that proposal should be structured.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, in the context of public health provision, we consider tobacco subsidies, which are, basically, nothing other than direct income support for the interested parties.
It can be done another way.
So, as every year, we urge progressive reduction of tobacco subsidies and their replacement by increased aid for rural development with a view to alternative forms of income, which could benefit workers upstream and downstream in the regions.
The same thing happens every year, yet so far nothing has changed.
But we must always hope.
As regards the NGOs, we are always advocating support for them.
We want to know, though, what is done with the money that is granted to them, which is only right and proper.
We therefore demand that information on them be made accessible to the public on a regular basis.
Only then will we have a chance to check whether our financial support for them is justified.
Believe me, we already find it extraordinarily difficult to get any kind of overview on what organisations we are supporting.
Equally opaque, though, is the Commission's decision to stop funding the environmental organisation 'Globe' .
This is quite unjustifiable and so seems positively wilful.
It must be added that the funds accorded 'Globe' in the current budget year were not paid out.
Yet even NGOs need to be able to plan ahead with certainty in order, for example, to be able to carry on paying their office staff.
The Commission's action in this regard is anti-social.
Where there is political will, Commissioner, one can find a way, or another budget line for the future.
As regards the agencies, it does indeed appear as if some agencies had already developed active lives of their own a long time ago.
They simply exist.
So we finance them; more money every year, irrespective of output.
That seems to be all that matters.
This cannot go on, for this money is needed elsewhere.
Our task is to ensure that the organisations we support work efficiently.
Efficiency and effectiveness are not achieved merely by blindly piling-up resources, but by regular observation and monitoring, on the basis of which any necessary adjustments can be made.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have the honour to speak for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that nearly all the amendments produced by this committee were adopted.
We have reinstated the substance of the budget estimates for regional and transport policy that you, Commissioner, proposed.
I really must appeal to the Council not to be such a two-faced split personality.
It is not tolerable for a great hullaballoo to have been made at the GÃ¶teborg Summit about our desire for a sustainable transport policy, only for the Council to cut resources in the area of sustainable mobility.
This sort of ambiguity cannot go on, and we hope that the Council will admit that.
If you want to have a rational, environmentally responsible transport policy, you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose.
My main point, though, is to do with tourism, something which did not, unfortunately, meet with favour in the Committee on Budgets.
I would, though, just ask you to think again about it.
We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe.
You all know about the debate over many years about the 'Philoxenia' programme to attract tourist from overseas, with its slogan 'tourists to Europe' .
This topic has taken on a whole new dimension since 11 September.
Not only are the airlines getting 20%-30% fewer customers, but so are hotels in Brussels, Berlin and in all European cities.
The same is true of restaurants, souvenir shops and boutiques.
We are seeing a massive slump in tourism, specifically from the USA and Canada.
This situation is leading to major difficulties in the economy and putting jobs at risk.
I put it to the Council and the Commission that, if we are to discuss the consequences of 11 September next month, we should re-examine the question of what we are to do to promote tourism in Europe.
Mr President, at the very outset, I wish to thank Mr Costa Neves for being so understanding, as he has worked on the questions we are discussing with really great care and interest.
I am deputy chairman of the delegation to Slovakia, and we were in Slovakia last week.
Our programme included, among other things, a visit to the 'green frontier', the Ukrainian border near Kosice, where we saw that a very large number of refugees, especially from Afghanistan, were crossing the border, probably not with a peaceful purpose; it is estimated that 10% - 30% could have other activities in mind - of a terrorist or military nature, for example.
So I wish to ask the Commission and the Council, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible to secure our borders, in particular, by immediately using the pre-accession support framework to make available the necessary apparatus on the borders that candidate States share with States not in the EU.
We are talking here about basic equipment such as night vision devices and motor vehicles, so that these frontiers can be better watched with immediate effect.
Secondly, the Committee concerned itself intensively with problems in connection with the support provided by the PHARE programmes and with the Toth case.
The Committee decided, from both a Slovakian and a European standpoint, not to put funds in reserve.
In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached.
The deputy prime minister with responsibility for this has resigned, which represents the political outcome.
The director dealing with the case has also resigned - a replacement has been appointed - and, in addition, the Slovak parliament has just passed a new law on financial monitoring and internal auditing.
So we will, I am sure, be able to take these funds out of the reserve by Second Reading.
Mr President, I just want to raise two points this evening at the same time as praising the rapporteur for the very sensible and courteous manner in which he has run the budget in advance of next year.
My first point is addressed to the Commissioner and concerns B-1 items where the Commission pays an enormous amount of money for subsidies for growing rice, bananas and the distillation of wine.
These are items I would have thought we were by now starting to reduce the payments for.
I would ask her to look at them.
I tabled many amendments amounting to hundreds of millions of euros.
I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that, being left to grow year by year, it should be looked at very closely.
Perhaps I could ask her to do that in advance of future budgets.
The other matter is a perennial matter which comes up each year: the European women's lobby and finance for women's organisations generally.
We tabled an amendment, and so did Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to say that the money that is voted for lobby organisations for women following the Beijing conference should not all go, as it has for many years, to the European Women's lobby.
I know many of my colleagues in the Chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around Europe saying it all must go to this one organisation.
This is wrong, we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field.
It is right and proper that the amendment that was put forward by the United Kingdom delegation was in fact passed.
This made it clear, in the remarks column, that one organisation, any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65%.
I trust that the approved amendment will be held to when the budget comes out.
I thank the Commissioner for her consideration.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Costa Neves for his efforts on behalf of all of us in this procedure and to say that it is a very technical and difficult task he took on: he has discharged it with great skill and shown much patience and kindness to all of us who wanted our ideas taken into consideration.
I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner.
Of course, in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and, unlike national budgets, it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union.
It is too small for that, even in the area of Structural Funds, for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP.
Ireland, at the best, was getting 2%, Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1% and 2% of GNP.
It is not a very generous outlay of money, but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best, then the money can be usefully spent.
There is one idea and one hope that I have always entertained.
I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop.
The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them, but there is one area that I would like to see developed.
I do not want to see an expansion of public spending at European level.
But in the area of economic cooperation and development, if we could only pool at European level the resources which the countries of the European Union and the European Union itself devote to international cooperation and development cooperation, we could convert individual national efforts into a common European effort without increasing the sum of taxation.
This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy.
I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor, help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world.
If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union, it is here.
Mr President, as in previous years, this debate is characterised by two elements which we could describe as endemic.
One relates to the general amounts and the other to the deficiencies in the rules on budgetary management.
Our differences on each of the spending categories are clear and I am not going to go into the detail.
Commissioner, representatives of the Council, we need the budget to be an effective and credible tool which works for employment, for research, for support for small businesses and for the construction of a genuine area of justice and security.
Parliament has shown flexibility and austerity in this procedure and it is therefore in a position to ask the Council not to be politically autocratic and to show unequivocal signs that it is prepared to negotiate.
I trust that you will take advantage of the flexibility demonstrated by our rapporteur, Carlos Costa, whose work - as well as the efforts of the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr SeppÃ€nen - deserves to be congratulated.
With regard to the resources intended for external Union action, we demand that this Parliament' s undeniable political objectives are guaranteed, and these include providing resources for areas which are essential to world balance, such as the Mediterranean and Latin America.
In this procedure, the Commission proposes using the flexibility instrument to finance the restructuring of the Community fleets which fished in the area of the defunct fisheries agreement with Morocco.
This decision is fair, technically correct and necessary.
It deals with a very serious problem which affects employment and a key activity of many regions, and which arises in a context of crisis.
We must remember that we are about to implement a new common fisheries policy which has been dogged by intolerable discrimination for decades when compared to other economic activities, from the point of view of internal market rules.
As for budgetary management, this Parliament has repeatedly condemned the Commission' s inability to put an end to the problem of the so-called anomalous RAL.
In this respect, we have produced a good strategy, which our rapporteur has mentioned, which is closely related to the reform of the Commission.
We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used.
We must therefore find rules which work, methods which allow faster implementation and rules which shorten the cycle of projects.
As the last speaker, I hope that the Commission and the Council obey the evangelical maxim when it comes to paying attention and that the last are put first, not only in the Kingdom of Heaven, but also here in Parliament.
Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
He had asked me to wait for it.
On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget.
Things like that do not happen all the time.
So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us.
Many thanks!
Thank you very much, Mr Walter, for such a constructive point of order.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00 a.m.
EIB: Community guarantee against lending losses
. (FI) Mr President, the European Union has an easy way of helping other countries: the European Investment Bank receives guarantees for loans it grants to other countries.
The recipients of loans benefit from the EU guarantees in the form of interest rates that are lower than market rates.
This is also the case here as we are debating a loan guarantee in respect of loans granted by the EIB to Russia for environmental investments.
The maximum amount of credit is envisaged as 100 million euros.
The bank is imposing the criteria according to which the loans are to be granted.
If Russia fails to propose projects that fulfil the bank' s criteria the loans will not have to be granted.
This is a new, positive initiative that will put new life into the notion of the EU' s northern dimension, which has become rather anaemic.
The loans will be used to try to improve the state of the environment throughout the Baltic region and, eventually, therefore, the Member States of the EU also.
Parliament has not called into question the matter of loans to Russia.
The proposal has the broadest possible political support.
Problems have nonetheless been caused by the way in which the Council and the Commission are taking the matter further.
In the summer, the Commission submitted a proposal to Parliament that the loan guarantees should be issued in the same way as other EIB loans guaranteed by the EU, and that the guarantee in question should be 65%.
That is still the only proposal that the Commission has submitted to Parliament.
The Council, however, decided later to take exceptional action and insisted on adopting a full 100% guarantee in respect of the loan to Russia, rather than one of 65%.
Russia has therefore been treated differently from other recipients of EU loan guarantees.
The Commission endorsed the Council' s proposal, but it has not submitted a new proposal on the matter to Parliament.
Consequently, we, in Parliament, are debating the Commission' s original proposal for a 65% loan guarantee.
Parliament demanded a new round of consultations as a result of the revised proposal.
After all manner of talks with representatives of the Council and the Commission we have received a letter from the Council that may, with a little goodwill on our part, be interpreted as a rehearing of the Parliament.
The Commission also has indicated in writing that it has approved the 100% guarantee.
As this is a deviation from the general rule, the Committee on Budgets would have liked to have an entirely new proposal from the Commission.
The Commission said it could not submit one in time.
In this case 'in time' means it would be most beneficial to all parties if a decision could be taken on the issue this year.
There is a ceiling for EU loan guarantees, which is formed by a special Guarantee Fund.
Funds are gradually transferred to it from the Guarantee Reserves as guarantee commitments are made.
This year the ceiling is 208 million euros.
The guarantees in respect of the loans to Russia fit into this year' s envelope even though the 100% guarantee takes a larger part of it than a 65% guarantee would.
A decision is needed this year, as there are so many commitments for next year that there will be no room then at all in the Guarantee Fund for new guarantees - not for loans for environmental investments in Russia either, which is the case here.
It would take consensus on the part of all the EU institutions to raise the ceiling for guarantees and it is not always a simple matter to achieve that.
If, therefore, we want to ensure that the EIB loans will be used for Russia' s Baltic Sea basin environment, it is best to take the decision this year.
The Committee on Budgets has been ready for it, even though the action of the Council and the Commission cannot be deemed to be completely appropriate.
Thus, the committee is working on the principle that there should be no precedent set here and that similar matters should not be dealt with in this way in the future.
Parliament insists that account also be taken of the priorities it has set.
As the permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees in the Committee on Budgets, I would like once more to draw attention to the fact that next year there will be no margin whatsoever in the Guarantee Funds for new and unexpected aid actions.
The Commission must take action accordingly.
Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy warmly supports the Council' s decision to grant a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under a lending action for environmental projects in the Baltic Sea basin of Russia.
We feel considerable unease faced with the environmental situation in that area, which is in immediate proximity to the European Union.
We believe that environmental investment in that area is required urgently and, in certain cases, even as an emergency measure.
We note that the European Investment Bank has already begun negotiations concerning participation in projects for dealing with waste water from St Petersburg and Kaliningrad.
It is important that the problems in these areas should be solved as soon as possible.
There is also reason for pointing out that environmental investment in this area can be more effective than many other investments within the Community and that major positive effects on health and the environment can be achieved for people in the European Union.
We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, can therefore warmly support the proposal tabled.
Mr President, I should like to thank the draftsman and express my support for Mr SeppÃ€nen' s report.
In certain parts of the immediate surroundings of the European Union, the environmental problems are genuinely alarming, especially when it comes to the water in the Baltic.
EU countries are naturally affected just as much by these problems as large parts of Russia, Poland, Kaliningrad etc. To obtain clear water in the Baltic, it is crucial for us to cooperate across borders.
I, myself, live in an administrative district on the Baltic, NorrkÃ¶ping, where one of the greatest problems we have when it comes to water quality is that we still receive so much untreated waste from the candidate countries and from Russia.
This is a very big problem for the EU Member States too.
We know, for example, that untreated waste water from 3-4 million people in the St Petersburg region is still being released and that the situation around Kaliningrad is much the same.
Such conditions affect us all.
In order to develop this region and to get to grips with the major problems, especially at a specifically environmental level, we have created the Northern Dimension, covering a very large area from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east.
Restoring the balance in the Baltic is a measure to which exceptional priority should be given.
The matter is urgent, and that is why I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has also expressed its wishes.
For myself, coming as I do from the Committee on Budgets, it is also a question of presenting the financial aspects of this proposal. From the Committee on Budgets, we should like to sound a warning note in this House.
The guarantee reserve that exists to cover possible credit losses is seriously stretched, both this year and next year.
The scope for this loan to Russia is really created simply through our not successfully implementing other commitments.
We have had to postpone other promised projects. Otherwise, we should not have managed to grant this loan within the framework that had been set.
If we are neither to renege on our promises in the future nor to give up our new ambitions, the Council and the Commission will therefore have to review the guarantee reserve ceiling relatively soon.
The situation is slightly reminiscent of the discussion we had in the budget debate earlier about the fact that the Council is happy to issue promises but then does not arrange satisfactory financing.
I should therefore like to ask Mr Solbes Mira what the Commission' s plans are when it comes to tabling proposals concerning the future of the guarantee reserve.
I assume the Commissioner agrees that there is a lot of pressure upon the ceiling for this reserve.
Commissioner, Mr Arvidsson, I can agree with everything that you, Mr Arvidsson, said about the importance and environmental significance of this decision.
We also know that the decision we are now discussing probably concerns the most important individual position to emerge from the meeting of the European Council in Stockholm.
I would again point out that it is the north coast of the Bay of Finland that has to receive all the waste from St Petersburg, something which leads to a particularly high degree of algal bloom.
I therefore wish to declare that I have a major interest in this issue and that the waste water from 3.5 million people has a very profound effect upon the environment and archipelago in my native Finland.
We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million.
These funds are to be used for selected projects which have clear environmental objectives and are also of considerable interest to the EU.
I believe that this is one of the critical points, if account is taken of what emerged from the discussion yesterday at the meeting of the Northern Dimension in Finland.
One Russian minister said that there is criticism of the selection criteria and wants international funding organisations to play a larger part in the project planning.
At the same time, we know that the budget of the North West Sewage Treatment Works has significantly exceeded Finland' s and the Nordic Investment Bank' s estimates.
I believe we must give a one hundred per cent guarantee.
I do not believe that EUR 100 million will solve the problem.
We know that the Russian Federation does not give guarantees and that the guarantees of the city of St Petersburg are completely used up.
I, therefore, appeal to my fellow MEPs to show solidarity on this issue.
Give a one hundred per cent guarantee for this project.
It would be in our interests, and we should be gradually paving the way for greater environmental awareness in St Petersburg, something to which we must always be attentive.
The situation is significantly more complicated than Mrs WallstrÃ¶m imagines.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Parliament for its willingness to adopt a report on this special instrument within the Union' s Northern Dimension.
This will provide a Community guarantee for EIB loans, to a value of EUR 100 million, for the purposes of environmental projects in Russia, as you have pointed out.
As you know, this decision was adopted in a very specific way.
This is the first time that financial operations in Russia have been accepted and the operation is not only of interest to Russia but also to the bordering Union countries.
The Commission had proposed the 65% guarantee normally considered for this type of operation laid down in the general mandate of the European Investment Bank.
However, we know that the Council, for a series of reasons relating to the unique nature of this operation and the need for greater transparency, suggested that in this case a special Community guarantee of 100% was required.
The urgency of the use of resources this year has led the Commission to accept this 100%.
I do not exactly know the procedural problems which have led to the information reaching Parliament excessively late, but, according to my information, the Council informed Parliament on 20 September of the amendments under consideration, on 12 October the Belgian Presidency explained the changes in greater detail and, on the same day, the Commission sent the Committee on Budgets information on the reasons why we were accepting the Council' s amendments.
With the unanimous decision of the Council and with the Commission' s acceptance, there was no need for the Commission to present a new proposal.
We believe that it is urgent to approve this decision during 2001 for the same reasons you have raised.
A delay until 2002 would clearly hinder funding given the narrow margin for manoeuvre we have for next year.
However, this decision is not going to affect any other type of operation.
In his report, Mr SeppÃ€nen made references to other fundings: the Turkish case is the most obvious, coming from the 2000 contributions.
Actions in 2000 and 2001 have already been financed and problems of this nature do not arise.
However, another longer-term problem does arise: how are we going to handle the funding capacity of the European Investment Bank within our lending mechanism?
Mr FÃ€rm also asked what we intended to do as a Commission.
I wanted to tell you firstly that the Commission is grateful to Parliament for raising this problem of the limited capacity for indebtedness that we have within the mechanism of the Guarantee Fund.
The Commission has already raised this problem in the Council and also here in Parliament on various occasions, and we believe that, if there are new initiatives in the context of 2002, current problems will become more serious and it will be essential to take certain decisions.
The Commission is currently weighing up various options and we intend to approve an initiative relatively soon by means of a Communication which we will send to the Council and to Parliament.
I cannot respond to Mr FÃ€rm by indicating which option we are considering at the moment but I can point out that in the past we proposed a reduction in the level of coverage from 65% to 60%.
This could be one of the instruments, like any other which may be necessary, for creating a greater margin for manoeuvre in future actions.
This is what I can tell you at the moment and I would like to thank you for your cooperation in the debate on this report.
Thank you very much, Mr Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
EBRD: Community contribution to Chernobyl Shelter Fund
Mr President, as we all remember, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl occurred on 16 April 1986 and it is still history' s most serious nuclear accident.
Radioactive contamination affected people and nature over vast areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and, furthermore, some present EU countries also suffered.
Around the destroyed unit a nuclear shelter was constructed hastily, given the conditions, to halt the spread of the pollution.
Inside the deteriorating shelter there are still more than 200 tons of uranium and almost a ton of radionuclides, of which 80% is plutonium.
The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was set up in December 1997 to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan, whose purpose it is to protect people and the environment from any new radioactive contamination.
The preliminary estimate of the cost of the project for the period 1998 - 2005 was around USD 758 million.
The first conference of the parties funding the project was held in New York in November 1997.
A total of USD 400 million was obtained in the form of pledges from twenty-five countries, of which USD 50 million was payment in kind from Ukraine.
This sum was sufficient for the first stage of the Shelter Implementation Plan.
The European Union at the start financed the shelter work with a payment of USD 100 million, which was pledged at the Denver Summit in 1997.
This amount came out of the general budget for 1998 - 1999.
A second pledging conference was held in Berlin in July 2000 to organise a final contribution to the scheme.
At that conference 22 countries in all decided to pledge around USD 320 million and the European Union pledged a further EUR 100 million for the period 2001 - 2004.
The report being discussed concerns a proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution by the European Community to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
The matter before us is thus Parliament' s opinion on the adoption of this regulation.
The current financial situation is as follows. In all, USD 716 million has been pledged to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and this includes USD 50 million from Ukraine as an in-kind contribution.
Consequently, the fund still lacks money, as the estimate of costs is rather higher, totalling at least USD 720 - 750 million.
For this reason - as this issue is being taken forward - it must be assumed and expected that Ukraine will also be able to organise this second contribution of funds.
The problem here is that the budgetary authority in 1998 set a 13% ceiling regarding the use of TACIS appropriations in respect of nuclear safety projects.
If this were to apply, the decisions could not be taken at present in the way the Commission and the Council have proposed.
However, I support the Commission' s proposal to set aside EUR 100 million for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund as this project' s implementation is of vital importance to the people of the European Union and their safety.
I also support the Commission' s proposal that there should be a special budget heading created for it so that the way in which the funds are being used can be monitored.
Clearly, it will be difficult to use these funds as people will be working in difficult conditions in which there is a huge number of international players and where the situation is to some extent still vague in the administration of the Confederation of Independent States.
All in all, I would nevertheless support this Council proposal, with certain amendments.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PSE Group in support of the Virrankoski report, which gives Parliament the go-ahead to grant a further contribution - as the rapporteur himself explained - to complete the Chernobyl Shelter.
I endorse Mr Virrankoski' s reasons for his choice and, in particular, I endorse the European Union' s decision to contribute practically to creating safe conditions in the wake of the 1986 disaster.
The European Union has been the largest donor by far, not just as regards Chernobyl but also with regard to safety and preventing the nuclear contamination of the Newly Independent States.
We were right to do this: none of us can forget the 1986 disaster and nobody is yet fully aware of the devastating effects it has caused and, I regret to say, may still cause.
As Mr Virrankoski pointed out, the tomb of Chernobyl still contains 200 tonnes of uranium and a tonne of plutonium, which represent a permanent danger which might - and I stress, might - also be a prime target for traffickers.
However, this was and is still a transparent, legitimate choice in legal terms: indeed, the new Tacis regulation states that the contribution to the initiatives supported by the European Union, such as the initiative on the closure of Chernobyl, will be one of the nuclear safety priorities.
In conclusion, this was and is, above all, something which the European Union has a duty towards the new generations to do.
Mr President, I wish to address two points - first the political dimension and, secondly, the issue of cost-effectiveness and control by Parliament.
As far as the political dimension is concerned, the Chernobyl disaster showed us that the use of nuclear energy involves risks beyond our control.
No national budget can cope with such a calamity.
At present, then, discussion is limited to the securing of the casing, which is urgently needed.
This is only a fraction of the money needed to deal with the disaster as a whole.
Neither the contamination of the soil and of the water underground, nor the harm done to the health of the population are capable of being dealt with within the Ukrainian budget, and it is in a situation like this that, for reasons beyond my understanding, aid from the EU runs out.
This means that these problems will remain unresolved for generations to come.
It might be added that no Western state budget - even that of a rich Western state - could cope with such a catastrophe without international aid.
This report therefore meets with the unreserved support of us Greens and regionalists.
We do not believe, though, that this will be the last contribution towards overcoming the after-effects of Chernobyl, which will be a financial burden on East and West for generations.
This report therefore invites the question: would it not be a practical preventive measure to at last bring in a European strategy for abandoning nuclear energy?
The question also arises of whether the nuclear industry itself ought to be compelled to contribute to a fund to help deal with the disaster, for it, now as then, derives profit from East European nuclear energy.
My second point is that it seems to us that the solution for implementation is not the European Development Bank, which guarantees neither control by Parliament nor affordable solutions, for Ukrainian firms are not considered when it comes to applying the resources.
We therefore urge the Commission to avail itself of all sources of information, and not only the Development Bank, in order to supply Parliament with comprehensive and up to date information.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, and also Mr Pittella and Mrs Schroedter for their comments.
Given the threat to the environment throughout Europe posed by the current state of Chernobyl, it is clearly extremely important that the shelter project, or protection system, continues to be corrected, is completed and fulfils its objectives between now and 2007, as was the intention with the initial project of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
To this end, the contribution of the European Union is essential.
You have said, quite rightly, that the scale of the disaster makes funding by a single country impossible.
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the promised contribution now amounts to approximately USD 720 million, and therefore, also according to the Bank' s assessments, the intended timetable and costs can be met, even though certain secondary activities may be delayed.
Furthermore, certain important steps have already been taken, such as the most urgent stabilisation work, which, undoubtedly, were a great concern.
The Commission is monitoring the application of the implementation programme for shelter and is attending the meetings of the assemblies of contributors.
We have already presented a second situation report, in accordance with Council Decision 98/381/EC, and also in accordance with the guidelines contained in the report by Mr Gordon Adams on the first contribution.
In this respect, I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter and point out that we will keep her informed.
We will keep Parliament informed.
It is true that the EBRD is not subject to Parliament' s control, but the Commission will keep Parliament informed of all activities which are being carried out by means of Union funds.
With regard to the proposals of the Committee on Budgets, the Commission believes both proposals to be acceptable, and that they enrich the Commission' s proposal.
I would, therefore, like to thank you for your contributions and for the work you have done on this issue, which is essential in preventing the risks that could have arisen in addition to the already serious effects we have suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster, that Mr Virrankoski has expressed so well in his initial presentation.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your contribution, Commissioner.
We hope that you can re-gather your strength and be back with us at 11 p.m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
ESF (2000 - 2006)
The next item is the report (A5-0328/2001) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission on the implementation of innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund Regulation for the programming period 2000-2006 (COM(2000) 894 - C5-0341/2001 - 2001/2141(COS)).
rapporteur. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of innovation is increasingly present in our objectives and policies at European and national level.
However, we have a unique opportunity, within the framework of the Commission communication on innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, to approach innovation in the strategy for employment, rather than solely within the bounds of the application of new technologies.
In fact, innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund can play a vital role in increasing employment and enhancing regional and social cohesion, the sine qua non to our strategic objectives, and we must not just make use of them, we must also take action to make up for lost time and lost resources, because the guidelines for innovative measures were only finally adopted a full year after the adoption of the structural fund regulations, which made delays in implementation unavoidable.
And, apart from limited funding, resources totalling EUR 104 million have been cut from innovative measures and technical assistance in order to cover old liabilities from the previous programming period.
Similarly, despite the swingeing cuts in these resources, the Commission failed to commit some EUR 31 million during the 2000 financial year and allowed these appropriations to be cancelled instead of transferring them to the following financial year.
Today, we wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that the European Commission has responded to the call by the European Parliament for a new plan on the content of innovation, how it is to be managed, how the measures implemented are to be evaluated and the strategy for disseminating the results.
However, we also wish to express our concern as to the efficiency of this proposal, which is vaguely worded and riddled with weaknesses.
We understand, Commissioner, that innovation is a multidimensional, composite concept and, as such, hard to define and confine to specific sectors or lines of action.
At the same time, we find that there has been no fundamental evaluation of previous innovative actions, which could have provided a basis for future planning.
We also find that social partners and social agencies are lacking in experience and face difficulties in their attempt to approach this concept and design innovative measures.
That is why we propose that the European Commission should adopt fixed criteria to be taken into account in fixing support priorities for and selecting projects and to state them clearly in calls for proposals.
These criteria are: the direct relevance of projects when it comes to increasing employment, really innovative features as regards the planning and implementation of the measure, the quality and viability of the measure and the potential for the circulation and dissemination of the results within the framework of the European Social Fund.
The European Commission is also vague on the question of complementarity.
Complementarity in European policy is extremely important to the sound management of resources and their multiplier effect.
The importance of complementarity is clear from this morning's debate.
However, I believe, Commissioner, that complementarity should under no circumstances mean that innovative measures will lose their specific and distinctive character, nor should it mean the deletion of budget lines referring to related but separate sectors of activities.
The description of thematic fields is also vague, especially when it comes to the social partners.
The social partners have an important role to play.
We all support it but they themselves are ignorant of it.
They themselves are ignorant both of the potential which European policy affords them and of the extent of their responsibility for creating a real European job market and increasing employment at local level.
We need to help them, perhaps with some clearer guidelines and examples.
It would be more helpful as regards the substance of innovative measures if, when defining the thematic fields for 2002 and subsequent years, the European Commission consulted the European Parliament and the Committee on the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee before announcing the thematic sectors.
We particularly welcome your reference, Commissioner, to equal opportunities and believe that this principle should distinguish not just how men and women are treated but also access to the policy on innovative measures by regions which lack innovation and face particular structural problems, such as mountain and island regions.
If we believe that a quantum leap beyond our standard policies is needed in this sector of activity by the European Social Fund, then this also needs to be expressed in the policy for evaluating and disseminating results.
We believe that the European Commission should design pioneering methods which are more penetrating and efficient than those applied to date.
Setting up a special unit to manage innovative measures is a good move and we hope that it will be suitably staffed by officials who can help it carry out its duties.
Of course, your efforts alone will not suffice and the Member States must not be left out of this process.
The dissemination of information and technical assistance for interested parties need to be promoted through specially staffed units operating in an optimum manner at regional level.
Mr President, Commissioner, this report on the implementation of innovative measures laid down in the European Social Fund, which has been so well produced by the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, considers innovative measures and pilot projects on a European level relating to labour markets, professional employment and training, study, exchange of experience and also Community dialogue, which is an extremely important instrument for the creation of jobs and social cohesion.
The priority objective of the European Union, as laid down at the Lisbon Summit, is to turn the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic development, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
This objective, which we all wish to achieve, demands innovative measures to integrate groups with special difficulties into the labour market.
Notable in this respect is the need to maintain the objective of equal opportunities, since the presence of women in the labour market is still insufficient.
The partnership between the different actors in the economy, as well as the choice of issues to be tackled, will help to achieve the proposed objective.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, this Commission communication is for the most part disappointing, especially because it lacks a clear, concise description of the substance of the intended innovation.
Precisely this defect can prove detrimental to the effectiveness of the Regulation.
From the point of view of subsidiarity, these innovative actions are to be called into question.
What is the specific added value which these actions should yield?
In this respect, the communication is bogged down in vague descriptions.
There is thus a major risk of the Commission backing useful actions which would also be implemented without ESF subsidy because national or local authorities have already recognised their usefulness.
The fact that there is still no assessment report on the innovative actions in the previous programming period (1994-1999) should ring alarm bells with the budgetary authority.
Furthermore, the Commission has planned considerable economy measures for the period 2000-2006.
Can the Commissioner indicate the reason for these measures?
And can the Commissioner also explain why the assessment report is still pending, and when it will be submitted to us?
I share the critical tone of the report.
A weak area in the report is the pursuit of a European labour market. This is still pie in the sky, given the language barriers, cultural differences and the different national systems for taxes, social security and pensions.
Europe' s most important trait is its diversity, and that is why Europe cannot be compared to the United States of America.
Experiences with ESF subsidies in the Netherlands indicate that it has been unclear on more than one occasion as to what can and cannot be subsidised.
According to the Dutch Court of Auditors, this is partly due to the loose and opaque wording of EU legislation.
Even if a conflict of interest is unlikely in connection with support for innovative actions, I still wonder if the present communication has been tested sufficiently for the risk of exploitation and improper use.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa on her report on innovative measures under Article 6 and to agree, both with Mrs Kratsa and the other speakers, that there are two basic issues in which we share an interest.
The first is optimising the application of Article 6 and the second is having the best, most efficient relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.
As far as the application of Article 6 is concerned, the unit which deals solely with Article 6 was created, staffed and started operating in December 2000.
This means that we were able to focus on implementing it and we have made satisfactory progress.
The first stage of the programme has already been announced with the call for proposals on the subject of adapting to the new economy within the framework of social dialogue.
This was announced in February 2001.
A second call for proposals on the subject of local strategies for employment and innovation is also ready and is due to be published at the end of October.
The first call was a complete success.
A large number of transnational plans was received in which social partners, trades unions and employers, as well as local authorities and companies played a very important part.
The evaluation of these plans was strengthened at the European Parliament's request and now we do not just evaluate each plan individually, we also evaluate the measures as a whole so that we can assess their complementarity.
I must say that particular account was taken in the calls for proposals of the 4 points on which Parliament also focused.
As far as working with Parliament is concerned, I can tell you that we are about to officially submit the first report on the implementation of the previous Article 6 period which is now ready - a copy has already been sent to Mrs Kratsa through official channels - and the communication makes provision for an annual report from the European Social Fund to the European Parliament on the application of Article 6.
The first of these reports is being drafted and should be submitted to you within the next few months.
Of course, there are other ways of working together and exchanging more views.
I think that Article 6 and its implementation could be a special item for the joint parliamentary and Commission committee on the European Social Fund, but there are other fora in which views can be exchanged.
One of these is due to take place on 18 December and everyone in charge of the social dialogue plans selected will be invited. Naturally we hope Parliament will also attend.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women in employment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0358/2001), by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on a Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and working conditions (9848/1/2001 - C5-0387/2001 - 2000/0142(COD)).
Mr President, in this second reading I would like to present a legal report that is broad in scale.
Its purpose is to bring up to date the European Union' s most important directive regarding equality at work, which was originally enacted in 1976.
Society has changed a great deal in a quarter of a century, so the Committee has worked hard to bring all the issues being raised in modern times to this report.
I would like to thank my colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive, fruitful co-operation we have had prior to this second reading also.
Firstly, for the first time, the Commission has proposed binding action for the Member States to adopt in order to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
Up till now there have just been recommendations and there have been very different practices among the various Member States.
Now the European Parliament is repeating its demand, which the Council has not approved, that the Member States should oblige employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
The Committee has found that a certain system that may be very useful in preventing and remedying damage resulting from sexual harassment is that each workplace should have a confidential counsellor people can turn to in such cases.
Another important issue is that the directive seeks to strengthen rights associated with maternity, adoption and parenthood in general and to protect mothers in particular - but also fathers - from the sort of discrimination shown to young parents.
Every day we hear examples of how employers still ask young women whether they intend to have children in the next few years, and this is how a very large number of people seeking employment might become the victims of serious discrimination.
This has already been illegal in the past but this discrimination must still be absolutely prevented.
The European Parliament is proposing that this directive will serve to bring this about once and for all.
This also covers the issue whereby a person must have the right to return to the same job, or at least a similar one, and with the same terms and conditions of employment, after a period of maternity leave, for example.
As rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment in which I also want to emphasise that the unfavourable treatment of fathers must be declared to be discrimination forbidden under this directive.
It is absolutely vital that Parliament tomorrow adopts the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and some groups, in which both fathers and mothers are protected and which refer, for example, to exercising the right to parental leave, so that discrimination cannot take place.
We all understand how important co-ordinating work and family life is for young families and our children too.
It is excellent to see that recently the Commission has also realised that day care is an important matter and that it will be possible in this way to raise the employment rate for women to that for men in order to increase the number of employees.
That obviously does not happen unless there is a good system of day care.
This directive does not lay down legal provision for new rights, but seeks to protect those who want to exercise their rights - both fathers and mothers - from discrimination at work.
Parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted.
This is a very strategic proposal, as equality must be actively and systematically promoted at grassroots level, in other words, where people work.
It has been a joy to see that employers' organisations have also actually approved this idea.
I hope that we will get wide support for this proposal.
I would like to thank the Commission for its very constructive attitude.
I believe that, united, we will see a decision taken on this directive soon.
If the Council does not approve all Parliament' s proposals legislative conciliation may be begun very swiftly.
Mr President, there is a German proverb that says good things are worth waiting for.
However, I remain to be convinced, especially now that I have heard what the rapporteur had to say, that everything will turn out for the best in tomorrow's vote on the recommendation for a second reading on the directive amending the important 1976 directive.
I honestly have to say that the progressive Council common position came as a pleasant surprise after the botched first reading in this House, which my group had very little to do with.
I could even have lived with the text proposed by the Council.
We could have avoided the risks of having too many new amendments at this stage and wasting valuable time on laborious negotiations on resolutions.
But that was not to be, since the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities once again failed to recognise the truism that the better is the enemy of the good.
Because of our persistence, Mrs Ghilardotti and I, the spokespersons of the two major groups in this House, which are needed to muster 314 votes, have succeeded in persuading the rapporteur not to table yet more superfluous amendments which really give women out there very little except semantic self-opionatedness and confused ideology.
We now have before us a number of new amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which the rapporteur belongs.
This directive is one of the EU's most important pieces of legislation.
It needs to be clear and legally tenable.
Above all, it should not be overloaded with excessive verbiage that really has no place in a legal text which will have to be interpreted by the judges of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Those judges to whom I have read the newly tabled definitions of harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace are totally horrified.
In particular, I wish to emphasise that the Council has recognised men's right to paternity leave.
