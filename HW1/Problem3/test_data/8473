Lastly, in relation to ACP-wide issues, the ACP want to establish some principles as a complete block.
They do not want to be subject to divide and rule and only to discuss issues with their regional groups.
If we believe in partnership in development then we should respect their wishes.
Mr President, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Yasmine Boudjenah, on her thorough and timely work, which provides us today, on the eve of the opening of negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements, with a high-quality report on a particularly important and topical issue.
Incidentally, the content of this report - and I wish to emphasise that it was given unanimous approval in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in contrast to what Mr Schwaiger appears to be saying - and the introductory words of the rapporteur herself make my intervention easier.
I shall, therefore, restrict myself to discussing a few aspects of this complex issue.
First, I wish to state the need not to play down, in order to fall in line with the WTO, a partnership that has already been around for decades and which I believe must be continued and focused particularly on one key objective: the development of our more than 70 partner countries and meeting the fundamental needs of their populations.
This highlights another issue: the Economic Partnership Agreements laid down in the Cotonou Agreement and the trade dimension of this agreement as a whole cannot prevail and even less replace a form of cooperation that must encompass various other fields and which, as I understand it, must be extended and seek to achieve better results than in the past.
Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I consider it crucial to ensure that total respect is given to the forms, timing and means of regional integration undertaken by these countries which, as we know, are not always easy or even obvious: and that it is necessary to pay special attention to the new development that is the recently constituted African Union.
And, fundamentally, I think it is crucial to ensure that there is no deterioration in the positive situation represented by the current ACP group.
Thirdly, and taking account of the disparity in levels of development between the two parties in the negotiations and, in particular, the well-known limitations in terms of the ACP countries' capacities, I wish to state that we must have studies on the predictable impacts of the new agreements on their various options and at various levels drafted and, if they are already drafted, presented as rapidly as possible, in addition to the fact that those limitations themselves reveal how crucial it is to ensure these countries special and differentiated treatment, which guarantees levels of protection able to ensure their development.
Fourthly, a more specific issue, however, that I feel is important and which Mr Titley has already mentioned: I am referring to the fact that customs revenues represent a substantial, if not almost exclusive contribution to the ACP countries' budgets, which means that the measures we adopt on trade liberalisation must take account of this extremely important fact.
Mr President, today's vote is important and fits in very well with our work timetable, as tomorrow negotiations will begin on partnership agreements with the ACP countries.
It is therefore important for Parliament to send a loud, clear message to the Commission with regard to these negotiations by means of the recommendations we formulate.
I would like to thank our rapporteur warmly and congratulate her. Mrs Boudjenah's report was unanimously adopted in committee, which is very good.
We fully share her point of view on the matter and we support her.
In this regard, I was sorry to hear Mr Schwaiger's statements, which could divide Parliament on the matter at a completely inappropriate time.
Perhaps, however, the PPE-DE does not fully share Mr Schwaiger's position.
With regard to the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE, I do not believe they improve the report, but rather that they aim to weaken it or sugar the pill.
From a political perspective, there is no real point in presenting a weak or sugared position to the Commission.
Basically, when we talk about partnership agreements, the word 'partnership? has an eminently pleasant connotation, we all agree on that, as it concerns a relationship between equals, or partners, with the ACP countries.
This, however, must not make us forget that we are not equal to the ACP countries.
These countries have weak and vulnerable economies.
Committing to the concept of absolute free trade, without first assessing the consequences for the social, environmental or economic situation of these countries, is rather like going down a dark tunnel.
We therefore think an impact assessment should be carried out first. Two years after Cotonou, this would be welcome.
We must also remove the structural and commercial barriers which prevent these countries from being able to benefit fully from the current non-reciprocal preferences.
Maintaining them would be suicidal.
What are these barriers?
Although the matter has already been raised by the rapporteur, I would like to emphasise a factor that we have repeatedly criticised, namely the problem of grants from the European Union for exports, in particular in the agriculture sector.
Furthermore, the lack of opportunity for local product processing is one great weakness of these economies.
I shall end there, as I see I have exceeded my speaking time and you are being uncompromising today, Mr President.
The problem of local processing, which creates added value at local level, is clearly fundamental and the rapporteur has quite rightly emphasised this point.
Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this debate on the economic partnership agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific nations.
I would like to commend the rapporteur on her excellent work.
It is important that these economic partnership agreements contribute towards placing the ACP countries in a position where they can be progressively integrated into the world economy.
Building capacity both in the public and private sectors, enhancing production and conforming with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries, in particular external investment and expanding economies.
We all hope for a successful negotiating process, which is due to be launched at an all-ACP level within the next couple of days.
On the key question of market access, we must move towards improved access to EU markets for exports from developing countries, so as to ensure that negotiating proposals take account of the economic interests of all parties.
I would urge the Commission to carry out an impact assessment of all the proposals.
I would also urge the Commission in its negotiations to strongly promote the importance of increased assistance for trade-capacity building.
I would, however, like to take issue with the rapporteur's insistence that a reform of the common agricultural policy is a necessary part of the process of integrating the developing countries into the world trading system.
Issues surrounding the external effects of the CAP will be dealt with in the context of the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks.
European farmers have had a very turbulent few years, following on from the BSE and foot-and-mouth crisis.
There was a major reform of the CAP with Agenda 2000, and we are now faced with review proposals that will profoundly disrupt our production and our markets if carried through.
Stability is needed, and suggestions that a new reform is necessary will only bring about more uncertainty.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this successful report which highlights as something positive the fact that the Commission wishes to introduce a free-trade area between the EU and the ACP countries.
Customs barriers are not, however, the most important problem for the ACP countries. Instead, this is, as several other fellow MEPs have also pointed out, the EU's heavily subsidised agricultural exports.
To give just one simple example, it costs Europe slightly less than EUR 700 to produce a tonne of sugar, but it costs only a little under EUR 300 to do so in many African countries.
Simple economic theory therefore tells us that African countries would have a superior position in the sugar market and that opening up the markets would be the route to growth.
Because of the EU's export subsidies, the conclusion is not, however, quite so simple because the EU backs up European exports to the tune of EUR 1 104 million so that European farmers are able to sell their sugar much more cheaply than the developing countries.
Nor, of course, will the situation change through the ACP countries' developing internal markets.
It has been said before, but it cannot be repeated too often: the EU is not a credible partner as long as we retain the agricultural subsidies.
They stand in the way of any development and of any fight against poverty.
Mr President, the report quite rightly highlights the fact that the results of the so-called EU-ACP partnership are greatly at odds with its claim to promote and speed up economic development.
Instead of noting an increase in their exports to the European Union, the ACP countries have seen them fall almost by half since the signing of the agreement.
Instead of improving, trade terms between the European Union and the ACP countries have deteriorated.
Instead of developing, these countries have become poorer.
The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the objectives stated in the LomÃ© Convention and the Cotonou Agreement and so on are far removed from reality.
They masquerade as a system of preferences, but these agreements encourage the pillaging of poor countries by large investors of rich European countries.
In the colonial past, pillaging was carried out in an open and shameless fashion.
Today, as ex-colonies have become independent, we speak not of diktats but of negotiations, not of exploitation, but of partnership, but the system is still the same.
Trade relations between imperialist countries and poor countries are designed in such a way that the former continue to become wealthier at the expense of the latter.
We share the rapporteur's opposition to the Commission proposal seeking to put in place free trade zones.
This sort of freedom would equate to getting the fox to mind the geese!
It would, however, be futile to attempt to improve a system that is fundamentally flawed.
The only salvation for poor countries is to be found in a radical transformation of the global economic system.
Mr President, I warmly welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, particularly in expressing so clearly Parliament's understanding that trade is only a means to an end, and that end is sustainable development.
All too often, in these institutions, there is a massive incoherence between European trade policy on one hand, and European development policy on the other, with trade concerns all too often undermining development objectives.
With this report Parliament sends a very clear message that development concerns must come first.
There are some key points I would like to underline.
First, capacity.
It simply beggars belief that some of the poorest ACP countries can possibly have the financial and technical resources to pursue the WTO's Doha agenda, the GATT's agenda, the NEPAD or FTAA agenda, at the same time as the EU economic partnerships agenda; and still at the same time still somehow pursue their own regional integration processes.
Yet it is these very regional integration processes that the Commission says that it wants to support.
We must get away from externally imposed timetables of which countries need to adopt new arrangements, and instead allow them to adapt at their own speed, according to their own development needs, just as the industrialised countries were able to do.
Finally, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of waiting until we have the results of the impact assessments of these proposed economic arrangements.
These must be conducted with the full participation of local people and we must have the results of those impact assessments before negotiations start.
If necessary, we should be prepared to delay negotiations until we have them.
Only in that way, can we be sure that the initiative will genuinely contribute to poverty eradication and sustainable development.
Mr President, this report is on the face of it well-intentioned and recognises the need for ACP countries to export their goods.
There are many fine phrases such as: 'worldwide inequality must be remedied'.
But, as ever, it is all hot air and naÃ¯ve idealism.
In fact, what really strikes me here is the large element of sheer hypocrisy.
Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports.
Yet, despite all the fine words, the tariff regime makes the EU a difficult market-place, with 16% being a fairly typical entry price for ACP goods.
It also means that consumers pay far too much for food here.
Of course, the solution to all of this - real reform of the common agricultural policy - is nothing more than a mirage.
How can we even talk about partnership agreements with these countries, given the continuing scandal of the European Union fisheries deals?
This Parliament continues to give its overwhelming endorsement to deals that involve huge sums of taxpayers' money going straight to corrupt African regimes: up to EUR 1.4 billion in the last few years alone, and little or none of it going to the local communities that need it.
As a result of all of this, hundreds of indigenous black African fisherman are continuing to die.
I have raised this point here before, and I am met with aggression from the Spanish and with indifference from Commissioner Fischler.
To satisfy the greed of large companies in Europe, this place turns a blind eye to a humanitarian disaster.
I do not expect many people here to agree with my view about political integration in the European Union.
On this one area of fisheries deals, please surprise me and let us see some reform and let us give these struggling African coastal communities some sort of chance.
Since 1994 there has been repeated documentary evidence about all this and it is high time that something was done.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to welcome a delegation, seated in the public gallery, from the Moldavian Parliament.
The members of the delegation have come to Strasbourg to meet with their counterparts in the European Parliament on the occasion of the fifth meeting of the parliamentary committee on EU-Moldavia cooperation.
I hope, as do all my colleagues, that this meeting was useful and that the members of the delegation have a pleasant stay in Strasbourg.
Within the context of interparliamentary relations, the delegation from the Algerian Parliament, led by Mr Bouzid Lazhari, chairman of the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs of the Council of the Nation, is making its sixth visit to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
In welcoming you, Mr Lazhari, and the members of your delegation, I would like to stress the importance that we attach to these meetings which provide the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to democratic values and principles and to the respect of fundamental rights.
The time is right, since we are currently examining the draft association agreement between Algeria and the European Union.
Mr Lazhari, I hope that the meetings that you have had with the members of the delegation have proved to be useful and once again, on behalf of the House, I bid you a very warm welcome.
Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 5, the last sentence of which reads: "considers in consequence that signing such an agreement is incompatible with membership of the European Union".
I would very much like the word "signing" to be replaced by the word "ratification".
That makes it much clearer and also means that the States that have signed still have a chance to refrain from ratification.
That is why I would prefer the word "ratification" instead of "signing".
Mr President, as you have very rightly said, the current situation in the Middle East has led my group to withdraw Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which were tabled on another basis and at a time when we were more optimistic.
Instead, we want to bring in an oral amendment to insert the following after paragraph 4:
Mr President, as we, in this Parliament, tend less towards the intergovernmental side, I would replace the word "Council" here by "Commission".
I would, by the way, like to congratulate Mr van Orden, by dint of whose initiative Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union is to be incorporated into the constitution in its entirety, without any derogation!
I have voted in favour of this report, firstly because I believe that the role of the European Ombudsman is of enormous importance, especially considering the increasing distance, in decision-making processes, between the institutional bodies of the EU and the citizens of the Member States.
Secondly, I wished to pay tribute the outstanding work of the outgoing Ombudsman, Jacob SÃ¶derman.
Thirdly, because I support some of its most striking guidelines, specifically its call for the principles enshrined in the EU's Code of Good Administrative Behaviour always to be applied and for the institutions to strictly apply Regulation 1049/2001/EC on public access to the documents of the European institutions.
Nevertheless, I feel bound to severely criticise the attempts made, also here, once again, to give what is known as the Charter of Fundamental Rights jurisdiction 'by force?, in a move that can only be seen as an attack on the Rule of Law and on European democracy - if the IGC, the only body that has competence in this matter, has not taken such action, because it did not see fit, no Community organ, court or body has the right to do so, at the risk of seriously contravening the law.
I have decided to support this report and its motion for a resolution bearing in mind, specifically, some points that I wish to highlight: its request to the European Convention to also look into consolidating the right of petition; its call for the adoption of new data-processing tools enabling petitioners to follow the processing of their own and other petitions over the Internet, its criticism of the lack of enthusiasm in the Council for cooperation with the Committee on Petitions; and also its call for petitions to be studied and processed more rapidly.
I believe that petitions could become an important tool for the exercise of citizenship and the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of persons and institutions and I find the idea put forward by the rapporteur that it could be possible 'for citizens to initiate reform of Community law through petitioning the European Parliament? extremely interesting.
Mr President, the British Conservatives support the thrust of this directive.
New engines with lean-burn or common-rail technology need low-sulphur fuels as a technology enabler to allow advanced catalytic converters to function.
It is a mistake, however, to extend this to non-road mobile machinery, for example, tractors and construction equipment.
These are not fitted with catalytic converters yet, and so do not need this type of fuel.
In fact, more CO2 will be produced at the refinery by additional processing.
Fuel costs will go up by at least 10% - another burden for hard-pressed farmers to carry at a time when they can least take it.
We are very disappointed that Amendments 10 and 13 were passed by Parliament.
The report by Mrs Hautala on the quality of petrol and diesel presents serious economic consequences for agricultural and forestry holdings.
First of all, it extends to non-road mobile machinery (namely, agricultural and forestry tractors) the quality standards for fuels which are applicable to all road vehicles.
We believe this measure comes under the NRMM (non-road mobile machinery) Directive.
Next, the lowering of sulphur levels for non-road mobile machinery will lead to an increase of 8 to 10% in the price per litre.
This measure will multiply the qualities of gas oil on the market and will bring about considerable logistical problems without providing any added value for the environment.
Lastly, the requirement to use a new category of fuel in agriculture means that storage vats will need to be changed, costing an average of EUR 5 000 per holding.
For an industry such as agriculture that has already been weakened by health crises and is awaiting the new CAP guidelines, this is a considerable extra cost.
In order to avoid bankrupting this industry, we would prefer to exclude the NRMMs and stick to the realistic common position adopted by the Council.
We would like to distance ourselves from the Hautala report.
The objective of reducing the sulphur content of petrol and diesel is, of course, commendable, but the considerable logistical problems posed by the proposal do not seem to bring about any known environmental benefits.
When the report was examined by the Committee on the Environment, neither the rapporteur nor the Commission itself were in a position to deliver a verdict on the various cost/benefit implications of such an initiative.
We do not support the inclusion of fuels intended for non-road machinery in the directive from 2005 onwards.
This is an unrealistic proposal which could further weaken the agricultural industry.
We should review the issue of the complete alignment of vehicles at the intermediary date of 2005.
Similarly, we are opposed to the removal of existing exemptions concerning the sulphur content of petrol and diesel. This is so that we can continue to deal with restrictions related to supplying the outermost regions.
Lastly, we condemn the fact that the need to change the volatility limit of ethanol-petrol blends has not been recognised.
This measure seeks to enable the Member States to include petrol with added ethanol in order to achieve the objectives set by the proposal for a directive on biofuels.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
For Portugal, and more precisely for the tourist region of the Algarve, recreational craft are a daily reality.
It is in this context that I wish to express my unconditional support for the rapporteur, Mr Callanan and for the Commission proposal that seeks to make recreational craft more compatible with environmental standards in force, particularly exhaust emissions and engine noise, which damage both the environment of the region and the well-being of its holidaymakers.
Making existing craft compliant with legislation will involve substantial costs that cannot be either disproportionate for boat owners or the sole responsibility of the shipbuilding industry.
I therefore also consider the obligation for annual craft inspections to be unnecessary.
We Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of the report entailing stricter European exhaust and noise emission limits for recreational craft.
We nonetheless reject a total harmonisation of the rules since the basic conditions in the different Member States vary so much.
The levels introduced should instead be minimum levels permitting individual Member States to introduce stricter levels for environmental reasons.
We also reject more stringent common exhaust emission requirements in the case of lakes, because many recreational craft, especially in Sweden and Finland, are used both on the sea and on lakes.
One possible consequence of drawing this distinction is that old engines that cause more pollution will not be replaced by new engines, because these do not meet the more stringent requirements.
In countries where drinking water comes from lakes, emissions cause especially major problems.
In these cases too, minimum regulations would give the Member States the freedom to tighten up the requirements concerning exhaust emissions.
Member States would also be able to ban or limit recreational traffic on certain lakes.
Finally, we believe it would be wrong to introduce further, more stringent exhaust emission requirements only three years after the directive has come into force.
It is important for industry to be given clear basic rules.
Minimum regulations are a better instrument for promoting development. They give manufacturers the opportunity voluntarily to adapt and develop technology to the highest current standards so that they can make sales to all the Member States.
.
(DE) As a German and Bavarian Member of the European Parliament, I am sorely disappointed by the outcome of this vote.
On behalf of my honourable friends in the CSU, with whom I voted for more stringent limit values, I must say quite emphatically that an opportunity to limit water pollution from recreational craft has been missed for many years to come.
Unfortunately, it is our impression that recreational craft engine manufacturers are deliberately holding back on modern engineering - we have an example of this in Switzerland - so as to be able to argue as the rapporteur has done.
It should be a cause of concern to anyone who supports motor-boat and sailing sports, knowing that more and more people enjoy these sports and leisure activities, that they are practised in as environmentally-friendly a manner as possible.
This dubious outcome in plenary today is certainly nothing to write home about.
.
(FR) We have approved the resolution on the results of the Johannesburg World Summit on sustainable development, since it demonstrates, and this is very positive, that the countries of Europe hold a largely common view of these issues, and that they display a high degree of sensitivity towards them.
On this basis, the European Union and its Member States can take action and in the future become, let us hope, the leading players in terms of respect for the environment at world level.
Although the real results of Johannesburg are not sufficient to meet the needs (since the enormity of the world's environmental problems can only be described as horrific), the Union was able to play the role of a catalyst there, for example in the launching of partnerships on water, decontamination and energy.
Amongst my particular reservations, I would like to highlight the following three:
the main one concerns the excessive role that the Union has allowed the WTO to play in reconciling trade rules with environmental rules;
secondly, the gradual dismantling of agricultural export subsidies is a desirable objective, but certainly not the dismantling of all internal aid;
finally, the Members of Parliament were not sufficiently involved in the preparatory coordination work.
.
(FR) 'The increasing divide between North and South must become our new frontier, our new challenge. We got rid of a wall in Europe.
We cannot accept another wall which cuts the world in two?. These were the engaging words of Romano Prodi in Johannesburg on 2 September, when he had no hesitation in mentioning the need for 'concrete measures' and 'binding timetables'!
Unfortunately, you know what then happened, as I do.
While we should not play down the advantages of the ratification of the Kyoto Process and the initiative to reduce by half, between now and 2015, the number of people without quality drinking water and adequate sanitary conditions, the Earth Summit has not been able, whatever Mr Prodi thinks, to 'restore hope to the poorest?!
'Let us ensure that the twenty-first century does not become, for future generations, a crime of humanity against life?...the task of the World Summit in Johannesburg was no more and no less than that!
Unfortunately, the person who uttered these words, the French President, like many other Heads of State of the world's biggest powers, has taken little account of the challenge set: the survival of the Earth and of human existence.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
In 1992, the Earth Summit took place in Rio to address the issue of sustainable development.
Numerous conferences have taken place since then.
Johannesburg should have been the opportunity to turn all the good intentions expressed over the last ten years into a concrete, courageous and ambitious plan of action.
Today, I am disappointed by the poor results achieved.
There is no point in repeating the list of shortcomings in the action plan adopted.
I simply wish to stress that research policy was given far too little attention during the debates on sustainable development.
While the main role of science is to monitor the state of the environment and to make this known to decision-makers and the public, it should be expected to formulate solutions to environmental problems.
Europe, which has put in place its European area of research, an area which is open to the world, must be in a position to share its scientific knowledge and to share the benefits of its experience with the developing countries.
These countries are faced with a difficult equation to resolve; that of reconciling the need for strong and rapid growth with all the harm that this may imply in social and environmental terms!
.
(DE) The dismantling of agricultural export incentives and barriers to food exports from developing countries mean that the countries in the south can take their rightful place in world trade.
However, the interplay between trade, environmental pollution and development which results from EU agricultural policy is often overestimated.
Disturbances on agricultural markets affect few products and should therefore be examined for any effect on lasting development.
We need to act by pushing ahead on so-called non-trade related concerns during WTO negotiations.
The WTO should stop evading the issues of consumer protection, the environment and animal protection standards.
This includes implementing the development work of the 15 EU Member States, as formulated on more than one occasion.
The decisions taken in Doha (on trade) and Monterrey (on finance) should be examined in detail immediately.
Now that the Summit is over, the vital work of ensuring sustainable development has to continue.
Johannesburg did not achieve everything, but there has been genuine progress nonetheless.
I believe that the Summit will make a significant difference in key areas such as water and energy.
The only way to deal with these issues is through common action at a global level.
In the EU, we know how much more we can achieve by pooling our resources and setting common standards and by tackling together environmental problems which have cross-border implications.
We can be proud that the EU played a crucial role in Johannesburg, presenting a very ambitious sustainable development agenda.
Without the EU's efforts, I do not think the Summit would have made as much progress.
The Summit was unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome on a target for increasing the share of renewable energy in global energy production.
This is essential if we are all to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
Even if some countries in the developed world are not pulling their weight on this score, I believe that the EU and other like-minded countries should, nevertheless, work for more ambitious action in this area.
.
(FR) Far from learning the lessons from the ecological and social crisis ravaging the planet, the Johannesburg Summit demonstrated the irresponsibility of the way in which States behave.
The Bush administration is largely responsible for the deadlock in negotiations.
But the European Union did not display any more will by confining itself strictly to the unacceptable decisions of Doha and Monterrey.
If the EU really wanted to assist development in the South, it would abolish agricultural aid for exports, which bring products onto the markets at prices which defy any competition.
The common agricultural policy still works on the basis of productivist thinking by multiplying surpluses.
It is urgent that we re-orientate direct aid in order to promote sustainable agriculture.
Against the widespread opening up of borders advocated by the WTO, the poor countries must be able to protect their agriculture by establishing tariff protections to stabilise internal prices.
The need for funding in order to guarantee access to drinking water, to energy, to health and to transport is enormous.
We must put an end to the stifling of public budgets by structural adjustment policies imposed by the IMF and cancel the external debt of the countries of the South.
National States must regain their sovereignty in the definition of their development priorities.
The resolution presented to Parliament does not take sufficient account of these issues and I have therefore abstained.
The EU may make grandiose statements, but the pitiful outcome confirms that Johannesburg was nothing more than a meeting steeped in hypocrisy and crocodile tears between the countries of the so-called developed world on the misery which their capitalist interests have imposed on the third world.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament resolution, for all its wishful thinking and "sensitivity", is merely a mouthpiece for the same hypocrisy.
It is infuriating to hear claims that capitalist globalisation will work to the benefit of poor countries, given that the unrelenting terms on which international capitalist trade is conducted do absolutely nothing to improve the life of the people on this planet.
Not a word on the foreign debt which brings developing countries to their knees or the responsibilities of the multinationals; just disgracefully hypocritical self-satisfaction when the same multinationals are called on to demonstrate "sensitivity"!
The claim that subsidies for agricultural produce in the EU are responsible for the underdevelopment of the third world and should therefore gradually be abolished has been swallowed hook, line and sinker in a frenzy of hypocrisy.
The same wishful thinking, the same begging for "sensitivity" and no progress on applying the Kyoto Protocol, while the capitalist world, and especially the USA, turns a provokingly blind eye to impending catastrophe.
We shall vote against the resolution in protest against those paving the way for even greater exploitation of the masses.
The concept of sustainable development stems from one need: to respond, through a solidarity which is mindful of the future, to the feeling of complexity and dependence which characterises globalisation.
What kind of world community, however, should we propose to future generations?
'Terminological antidotes' are brandished in the guise of panaceas; the concept of sustainable development is one of them.
In an environmental discourse in which the precautionary principle becomes a policy and good governance a myth, it is easy for this concept to feed off itself and justify itself.
Because this vague principle, which advocates transparency in decision-making, is sometimes very opaque.
Today's resolution is typical of the texts submitted to us on this subject.
Based on declarations of intent which make unanimity inevitable, they open the door to technical elements which are sometimes arguable.
Today, it is a reform of the CAP and Community trade policy and therefore, implicitly, the fisheries policy.
It is not a question of running down a strong and stimulating concept, but of being wary of the risk of instrumentalisation which may be in store.
We also propose a return to the interpretation of the Brundtland report, which defined sustainable development in terms of a guideline for action.
This then puts action back in the hands of national States, within the context of international organisations or by means of bilateral cooperation.
.
(FR) It is rather unpleasant to read the European Parliament's resolution on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and discover in each line a certain arrogance on the part of the Union, which wants to force the hands of the Member States, candidate countries and third countries so that they will sign up to the statutes of the Court or refuse to sign bilateral agreements with non-signatories.
It is as if the European Union had sole access to some higher universal principles which lay down that the Court must have universal competence.
Well, that is not the case.
The ICC is based on a treaty which only binds its contracting parties.
Therefore, the United States have the right to stipulate that, if they do not sign, their nationals cannot be brought before the court without their agreement.
By believing, or appearing to believe, the opposite, the Union is mistaken, and this is pointlessly complicating transatlantic relations.
Furthermore, in view of this European arrogance, it appears that the United States has good reason to be mistrustful.
How far is Europe prepared to go?
We should remember that it may be dangerous to abandon the traditional rules of international order in favour of a system of world justice which, without the consent of all nations, would have no real basis.
.
(FR) With regard to the scandalous nature of the remarks made about the United States, I would simply say that, by condemning their refusal - which is perfectly legal and legitimate, by the way - to sign up to the Statute of Rome on the International Criminal Court, adopted in 1998, Parliament is committing a gross act of interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State.
In the name of what is it doing so?
In the name of a proposed international criminal law to be imposed, God know how and why, on the members of 'international society'.
Clearly, the moralists of cosmopolitan 'right-thinking' have learnt or understood absolutely nothing.
The ICC will be to human rights what the SDN was to the maintenance of peace: a hollow shell!
The effectiveness of a legal system does not depend solely on the legislation it lays down, but also on its ability to impose its law as a result of its 'monopoly of legitimate violence'.
Public order requires a public power, an imperium which can exercise coercion.
The judge is nothing without the power of the sword.
If the ICC is to be more than a mere gimmick, then we must establish an international public power, and therefore a world government!
However much this imperialist thinking claims to represent universal humanism, we reject it.
The aggressive stand taken by the Americans on the International Criminal Court is the product of its warmongering, imperialist plans.
It is perfectly consistent with its general attitude towards the UN which, when it has trouble getting it to fall in with its plans, it ignores completely.
Thus, having adopted a bill granting immunity to American personnel, even if they commit war crimes or genocide, it is now coercing various countries into signing bilateral agreements containing immunity clauses.
Just what is the so-called international community doing in the face of this galling provocation?
The UN has rushed in to satisfy the Americans by granting them immunity for their crimes for at least a year and by excluding the crime of attack from the jurisdiction of the ICC.
The ?U remains firmly pro-Atlantic, refusing to take a stand on the rushed plans for war against Iraq, one member (England) is actively involved in preparing for war and 3 other Member States have come out openly in favour of war, with no reaction whatsoever on the part of the ?U.
In view of the foregoing, as members of the Communist Party of Greece, we consider that the ?U's interest in the ICC, as expressed in the resolution put to the vote, is hypocritical and is just part of the game of standoff between the imperialist powers as they squabble over the spoils and we shall not be voting in favour of it.
I voted against this resolution solely because I do not think that the European Parliament, which is not a signatory to the Statute of Rome, has competence to interpret any of the provisions of this Statute, specifically the provision that has enabled the USA to hold negotiations and conclude agreements with some of the States that are signatories to it.
I am also profoundly disappointed at the position adopted by this Parliament of implicitly threatening the countries that are candidates for accession, and others that benefit from financial aid under agreements and partnerships established with the EU, so that they abstain from adopting positions, in the context of their legitimate external policies, that are not in line with the EP's unilateral interpretation of Article 98 of the Statute establishing the ICC.
This aim of this explanation of vote is also to point out that one of the countries covered by this resolution is East Timor, which would not have survived as an independent State without massive external military aid against the invader, aid that we doubt would have been made available if, at the time, the position adopted in this resolution had prevailed.
.
(FR) The joint resolution, which brings together the Left and the Right in this House in a touching display of unanimity and deals with relations between the European Union and Mercosur, the common market involving four Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, intends, amongst other things, "to re-examine and resolve the four countries' external debt problem" at a time when Argentina's bankruptcy is spreading to Uruguay and is currently threatening Brazil.
The resolution urges the European Union to give Mercosur financial support.
Even amended with vague promises of aid for various 'economic solidarity initiatives? which the population has had to take in order to survive, the resolution's principle plea is for Mercosur to remain a windfall for European companies whose exports have tripled in five years and which are the main partners of Mercosur.
European companies would love to maintain their small presence in the backyard of the United States in this way.
It is precisely the implementation of this predatory policy, however, increasingly favourable to capitalist groups, both American and European, and from which the wealthy classes of Latin America have profited, which has plunged the majority of the population into misery and unemployment.
Pursuing this policy of plunder can only worsen their misery.
That is why we have voted against this resolution.
.
(FR) The joint resolution states that 'the EU is the main trading partner and the leading investor in the countries of Mercosur?.
We should take a further look at these investments.
They are directly related to liberal policies of structural adjustments.
For example, French companies such as EDF, Suez Lyonnaise or France Telecom have taken advantage of the wave of privatisations of public services in order to enter into these 'markets' with the sole aim of making profits.
That is translated into redundancies for workers and increases in charges for users.
The last straw is that a company such as Edenor in Argentina, the main subsidiary of EDF, is today asking the government to renegotiate its debt as well as an agreement to increase its charges!
Privatising profits and nationalising losses, that is what the 'Union's strategic and supportive commitment to the countries of Mercosur in relation to their economic and political integration projects?, which the policy praises, really looks like!
Mass redundancies, insecurity, unemployment, poverty, the dismantling of public services; that is what the IMF policy which the countries of Mercosur have implemented means.
For our part, we reaffirm our complete solidarity with popular movements developing in these countries, Argentina in particular.
The first minimal measure Europe could take would be the complete cancellation of the debt of the Mercosur countries.
Since none of this appears in the resolution, I have voted against it.
Mr President, my group has voted, with good reason, for the whole of Amendment No 3 to the Brok report, including the section in which Parliament urges Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions to avoid the implementation of these resolutions having to be enforced.
The resolution links this to a statement by the Security Council about the result of the inspections.
As I highlighted in my contribution to yesterday's debate, the ELDR Group too is of the opinion that explicit permission from the Security Council is required for military action.
This is, in fact, how the ELDR's entire amendment should be interpreted.
In general, we believe that Mr Brok's report is sound.
We do not however agree with certain points in it.
Paragraph 11: For reasons of efficiency and to increase the likelihood of the EU's speaking with one voice, we are, like the report, well disposed towards merging the tasks of the High Representative and those of the Commissioner for External Relations.
On the other hand, we are not prepared at this stage to state in which institution this merged office is to be set up.
At all events, the Common Foreign and Security Policy is an intergovernmental matter.
Paragraph 14: We are in favour of the rule enabling the Member States to act within the framework of enhanced cooperation, but it should not be possible to apply this rule in matters of security and defence policy.
Paragraph 20: The report should not encourage the Member States to increase their defence budgets.
Paragraph 23: We do not agree that Article 28 of the Treaty should be changed so that the costs of military operations within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy can be funded from the Community budget.
Paragraph 26: We do not oppose closer institutional relations between NATO and the EU as a prerequisite for the EU's actually being able to carry out military operations relating to crisis management, but we wish however to draw attention to our view that any military intervention must be preceded by an appropriate UN mandate.
.
(FR) In relation to the institutional organisation of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), the Brok report is typical of the European Parliament's traditional positions: it pushes the CFSP as far as possible towards communitarisation, in particular calling for 'a common, though not single, European diplomacy? (paragraph 12), qualified majority voting in the Council (paragraph 14) and the transfer of the post of High Representative for the CFSP to the Commission (paragraph 11).
These proposals are the result of a desire to impose on Europe an abstract concept of a federal State, and not a considered understanding of practical realities.
The common foreign and security policy cannot draw its strength from artificial Community procedures.
It can only draw its strength, if necessary, from the support of the nations.
It must therefore be based on those nations, which means: maintaining the coordinating role of the Council; unanimous decision-making, or otherwise variable geometry; the instruments must fall within the responsibility of the Council and not of the Commission.
If the Convention meeting under the presidency of ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing wants to be effective, it must remain lucid by resisting federalist bombardment.
In broad terms, the report on the CFSP is part of the approach extending its communitarisation and the militarisation of the European Union, implementing a Common Security and Defence Policy - as the European pillar of NATO, within the framework of our partnership with the USA.
Amongst various troublesome aspects, I feel bound to highlight the 'ambiguous? and supposedly 'neutral? way in which the current situation on the Middle East is addressed, glossing over the Israeli Government's considerable responsibility for the intolerable situation that exists in Palestine, due to its policy of terror and violence against the Palestinian people and their representatives, its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories and its failure to comply with UN resolutions.
Equally negative is the position adopted by the current Danish Presidency which, in the debate held in this plenary, did not condemn the Israeli Government for the unacceptable siege imposed on the Palestinian National Authority and the blackmail practised against President Yasser Arafat, and did not call for an end to it and the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army.
I also feel that the failure to adopt the amendments tabled by my group seeking to reject any military aggression against Iraq, to lift the embargo on that country and to promote negotiations between Iraq and the UN to find a solution to the current situation is a mistake.
Hence our vote against.
.
(FR) This report on the progress made on the implementation of the CFSP comes at a time when Europe is totally absent from the international stage!
What a paradox!
Yet Europe is still displaying the same stubborn desire to ignore the reality, which is that today, one State is making great use of its colossal power to impose its hegemony.
It is true that the attitude of the United States toward Iraq, for example, is regrettable.
However, it is also the expression of a constant in geopolitics, which is that international relations are primarily determined by States whose behaviour is a result of a free appreciation of their vital interests.
Europe's problem is that it is faced with a nation which, while already disproportionately powerful, furthermore benefits from the elimination of the great European diplomatic corps.
European integration, far from providing added value, leads to a levelling down of diplomatic corps, which maintains the imbalance between powers.
The communitarisation of a virtual CFSP would therefore be a serious historic mistake: it would further restrain the Member States, while the freedom of our nations, in the field of foreign policy as well as other policies, is what makes Europe independent; this excludes neither cooperation between countries nor freely discussed and agreed coordination of their policies.
The report on progress with the CFSP is being debated to the sound of war drums beating on the other side of the Atlantic.
The USA has stated that it is determined to proceed with its attack on Iraq, its aim being to control the oil supply in the area and impose its supremacy.
The report points the way for ?U action: closer collaboration with the USA and stronger trans-Atlantic relations.
Greater militarisation of ?U institutions, more military spending by Member States, military action to prevent and manage crises.
Alliances under the umbrella of ???? and the orders of the USA in order to silence the people and anyone who gets in the way of their imperialist interests.
The EU's imperialist policy has already shown its face in Bosnia, Serbia, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
The objections expressed so far to the EU's again becoming involved in an attack on Iraq are objections by imperialist interests and hence objections to the unilateral nature of the action by the USA rather than the war itself.
We are worried that the ?U is prepared to take part in this dirty imperialist war if it is promised a share of the spoils.
We say no to war.
We want peace, de-escalation and disarmament.
We are fighting alongside the people of Europe to put a stop to more imperialist wars.
The Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Brok report.
In the report adopted today concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Parliament expresses a number of views about the direction it would like this policy area to take in the future.
On the basis of several of these views, I have felt compelled to vote against the report.
In today's EU, there are a number of countries which are neutral, including Sweden and Ireland.
By adopting Amendment No 2, calling for mutual-assistance obligations laid down in the Western European Union treaty to be incorporated into a future European constitution, Parliament has declared that it does not respect these countries' positions and wishes to force them to give up their neutrality.
That conflicts with, for example, the accession agreements signed by these countries when they became EU Member States.
The majority of Parliament also expresses the view, in Recital I, that the foreign and security policy should be a common policy. On the basis of previous positions, this must be understood as indicating a desire for the Community method to be used and for Parliament to be given the right of co-decision.
I believe this to be an unrealistic and undesirable development.
Paragraph 19 also makes what I consider to be an insufficiently substantiated demand for a European armaments agency.
The report is dominated by the developments following 11 September and their influence upon the European foreign and security policy.
I am of course pleased about the EU foreign ministers' statement opposing military operations in Iraq and I endorse the statement that everything must be done to enable the UN inspectors to return unconditionally.
I believe that international law must be upheld and any military intervention securely based upon a decision by the UN Security Council.
The report contains a number of proposals I cannot support, including the proposal in paragraph 11 to merge the office of Council High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy with that of the Commissioner responsible for these issues and to set up this new office in the Commission.
Nor can I support the proposal in paragraph 23 about funding the joint costs of military operations within the framework of the ESDP from the Community budget, or paragraph 19 on a joint European armaments agency.
Nor can I support paragraph 20 on strengthening the Member States's defence budgets, the proposal in paragraph 14 to allow decision-making in the Council by qualified majority, or the rule on enhanced cooperation to allow those Member States which desire, and are able, to do so to take action without a joint decision's having been made.
I support neither the proposal in paragraph 26 concerning closer institutional relations between NATO and the EU, nor paragraph 12 concerning a European diplomatic corps.
We have of course voted against this report, which has the ridiculous intention of introducing an ethical dimension to the arms trade.
We are against arms dealing, whether it be official, unofficial or illegal.
And it is very difficult to distinguish between these three categories of dealing considering the number of arms deals taking place involving ministers, whether still in office or not, or supposedly 'official' persons!
It would be preferable to dedicate the productive capacity of society to the manufacture of goods other than arms.
And it is truly criminal to plunge poverty-stricken countries further into debt by selling, even legally, arms to their leaders so that those leaders can then go on to use them against their own people.
The European Union code of conduct is the most complete international system for the control of arms exports.
The European Union has a positive involvement in the restriction and control of arms exports and attempts to add an ethical dimension to the arms trade.
As well as legal procedures and treaties, supplementary actions are required in order to restrict the proliferation of arms.
Conflict prevention does not just involve the restriction of arms exports.
In order to be effective, it must be accompanied, in the developing countries in question, by support for democracy and the liberal democratic system (the protection of civilians by the State, education aimed at creating a culture of peace, the creation of institutions to resolve conflicts through negotiation, etc.).
In this context, it should be stressed that an emerging and fragile democratic regime cannot be prevented from defending itself against a rebellion that wishes to reverse it.
Additionally, the industrialised countries must also support programmes of micro-disarmament, mine-clearance, the training of security forces and legal support in their development cooperation projects.
.
(NL) In the Netherlands, my party, the Socialist Party, supports the initiative launched by a large number of peace and development organisations to institute an arms embargo against Israel by means of a temporary injunction.
This is in the light of the ever-increasing violation of human rights by the Israeli army in the occupied Palestinian territories and the destruction caused there.
Parliament's resolution on the third annual report with regard to the code of conduct on arms exports is founded on the assumption that the EU's external policy is guided by values of democracy and human rights, and that arms exports may not worsen the region's instability.
Moreover, a majority voted today for the amendment in which military-industrial relations with conflicting parties in the Middle East are condemned.
Meanwhile, the Dutch Schiphol airport remains the link and focal point of the arms trade between the USA and Israel.
This is bound to cause enormous bitterness amongst the victims and also further instability in the region.
The systematic oppression of the Palestinians gives every reason to refuse licences for the export of arms within the framework of the European code of conduct.
I call on the Commission to help put an end to the escalation of violence and to support actions by citizens against Israeli violence in the Palestinian territories as a matter of urgency.
.
(FR) Four years after the adoption of the EU code of conduct on arms exports, it was time for the European Parliament to demonstrate to the Member States their will to make the common criteria for arms exports binding.
I am delighted that amendments to this effect have been adopted.
Following the example of the Belgian Government, all the Member States should introduce the provisions of the European Union's code of conduct on arms exports into their national legislation.
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, we are absolutely astounded that the Commission has tabled a proposal to water down the stability criteria without first agreeing the matter with the European Parliament in the relevant committees.
I would ask that we debate this Commission proposal as quickly and efficiently as possible here in Parliament, because the current position does not, I think, have the support of this House.
Your proposal will, of course, have to be laid before the Conference of Presidents, which I am afraid took place this morning instead of on Thursday afternoon as usual.
If you had made the proposal this morning, we might have been able to persuade the Conference of Presidents to examine it in today's meeting but, in any case, it will be recorded in the Minutes and will be examined so that the point can be included in the agenda of one of the forthcoming part-sessions of the European Parliament.
Mr President, I must stand up for my honourable friend.
He could not have raised it this morning, because the Minutes are not approved until the afternoon.
But I wanted to say something quite different.
As you can see from yesterday's Minutes, there was no Question Time and yet the sitting ended at 10.20 p.m., i.e. considerably earlier than planned.
So there would have been time enough for Question Time.
I know you will probably say that the decision would have been taken by the Conference of Presidents, but the Bureau - and I should like to ask you to convey as much to the Bureau - is responsible for keeping to the Rules of Procedure.
And it states quite clearly in the Rules of Procedure that there must be one Question Time during each of the twelve plenary sessions in Strasbourg - at least that is how I understand it.
That is a parliamentary right and it is non-negotiable.
Hence, cancelling Question Time to the Council and Commission this week was, in my eyes, both an infringement of our fundamental parliamentary rights and an infringement of the Rules of Procedure, despite the fact that there was time enough.
This afternoon we have just one more debate.
So we could easily have held a topical and urgent debate this afternoon, but that too has been cancelled.
There has been a coup in the CÃŽte d'Ivoire. We are due to debate it on 9 October, when it will already be history.
I urge you to organise Parliament's work differently from the way in which it has been organised this afternoon and this week.
I feel that your comment should be relayed to the President - I will bring the matter before the President as a first port of call rather than referring it to the Conference of Presidents - so that it receives careful consideration.
It is true that we usually follow the practice you have described of holding one part-session per month, and this month there have been two part-sessions.
In any case, I feel that your comment is well-founded and that there needs to be reflection on the matter, on the part of our President first of all.
(The Minutes were approved)
The next item is the oral question (O-0040/02- B5-0254/02) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to the Commission on the action taken by the Commission on the MHP (Multimedia Home Platform).
Mr President, Mr Posselt may have plenty of time, but I have to leave as I am booked on a flight departing from Frankfurt at 3.30 p.m.
Tomorrow I shall be speaking at a conference in Greece on this very subject.
I apologise in advance to the Commissioner, and I will be much briefer than the chairman of our committee might have been, had he been here.
Normally our colleague Mrs Junker would have replaced him, but she has been unwell and in hospital.
I am sure the House would wish her well and a speedy recovery.
I must declare an interest as a director of a television company that will certainly be involved in digital broadcasting and the broadband communication field - though probably long after I have ceased to have any connection with it.
Would the Commissioner like me to repeat Mr Rocard's question?
And will the Commissioner be replying to the debate as a whole at the end?
The Commissioner is scheduled to speak immediately after your speech, Mr Whitehead.
Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the reason for this question and for its urgency.
Essentially it concerns the pace at which we will be able to open a full and proper debate on the standards for a single MHP, were we to have one.
The Commissioner will, I think, be saying in his reply today when the necessary standards are going to be introduced and published.
The reason for the urgency is that this subject also relates very much to the ongoing debate about media concentration and to development in the field of broadband communications, particularly in the light of what is happening in television and broadcasting at the moment.
In my own Member State we have had ambitious plans, aiming to have the most competitive broadband system in the developed world by 2005.
However, there have been stumbles along the way to the intended creation of a real competitive market for digital broadcasting and towards a measured advanced analogue switch-off.
That serves as a warning to many of us - certainly those in the Committee on Culture, which is unanimous in the view that I am expressing - that the consumer and the citizen need to benefit from an open and wide debate, taking some account of the problems we have had in past attempts at regulation, as well as of those that we face now.
There need to be clear markers on the ways in which a system of non-discriminatory interconnection and oversight of the gateways of broadband broadcasting and other systems can be operated in the public interest.
I am painfully aware of the fact that one of the first attempts to set standards for early satellite broadcasting came adrift because the most powerful broadcasters in the field at the time - and they are still there today, but stronger and more powerful - deliberately decided to bypass these standards and to go their own way.
With effective use of the market and less advanced technology, they were able effectively to end that first attempt at common standards.
We do not want to make that mistake again, and I believe that in this situation we want to know how we are proceeding.
I would ask the Commissioner to indicate how the European Union as a whole can take an active role, so that the operators of APIs are encouraged and helped to come together.
He must know of the suspicions in this regard and precisely where they originate.
The APIs are likely to be repeating in some ways what happened in the debate about conditional access and the gateways for satellite broadcasting.
Many - particularly in my country would say that you do not need to have a single mandated standard, and that it would be better to encourage the APIs to come together. For the sceptics who believe that it would be very much against some of their interests to do so, and it has to be acknowledged that we would then be gambling everything on a strategy which some of the big operators, once again, would not want to cooperate with.
How would the Commissioner square the need for competition that guarantees plurality with the technical advances which - according to those who operate it and profit by it - will come from the unregulated market?
I do not believe that we can take this matter further without a proper consideration not just of the technical debate but also of the way in which monopolies are currently developing.
Mr Rocard's questions, I hope, will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me.
I do apologise again for the fact that I have to leave before the conclusion of this debate, which I am taking part in, as you can see, at very short notice.
We would like to join you, Mr Whitehead, in wishing Mrs Junker a speedy recovery.
Mr President, the honourable Member's question relates to the interoperability of interactive television services and the role of the MHP standard.
The question contained five points, which I will respond to individually.
Firstly, on the first point, I can acknowledge that the adoption of the framework directive in the field of communications represents a powerful signal both for operators in the digital television market and for consumers.
The directives which will come within this framework will allow us to achieve three important objectives.
Firstly, to give broadcasters access to the networks and to connected equipment such as electronic guides and programmes.
Next, to prevent excessive regulation through the application of proportional access solutions and finally to benefit the consumer by contributing to the provision of a wide range of services.
If we consider the legal position established in Article 18 of the framework directive for electronic communication services and networks, the Member States must encourage openness in relation to the provision of an application programming interface (API).
No particular API technology or single API will be laid down.
The MHP standard satisfies the needs of interoperability and openness in this field.
This is why we are encouraging the voluntary application of this standard by the sector.
The second point relates the date of publication of the standards applicable in the field of MHP.
My reply is that the list of standards will be published after the meeting of the committee responsible for communications on 2 October.
Third point; the use of a non-standardised API technology may give a company power on the market.
The directive in question lays down specific solutions which may be used by national regulation bodies to control the power of certain companies on the market.
Since it guarantees interoperability and offers users greater freedom of choice, standardisation will certainly contribute to preventing the appearance of monopolies.
However, in itself competition is not a measure of fair competition.
Dominant players may appear, even when there are open standards.
On the fourth, as I said in the reply to the first point of the question, the objectives of the regulation are openness and interoperability.
The MHP standard meets the needs of interoperability and openness in this field.
This is why we are providing political support for the voluntary application of this standard by the sector.
However, the sector also wishes to hold a dialogue on interoperability, particularly on migration.
We have therefore launched a debate and sectoral investigation into interoperability.
With regard to the fifth point, in its declaration to the plenum on 12 December 2001, the Commission committed itself to publishing the relevant MHP standards in a list of standards to be published in the Official Journal, in accordance with Article 17 of the framework directive.
Pursuant to this directive, the Member States must encourage the application of the standards contained on the list.
Secondly, the Commission is committed to examining, a year after the entry into force of the directive, whether interoperability and freedom of choice for users have reached a satisfactory level in the Member States.
If that is not the case, the Commission will be able to propose making the use of these standards obligatory.
In accordance with our commitments, we will provide a list of standards after the meeting of the competent committee on 2 October, as I have just said.
They are scheduled to be examined between now and July 2004.
Article 18 of the framework directive demands that Member States encourage the use of an open API.
The Commission will therefore hold a dialogue with the Member States and national regulation bodies, by means of the committee.
The MHP will certainly be amongst the subjects discussed within the framework of this dialogue.
The widespread adoption of the MHP seems to be the most obvious means of achieving interoperability.
Businesses must take the initiative in terms of creating migration strategies since migration itself raises many technical and commercial problems.
We are pleased with the sustained efforts of the sector to resolve these problems and reach agreements, at national or European level, in view of the transfer to MHP.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed reply to the question put by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has been considering how we can find a way of guaranteeing a free flow of information and freedom of choice for viewers in the digital era.
How can we achieve this objective?
No further debate is needed, we held our debate when we passed a resolution on the telecommunications package and, more particularly, on the framework directive.
Today, and this is why we asked the question, we wanted the Commission to tell us what it can do to help implement the resolutions we passed then.
And I am grateful because I think the Commission's statements have pointed to a constructive way forward here.
However, I should like to reiterate that we have three basic resolutions.
First, open interfaces, so-called APIs are not enough; these open interfaces need to be widely accessible, i.e. they must be interoperable.
That is the objective we decided on together in the framework directive.
Secondly, we decided that the Member States should promote the introduction of interoperable technology.
Thirdly, we decided that we had until July 2004 for this voluntary procedure.
Parliament is pushing for action in order to bring about a voluntary, user-friendly solution which also guarantees real freedom of choice and pluralism.
For that, as you announced today, Commissioner, we need the technology, the standards which meet these requirements, to be published.
There is a standard which has already been licensed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is responsible for the standards, namely MHP, which is why Parliament's demand is perfectly clear in the resolution we are voting on today.
What we want to do is promote the technology that incontrovertibly meets the requirements.
Hence the demand and the call in the resolution for the Member States to submit an action plan as quickly as possible - we are saying by the end of this year - as to how this objective can be achieved, so that we have real results by July 2004.
So, as you see - and my thanks here to all my honourable friends in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who helped here - we refer to the resolution and voluntary implementation of this resolution, but in the time specified and for the purpose specified.
That is the point of this resolution.
We trust that we have the agreement and support of the Commission and the Member States, in the interest of our citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your statements today; for us they are a really important step forward in the joint voluntary procedure, as Ruth Hieronymi has pointed out.
We have not raised the question of comprehensive interoperability in the telecommunications directive, but we know that it is of huge importance to Europe, which sets standards in media policy.
The Commission and the regulators, like the European Parliament, were not perhaps decisive enough in the early days.
But we are now, because time is running out.
The summer of 2004 will be here before we know it.
Let us call it guidance that we need in this voluntary procedure; what our institutions are waiting for and what we are jointly calling for is a clear media policy message.
We have mentioned a single standard.
We have consistently avoided the word simple.
We do not want to jump the gun.
But this is not jumping the gun, it is being logical.
As my honourable friend, Mrs Hieronymi said, we could have set one standard that speaks this common language, a single language, in the MHP.
We need more clear political signals here.
We opted for a single system for mobile telephones and we should do the same here and now.
Before the industry invests any more and we have various other APIs which cannot talk to each other as we would like, because the more economic facts, figures and data there are on the table, the harder it will be for politicians to intervene directly here.
This common voluntary procedure needs clear signals from us. Again I read a quotation in a technical journal recently in which you pointed out that the Commission can lay down binding European standards here if appropriate freedom of choice for our citizens and interoperability are not achieved by 2004.
I do not think it will come to that.
We should be able to find a joint solution before then.
We need to meet each other half way.
A large majority of market players are in favour of MHP and we should say so clearly.
I think that is the answer expected of us.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be participating in this debate, not as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport but as one of the rapporteurs on the electronic communications package and a member both of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I should just like to say to colleagues from the Committee on Culture who are present that this is not an issue for that committee alone.
It would be good if they encouraged more participation in their work within Parliament.
This question was developed entirely within their committee.
I am glad to have been able to work with many colleagues and to make a contribution.
However, there is a much wider range of issues at stake here.
Firstly, I sense a perception that this whole idea about a multimedia home platform (MHP) is somehow a silver bullet, a magic cure that will, in one sweep, create universal accessibility for digital television.
Mrs Echerer gave us a hint of that just now.
That is far from the reality.
It is not like mobile telephony; it is not like introducing a GSM standard, because we already have digital television systems in the market, delivering services that consumers want to quite a high interactive standard.
In my own country nine million people already have systems operating under other standards than MHP.
Indeed, the final standard - the full interactive standard - for MHPs has not even been published, and yet colleagues here want to rush ahead and standardise it.
That is not realistic.
I also find a lack of realism about the whole idea that somehow we want to impose a particular business model on broadcasting.
This resolution contains a rather unnecessary attack on vertical organisation and my group, and I hope Parliament, will reject that element.
As the Commissioner said earlier, this is an issue on which I and other Members have worked in connection with the electronics communications package.
We have put competitive instruments in place to stop vertical operators from abusing their dominant position in the marketplace.
There are also must-carry obligations that we expect member governments to enforce.
The first thing we should be saying to the Commission is that we want them to be enforced.
They are critical.
It is not up to us to enforce a particular business model.
We are not there to do that.
On the question of application interfaces and the technology, the key word is 'interoperability'.
It is not a single standard, and just having a single standard does not mean you automatically get simple authoring or interoperability.
We have three mediums in the United Kingdom already - cable, terrestrial digital - a powerful access for people to get onto the digital system - and satellite.
Each of those has a different interface.
The Commission needs to encourage what I call a toolkit for digital authors.
That will allow digital authors to come on and have a common set of principles within which they can develop programmes for any platform.
That is the sort of practical thing the Commission needs to work on.
It certainly needs to monitor how MHP is developing and to see whether that needs further encouragement.
However, we are already well down the road to the digital revolution already, and the sort of interference that is being implied by some colleagues here - I am pleased to say not in the resolution - will not help the way forward.
We must be realistic about what is going on in the market-place and what consumers are buying now.
Mr President, as the representative of a thriving but also highly endangered media centre - namely Munich - I welcome this question by the Committee on Culture and today's debate.
I must make one thing quite clear: the European Parliament has a very long tradition in media policy, especially on television issues in Europe.
It dates back to the beginning of the 1980s with the highly prophetic report on European television by the former Culture Minister of Baden-WÃŒrtemberg, Professor Hahn, who was MEP for Heidelberg at the time.
It was way ahead of its time, even if some of the proposals made then have long since been overtaken by events.
But in the intervening years, this House has lobbied consistency for European television, through to the telecommunications directive and the Television Without Frontiers directive.
What were the two core elements?
First, we have stated quite clearly that we want to prevent this necessary, proper and important technology from being abused, by setting unequivocal ethical standards.
And secondly, we have constantly reiterated that this is a question of competition, and not just competition within Europe, but the competitiveness of Europe per se.
Today we can see that this European market stands in increasing danger from non-European suppliers and non-European monopolies.
I therefore take the view that we really do have to go the way proposed today, namely the way of voluntary convergence and harmonisation, but that this should not be used as an excuse for doing nothing.
I therefore emphatically support what Mrs Hieronymi has said.
We really do need a deadline.
We know from the Member States - of which there are presently fifteen but of which there will soon be twenty-five or thirty - that they are not exactly quick off the mark when it comes to action plans.
Having come down in favour of voluntary action, we really should set this deadline for the Member States by the end of this year, as far as submitting action plans is concerned.
Otherwise we will have to come up at the beginning of next year with ways of speeding up the process.
I share the view expressed by Mrs Echerer, that hopefully there will be no need for the Commission to step in with binding proposals and standards, but I fear it may come to that.
I should therefore like to again urge the Member States to submit their action plans by the end of the year.
We need to make it quite clear that we are as concerned about the competitiveness of Europe per se as we are about cultural diversity in Europe, the cultural diversity that makes Europe what it is and - and this too is an important point in this resolution - the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises.
And the challenge here is for small and medium-sized enterprises.
We in the European Parliament see ourselves as the champions of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are perhaps still shying away from a great deal in the dimension facing us.
Commissioner, thank you for your clear and detailed reply, but may I say quite unequivocally that, if the Member States fail to submit their action plans by the end of the year, we shall have to meet again in January in order to discuss how the European Union is to proceed.
Mr President, honourable Members, unlike Mr Posselt, I do not represent the endangered media centre of Munich, I represent the media centre of Cologne.
And if I am not from Cologne itself, then neither is Mr Posselt from Munich itself; however, as a Rheinlander like Mrs Hieronymi, I have a regional connection just like Mr Posselt.
And the only reason I am standing here talking on cultural policy issues is because I have had to jump into the breach and replace my honourable friend Karin Junker who is ill and whose illness is too serious for her to be here.
So, Mr President, if you hear me making a speech that is completely off the mark, attacking my honourable Christian Democrat friends in the usual battle of principles between left and right, it is because I am not the expert in this particular field that I consider myself to be in other areas.
Thank you for your friendly show of agreement.
Mrs Junker has instructed me to say the following on her behalf: the audiovisual sector is a growth market and a powerful economic factor.
Mr Harbour made it perfectly clear in his speech that this is not just a question of the configuration of the market, it is a question of who on the market is exercising what influence and where.
To give you a statistic: EUR 65 billion is the estimated turnover in the audiovisual sector alone this year in terms of gross domestic product.
And the audiovisual industry is an employment sector, employing 950,000 people.
It is this sector that will regulate access to information for the broad mass of people in the future.
The average person, so Karin Junker tells me, watches 206 minutes' television a day and listens to the radio for 3.5 hours.
I do not qualify as an average person.
(Applause)
The objective we must work towards, as several honourable Members have explained, is that of a single European API or Application Programming Interface, to give it is proper name.
So just as we have a single mobile telephone system, the so-called GSM system, we need one API and not 15 different APIs in the European Union.
If we want a competitive market, then we need a single system.
Which is why the difference between us and Mr Harbour is easy to explain, because what Mr Harbour has said is precisely the position of someone who insists that isolationism, of an insular nature, will obstruct the creation of this API.
MHP is the only open, interoperable standard which meets the requirements which need to be imposed on this system.
The European Commission should, as the Commissioner has already explained in detail in his reply to the five questions put by Mr Rocard, quickly take the initiative and introduce this standard.
I share Mr Posselt's view: if the Member States fail to make a move on this issue in time, then we must take the initiative.
The comment that television is the number one source of information does not just hold true for viewers during election broadcasts on the eve of elections in the Federal Republic of Germany; access to television, access to this democratic, pluralistic information system is a fundamental democratic right of all European citizens and needs to be anchored in the plurality of democracy.
Access must be guaranteed, irrespective of the form of television on offer in the future.
And if the future of television is digital, then access to this digital television system is a basic question of democratic rights, plurality and the freedom of self-determination of our citizens on information matters.
This is the only way of guaranteeing in future that, on the one hand, market suppliers will be able to offer all consumers a complete range and, on the other hand, our citizens the consumers will be able to make use of what is on offer with the greatest possible freedom of choice.
We European Socialists here in this Chamber would like to remind Commissioner Liikanen that he promised to implement a single standard by 2004.
If the media sector cannot agree on a uniform approach, then we shall go one step further.
As Mr Posselt said and as Mrs Echerer said.
Commissioner, the European Socialists in this Chamber therefore call on you to act as quickly as possible so that we can make progress on one of the fundamental questions for the future of a European information society as quickly as possible, but also in as pluralistic and democratic a manner and, my dear Mr Harbour, as uniformly as possible.
(Applause)
Mr President, seeing as there is so much interest in this issue I cannot pass up the opportunity to comment on the resolution that is to be put to a vote.
I agree fully with the European Parliament that digital television as such, including interactive television, has tremendous potential for extending the reach of the information society.
The Commission is already actively involved in advancing the role of digital television and promoting interoperability.
In particular I would like to mention the eEurope 2005 action plan.
This fully recognises the role of digital television in helping to achieve the Lisbon agenda for instance, as an alternative platform for citizens to receive on-line public services.
Member States are asked to publish switch-over intentions by the end of 2003.
Next year, the Commission also intends to adopt a communication on digital switch-over.
Another communication, on which we are working now and which should be discussed at the Copenhagen European Council later this year, will analyse remaining barriers to open platforms in digital television and 3D mobile communications.
The answers I have just provided to various parliamentary questions have outlined all the steps we are currently taking regarding interoperability in interactive television.
It is important that interoperability evolves hand-in-hand with the development of the interactive television market.
Given that interoperability in the field of interactive television is covered by the Electronic Communications Framework Directive we should avoid duplicating regulations by also covering this in the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, we will ensure that complementarity and coherence are maintained between the electronic communications package, dealing with transmission and access issues, and the regulation of contents - for objectives of general interest covered by the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which will be the subject of a review next year.
In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the resolution and calls for the development of digital television and the availability of digital television to the public at large to become a top priority on the political agenda.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order, I wanted to say that I was going to vote against.
I wanted to say it publicly.
You are, of course, within your rights in informing the House of which way you were going to vote, but that does not change the outcome of the vote.
Mr President, I know this does nothing to change the outcome but a great many Members entered the Chamber after the vote.
May I suggest that we also return to fixed, reliable voting times on Thursday afternoons, especially as there are several places where the bell cannot be heard.
I therefore urgently request that the timetable be rescheduled so that the honourable Members know when there is a vote and where there is not.
Mr Posselt, thank you for your first comment, in particular, to the effect that the outcome of the vote is as it stands and cannot be changed.
Mr President, I should like to go one step further than Mr Posselt.
I should like to protest against the fact that the vote is being held now.
According to the agenda, we should be voting at 4.30 p.m. and I can assure you that you cannot hear the bell upstairs in the offices.
I do not know where your office is and whether or not you can hear the bell from there.
We have arranged to vote at 4.30 p.m. and it is wrong to hold the vote now because not everyone in the building has arrived in the Chamber yet.
Mrs Sommer, the Agenda clearly specifies that the vote will take place at 4.30 p.m. or at the end of the debate.
My office is on the twelfth floor and I have to say I found the bell ringing rather a nuisance, since they rang it for 15 minutes without a break today.
That is too much!
Mr President, you have in principle anticipated my point.
Nonetheless, Mr Posselt is right.
We need to discuss Thursday afternoon's agenda.
I have no wish to gainsay my honourable friend Mr Whitehead, who said at the start of the debate that he had to give his speech and then leave to catch a flight, but to me it is absolutely unbelievable that a Parliament should arrange its schedule to accommodate Members' flight connections.
We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists shall therefore be discussing this with our Rules of Procedure experts.
Other groups should do likewise, so that we can return to the old schedule for Thursday afternoons.
Otherwise we might as well spare ourselves the effort.
(Applause)
Mr President, I think there are more fundamental questions to be asked following on from what our colleague said.
If you look at the total amount of debating time that we had at September I and II and the fact that we are finishing now, the question is why did we need to have two sittings in September at all?
It simply is not necessary with the new Rules.
I would ask you Mr President to take back to the Bureau that we are already seeing the highly desirable impact of the Corbett report on the Rules changes.
We need to evaluate how many weeks we need to be working here, because, President, we are desperately short of committee time in this Parliament.
We have a ludicrously small amount of committee time between now and Christmas to deal ...
(Protests from Mr Posselt)
It is true Mr. Posselt, and I will show you the agenda for my committee.
We have a ridiculously small amount of committee time, and we should not be wasting time sitting around here waiting for something to happen, when we could be doing serious political work in Brussels in committee.
Contrary to what Mr. Schulz is saying a true democratic Parliament would have a serious look at its workload and - I thank you for the interruption Mr Posselt - I believe there are many people who agree with me.
Most of them have gone already, because they do not want to waste their time here on Thursday afternoon.
Mr President, at a more mundane level, I should like to support those who are complaining about the change in time of voting in one regard.
When the bell rang - and I did hear it in my office - I looked to the screen to see what was happening.
And what did I see, but my esteemed colleague, Mr Harbour, speaking with great authority on the issue in hand with no indication that the votes were to follow next. For all I knew, it could have been a fire alarm or something else.
Perhaps the screens could have given us better information about what was coming?
It was clearly indicated on the screen, Mr Chichester.
There might be something wrong with yours - I do not know - but the time of the vote was clearly displayed on the screen.
Mr President, I can confirm that the votes were indeed announced on the television screens.
And it was thanks to that that I realised it was time to come to the Chamber to vote.
Having said that, I have requested the floor simply in order to say to the British Members that if they think they are wasting their time here and do not have enough time to dedicate to the work of the committees, I suggest that they miss the Brussels sittings.
In that way, we will have enough time in Brussels to work in committee and we will be able to dedicate all our time to the plenum here in Strasbourg until Friday morning.
I believe that would cause no more problems: we would not waste our time and we would be working under very good conditions.
I can see that feelings run high, and rightly so.
If there are no objections, I will give the floor to another two Members who have asked to speak as well, and then we will stop.
Mr President, this is a very naÃ¯ve discussion by those who are always opposed to Strasbourg.
And just what has been decided?
More mini plenary sittings have been convened for the next session in Brussels.
In other words, there are a few people who never miss a chance to turn everything against Strasbourg.
There is something, however, which I consider to be far more serious: we were told we could not hold a topical and urgent debate this Thursday because we held one during the first session in September.
Do you seriously believe that questions of world history, urgent questions should depend on whether or not we have the honour of expressing ourselves on current affairs?
I would have thought it more important to use the time available this afternoon to deal with other urgent topics, which normally go by the board because we never have time for them.
We would have had time today for anyone with any inclination to notice what we should have.
Members of Parliament should be able to speak on important matters when the occasion arises.
Today would have been a perfect opportunity.
I therefore urge that urgent matters be allocated the time needed to ensure that human rights issues are not sacrificed just because a few people are in a hurry to get back to their constituencies.
They can spend hours in their constituencies.
But those who wish to speak because they think it is the right thing to do must have the chance to do so, especially on Thursdays.
Thursdays do not end with a few 4 o'clock flights; they should end at 6.30.
The issue you have raised, Mr Mann, has already been raised just now by Mr Posselt, with great feeling, feeling equal to yours, moreover.
Mr President, I should like to pick up on what Mr Harbour said.
First, my dear Mr Harbour, you are one of those who sets great store by the Treaty and if you read the Treaty, you will see that we have 12 regular plenary sessions a year and that, if necessary, we can hold additional plenary sessions in Brussels.
If we were to take out these six days in the autumn, we would have time for committees, time for week-long surgeries and all the rest, instead of which we could use the time here really profitably.
Secondly, this afternoon's agenda should have included a topical and urgent debate, for example on the coup in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Today we were told this would be discussed on 9 October.
In other words, the Conference of Presidents decided that this urgent matter should be debated on 9 October, i.e. in a fortnight's time, instead of this afternoon, when it could have been slotted in without further ado.
Thirdly, there was no Question Time this week, either to the Council or to the Commission.
That, as I said earlier, is a fundamental parliamentary right and the fact that there was no Question Time was a violation of the Rules of Procedure.
My dear Mr Harbour, I am very proud of Question Time; it is an achievement which mirrors a long parliamentary tradition in Great Britain.
This line of reasoning, which appears to be common to the different groups, is extremely interesting!
Mr President, to return to our same topic of conversation, listening to Mr Harbour, Mr Mann, Mr Posselt and Mrs GrossetÃªte, I now know why group chairman Poettering always looks so pale.
Discussions within the European People's Party are so lively that it is a pleasure to listen to them.
Perhaps you will invite us into your group one day so that we can share in your joy.
(Applause)
But there is one thing we should learn from the debate, and I address this comment quite pointedly to the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The Corbett reform has been a help, we can see that every lunchtime when it comes to the vote.
We have saved time.
But to save time and then not use it for parliamentary business is wrong.
(Applause)
I therefore think - and we shall be doing as much in the Group of the Party of European Socialists - that both you, Mr Vice-President, in the Bureau, and the groups at the Conference of Presidents should retable the question of the agenda, because if today is anything to go by, we cannot go on like this.
(Applause)
My response is addressed to you, Mr Schultz, and to Mr Harbour and the other Members who mentioned the Bureau.
The agenda is drawn up by your heads of group, by our group chairmen, at the Conference of Presidents. It is not decided by the Bureau, which has other, less important tasks.
You should therefore reintroduce this debate in discussions within your groups so that the chairmen are informed of the situation which has arisen this afternoon, which, regardless of the different points of view, everyone has found a little odd.
Now, Mr Schultz has issued a challenge and Mr Elles is going to respond to it.
Mr President, on a point of order, firstly as Mr Schulz will well know, as he sees the lively debates in our group which go on in public and in private, we have already attracted one of his members, Mr Balfe, who is a member of our group now.
We welcome any others who wish to cross the floor because we would like to have an overall majority in this Parliament, as we have in the Quaestors!
Secondly, Mr Schulz is quite right that we need to fill up the time.
Perhaps that is why Mr Poettering is looking a little pale, perhaps it is overwork.
As far as time is concerned, while we are in Strasbourg we should use it to full effect, otherwise it just influences the other part-sessions where we then have to do things that we would not otherwise do.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have achieved the goal you set yourselves of continuing until 4 p.m. for it was clear that that was your aim.
Tribute
During the night of 26 and 27 September 2002, a Senegalese vessel, Le Joola, carrying more than 1 000 people, sank near the Senegalese-Gambian coast.
Now, nearly two weeks later, 476 bodies have been recovered from the sea and 500 remain missing.
On behalf of Parliament, I wrote to express our sincere condolences to President Wade of Senegal and to invite him to convey our condolences to the families of the victims.
It is important today that we should, in a solemn moment of silence, show our respect for the dead and the bereaved and to connect, from the northern hemisphere, with this African tragedy as an act of reassurance and solidarity that the south matters to us.
I ask you to observe one minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Last Sunday, 6 October 2002, his Royal Highness Prince Claus von Amsburg, husband of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, died in Amsterdam after a long illness.
Prince Claus committed himself to Dutch society with strength, seriousness, dedication and, when appropriate, with humour.
We are well aware of his dedication to the cause of international development cooperation.
I would like to inform the House and our Dutch colleagues that, on your behalf and on their behalf, I have transmitted our sincere condolences to Her Majesty, Queen Beatrix and to the Dutch people.
The Danish Presidency, represented by Mr Haarder, Minister for European Affairs, has expressed its willingness to make a statement on behalf of the Council on the situation regarding Iraq.
Mr Haarder and the Danish Presidency are stepping into this at short notice.
I want on behalf of Parliament to thank the Council and personally to thank Mr Haarder for doing so.
The first item is the Commission report on the progress made towards enlargement.
These reports were adopted before lunch today by the European Commission.
With the adoption and publication of the accession country reports, we are now one significant step nearer to the creation of a truly continental-scale European Union.
We are entering the final stage of a process which began with such inspiration almost thirteen years ago with the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
Our Member States and not just the accession states must individually and collectively summon up the necessary political will to overcome the last remaining obstacles.
In this House we are determined to use our best endeavours to ensure that insofar as we can make a contribution, this House will contribute to the removal of any remaining obstacles between now and the Copenhagen Summit in December.
This enlargement represents for Europe an extraordinary and unparalleled act of reconciliation, healing and opportunity.
It is the first time in millennia in our old continent that, by the free wills of free and sovereign people, we will be coming together neither forced at the point of a sword nor through the barrel of a gun nor any other oppressive force but by the use of reason, conviction and shared values.
Today's debate is an important staging-post in this exercise.
I would like in particular to pay a tribute to the European Commission and its services and to all of those in leadership positions and in the public services of accession states who have engaged in such extraordinary work of transformation.
The Commission will remain central to the management of this exercise right to the end.
We are coming to a time when we, the political class, must undertake our political responsibilities to reach out to our publics in terms of the calculus of consent.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great emotion that I take the floor to speak to this House today.
When I took office, I made a commitment - before this very House - to make enlargement the top priority of my Commission, to make my Commission the Commission of enlargement, because in enlarging the European Union we will be consolidating an area of peace, security and democracy throughout the European continent.
Three years later, I am standing here before you once again to tell you that this commitment has been honoured. The Commission has done its job and kept its promise.
The Commission has carried out a careful study of the progress made by the candidate countries and I can now announce the names of the countries with which we recommend the Council should conclude negotiations by the end of 2002.
I will now, if I may, read out the key points of the recommendations we adopted today.
'Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia fulfil the political criteria.
Bearing in mind the progress achieved by these countries, the track record in implementing their commitments, and taking into account their preparatory work in progress and foreseen, the Commission considers that these countries will have fulfilled the economic and acquis criteria and will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004.
The Commission therefore recommends to conclude the accession negotiations with these countries by the end of this year with the aim to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003.'
In view of Bulgaria's and Romania's progress over the last year, the Commission notes the date - 2007 - that those countries have set themselves for accession.
The Commission will do everything necessary to ensure that this objective can be achieved.
Through constitutional reform and a series of legislative packages, Turkey has made considerable progress as regards the Copenhagen criteria.
However, further efforts are needed.
The Commission is therefore recommending that the European Union give more support and allocate more resources to Turkey's pre-accession preparations.
To this end, the Commission will propose a revised Accession Partnership and step up legislative scrutiny.
Turkey is encouraged to pursue its reform process and so advance its candidacy for European Union membership.
Ladies and gentleman, just 13 years ago, Berlin was still divided by the wall of shame.
The wall has been pulled down and Germany has been reunified.
This re-establishment of freedom has allowed us to restore the historical unity of the peoples of Europe.
Our common destiny is once again to build a common future, a future built on the fundamental values we share of peace, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities.
In 1993, the Copenhagen European Council offered the countries of Central and Eastern Europe the chance to join the European Union.
Since then, these countries have gone through a huge process of change, moving peacefully from dictatorship to stable, participatory democracy.
Their achievements are extraordinary.
In the space of a decade, we have seen the holding of dozens of transparent, democratic national, regional and local elections, the adoption of thousands of laws and regulations giving shape to the new democracies and incorporating the Community acquis into national law, the training of tens of thousands of civil servants and magistrates to interpret and apply the new legislation and the participation of hundreds of thousands of elected officials, specialists and members of professional organisations in EU-financed training and cooperation projects in order to learn about our policies.
All 12 countries satisfy the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen and democratic institutions are stronger everywhere. Lastly, the overall performance of the economies of the ten first-wave countries is gradually improving: their growth rates are higher than ours, their inflation rates and deficits are being managed and kept under control and direct foreign investment is flooding in.
This proves that the markets have confidence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we adopted today also highlights the remaining deficiencies in some sectors, for some countries.
These failings have to be remedied before accession: the Commission will work with the authorities of these countries to ensure that the problems are resolved in good time.
Our concerns continue to be centred on the administrative capacity of these countries and their justice systems, which are undermined by a lack of financial and, above all, human resources.
We have endeavoured to address these problems through a EUR 250 million support programme.
This programme is starting to bear fruit.
Another weakness we have identified is inadequate preparation for implementation of the acquis in a number of crucial areas, namely customs services, taxation, veterinary and plant-health controls, the institutions managing and supervising agricultural policy and, lastly, the departments in charge of managing and controlling the Structural Funds.
I should also mention a further two extremely serious problems: the corruption affecting many of these countries, with a few exceptions, and the shameful issue of the trafficking of human beings.
This does not mean that nothing has been done in these fields.
On the contrary, a great deal has been achieved already and the operation is almost complete in some countries.
However, our report stresses the scrupulous monitoring the Commission has undertaken to conduct up until accession.
We shall publish a final evaluation six months before the date of accession.
To cope with the complexities of enlargement, the Commission will take all the necessary measures to reorganise its departments, increasing monitoring and support for the new Member States after accession and providing pre-accession aid for the countries that will follow those covered by today's recommendation.
Mr President, our objective is still to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003.
We are therefore entering the final stages of the process.
In this regard, the Commission hopes that the Brussels European Council of 24 and 25 October will take the necessary decisions on the chapters still open, namely agriculture, financial issues and institutions.
In this way, we can negotiate and conclude these chapters before Copenhagen.
As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Commission will put forward proposals for an enhanced pre-accession strategy in good time for adoption by the Copenhagen Council.
Then for Turkey, which does not yet meet the accession criteria, the Commission will propose an enhanced pre-accession strategy with extra financial resources in the new year.
The Treaty of Nice is still crucial and cannot be sidestepped.
I therefore place my confidence in the Irish electorate, which will be voting on the Treaty again in a few days.
I hope that the achievement of the historic objective of unifying our continent will not be jeopardised by this vote.
Lastly, let me focus on the issue of Cyprus.
Let us hope for real progress towards reunification of the island, even though the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council do not make it a precondition for entry.
The Commission wants a reunited Cyprus to join the EU and believes this is the best solution for all.
In recommending that the Council conclude negotiations speedily with Cyprus, the Commission is issuing a fresh appeal to the parties concerned to work towards reunification of the island.
We call upon everyone to support the process now under way under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General so that a solution can be found before the year's end.
The Seville European Council has already affirmed that the European Union 'would accommodate the terms of such a comprehensive settlement in the Treaty of Accession in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded.'
Ladies and gentlemen, all too often, I hear talk about the risks and costs of enlargement.
I believe we can and must discuss this calmly and openly, for the costs have been analysed in detail and they are in line with the resources available.
However, we should also - and above all - be telling the public about the benefits of enlargement, which are stability in Europe, unification of an artificially divided continent and the creation of the biggest single market in the world.
Enlargement will unite us with economies that have lower incomes than the present Member States but which have greater growth potential.
The situation was exactly the same in 1985, when the accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal were concluded.
Now, nobody could doubt the validity and farsightedness of that decision, although at the time it was controversial.
Enlargement is the new front line of the European project.
It will give impetus to trade, investment, education and research. And to economic growth.
As regards the costs of enlargement, we know that they are sustainable until 2006 because they are included in the Berlin financial perspective.
I shall not hide the fact that the accession of ten countries will entail a significant financial burden, within the framework I have described, but this will be more than fully offset by the benefits brought by the consolidation of enlargement.
Enlargement is not just about economics, however. It is important primarily for political and ethical reasons.
Enlargement is the culmination of the process of European integration: the process that has given us half a century of peace and prosperity must be extended to the whole continent.
Consider the recent events in the Balkans, where there have been thousands of deaths, whole communities have been forced to flee as refugees and entire cities have been destroyed.
Enlargement is our political masterpiece since it will prevent such things happening.
From this broader and more accurate perspective, the cost of enlargement is very slight compared with the cost of non-enlargement.
In the coming months, we need to conduct a realistic and positive information campaign.
We must touch the hearts and minds of our citizens.
Enlargement has been made possible by great determination, tremendous political courage and a farsighted vision of history.
Moreover, it will be a test of our commitment to our principles, for accession will force us to change as well as bringing big changes for the new Member countries.
This is the task of the Convention.
The institutional reforms that come out of it will have to be just as courageous and farsighted as our endeavours have been.
It must be understood that, without radical, intelligent reform of the institutions, the success of enlargement could turn out to be unsustainable. Indeed, the new Europe needs a clear, stable geographical shape and institutional framework that all our citizens can understand.
In other words, the time has come for a European constitution. A constitution that guarantees the rights of all the citizens and the role of the Member States.
A constitution that preserves cultural and linguistic diversity whilst reinforcing solidarity. A constitution that completes the creation of a democratic European Union, a genuine union of peoples and States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by looking beyond the impending enlargement, beyond its historical and geographical limits.
We are inviting the new countries to join our Union because we want peace and stability across the whole continent.
However, this process must not result in new barriers being erected just when we are trying to break down the old ones.
We must keep this in mind when building new relations with our neighbours after enlargement.
Here, I am thinking of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. They will be the new neighbours of the enlarged Union, which will one day extend to the Balkans region too.
Focusing on our new European neighbours, however, should not make us any less receptive to the ever-increasing expectations of the Mediterranean countries, expectations that we have not yet managed to fulfil.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European integration that started half a century ago has earned us the admiration and respect of the entire world.
We alone are building a genuine, practical model for managing globalisation, if only across our continent.
This globalisation is a democratic globalisation with a human dimension, a globalisation in which all citizens have an equal role.
Our enlargement is an example to the whole world and a visionary act: it unites the whole continent for the first time and it makes us protagonists of history once more.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's recommendation by the Commission that the negotiations on accession should be concluded with ten candidates by the end of this year is perhaps the most important staging-post on the road towards the completion of what is currently the major project on the European Union's agenda.
There is only one justification for our recommendation today - the ten countries have earned it!
The ten countries have succeeded, through their own efforts, in meeting the incredibly difficult and challenging criteria for accession to the European Union.
I attach great importance to the comment that the Commission did not see it as its task to justify a desirable political accession scenario 'after the fact'.
What we did see as our task was to provide you, the Members of the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States, with neutral and objective information showing which countries are ready and prepared for accession and the conditions under which this will take place.
The progress reports were not produced on the basis of political stipulations.
The Commission staff were given just one instruction: they were not to conceal, omit or prettify anything, and they were to indicate clearly where problems still exist.
In our reports, we identify the problems by name.
However, the key point here is that we have not identified a single problem which could not be solved by the end of 2003.
Please do not be misled by the sometimes very critical tone.
Of course, the issues which have still to be resolved must be put into the context of what has already been achieved, and if we look at what has been achieved in the accession countries over the last ten years in the transformation process and the preparations for accession, I must say that the progress made by the people in these countries is a truly magnificent and historic achievement which deserves our greatest respect.
The Commission has developed a methodology which allows us to determine, as precisely as possible, where we are and what has still to be done.
The Commission has also made a number of proposals concerning the ongoing monitoring of the commitments undertaken and the introduction of a safeguard clause in the Accession Treaty.
Let me explain this in a little more detail.
First of all, I must point out that our recommendation naturally contains something of a prognostic element.
After all, the new Member States are not obliged to meet the criteria for membership today; they must do so at the time of accession. In other words, what we have to do today is to assess whether the remaining tasks can be completed within the timeframe.
This assessment is not based on a feeling or mood; it is based on sound knowledge of the pace and quality of the preparation process in these countries.
We will continue to apply all the tried and tested monitoring instruments after the conclusion of the negotiations and the conclusion of the Treaty, in order to ensure that all the commitments undertaken are fulfilled. We propose that for the first two years after accession, an entirely new clause should be introduced into the Treaty, one which has never appeared in any other enlargement treaty to date.
This clause will ensure that rapid and targeted measures can be taken if it becomes apparent, within the first two years of accession, that the internal market is disrupted in any area, or if policies are not working properly in any area relating to the internal market. In this context, the phrase 'internal market' should be interpreted in the broadest possible terms; in other words, it relates to all policies with a cross-border dimension.
I do not believe that this clause is necessary because the candidate countries pose a risk - they do not. I believe that this clause is necessary because this enlargement is quite unlike any other we have previously experienced and - if we are honest - we cannot tell precisely which adjustment problems are likely to occur within the first two years.
This is why it is necessary to have an instrument enabling us to respond quickly and flexibly.
I also think it is necessary in terms of the public debate in our Member States.
Before we get to the stage of being able to welcome Members from ten new countries to our plenary here, several important steps must be taken.
First of all, the Treaty of Nice must be ratified, and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the voters of Ireland and ask them to consider, when they make their decision, that what is at stake here is the European future of nations in Europe. What is at stake is the European future of nations which did not voluntarily dissociate themselves from the European unification process, but which were forced to do so, which were forced to live separated from us behind the Iron Curtain, and which now wish to belong, once and for all, to the family of democratic nations in Europe
(Applause)
Secondly, at the European Council meeting in Brussels in a few days' time, the Member States must come to an agreement on the common negotiating positions which are still open.
I was a little concerned, when returning from the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, about the complete lack of movement there.
The Member States too must now be urged to show the necessary flexibility and willingness to compromise.
If the timeframe is to be adhered to, we need to reach an agreement in Brussels on the financial package and institutional issues.
Thirdly, the candidate countries must continue their work and continue their efforts. In doing so, they will undoubtedly be heartened by the Commission's recommendations today and by our debate here this afternoon.
Finally, let me say a few words about Bulgaria and Romania.
I am gratified by the progress made by these two countries.
We did not decide that Bulgaria and Romania would not be included in the first round of enlargements.
It is their own decision.
They said that they wanted to be part of the process in 2007, and all the commitments which they have undertaken during the negotiations relate to 2007, not 2004.
The Commission solemnly pledges to do all it can to help these two countries achieve this goal.
The current enlargement process will not be complete until Bulgaria and Romania also have Members representing them in this House.
(Applause)
Finally, let me comment briefly on Turkey as well.
I take issue with the people who say that the Helsinki strategy was a mistake.
On the contrary, it is apparent that since the Helsinki strategy came into effect around 18 months ago, Turkey has made more progress on human rights, democracy and the rule of law during these 18 months than in the previous five decades.
We should - and we do - recognise this fact.
(Applause)
Turkey, however, could not be expected to fulfil all the political criteria for entry to the accession negotiations within these 18 months.
I do not wish to imply any criticism of Turkey when I say that it has not yet fulfilled all the criteria.
On the contrary, I think it is remarkable that Turkey has achieved so much in such a short time.
This is why Turkey must be encouraged to continue along this road, and the Commission will put forward suitable proposals to ensure that Turkey can continue along this road and the door remains open for Turkey.
Let us not be distracted from the real task, however, namely to reform the country in such a way that it is ready for EU accession.
Let us not be distracted from this task, and let us not enter into a fruitless statistical debate whose outcome is bound to be unproductive.
Today's outcomes will be received in many countries of Europe with great interest, excitement and hope.
Our task now is to ensure that Europe's citizens do not just understand but wholeheartedly endorse and welcome this project. There is still considerable scepticism surrounding this issue in many Member States, and this should not take us unawares.
My impression is that the scepticism is often greatest in those areas where there is a serious lack of information.
It is extremely important to ensure, over the coming months, that we supply people with information, information and more information and enable them to use the range of information productively.
If this does not take place, we may have a very, very nasty surprise in a whole range of countries just as enlargement becomes the central issue on the domestic agenda, if people turn round to us - after the Treaty is concluded, at the very latest - and say: 'Why weren't we told about this?
Why did you do this without us?'
Involving the citizens is the key task facing us now.
(Applause)
Mr President, the train that began its journey in Helsinki is now only two stations from its destination.
It is very gratifying indeed that it has been possible to push ahead with the Commission's progress report to such an extent that it has appeared a month earlier than last year's, and it is also gratifying that we now have a complete basis for making decisions as to which countries are ready to conclude the enlargement negotiations.
To begin with, I should like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the commitment and the energy they have shown right from the start in carrying out this historic task.
I followed their efforts from my position here in Parliament as soon as they took up their offices.
It has been a pleasure to note and observe their commitment, which also shines through here in Parliament today.
We have been given an objective account of the candidate countries' level of preparation.
The Commission has come to the view that ten countries are ready to conclude the negotiations.
They fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, and it is considered that, before the date of accession in 2004, they will be able to fulfil the economic criterion, as well as the criterion of being able to implement the acquis communautaire.
On certain points, there is a need for further efforts with regard to administrative capacity, and the Commission proposes that consideration continue to be given to the candidate countries' preparations for membership.
The recommendation to conclude the negotiations with ten countries is to be debated at the Brussels European Council in 14 days' time, and discussions regarding the final decision are to take place at the Copenhagen European Council in two months' time.
According to the Commission, Bulgaria and Romania have made good progress since the last reports, but are still not so far forward that the negotiations can be concluded.
As is well known, it was decided in Seville that special efforts should be made on behalf of these two countries, and a decision on this matter too needs to be made in Copenhagen.
The Commission notes that Turkey has made great progress towards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
This is a gratifying development that must be maintained.
It is also noted that there is still some way to go, and Turkey is therefore being encouraged to carry out further reforms and to implement reforms already adopted so that it continues to improve its prospects of membership.
With regard to the Seville conclusions, Copenhagen will be the decisive moment in the development of the relationship between the EU and Turkey.
In the run-up to the Brussels European Council, we must not now pre-empt the decisions to be made in Copenhagen.
With regard to Cyprus, the Commission fully supports the EU's efforts.
The Commission calls upon all the parties involved, and Turkey in particular, to take active steps to bring about a solution before the conclusion of Cyprus's negotiations for accession to the EU.
The conclusions from the Helsinki European Council still form the point of departure for adopting a position on the issue of Cyprus's accession.
Finally, I want to endorse what the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have said about the Irish vote, and I want to concur with the words of the President of the Commission about the risks and costs of not enlarging the EU, for the risks and costs of non-enlargement are much greater.
That, of course, was why the track was laid in Helsinki.
That is why the train is now travelling on towards peace, democracy and prosperity throughout our continent.
The next station is Brussels and the last station is Copenhagen. The Danish train drivers are ready, and the whistle has sounded today.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate since it concerns the greatest challenge facing the European Union, namely the accession of ten countries in a first round of enlargement.
I therefore find it especially regrettable that the substance of today's debate was revealed in the European press some days ago, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that in future, Parliament is informed first, and then the European public.
I think this is the right way round if a debate like this is to be meaningful.
Notwithstanding this criticism, however, which is meant very seriously, I would like to say a word of thanks to the Commission: to its President, Romano Prodi, to the Commissioner responsible, GÃŒnter Verheugen, but also to the previous Commission under Jacques Santer, together with Commissioner Hans van den Broek, for after all, the present Commission did not start from scratch; it built on the work begun by the Santer Commission.
I would like to voice my warm thanks to all concerned for their great work.
(Applause)
We are in broad agreement with the conclusions and also with the listing of the ten countries recommended for accession by the Commission, but there is a massive amount of work ahead of us.
The accession countries - as has been stated, and for which we express our great respect - after 50 years of communism, communist mismanagement, communist tyranny and dictatorship, have made massive efforts, and this deserves the greatest credit and our greatest respect.
However, there is still a massive amount of work to be done, not only by the accession candidates but also by the European Union itself.
I think that what is important now is to ensure that we do not shatter the confidence vested in us by the accession countries. Anyone who now sets new accession conditions for the Central European countries, Malta and Cyprus - for example, by demanding reform of the European agricultural policy first of all - anyone who demands this is sinning against the accession countries, because it undermines their confidence in the European Union and its pledges.
This is why we must now honour the confidence vested in us by the accession countries and not impose any new conditions.
Poland is without doubt the most important accession country, for its population - almost 39 million - is larger than in the other nine candidate countries.
We must also remember today that this great transformation in Europe would not have been possible without Poland, without Solidarity - and let me also say this, lest we forget - without the great intellectual power of the Pole who occupies the papal throne, John Paul II, who told the Polish people: 'Don't be afraid!'
This was the basis of Europe's intellectual and political transformation.
(Applause from the right)
We must never forget this!
It was also the basis on which Germany could be united twelve years ago.
Without Poland, this would not have been possible.
We therefore hope that at the negotiations, Poland will be able - also in the coming weeks and months - to master the difficult problems still arising in the accession process, and we support the Commission with its proposals on direct payments.
There are several unresolved questions to which we would welcome answers from the Czech Government.
What is the Czech Government's position on the question whether, for example, legislation still exists in the Czech Republic which does not treat all persons in the European Union equally?
Is there discrimination here?
It would be helpful if the Czech Government provided an answer to this question.
We hope that Bulgaria and Romania, which are not part of this enlargement round, will continue to make progress so that we can close negotiations with these two countries within a foreseeable timeframe as well.
We endorse the Commission's position in declining to give Turkey a date for the start of negotiations.
On behalf of our group, I would like to point out that we have divergent views on the issue of Turkish membership of the European Union.
It is important to state this clearly, and it is the same in other groups.
However, we are united in our view that Turkey is a key strategic partner for us, and that we must always maintain our links with that country in a close and well-functioning partnership.
There is the problem with Kaliningrad, and I recommend, as a matter of urgency, that in overcoming this difficult problem, we prioritise the issue of security, and also Lithuania's sovereignty, which we must not call into question.
On this basis, flexible arrangements with Russia must be found.
I also warn against the creation of a new Iron Curtain, for example between Poland and Ukraine; in the region around Lviv in Poland and in other areas, there are close regional and family ties with Ukraine and we must arrive at flexible arrangements which guarantee security but also enable people to meet.
The President of the Commission referred to the Mediterranean region.
I have just visited Morocco, and there is great concern there that as a result of enlargement, we Europeans will forget about the Mediterranean.
The Mediterranean region is our neighbour just as much as the accession countries in the heart of Europe, and I recommend that we take our cooperation with the Mediterranean as seriously as we take our relations with Eastern Europe.
(Applause)
If twenty years ago, someone had asked: 'We are offering you the chance for Poland and other countries to join the European Union - what are you prepared to pay for this?'
We would have been willing to pay any financial price at all, and so I say to you: Let us all be happy that today, the accession of Poland and the other countries to the European Union, to our community of values, to democracy, the rule of law and a social market economy is possible, and let us welcome our colleagues warmly when, as we hope, they are elected to this House at the next European elections in 2004.
This is a great day for Europe, for we have a shared and, it is to be hoped, a good future ahead for our European continent.
(Applause)
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission's proposals which have been outlined today.
Today is an historic occasion.
In many ways it marks another stage down the road begun by Willy Brandt when he was mayor of Berlin.
Before dwelling on the historic nature of today, I would like to acknowledge that it has only been possible to get where we are thanks to the determination of the Commission.
When President Prodi launched the new fast-track method of negotiation, it radically changed the enlargement negotiations.
I would also like to pay tribute to Commissioner Verheugen, who has pursued his brief with great determination and with a unique ability to master the detail while holding on to the big picture.
He has also been a model of transparency and openness.
Enlargement is first and foremost a security issue.
It is about admitting countries to a political and economic system which has brought peace, stability and prosperity to countries which spent much of modern history trying to destroy each other.
In our discussions about the details, we must not lose sight of that fact.
We have it in our power to reunite Europe and to create a genuinely Europe-wide Union dedicated to building stability and prosperity, not only for its own citizens, but also beyond its borders.
Inevitably, as enlargement approaches reality, the voices of doubters are beginning to be heard.
Some say enlargement is too costly.
To those I would point out that in the period of 2000 to 2006, we will spend one thousandth of one percent of the EU's GDP on the candidate countries.
We will spend ten percent of what Germany has spent on its reunification.
What we spend is a fraction of the cost of defending Western Europe during the Cold War.
The real question is - what is the cost if we do not enlarge the European Union?
What will it cost in terms of the social, political and economic dislocation which will inevitably follow?
Some say they are in favour of enlargement but not yet.
They say we must wait for the reform of this or that policy.
But politics is not like that.
We do not sit around waiting for perfection.
Enlargement is a dynamic process which itself will drive forward the process of reform within the EU.
Enlargement is actually the solution to the problems which concern our voters - the concerns about crime and drugs, about the environment, about jobs and a better future for our children.
We have a window of opportunity to enlarge.
If we miss this moment, it will be lost for a generation and the cause of reform will be lost with it.
Enlargement and reform go side-by-side.
I do not wish to underestimate the very serious issues that must be addressed.
The core of the EU is the Single Market and there can be no weakening of it.
There can be no question of admitting countries that cannot or will not enforce the aquis in this area, particularly in relation to state aids, competition policy and respect for intellectual property.
There can be no question of admitting countries whose judicial system is corrupt or inept, or whose administrative capacity is not up to the task ahead.
There can be no question of admitting countries unable or unwilling to take effective action to combat crime or the traffic of people and drugs.
That is why I welcome the safeguards that the Commission has announced.
I welcome in particular the economic safeguards in relation to the internal market which we have never had before, and also the commitment to have a further progress report six months before the date of accession.
If there are problems then, we and the Council must have the courage of our convictions to act effectively in those circumstances.
There are, of course, serious issues to be addressed in relation to agriculture.
Firstly, there have been profound delays in the implementation of SAPARD.
Money must be spent before accession to strengthen structures in the rural areas and to avoid a rural exodus and mass unemployment.
The central eastern-European countries will have problems co-financing SAPARD because they will have to incorporate budget resources which they had set aside for 2000-2001 into their budgets for 2002-2003.
Therefore, the Commission must take appropriate measures to ensure that SAPARD funds are not lost because of late implementation.
The agricultural sector and the interests of the rural population are important to both the EU and the candidate countries.
That is why we need a balanced solution to financing agriculture which does not offload the costs onto the weakest.
Therefore, we strongly support the proposals Commissioner Fischler made in January because they are fully compatible with the Berlin Agreements and the roadmap for enlargement.
In discussing further reform in the CAP, we must ensure that the accession countries are involved in an advisory capacity as soon as possible.
We must have reform before Agenda 2000 runs out in 2006.
Reforms, however, cannot be a further hurdle to concluding accession negotiations, just as enlargement should not hold up the reform of the CAP.
As a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC, I must raise the issue of Kaliningrad.
I would urge that we find a solution which is deliverable for the Lithuanians and does not drive them into the 'no' camp.
Today is not the end of a process.
Today is, hopefully, the beginning of the end of a process.
We must scrutinise the path forward very closely.
We must remember that no other enlargement has been as well-prepared as this one has, but we must seize this moment in history to make progress.
I would like to call upon the inspiration of the late, great Elvis Presley at this moment - it is now or never, tomorrow is too late.
Thank you Elvis!
Mr President, many of us never thought we would witness in our lifetimes the fall of the Berlin Wall.
That event changed the face of Europe and heralded a process of emancipation for our neighbours in central and eastern Europe which is nearing its conclusion.
It is worth reminding ourselves of the 13 long years this process has taken as the siren voices of the sceptics seek to dash enlargement on the rocks.
In a previous debate, I described enlargement as a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam.
I thank Mr Prodi for presenting today the Commission's assessment of the readiness of the applicant states to join the European Union which marks those countries' completion of a major assignment in that process.
They are now approaching the final examination at the Copenhagen Summit.
The prospects look good although they still have some hard work to do in the months ahead if they are to make the grade.
The Liberal Democrat Group has always sought to apply the Copenhagen criteria and the timetable, not to elevate one above the other.
We, therefore, welcome the Commission's conclusion that the ten applicant states will be ready to join the European Union by 2004, but that monitoring of their preparations will continue.
A reinforced monitoring system is necessary because the overview provided by the Commission clearly shows that there are deficiencies in the readiness of those applicant countries and we should be open about this.
If we are to convince our own people of the case for enlargement, it must be clear that we are not sweeping problems under the carpet.
Openness about those problems and the measures taken to tackle them will make us better able to reassure the doubters.
I therefore call on the Commission to transmit to Parliament all the regular enlargement reports which it will make to Council.
If we await the comprehensive monitoring report six months before enlargement, the Commission may have no alternative but to impose safeguards since the nuclear option of suspending enlargement may not be viable.
I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used.
Neither should we forget, however, that it is not only our own voters who have to be convinced.
There are referenda to be won in the applicant states.
Critics in those countries who compare the European Union to the old Soviet Union are confusing a jacket with a straightjacket.
Yet we must show those countries that they will benefit from enlargement from year one.
This means a generous financial settlement which precludes them becoming net contributors in the short term.
By introducing a secession clause in a new constitutional treaty, we would also assuage any fears that to join the European Union is to throw away the keys to freedom.
My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis in justice and home affairs.
We must be firm on the failings of the candidate countries, yet we must recognise that the report before us today is only a progress report.
My own country struggled to meet the criteria 15 months before accession.
