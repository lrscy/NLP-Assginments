As she moves her activities to another stage, or should I say back to the stage where she started her career, I am sure that all of us will join in wishing her well, thanking her very much for her work, and we can demonstrate our support for that by our unanimous support for the report when we vote later on.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to begin by paying tribute to Mrs Echerer â and I do not need to insist on this, since many Members have done the same â but I would also like to welcome the statements by Commissioner Bolkestein, who acknowledges the importance of collecting societies at the present time.
Intellectual property has developed as a result of technological advances.
Until printing there was no real intellectual property.
We now have a second technological revolution, the âMarconi Galaxyâ, with all the new information technologies.
As technology advances, the creator moves further and further away from the consumer.
Specifically, my colleague, Mr Harbour, talks of the customer, but I prefer to use the word consumer, differentiating between the two classes of client: the final consumer, that is, the long-suffering citizen who has to watch television and radio programmes, and the intermediary, who buys the intellectual property rights, uses them and exploits them.
This brings us to the situation we are faced with, with a multiplication of forms of media, but which are increasingly lacking in content.
In other words, we have more and more hours of television, more and more electronic hours, more magazines, more books and more means of production, but they are practically devoid of content.
And this is the result of a lack of support for the creator.
In the current information society, creators are not being protected.
We are creating rubbish-media, which use intellectual property in an entirely thoughtless way, with no sense of responsibility whatsoever and, in view of this, creators need to be protected.
That is the role of the collecting societies, which are not monopolies, but instruments available to creators so that they can defend themselves in the face of the control of the media by a few media groups, supported by huge economic power and at the service of political or economic interests.
Therefore, the only instrument these creators have today are these collecting societies, which constitute employeesâ unions, in order to confront the employersâ organisations, which have enormous strength.
I agree that collecting societies must adapt to the new situation, because they have arisen at national level and we are about to move on to a transnational, and even world, level.
But at least, at European Union level, we should reinforce the action of these collecting societies, so that, at this level, we can have that protection.
I would like finally to refer to enlargement.
The European Union is going to be enriched with ten new countries which have a great cultural tradition, but in which â as a result of their recent political past â intellectual property has not been sufficiently protected until very recently.
I believe it is very important that, in the final enlargement process, we make these countries aware of the need to adapt themselves to the Community acquis, including, amongst other things, collective management, in the face of this danger of monopoly on the part of the large groups controlling the media.
Â Â  â Mr President, I join in the warm thanks expressed by all my fellow Members to Mrs Echerer.
I should also like to do so with reference to the way we cooperated.
We might yet â who knows? â feature in her TV programmes, as long, of course, as these are properly protected in terms of intellectual property rights.
That everyone is in agreement is evident from the fact that the report has been adopted unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
In addition, the encouraging words which the Commissioner has just spoken will now, I think, lead to improved legislation, in respect of which it is particularly important for transparency and legal certainty to be increased and, above all, democratic control, because clarity avoids lack of understanding.
We are now all talking about the right-holders, but I think that it is also very important to mention the right-users.
I can remember an incident last year when many companies in the Netherlands received a letter out of the blue from the â the Reproduction Right Foundation â stating that they needed to pay a hefty bill for copies they had made, without any explanation as to the purpose of this exercise.
This sparked fear and anxiety.
I think that this legislation can ensure that it becomes clearer on what basis certain costs are charged, why certain costs have to be met and for whom they are intended.
The Commissioner has already indicated that 5% to 7% of the Gross Domestic Product â which is high â is accounted for by products and services that are limited, governed and protected by copyright and neighbouring rights.
This means that we are talking about a considerable proportion of our internal market activities, in which there is a need for clarity and structure.
As I have already pointed out, competition and the dominant position of collecting societies should not be a problem as such, as long as legislation is clear and is not used inappropriately.
I think that this problem can be solved with these recommendations if they are enshrined in legislation.
As Mr Medina Ortega has already indicated, enlargement is also a key aspect of this issue.
As a result of their political history, the acceding countries have never given copyright-holders any explicit protection, and this is why I think it is important to provide support on the spot.
The rapporteur re-emphasised this point in her oral amendment.
We, the Liberals, give her our unqualified backing.
By way of conclusion, we welcome this initiative, and we hope that the Commission can adopt the amendment that I have tabled to produce a clear evaluation after three years in order to check whether the legislation actually works and protection takes place.
Having kept within the three-minute time limit, I will not further delay this afternoonâs proceedings.
Â Â  Mr President, it is customary for a speaker in my role to assure rapporteurs that we are right behind them, but in this case that would not quite be appropriate.
In this case, the cart is firmly behind the horse, and she is leading us â as well as all the Members of the Committee and Parliament â in the charge.
We are very grateful to Mrs Echerer for having given us that lead.
As was said in the debate, there is a kind of tripod involved in relation to copyright and related rights.
One leg of the tripod is the copyright legislation that has already been adopted by Parliament.
The second leg is the enforcement provisions that we are currently debating, and the third leg is the issue of collecting societies and the administration of copyright in the interests of rights holders.
As Commissioner Bolkestein said, these are monopolies, but they are in principle benign monopolies because of the territoriality of copyright.
It may be â and perhaps Mr Harbour and Mr Karas will explain this to me one day â that collecting societies can operate in competition with each other within a given domain or within a given country, but I find it difficult to see how that would work.
If I am right, the point made by the Commissioner earlier assumes tremendous importance, namely that we need to look closely and critically at the governance of these societies, which are in a position to 'rip people off' by charging unduly high fees for providing services to artists, authors and others.
I am delighted to hear that the Commission is to follow up the Committee's initiative by bringing forward a proposal for a legislative instrument concerning the good governance of collecting societies.
It is a proposal I await eagerly.
I would like to make a point in response to what Mr Harbour said that also provides me with an opportunity to declare a minor interest.
I am an academic author and a very modest part of my annual income, as anybody who reads the Declaration of Members' Interests will know, comes from rights management on behalf of myself as an academic author.
Looking at it from the point of view of an author of that kind, the notion of the reader as customer is not as significant as Mr Harbour said.
The critical notion â and this also applies to the arts â is surely the reader or consumer as audience.
One is concerned about getting ideas across to people and getting them engaged in debate about ideas.
From that point of view, it is a matter of total indifference to an author what or how much they get paid.
Quite the reverse.
I and authors like myself have no chance of getting ideas to a wide public unless there are effective publishing systems â that is to say publishers who get paid for their activities.
In that sense, this whole business of collective rights is for us more a means to an end than an end in itself.
We should not think of it simply in terms of customers, but as an essential feature of the single market.
We are delighted with the Commission's proposal and, like everybody else, I am so pleased to have worked with Mrs Echerer on this.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid and multifaceted growth of the information society and the development of ever-more varied communication resources, technologies, instruments and supports that are easily accessible in an enormous variety of ways, place new and continuous pressure on the protection of copyright and related rights, specifically on the laws that cover them and the means for guaranteeing their practical effectiveness, without at the same time violating other fundamental rights and freedoms.
This issue clearly brings us to the very epicentre of globalisation, to the real uncharted territory of the global village in which, consequently, instruments for regulation and protection must be increasingly international, without prejudice to the responsibility of States themselves.
One of the novelties imposed, however, by the changes in recent decades, and which has played an increasingly significant role in the last few years, is precisely that of the collective copyright management societies.
These are undeniable facts of our times and regulating them is, therefore, increasingly important.
Our group acknowledges their important role as voluntary associations of authors, performers and other copyright holders, in effectively protecting their intellectual and financial interests and their intellectual property or related rights for services at home and abroad.
We also believe that, in addition to offering protection to creators, artists and others as a group in the context of related rights, by acting as trustees, these collective societies also perform a cultural function of the greatest importance, which is disseminated throughout society at large and throughout an increasingly open and pluralist world.
On the basis of these principles, we congratulate the rapporteur on her superb work, which clearly identifies the lines that we should pursue if we wish â and we certainly do â to see the framework for rights management in this European Union of ours, which is soon to be enlarged, able to move resolutely towards the crucial aim of simplifying processes and of reforms and comparable parameters.
We cannot continue with statutes and practices that are too diverse and often even incompatible within the European Union.
These glaring discrepancies affect us all, leave our creators, artists and other agents in this key area unprotected and make us particularly weak and vulnerable in the face of global competitiveness, which is increasingly aggressive at world level and sometimes even savage and buccaneering, as we know.
Consequently, we broadly agree with the rapporteurâs ideas on organisational forms of collecting societies, on conditions for authorisation, on areas of activity, on internal structure, on reciprocal agreements, on cultural or social operations and functions in the public interest, on the supervision and control over collecting societies and their activities, on arbitration mechanisms and on transparency, which is a fundamental requirement for all those involved, both internally and externally.
I wish to say one last thing: to congratulate the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on its work and in particular the suggestions that it presented to the Commission on the future directives on television, radio, communication, transmission and telecommunications in the digital area, opportunely accepted in this report and which feature in paragraph 29 of the resolution that we will be voting in favour of.
In fact, these directives must also themselves directly enshrine the importance of copyright and its protection, including specific provisions on this matter.
It is essential that the European Union should enhance art and culture and strengthen the confidence of all creators and other agents and other areas of cultural creation, by cherishing them and encouraging them to create new works that they know will be properly protected against piracy, whilst at the same time guaranteeing their moral rights and reasonable financial rewards.
We will therefore vote in favour and we join in congratulating the rapporteur.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega said that collecting societies are not monopolies; they are associations that serve to protect a weaker section against a stronger section.
That is not always true, and I believe that it should be noted, as the rapporteur notes in her report, that an association is an association, whereas an association with a monopoly, of which one is compelled to be a member by laws governing rights and duties, is a monopoly.
In my view, monopolies, whether legal or , involving collecting societies, are not healthy because they expose amateur artists, for example, to considerable risk of abuse.
I am not acquainted with the situation in the rest of Europe; I know that in Italy the sum paid by amateur artists to collecting societies for authorsâ rights amounts to a tax which is disproportionate and benefits major artists.
Consequently, I consider that an association with a monopoly is not a good association, as a good association should be as unfettered as possible.
Therefore, as the rapporteur states, attention and appropriate controls are required to prevent monopoly situations becoming, whether legally or de facto, as often happens â in Italy certainly, and I believe in the rest of Europe too â abuses and pointless taxes to the detriment of amateur artists.
In addition to this, if, for example, only associations for the disabled, and not disabled individuals, may avail themselves of the exemption from authorsâ rights, there is a risk that authorsâ rights will be subject to corporate interests and the final user will not benefit from situations of this kind.
I, of course, compliment the rapporteur for the work she has carried out.
Â Â  â Mr President, the protection and collective management of intellectual property rights are important factors in the promotion of cultural creativity and the aim of making it possible for artists to work.
Both financial and moral rights must be taken into consideration, the latter meaning authorsâ rights to have control over any modification of their works.
The Community must be able to strengthen artistsâ confidence that their works are properly protected.
On the other hand, it is important to ensure that works are disseminated as widely as possible, because there is no art without an audience.
The Community has been active in this area, and, besides national and international laws, there are already several Community directives.
One drawback, however, is still the fact that the rules that apply to societies responsible for the collective management of intellectual property rights vary from one EU Member State to another.
Often these collective management societies enjoy virtual monopoly status, which might well be justified for functional reasons but at the same time leads to the risk of abuse or defeats its own purpose with a decline in the efficiency of the society or increased costs.
At any rate a justified monopoly structure does not need to be prevented through legislation, but people should be aware of the associated risks.
These risks must be countered by means of clear rules to apply throughout the Community.
Such rules must be based essentially on an insistence on full transparency.
The necessary statutory changes to Community legislation set out in the report will also have the effect of massively enhancing economic growth.
The report estimates that between 5% and 7% of EU Gross Domestic Product is earned by goods and services protected by copyright and related rights.
That is by no means a minor proportion of the European economy and it is surely also still capable of growing.
Technical advance in particular offers enormous opportunities for the development of new forms of work.
At the same time the management of copyright in respect of these new kinds of works will be more challenging than ever.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, but above all Mrs Echerer, congratulations on the Sisyphean task that I am sure this report has been.
That was inevitable with such a many-facetted subject, but its success is a tribute to you.
We do not always have so large a consensus in this Parliament, and that shows that people have now become more aware of the problems.
I will illustrate this with a few figures.
When it comes to child pornography on the Internet, the media are full of headlines and leaders.
But far less attention is paid to economic crime.
If artistsâ rights are ignored and they are denied the fair income to which they are entitled, that is also an aspect of economic crime.
An economic loss of 5% of Gross National Product has been mentioned here; broken down into individual areas, it looks like this: 25% of audiovisual industry output is counterfeit, with sound recordings accounting for as much as 40%.
It has become a lucrative market for organised crime.
It is not simply a matter of lawbreaking by individuals becoming widespread.
As is rightly described in detail here, it is also due to excessively lax and at any rate very different laws in the various Member States, which encourage such product piracy and use of counterfeits.
The result is economic loss on a tremendous scale â lost tax revenue, lost jobs, lost investment confidence, which can be seen in the music industry in particular, but it also means lost rights for people like you and me, namely a loss of consumer protection, a loss of young peopleâs welfare and the like, and in the end it is also a threat to cultural diversity.
It follows that a uniform legal basis for the protection of intellectual property is long overdue.
The collecting societies that have already been mentioned many times have a particular part to play here, especially in light of the changed market conditions that we find in the information society.
How that can and should be done is described in detail in the report, which also contains the opinions from the other committees.
As a member of the Committee on Culture, I think it is particularly important to stress that the collecting societies are not simply a kind of protective association, but that they always have a cultural function as well, regardless of how they are organised.
The protection and exploitation of rights in intellectual property help to promote culture and cultural diversity, so the Committee on Culture is right, in its opinion, to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to this aspect.
Â Â  . Mr President, after this most interesting debate there is very little that I can add to what I said earlier.
No questions have been addressed to the Commission and no amendments have been brought to the notice of the Commission â even though Mr Manders mentioned one.
There is therefore nothing for me to comment on.
I shall end by saying that in the forthcoming Commission communication on the management of copyright and related rights in the internal market, the Commission will take due cognisance and notice of the remarks made this afternoon by Mr Karas, Mr Harbour and others.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions:
- B5-0016/2004 by Glenys Kinnock and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
- B5-0020/2004 by Nelly Maes, Didier Rod and Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe;
- B5-0022/2004 by Niall Andrews, JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro and Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
- B5-0023/2004 by Jan Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Zimbabwe;
- B5-0026/2004 by Pedro Marset Campos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
- B5-0030/2004 by Geoffrey Van Orden, John Alexander Corrie, Nirj Deva, Jacqueline Foster, Neil Parish, Charles Tannock, Mary Elizabeth Banotti, Michael Gahler, Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Bernd Posselt and Lennart SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;
- B5-0033/2004 by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Zimbabwe.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I should like to point out that we will be supporting the joint resolution on Zimbabwe.
The Zanu-PF regime is an appalling example of the repression of an impoverished and starving people.
Morgan Tsvangirai â the leader of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change â has been put on trial under spurious charges of treason.
The economic situation in that country has sharply worsened, with the GDP falling 40% over the last 4 years, and with inflation already at 600% and forecast to reach 1000% before the end of 2004.
There is 70% unemployment and over 6 million people are in need of food aid.
There have already been some reports of children dying from malnutrition, particularly in the Bulawayo area.
There has been a disastrous land reform programme â which no reference to the evils of colonialism can possibly justify â that has dismantled commercial agriculture without replacing it with any other way of producing food efficiently and effectively.
The â Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper â is still closed, despite the courts ordering its reopening, and now the news editor and chief reporter of the have been arrested under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act.
What we want is a renewal of the sanctions against Zimbabwe, which are up for renewal by the EU on 20 February 2004.
Equally, we want a further widening and strengthening of sanctions against the regime, with the introduction of additional measures to make international action against the regime more effective, in particular the stringent enforcement of the visa ban.
There will be a meeting of the EU-African Union Foreign Ministerial Troika on 1 April, and we hope that the EU will put it high on the agenda.
We welcome the intervention by Archbishop Desmond Tutu following the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Nigeria, but would call on other African leaders to equally intervene and put pressure on Mugabe to take action.
We need the donor community to make available food aid that can be distributed through non-governmental channels; and we want the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to galvanise the international community into taking coordinated and effective action against this intolerable regime.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to say a few words to state how much we deplore and condemn the situation the Mugabe regime is imposing on its people and on its country, Zimbabwe, turning one of southern Africaâs richest countries into one of the poorest and most underdeveloped, with constant and increasing attacks on human rights.
I also wish to note the reasons why we support this compromise motion for a resolution, which once again, like the others that we have tabled in the course of this parliamentary term, condemns the regime and which calls for sanctions to be re-imposed and for diplomatic pressure to be exerted on Mugabe that will lead to the democratic transformation of the country.
I also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to provide more practical support for representatives of civil society.
I recently asked the Commission about this matter and I was satisfied with the answer Commissioner Nielson gave.
He said that the Commission intends to continue providing assistance to representatives of civil society in order to support projects and/or activities in the field of human rights and democratisation and to help them to promote internal dialogue, an approach that we support and which, incidentally, is reproduced both in our own motion for a resolution and in the compromise text.
We would like this support to be more specific, however: what specific actions are being undertaken, with whom, with what means and how actively?
I believe that closer cooperation between the Commission and Parliament to mount political pressure could perhaps achieve more effective results.
We need to achieve more effective results not only because of the growing tragedy in Zimbabwe, but also because this could be a focus for instability and could set a bad example.
We were worried to hear news recently of similar actions or rather news that similar actions were being planned in Namibia too, even though this is not the official position maintained by that countryâs government.
There is also news â which led to some fellow Members tabling a written motion for a resolution â of an abnormally high murder rate of farmers in the Boer areas of South Africa.
This is one aspect of the persecution of farmers in Zimbabwe that should also concern us because it could spread throughout southern Africa.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Vitorino, we have discussed Zimbabwe on many occasions in this Chamber, and it is extremely tragic to see how this well-off country with such huge potential has headed straight for the abyss.
Zimbabwe has for a long time been a completely lawless country, economically impoverished and badly affected by AIDS.
It has a dictatorial, mad old leader who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people.
Precisely when one imagines that things could not be worse, new reports come in that the situation in the country has deteriorated further.
The human suffering and famine are becoming worse and worse, and there is an acute need for humanitarian aid.
Mugabe must go. That is the only chance for the people of Zimbabwe.
Now, the surrounding world must respond with vigorous countermeasures.
Everything has failed so far, but the sanctions must be intensified.
The whole of the international community must be crystal-clear in its condemnation of Mugabeâs regime and tell him that our patience is exhausted.
No contacts, no exchanges and no sporting events, together with renewed and more stringent sanctions, are what we require.
We must seek a broad coalition, which includes the SADC countries, in order to take measures and put pressure on the regime.
South Africaâs silent diplomacy, as it is termed, has shown itself to be completely ineffective, but South Africa must nonetheless be prevailed upon to use its contacts to put pressure on Mugabe.
At the same time, we in the EU must support the opposition.
There is a small number of incredibly courageous people who â at danger to their own lives and, in some cases, at the loss of their lives â are trying to fight for democracy and human dignity in that country.
I hope that the Commission is able to guarantee that the EU will continue to support these courageous people.
Â Â  Mr President, African countries have made solemn commitments to democracy and the protection of human rights on numerous occasions: under the NEPAD agreement and the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement, to name but two.
However, the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe's neighbours, who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country.
Not only have southern African countries been unwilling to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe, they have also allowed him to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with Europe, and that is worse.
The European Union's relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states' insistence that banned Zimbabweans should be included in meetings in Europe.
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has also been severely disrupted.
This not only undermines the founding principles of NEPAD and the ACP-EU relationship, but also means that major problems burdening Africa â external debt, AIDS, food security, conflict prevention, good governance and human rights â cannot be properly addressed.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control.
There are terrible shortages, and oppression is increasingly widespread and brutal.
A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed.
African states' refusal to take the initiative on Zimbabwe means that it is even more critical that EU sanctions against the ZANU-PF regime be strengthened.
This House has already called for them to be extended on six separate occasions.
To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls.
The EU travel ban against the Mugabe regime has regularly been breached in its first year and subsequently weakened to facilitate the entry of banned Zimbabweans into Europe.
The resolution before us today calls for renewal of EU measures when they expire on 20 February and the introduction of tough new sanctions.
It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded, for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union, for high-profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed, for those providing financial backing to the ZANU-PF regime to be identified, and for measures to be imposed against them.
Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish: real, effective actions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe now.
Â Â  â Mr President, on Monday, 5Â January 2004, the ran a trenchant essay entitled âTeargas for Haitiâ by the German author Hans Christoph Buch.
What does that have to do with the tragic situation in Zimbabwe under its President, Robert Mugabe, our topic of debate?
Well, Buchâs essay is an open letter to the current President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, an old acquaintance of the author.
Buch derides Mbekiâs stance on President Aristideâs regime in Haiti and President Mugabeâs in Zimbabwe.
Let me quote: âWhy did you not speak up for human rights to be respected in Haiti, and why do your protests against the ongoing violation of human rights in Zimbabwe sound so muted?â
Just like Buch, this resolution explicitly addresses South Africaâs attitude to the ever-worsening situation in Zimbabwe.
Council and Commission, let your voices be heard!
Buch, forthrightly, asks Mbeki, âOr do you want to leave South Africa the option of the road already taken by Mugabe â the white minority as scapegoat for your own failures?â
It is this clear stance that I demand of the European Union in the forthcoming consultation with the African Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have not in fact added our signatures to this resolution, and I want to tell you why.
Not in any way do we dispute the description of the misery in Zimbabwe, and we can endorse the rigorous condemnation of the Mugabe regime, but we have problems with pointing the finger at the surrounding countries and saying that it is they who have to remove Mugabe from power.
We certainly want to see Mugabe out of office.
We know that there is a well-organised and courageous opposition, but we are demanding things of the countries of Southern Africa that we ourselves are unable to do.
What are our own sanctions actually achieving?
Nothing so far â and I have to tell you that the surrounding countries are particularly susceptible to pressure.
It is the case that the violence is threatening to spread to South Africa, it is true that there is talk of land reform and that people who have nothing but weapons are now marching on the white-owned farms to take the law into their own hands â not only in Zimbabwe, but also in South Africa.
The land reform in Zimbabwe is a disgrace.
It has done nothing to put an end to peopleâs misery; far from it, it has made a few rich people even richer.
We are perfectly well aware of that but, rather than pointing the finger at one side only, we must look for effective measures.
Even the elephants are fleeing Zimbabwe in the knowledge that the national parks are being plundered, that the wild animals living in them are bereft of any protection and are being slaughtered, not only by poachers but also by people who hunt these animals out of their own desperation.
As people flee Zimbabwe, they are arriving in the neighbouring countries.
I therefore urge that we resume dialogue with vigour and examine ways in which we can help the well-intentioned regimes in Southern Africa.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the 1990s I worked as a trainer and advisor for a large Finnish development cooperation organisation.
Zimbabwe was our one cause for pride, our favourite example of what development cooperation and genuine partnership achieves.
It was proof that Africa was flourishing.
What destroyed Zimbabwe?
I am not now going to repeat that pitiful and seemingly endless list of factors the resolution mentions.
That would be too much.
Destruction has permeated Zimbabweâs entire social structure, from healthcare and education to the trade union movement and agriculture.
Africaâs formerly productive model country is in a state of chaos and its economic structures are in tatters.
In inciting people to occupy land illegally, instead of implementing controlled land reform within a reasonable timeframe, Mugabe flouted the law of the land and so devastated the functioning core of society.
That is what this issue is about.
When the basis of the legal system is destroyed the structures break up one by one.
The fact that President Mugabe, former fighter for independence and national hero, degenerated to the level of dictator to keep watch over his own country is a tragedy of our time.
I was a member of Parliamentâs delegation of election observers in Zimbabwe a few years ago and we were simply amazed when during the elections someone had the nerve to declare that the government would remain in power whatever the result was.
Despite intimidation, people voted.
In Zimbabwe that could mean not only taking risks but also walking for miles to a polling station and queuing for hours.
That was a sight to behold for someone used to a system where voting is easy.
I wish everyone who is scornful of voting and representational democracy could just see queues like that even once.
Let us in the EU give our unambiguous support to those who, despite oppression, have the courage to fight for law and rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is lamentable that the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe is turning into a never-ending story.
There are no positive developments within it to speak of and few from outside it to report.
The only positive aspect that comes to my mind is that the Commonwealth, at least, has not changed its stance on Zimbabwe.
The Council, too, though, when the situation first got worse three or four years ago, took a very ambivalent approach for a very long time.
As the main criticism in debates on matters of topical and urgent importance is often directed at the Council, I would like representatives from it not only to be present on such occasions, but also to make statements on the accusations levelled at it.
Where the travel ban is concerned, the Council always hides behind what it claims to be obligations under international diplomatic agreements, when â as usually happens â ministers from Zimbabwe are again allowed in.
Nowhere is it stated that a criminal regime must be accorded all diplomatic honours.
Of course one can take diplomatic reprisals against those who fail to abide by any human rights convention.
Of course you can also seize these peopleâs bank accounts and freeze the money until such time as circumstances change.
Nor, in my view, has the Council really made plain to South Africa the seriousness of our insistence that it too should bring this necessary pressure to bear.
I do not believe that we can sit by and wait for this problem to resolve itself.
We can of course try to avert our gaze, but the situation will become ever more pressing.
Other Members have already referred to the situation that people face, to the many millions of them who are already in South Africa illegally, and I see this as a situation in which pressure is needed, and must be brought to bear from every quarter.
There is no reason why our own governments should look away when these things are going on.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is following events in Zimbabwe closely and is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situation there.
In the light of the dire political situation in that country, and as no sign of a commitment from the government of Zimbabwe to take tangible measures to remedy the situation has been forthcoming, there can be no justification for lifting or easing European Union measures against Zimbabwe.
The Commission will therefore consider extending those measures for a further year.
The Commission remains fully committed to, and has even stepped up, its provision of direct assistance to the population of Zimbabwe in the form of food aid to cover essential needs.
This month an extra EUR 20 million was pledged for food aid operations owing to evidence of continuing significant requirements and the absence of other donors in the critical period up to the harvest in May.
This brings our total funding for food and humanitarian aid for the current season to EUR 85Â million.
We continue to be very active in providing support to projects in social sectors and in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
This sort of support was specifically excluded from the measures taken against Zimbabwe in order to protect the population and to promote progress.
To be more specific, and in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I would remind the House that Zimbabwe is a focal country in the context of 2002-2004 European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights funding.
That initiative should be viewed as a catalytic instrument for achieving significant results in protecting civil society and ensuring that critical voices can continue to make themselves heard within society.
The Commission continues to provide assistance for capacity building for human rights and democracy NGOs that carry out basic human rights work and for civil society actors by enhancing their capacities to promote internal dialogue.
In the last two years â 2002-2003 â almost EUR 2.5 million was allocated to specific projects under the EIDHR.
Finally, the Commission continues to explore all possible avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and is pursuing an enhanced dialogue with its neighbouring countries, and notably the Southern African Development Community and the government of South Africa.
It will support any peer pressure that the international community, and African heads of state in particular, can bring to bear on the government of Zimbabwe to improve the political, economic and humanitarian situation in that country.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the close of debates.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
â B5-0014/2004 by Mr van den Berg and Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Burundi;
â B5-0017/2004 by Mr Corrie and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Burundi;
â B5-0021/2004 by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and MrÂ Rod, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Burundi;
â B5-0024/2004 by Mr Van Hecke, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mrs Flesch, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Burundi;
â B5-0027/2004 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the assassination of the Apostolic Nuncio to Burundi;
â B5-0029/2004 by Mr Collins and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on Burundi.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I can say we will be supporting this compromise text on the situation in Burundi.
We were all shocked by the brutal murder of Monsignor Michael Courtney â the Apostolic Nuncio, and a man who had been playing a key part in the peace process in Burundi â in a road ambush on 29 December 2003.
All the indications are that he was murdered by Agathon Rwasa's rebel FLN.
Despite the murder, we welcome the fact that the FLN has now expressed for the first time a willingness to engage and meet with the President of the Republic with a view to opening peace negotiations.
Last November saw the peace process gather momentum, with the signing, on 16Â November, of a peace agreement between the transitional government of Burundi and the Forces for Defence of Democracy movement.
Yet fighting is still going on in several provinces, especially in rural Bujumbura.
The UN Secretary-General has rightly said that the Burundians must experience an improvement in their living conditions if this peace process is not to be jeopardised.
The human rights situation continues to get worse, and so we urge the African Union and its Member States to exert every possible pressure on the FLN with a view to bringing them to the negotiating table in an attempt to seek a peaceful political settlement.
We call on the UN Security Council to consider the rapid constitution and deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation to support the peace process at this crucial moment and to strengthen and complement the African Union's peacekeeping mission, which has already been deployed.
We also call on all states participating at the Donor Conference for Burundi to make sure there are sufficient funds for human rights promotion and protection.
Â Â  Mr President, Burundi has been plagued by violence and tension between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority for many years.
Democratic elections were held in 1993, which gave some hope for the resolution of this bloody conflict.
However, this progress was short lived, as the newly elected Head of State was assassinated and this triggered yet another massacre.
Since this period, Burundi has lurched from crisis to crisis, with many thousands of people losing their lives in the process.
A ceasefire was brokered by Nelson Mandela in 2002 but later collapsed.
A second power sharing deal was signed in 2003, which finally brought three of the main rebel groups into government, although, regrettably, fighting and abuse of human rights continues in several areas.
Only the National Liberation Forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the Irish Archbishop, Michael Courtney, who was the Vatican's envoy to Burundi.
Archbishop Courtney was heavily involved in the peace process and played a significant role in bringing about this recent progress.
Unfortunately, he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29Â December 2003.
This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family, friends and colleagues from the church.
As Mr Ford also pointed out, Michael Courtney made a valuable contribution to the current peace process in Burundi and I would hope there will be a full inquiry into his death which will bring those responsible for his death to justice.
Perhaps the tragedy of his death will intensify regional and international pressure on the FNL to sign up to the peace agreement following their long-overdue talks with the government, so that no more lives are needlessly lost and so that peace is finally restored to Burundi.
Â Â  â Mr President, nobody knows the precise death toll in the creeping genocide in Burundi.
The figure of 300Â 000 has been quoted â an enormous figure for a small country, but the reality is that we do not know.
The murder of the Nuncio is one of the latest acts of senseless violence.
The signing of the peace accords has reduced the violence, but the situation is highly unstable.
The FNL, which still refuses to enter into any agreements, is being reinforced by disaffected elements from the earlier rebel movements that, despite earlier agreement, continue to resist.
There are armed militias returning from the Congo, many other armed gangs wandering around and enormous numbers of handguns circulating among the population, handed out by the government itself, allegedly for peopleâs self-defence.
There are of course obstacles to the acceptance of the latest group of rebels, for which we are calling, for what real motivation is there to accept them?
Those who accept the peace agreements must then give up their seats in government, and the Hutus will then be even more of a minority in relation to the Tutsis.
I am aware that these are very sensitive issues in Burundi, but it is known to be the case that the groups that agree to peace must themselves bring on board new signatories to the peace agreements at the cost of their own seats.
You will understand that this, in Africa, is a very difficult thing to do.
A genuine human rights agenda has to be implemented in Burundi, for the continuing violation of human rights is a scandal.
Finally, the UN peacekeeping force that we support is probably needed more than ever, as the African peacekeepers have inadequate resources and cannot operate effectively enough.
It may be that we can improve matters in the meantime, for this is a matter of extreme urgency.
Perhaps then there will be less need of a peacekeeping force from outside.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, naturally, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party strongly condemns the murder of the Irishman, Archbishop Courtney, and demands that the authorities immediately carry out an extensive investigation to find out who murdered him.
The people responsible must be held accountable and punished.
The important work for peace done by Archbishop Courtney must not, of course, die with him, but must live on.
We also extend our condolences to his family and relatives and to the Irish people.
Perhaps what happened may lead to the Irish Presidency intensifying its work to support the peace process in Burundi.
It is unclear who murdered Archbishop Courtney.
The rebel movement, the FNL, has denied all involvement, but nor does it support the peace process.
We would, however, call upon them to lay down their weapons and support the peace process, and we would also express our pleasure at their having in actual fact agreed to meet Burundiâs President and engage in talks with him.
Perhaps that will lead in time to support for the peace process and negotiations.
Burundi is a tragic country in every respect, with extensive destitution in social and humanitarian terms, a good deal of violence, especially against women, and acts of considerable cruelty involving a disregard for human rights.
The peace process is very fragile.
Many people are guilty of extremely serious war crimes.
We strongly oppose any move to grant these people any kind of general exemption from punishment.
Burundi should instead implement what was decided in the Arusha Agreement and ratify the charter of the International Criminal Court, or ICC.
The wounds in Burundi following 300Â 000 or more murders will never heal if justice is not seen to be done and the murderers not held accountable.
People must be given the opportunity to move forwards, and the national process of reconciliation must continue.
We support the setting-up of a UN peacekeeping operation and hope that the EU may do all it can to help in supporting the peace process.
We have high expectations of the donorsâ conference later this year.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of my political group, I very much welcome the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Burundi and in particular acknowledge the cross-party support for the condemnation of the brutal murder of Archbishop Courtney on 29 December 2003.
I am quite sure that Archbishop Courtney's family and many friends will appreciate the support of the European Parliament at this time.
Michael Courtney was known to many of us here in Strasbourg when he served as Observer to this Parliament.
We came to know and admire him as a man dedicated to his calling, his work and to peace.
He went to Burundi as Apostolic Nuncio and it was there, while returning from a pastoral visit in one of his dioceses, that he was murdered.
We have lost a true friend.
I would like to tell the House that on learning of his appointment he told me and some parliamentary colleagues that he had a premonition about going there, but he brushed that aside and set about fulfilling his mission there.
We have lost a brave and distinguished friend and I would like to express my thanks to the Irish presidency for the acknowledgment of the life and work of Archbishop Courtney made by An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during his response to yesterday's debate.
It is typical of the man that he died trying to fulfil his mission of peace.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament's resolution recognises and appreciates the quiet and effective ways in which Archbishop Courtney had been helping the peace process and alleviating the suffering of the people of Burundi.
He had been instrumental in persuading some of the rebel groups to give up their armed struggle and had helped to secure the release of hostages last June.
It is my sincere wish that his legacy will now be recognised as a man of peace who worked tirelessly for all those in need.
The military option in Burundi must be abandoned once and for all.
The recent peace agreements must be swiftly implemented.
On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt.
Initiatives by the international community, focused on obtaining a political settlement, must ensure that human rights issues are addressed at every stage of the peace and democratisation process.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are shocked by the murder of Archbishop Courtney, whom, in the five years that he was here in Strasbourg, we knew as a diplomat, pastor and also as a personal friend.

I simply have to say that he was one of the truly great ecclesiastical figures in the tradition of the great Irish churchmen of the Middle Ages, who was always actively committed to the cause of peace and humanity; it was he who made it possible for us, here in Strasbourg, to join together in a service once a month, something he started along with a few of us in this House.
I can still remember how Archbishop Courtney took his leave of us when he went to Burundi to actively involve himself in the peace process there.
As soon as his aircraft landed there, it was shot at; there were rockets to welcome him.
He then, in peril of his own life, spent five years participating in the peace process, drawing on the wide experience he had gained from his missions in trouble spots on four continents.
He was meant to go to Cuba this week to take up office as papal Nuncio there and help human rights and freedom of religion to prevail.
His mysterious, brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that.
We should honour his memory.
He would certainly not, though, want his murder to be the only reason for us to focus on Burundi and thereby forget that murder is a daily occurrence in that country.
In recent years, over 200Â 000 people have been murdered there, not because of what we term ethnic conflicts, but because of a deliberate policy of genocide, and the fact that the situation in nearby Rwanda is even worse, and that in its neighbours Uganda and the Congo no better, should not hide from us the fact that we have a special obligation to this region, tormented as it is by ethnic killings that know no borders.
Europe does have obligations here, and our respect for Archbishop Courtney and for his legacy demands that we take appropriate action.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission joins in the strong condemnation of the brutal murder last month of Archbishop Michael Courtney, and expresses its deep sympathy to his family and to the Holy See.
The Commission calls upon the government of Burundi to find and bring to justice those responsible for this heinous crime.
The Commission notes, with some optimism, the news that the armed movement, the FNL, is prepared to negotiate with the transitional government of Burundi.
We very much hope that these negotiations will finally lead to a ceasefire agreement and the integration of this group into the transitional government.
Events in the last year have demonstrated that the consolidation of the peace process is achievable.
The Commission has closely followed and strongly supported the peace process in Burundi, using the instruments at its disposal to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation.
For example, we made food aid available for combatants to support the ceasefire of December 2002 and used the rapid reaction mechanism to support the deployment of African Union observers in April 2003.
The Commission did not wait for the establishment of the peace support facility to prepare an emergency programme to support African Union peace-keeping in Burundi and to make available EUR 25 million for the African Mission in Burundi, keeping the peace on the ground.
The financing agreement for this programme, seeking a timely contribution to peace, was signed in Brussels this morning during the visit of the President of Burundi.
The Commission is also contributing to economic and social reconstruction.
Our rehabilitation programme amounts to EUR 48 million and focuses on economic and social infrastructure destroyed by the civil war.
Last August, the Commission signed with Burundi the national indicative programme for the Ninth European Development Fund.
This programme, for EUR 172Â million, will make available much-needed budget support and promote rural development and good governance, including support to the transitional institutions.
As the Commission confirmed at this week's Donor Conference on Burundi, this new programme comes on top of the ongoing programmes amounting to some EUR 200 million.
Humanitarian assistance, through ECHO, will be continued in 2004, and EUR 15 million is earmarked for that.
It should therefore be clear that the Commission has the means and the intention to make a substantial contribution to the peace process and the reconstruction of Burundi.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the close of debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint discussion of the following motions for resolution:
â B5-0015/2004 by Mr van den Berg, Mrs Junker and Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Haiti;
â B5-0018/2004 by Mr Khanbhai, Mr Gawronski and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the situation in Haiti;
â B5-0019/2004 by Mrs SchÃ¶rling and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Haiti;
â B5-0025/2004 by Mrs Flesch, on behalf of Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Haiti;
â B5-0028/2004 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Haiti;
â B5-0031/2004 by Mr Andrews, on behalf of Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in Haiti;
â B5-0032/2004 by Mrs SandbÃŠk, on behalf of Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Haiti.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we now come to yet another extraordinarily sad topic for debate.
Haiti was once seen as a glimmer of hope for slaves taken from Africa to America, who were able to join together in establishing a free republic there.
Today, 200 years after Haiti achieved independence, we cannot but note that it is poor, broken-down and wracked by violence as never before, and those who have seen the place first-hand can only sink into pessimism.
I have met the present President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on two occasions.
The first was a number of years ago, when he was still regarded as the shining light of potential democratisation in Haiti.
Those who had turned out in large numbers to elect him by a large majority had believed that, having been freed from the dictatorship of Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, they would now be able to have a new life in a bright future.
This, unfortunately, turned out to be a great mistake, and he too was driven out of office.
During his exile, we covertly smuggled him into the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Santo Domingo, for we too believed that Haiti could have a good future under Aristide.
My second meeting with him was after the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, when I had the honour of leading a delegation that the Committee on Development and Cooperation sent to Haiti.
It was apparent from this encounter that we are dealing with a man who no longer has any idea where he is coming from, but that is not, in my view, the worst of it.
We are dealing with someone whose views are akin to fascism â there is no other way of putting it â and who treats all democratic institutions with utter contempt.
So it is that Haiti has, for the past three days, again been without a parliament, as the term of office for the deputies expired on 12Â January and there is no prospect of new elections.
There are, admittedly, still a handful of senators in the second chamber, but that does not legitimise anything.
What we are seeing here is a failure to hold elections, the falsification of ballots, the intimidation of the electorate, of whom â as was apparent the last time â only some 5% turn out to vote, most preferring to stay at home where they feel safer.
Such is day-to-day political life in Haiti.
It is not always possible to separate political and criminal forces.
Death squads dispose of those opposition elements who incur the regimeâs displeasure, and journalists who try to maintain something like standards of independent reporting are persecuted and even killed.
I could go on in this vein for hours.
We will have to support those forces that are combating these abuses; the caravans of hope are coming together.
We should be supporting these forces in the hope that things in Haiti may take a turn for the better.
Â Â  â Mr President, as Mrs Junker has just said, Haiti has been independent for 200 years, and, when the terrible Duvalier dynasty of Papa and Baby Doc came to a belated end over ten years ago, we thought that things could only get better, and, indeed, at first they did to some extent.
Mr Aristide carried the hopes of many, but we can all see what has happened in the meantime.
It is not only we Europeans who must ask ourselves where we went wrong with our policy over many decades, what we did or failed to do: the Americans certainly must, for they are closer to hand geographically speaking.
Why did the western half of Hispaniola â which is a large island â turn out like this?
Of course not everything is ideal in the Dominican Republic on the other side of the border, but, all the same, the fact that millions of Europeans and Americans go there as tourists and at least bring some money into the country is an indicator that things cannot be that terrible.
The situation is not yet ideal, but this does show that you can stay in the place with some degree of safety.
It is certain that we must look to ourselves for answers as to what we did wrong.
This House has been making very concrete demands of Haiti; political murders must be stopped; members of the ruling party must be compelled to uphold justice and maintain the law; the militias, the armed brigades and the so-called special brigades of the police must be disbanded and disarmed, and a start must be made on a national dialogue between the government and the opposition, so that the caravan of hope can reach its destination.
What would be best â and what we demand â is that this should be done through the mediation of the United Nations, and that the UN Mission must be re-established to work together with the Haitian police.
The conditions have to be created under which the suspension of the Cotonou agreement in accordance with its Article 96 can again be lifted, for our support is urgently necessary, especially in the areas of education and health.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it would have been good if, for once, our agenda could have included reference to a happy event relating to an ACP country, namely the bicentenary of Haitiâs independence. When the country became independent, it put an end to the slavery and exploitation of an entire people, which had lasted for decades.
What kind of celebrations can there be, what kind of congratulations can we offer to the Haitian government, such has been the downfall of this country, in which all optimism has been reduced to nothing?
A vicious circle has dashed the hopes and extinguished the symbol represented by Haiti.
President Aristide, previously a torchbearer for democracy, and reinstated by American intervention, has drowned Haiti in the mire of the third world.
The country has degenerated into a caricature of the poorest of the poor on the American continent and within the ACP.
A collapsed social economy is strangling the population and discouraging local and regional aid, while the black market prospers in the hands of the highest echelons of the regime.
The environmental disasters of deforestation and floods have heaped further misery on a desperate people.
Giving up in the face of such chaos would be the final nail in Haitiâs coffin.
Two centuries of Haitian independence have revealed the resourcefulness, the will and the ideals of the people, who represent the seeds of a rebirth of democracy and prosperity.
Condemnation of the current regime and situation, however, cannot hide the difficulties that exist and the abuses committed by countries of the region and of the West, within their framework of assistance.
Let us remember that not even the UNDPâs cry has evoked a response that will result in humanitarian aid.
The international communityâs disarray leads only to a lack of investment of resources and attention.
The EUâs cooperation agreement must be capable of adapting to the current situation, in conjunction with regional and international organisations.
We must not be daunted by Haiti; rather, we should view it as a challenge and a laboratory of transition for the EU in its cooperation with the ACP countries.
While remaining resolute, we must encourage dialogue with civil society, and request a UN mediator to reach a long-term political agreement, in order to help the Haitian people back onto the road to democracy and sustainable development.
Â Â  â Mr President, the appalling situation in Haiti is partly attributable to the violence perpetrated by armed gangs on which the regime relies, but mainly to the abject poverty suffered by the majority of the population.
President Aristide, its Head of State, certainly deserves no sympathy, as he has betrayed the hopes that his people placed in him.
One cannot help but feel deep disgust, however, when politicians from the major powers, in particular France and the USA, who are overwhelmingly implicated in Haitiâs fate, begin to lecture and moralise.
Two centuries ago, Haiti was one of the wealthiest countries in the Caribbean, but has become one of the poorest in the world. This is because it has been constantly pillaged and because France, its former colonial ruler, has never forgiven the country for winning independence by armed struggle and a slave revolt.
Over the course of the decades, newly-independent Haiti has been subject to a blockade by France, with the complicity of the US and UK, in order to force Haiti to pay compensation to the former slave-owners.
It is certainly in order to court mass popularity that Aristide is today demanding reimbursement of this colossal sum, which Haiti was obliged to pay until the twentieth century.
This claim does, however, have historical legitimacy, and paying back the stolen money would enable the country to establish an infrastructure, a road network, a water supply system and a health care system, which it almost completely lacks, and that would be only the start.
On a more general level, the sum required to alleviate the poverty of this country located a short stretch of water away from the wealthy USA would be a pittance for the major powers.
Instead of helping Haiti, however, these major powers continue to pillage the country, with the few French and USA companies established in the country paying scandalously low wages, and taking back to the USA all the profits made on the backs of Haitian workers, rather than investing profits productively.
It is precisely by showing solidarity with the people of Haiti that we can dissociate ourselves from the cynical and hypocritical declarations of those who claim to defend their freedoms.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is extremely sad that the way in which we, here in the European Parliament, are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Haitiâs break with oppression and slavery is with a statement about the drastic situation in the country.
I must not use my speaking time to repeat everything that my fellow MEPs have said about President Aristide.
Historic injustices are difficult to remedy, and reconstruction of a country demands not only the right leader but also the right institutions to control him.
A number of things have gone completely wrong in Haiti.
Neither Parliament, the courts nor the police function, and there are daily reports of serious human rights violations.
The most basic right, that to food, is being violated to a quite incredible degree.
Half the population is starving, and 23% of all Haitian children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, factors that are a direct threat to Haitiâs prospects.
The EU and the international community cannot, and should not, look on silently.
The humanitarian aid must correspond to the Haitian populationâs real needs, and the strongest possible political pressure should be exercised to get the parties to enter into dialogue and work towards a political solution.
A political solution is the only way of reintroducing a system providing legal certainty and respect for human rights, and the only option for solving the structural problems that have brought Haiti to the brink of famine.
Â Â  Mr President, I speak in support of my colleague, Mrs Junker, who has spoken on behalf of the Group.
Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas; 80% of its population live below the poverty line.
It has one of the lowest life expectancies, literacy rates and health indicators in a region which, as someone has already said, is itself rather poor.
The political, social and economic crises have all worsened in the last four years.
Half the population suffers from malnutrition; there is difficult access to clean water and where traditional exports have collapsed, drug trafficking and corruption are flourishing.
Worse, the recently-formed Haitian National Police has been able to enforce the rule of law and has been severely criticised by human rights groups for its own abuse of protesters protesting against President Aristide's rule and for failing to protect them from machete and gun-wielding government-supporting militias.
We condemn all the violence and political assassinations.
We call upon the Haitian Government, the opposition and civil society to engage in a constructive dialogue, possibly in the framework of a national conference to pave the way for free and fair legislative elections.
We call on the Council and Commission to use all political and diplomatic means to encourage the Haitian authorities, opposition parties and civil society to facilitate this dialogue.
In the meantime, we ask for the restoration of the United Nations mission working with the Haitian police, the disbandment of the so-called special brigades â as suggested by the UN Special Envoy â and the disarming of the militias.
That would be the first step on what may be a possible path to a solution.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am happy to be able to express to this House the congratulations of the Dutch Platform on Haiti on this joint draft resolution.
At the same time, as a Christian and a co-signatory of the petition, I put into practice the wise Biblical saying: âlet other lips praise youâ.
In contacts with workers in the field, I always ask what practical help the European Union can give.
I gladly endorse the suggestions that committed experts on Haiti have made to the Council and the Commission: firstly, that there should be support for local food production programmes and improvement in health care; secondly, careful observation of the human rights situation on the ground by the European delegation in Port-au-Prince, with careful reports on it sent to Parliament; and finally, the encouragement of constructive dialogue between government, opposition and civil society in accordance with paragraph 3 of the draft resolution.
The attacks this week on various radio stations in Haiti, which are the source of information for the countryâs people, underline once again the urgent need for European action in Haiti.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission shares the concern about the political, economic and social situation in Haiti and particularly at the absence of an agreement which would allow a solution to the political crisis in the country.
We encourage all parties in Haiti to respect Resolution 822 of the Organisation of American States and to work towards a rapid political agreement.
This is necessary to allow free and fair elections to take place in the near future in a climate of security and mutual respect.
A key element in the resolution of the crisis is the formation of a credible electoral council.
Despite the announcement of elections, this key element is still not in place.
The Commission recalls that for the last three years Haiti has been subject to appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Last December the Council decided to extend the measures for a further year.
Under these measures, some Community aid to Haiti is suspended.
However, the Community still provides considerable support of direct benefit to the Haitian population.
Actions to strengthen civil society and the private sector, to support democratisation and strengthen the rule of law, to fight poverty and to give humanitarian and emergency assistance are being pursued.
The European Union intends to remain present in Haiti and to promote a solution to the political crisis.
Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law constitute essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement.
Such elements are not in place in Haiti.
Normalisation of the EU's relations with Haiti depends on the fulfilment by the government of the conditions of the OAS resolution.
In a letter sent by the Commission and the Council at the beginning of January 2004 to the government of Haiti informing it of the extension of appropriate measures, the Union urges the government rapidly to translate its commitment to comply with the requirements of OAS Resolution 822 into concrete actions, which would lead to free and fair national and local elections.
The Commission is ready to provide support for elections in Haiti if they take place in accordance with the resolution.
Over the past few years, ECHO has responded to natural disasters mainly flooding by funding relief operations.
In addition, Haiti has been a priority in ECHO's programmes, which support activities to improve vulnerable populations' preparedness for disaster.
Current funding for such projects in Haiti amounts to more than EUR 1 million.
The Commission's growing concern with the deteriorating situation in the country is reflected in the fact that Haiti is listed as one of the forgotten crises in ECHO's 2004 strategy.
Parliament may be assured that the Commission is actively promoting a solution to the political crisis in Haiti and is using the means at its disposal to respond to the urgent needs of the Haitian population.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The joint debate is closed and we shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
âThe Conference of Presidents has approved, in its sitting this morning, an amendment to the title of this report. It should now read "a Community framework for collective management societies in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights".
The services will ensure that this amended title is translated into all languages.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to table another oral amendment.
Have no fear: it does not take up any new issues.
I have noted that one of the amendments has been incorrectly translated, and I do not think it accurately reflects the opinion of the Committee.
The text of item 8, which I have also forwarded to you, should properly read as follows: 'considers that, in the area of collective exercise of rights, the enlargement of the European Union means that there is a need for suitable measures and that action may be required'.
I think Members need have no qualms about voting for this.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am an interested party in this matter and so I have not taken part in the debate, nor will I be voting.
Â Â  â Parliament has completed its agenda.(1)
Wishing everyone a safe journey home to their countries, I declare this sitting of the European Parliament closed.
15 amendments could be accepted in their entirety:

Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 15 January 2004.(1)
Â Â  Madame BerÃšs, happily, on this question and the multiplicity of legal dimensions which you bring to my attention, I am not an expert and so I sought advice from those with expertise.
I am advised that the course of action I followed was appropriate.
I should like to quote to you the relevant part of Rule 7(4) : 'Should the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office, the President shall ask them to keep him regularly informed of the stage reached in the procedure. He shall refer the matter to the committee responsible.
On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter'.
That is what I have done.
There is no point in having a debate on this, although I do not mind having a bilateral dialogue with you.
I believe I have acted in accordance with the Rules.
I have acted on the advice I took on the matter, which I believe was offered with no malice or prejudice.
When I have the advice of the committee I will continue to act as my duty requires.
Â Â  I should like to welcome to the official gallery a Libyan delegation currently visiting the European Parliament.
I am pleased to inform you that today our interparliamentary relations with Libya take a positive step forward.
The delegation, from the General People's Congress of Libya, is led by Mr Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim, Vice-President of that Congress.
Mr Ibrahim, I welcome you and your colleagues, and underline the importance we attach to your visit in the present circumstances.
The recent measures taken by Libya are a cause for some hope.
We now need to build on that hope together.
We thank you for being here.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the programme of the Irish presidency and the European Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in the Intergovernmental Conference and I look forward to hearing your views.
As you know, in accordance with our mandate from the Brussels European Council, we have been consulting widely with our partners.
The Taoiseach has already either spoken to or met most of his colleagues on the European Council and will have been in contact with all of them before long.
Several more meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks.
Foreign Minister Cowen and I have also talked to and met with as many of our counterparts as possible.
We also discussed the IGC over lunch at last Mondayâs meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Notwithstanding the importance of bilateral consultations, we felt that it was also important to recognise the collective nature of the IGC and to have an informal discussion of where we stand.
I was very gratified that there was full support for our approach at the General Affairs Council.
The discussion was a positive one â there is considerable common ground.
We are all committed to taking the work of the IGC forward and to concluding it as soon as possible.
However, we all also recognise that there are sensitive and complex issues which remain to be resolved.
In these consultations with our partners and all those involved in the IGC, including of course the European Parliament, we are seeking to build a complete picture of the situation in the IGC.
We want to ensure that we fully understand the views and concerns of all, to listen to what everyone has to say and, through active dialogue, tease out the exact nuances of their positions.
This will help towards the second and more complex phase of our mandate to draw conclusions from our contacts and prepare a report for the March European Council.
I do not wish at this stage to speculate about what that statement will contain.
We do not underestimate the complexity of our task.
The issues to be resolved may be few in number, but they are highly sensitive and difficult.
We will try to encourage progress, to build mutual understanding and to identify common ground.
However, we cannot compel agreement in the absence of the shared political will to achieve it.
There is an obligation on everyone to think not only of their own interests, but of the collective interest of the Union as a whole.
In that context I want to reiterate the point made by the Taoiseach in Strasbourg, and also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Cowen, before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week: 'If it emerges that there is a real prospect of achieving an agreement during our presidency, then we will not hesitate to seize that opportunity'.
We intend to submit the fullest possible report to the European Council.
The Convention opened up the process of Treaty change and brought fresh perspectives to bear.
We all â parliaments and governments alike â are accountable to our people, and the democratic authority of the Convention was underscored by the breadth of its membership.
I am pleased that the great bulk of what was proposed by the Convention has stood throughout the IGC and will continue to stand.
For example, the text clearly sets out the allocation of competences between the Union and the Member States, and the principles governing their exercise.
It simplifies legal procedures and instruments.
It creates a single legal personality for the Union.
It enhances the role of this Parliament, and it also gives national parliaments an important part in the overall architecture.
By incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the draft enhances the prominence of human rights in the work of the Union.
The values and objectives of the Union are more clearly expressed.
Its proposals on the creation of a single European Union Foreign Minister and External Action Service should make the Unionâs external policies more effective and coherent.
The Conventionâs report remains and will remain at the heart of the IGC's work.
But as a matter of both legal and political reality, governments are obliged to look very carefully at it, and in particular at those aspects which would affect them most directly.
In due course it will be our duty to seek national ratification, in some cases through referenda.
The efforts of the Italian presidency ensured that considerable progress was made in resolving most of the points raised by governments.
The work done in the run up to the Naples Conclave in late November 2003, and at Naples itself, was very productive.
The paper prepared immediately in advance of the European Council was particularly valuable and struck a very careful balance.
While, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and while there are aspects of the Italian presidency's good work which were not the subject of final consensus, we believe we must try, as far as possible, to maintain the excellent progress which has been made.
When Minister Cowen appeared before the Constitutional Affairs Committee, he gave an assurance that the Irish presidency would be open, fair and balanced, and that we would listen to all views and work to accommodate them.
I want to repeat that message here today.
We have no hidden agendas, no pet projects.
We are determined that nobody will be able to question our even-handedness.
We may, or may not, succeed. But this House can be absolutely assured that we will put every possible effort into this work.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I recall quite a well-known proverb which says something like âProcrastination Road leads straight to Never-Never Landâ.
You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, were there when, a few weeks ago, the European Council in Brussels decided to take âProcrastination Roadâ towards a European constitution.
At the moment, in line with the thinking in Brussels, many of us have concluded that this âprocrastinatingâ timescale was preferable to reaching a bad agreement immediately, which would have undermined the work of the Convention.
I would like to say, however, on behalf of the Commission and in particular on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino, that we will not resign ourselves to âProcrastination Roadâ leading to âNever-Never Landâ.
The debate today, which this House wanted, is an opportunity for you to join with us in relaunching the constitutional process, and to preserve the European spirit that we have built up over eighteen months in the Convention.
In order to achieve this, all our good will needs to be united: that of presidencies and Member States of the Council, that of Parliament, that of the Commission and of national elected representatives, with the support of the regions and organised civil society.
In order to remobilise public opinion in general, we all need to work together to give this process hope again.
The Commissionâs contribution to this urgent task will be based on three convictions.
The first is that we want a general agreement.
A general agreement is not an agreement bit by bit or piece by piece, but an overall agreement, in which everyone can see a balance based on a text of which everyone is aware.
This is why the Commission does not think that anything has been gained from the discussions in Brussels, as Mr Roche said earlier â particularly when the result would have been nothing more than a step backwards.
Moreover, although there are tendencies that it is helpful to take into account when continuing a task that has been interrupted, these must be confronted in open, transparent debate and by the current situation.
Naturally, we acknowledge the very useful work done under the impetus of the Italian Presidency, which was the subject of the preparatory document for the ministerial meeting in Naples.
The second conviction is that we want an agreement solely based on the draft constitution drawn up by the Convention.
This is the only thing that should be taken as established because at best, we do not think that anything better or greater can ever be done than this collective, democratic effort, which took eighteen months.
You are of course aware of our institutionâs position regarding this result.
We think that on a few points it could be clarified, adjusted and improved regarding the composition and operation of the Commission, in order to broaden the scope of qualified majority voting and of course to make the procedures for revising the Treaties more flexible.
However, like you, we wish to preserve its general balance, in particular with regard to finance and budgets.
The third conviction is that we want an agreement as soon as possible.
The Irish Presidency has, in a sense, started on what it has to do.
It has restarted the work of listening and working between those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Commission supports â and will continue to fully support â the efforts and the method that you, Mr President-in-Office, have chosen, and these efforts are essential.
It will be no easier to reach an agreement in November than in April or May 2004; in fact, I think that it will be much more difficult.
If we allow the symbolic deadline of 1 May or 9 May, or the politically more significant one that is primarily your own, 13 June to pass by, the draft constitution will not be very far from what I called at the beginning of my speech âNever-Never Landâ.
In other words, the Commission supports all efforts, wherever they come from, to preserve this constitutional process.
As you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the next meeting will be that of the European Council in March, where the Presidency will evaluate the results of its bilateral consultations and where we will all be able to verify the state of mind of the Heads of Government.
We will see whether that state of mind is, as we hope, different in March to what it was in December in Brussels.
This is why, Mr President, the draft resolution prepared by this House has the Commissionâs total approval and support.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too wish to express my gratitude to the Irish Presidency of the Council, which, I believe, has given the necessary response to this Houseâs December resolution, and has got the debate moving.
It has found new ways of structuring the way we talk to each other, and is applying the necessary sensitivity to getting us to do it.
Taking all these things together, there is, in my judgment, a real chance of this Houseâs objective being approached even before 1 May or prior to the European elections, and of a result being achieved.
I see this as important; we can all see that there is no desire to maintain the debateâs momentum until next December, nor to maintain the collective awareness of what was more or less already agreed under the Italian presidency, namely that we have to work to a tighter deadline in order to keep the two together.
It is because this is generally known that there is ongoing discussion in the various Member States, and so I am aware of a general willingness to produce a result as soon as possible.
At the same time, let us bear in mind what this House would like to see: further democratisation of the European Union, of course, and the Budget issue, which we see as decisive and to which I would like to return.
There is the issue of transparency, so that the public can know who in Europe is responsible for what, and also, of course, the issue of efficiency.
That is what we have to get to grips with at the present moment, and it will be decisive.
I think it important that we should not explicitly specify certain models right down to the last millimetre.
What has to be decisive is that the decision-making structure should be more efficient than that proposed in Nice, and should enable an enlarged Community to act; that has to be the crucial yardstick, and I believe that, if we take this as our basis and apply the requisite capacity for imagination, we will be able to find compromises that will enable this to be accepted by those countries that often have difficulties on this point, for it is connected â or can be â with other issues as a means towards reaching a compromise that, while being truly fair, does justice to the three goals of democratisation, transparency and efficiency.
Let me now mention a final point.
In the aftermath of Brussels, there has been so much discussion of a multiple-speed Europe, something we have always had within the Treaty, whether about the euro, Schengen or anything else.
It was always the case, though, that everyone could talk to everyone else, in the same fora, and that all Members had the opportunity of joining in.
What we are today describing as a necessity is a defence union.
If we do not get the constitution, there will be irresistible pressure for a defence union to be established outside the framework of the European Union.
We will then no longer be obliged to talk to each other every day in the same fora, things will fall apart, and then, rather than there being a multiple-speed Europe within the framework of the European Union, Europe will drift apart.
The end result â not because anyone wants it, but because these things happen in the course of time â will be that, at some point in the next five or ten years, we will be where we were before 1914, in a Europe of alliances.
I think we all should know how undesirable this would be, and so we should see it as our responsibility to get a result now.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we need the Constitution, and we need it for twenty-five of us.
All this talk about âcore Europeâ, centres of gravity and multiple speeds is no substitute for the constitution; on the contrary, it leads us astray, into a patchwork Europe of plots and counter-plots, and that we must avoid above all else.
Secondly, we need the constitution before the elections, as we have to send out a signal to the voters throughout Europe, who are increasingly impatient for this constitution to be adopted, for we know that nothing will be any easier in the autumn or next year; indeed, everything to do with the constitution will become more difficult.
Thirdly, we know perfectly well that we must not have another failed Intergovernmental Conference.
It is vital that we succeed this time round, and I support the Irish presidencyâs desire to clarify in advance whether we can achieve a positive outcome.
Let us, fourthly, stop putting question marks against what came out of Naples.
We have traded arguments; we are where we did not always want to be, but this is where we must start from if we are to progress further.
I know that most of the Member States are willing to accept Naples in terms of the consensus that the Italian presidency presented.
Apart from that, there is one point on which I differ slightly from Mr Brok.
Although it is certain that effectiveness is the benchmark, the yardstick of democratic legitimacy must also be applied to the decision-making processes in the European Union.
I do think, though, that we will draw a bit closer together on this point in the course of the coming weeks.
We will support the Irish presidency with all our might, not only as regards the methods by which it endeavours to achieve consensus, but also in terms of its goal of presenting, in March, a sketch of potential outcomes rather than merely a timetable.
Let me conclude with words of hope.
After this Mondayâs informal meeting there is a little light peeping over the horizon; may it become, under this presidency, a European dawn!
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if Mr HÃ€nsch is listening, let me say that, although Brussels is a cold place at the moment, those of us who are motivated by the Christian faith are in any case always animated by hope and optimism, and that is why nobody can hamper our work on a European constitution; we too want the sun to shine.

That it may well be for you lot; red is a fine colour, but not only by its associations with the European Socialists ...
... that is a misuse of the colour.
Let us be serious; let us get back to 2004, which is, as we all know, a crucial year.
On 1 May, ten countries will be acceding to the European Union, in which there will then be 450 million people â far more than in the USA and Russia combined, and that figure itself shows by its magnitude how necessary it is that we should have a basis on which these 25 States â and later more â with their 450 million inhabitants may be held together.
It is important that we should be able, on 10 and 13 June, to present the voters with a constitution that will show us the way to get through this twenty-first century in peaceful cooperation, as our continent is peacefully integrated.
Let me say, on behalf of the European Peopleâs Party element in our shared group, that we see the constitution as the priority above all others.
It was the experience of Nice that prompted us to set up the Convention.
It was Parliament â I do not want to claim credit solely for our own group â that called for the Convention.
I can tell you that if the Convention had been able to take decisions on its own, we would have a constitution today.
What was proposed was, in principle, a right and proper project, and that is why we declare that the failure of the Brussels Summit must not mean the failure of the European Constitution and that everyone concerned should now learn from the Brussels experience.
Apportioning blame will get us nowhere, and not only politics but also human experience teach us that blame is never, or almost never, to be attached to one person alone, but that it is always shared by many.
We therefore urge everyone to seek out opportunities for compromise and to muster their capacity for it, for there is above all a psychological basis for success, namely that we should respect each other and that the small countries should be treated with the same respect as the large ones.
A country may well be large, but that does not mean that it is on the right track.
There are, then, no first and second-class Members of the European Union.
One does hear some preposterous arguments used against the constitution; there are those who say that a constitution amounts to centralism and a European superstate, and the very same people who reject a constitution scorn Europe as being, in their eyes, nothing more than a bureaucracy.
That is why we say that a constitution is our chosen means of making democracy and parliamentarianism realities in the European Union.
Indeed, Mr Schulz, there are many that I have in mind, but I do not want to make you more famous than you already are.
The constitution will strengthen not only this House, but also the national parliaments, which will be able to appeal, on the grounds of subsidiarity, even against legislation planned by the European Union, and it needs to be pointed out to the constitutionâs detractors that it, for the first time, puts local government on a legal footing.
In the event of any dispute as to whether, in accordance with the allocation of European competences, it is Europe or the nation-states that are competent, or if regional and local self-government is impaired, it is not merely politically but also legally of vast significance that the European Court of Justice can refer to the article that lays down how local communities govern themselves.
There has been talk of âcore Europeâ and multiple speeds, and I want to say how much I agree with what both Mr Brok and Mr HÃ€nsch have said.
Both have been Members of this House for a long time, so the slight differences of opinion that remain between them despite their intensive cooperation in the Convention can be overcome, and, should they be in need of conciliation, they will find plenty of members of our group ready and available.
There is one goal in Europe towards which we must strive.
We have one goal in common, and we want to reach it together.
Those who talk in terms of a âcore Europeâ basically want to revert to intergovernmental cooperation, and I can tell you that our group will not stand for it; we will counter it with determined resistance.
Where there is a will there is a way ...
... and we need to respect each other; more than anything else, we need to trust each other.
We have confidence in you, Mr President-in-Office, in your government, in your Taoiseach, in the President of the European Council, in your foreign minister, in you personally and in Commissioner Barnier too â that is all I want to say about the Commission today â and, if we take this path together ...
... and with determination, defending the Community of Europe, then, I am convinced, we will eventually be successful.
Â Â  A commendable new form of 'inter-faith' dialogue!
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, aware that the Irish Presidency is very sensitive to poetry, allow me to begin by expressing in positive terms what Commissioner Barnier has said in a negative way.
The universal Spanish poet, Antonio Machado, said in a very famous poem: and you have begun to walk, prudently but firmly, and I believe that Parliament should appreciate this.
You are opening up the path and overcoming a very dramatic situation of deadlock, of stagnation, in Europe.
We have heard the report from our representatives in the IGC, Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr Brok, and what both of them tell us is that it appears the atmosphere has changed.
I believe that Irish hospitality is playing a positive role in this and it is very significant that the atmosphere has changed for the better; and I even welcome the very positive words of Mr Poettering, who I am sure has spoken on behalf of at least three-quarters of his group.
I imagine that the British Conservatives will not be happy, but I believe that there is clear convergence between us ...
Well, on behalf of 80%, I admit.
There is a first important question which has not yet been resolved â and I believe that the Italian Presidency has not communicated a single document in this respect â which is the status of the modifications to the text of the Convention at the Brussels Council.
Having heard the Irish Presidency and having studied these modifications in Parliament, I believe that further work has been done on the text of the Convention, that is to say, there has been no consolidation of these texts, and that is important in terms of assessing the backward movements which have taken place.
We must, moreover, begin working in this regard.
I also believe we must stress that a number of countries that were very critical at the Brussels Summit â and I include my own, Spain, together with Poland, Germany and France, amongst others â have publicly expressed by means of their ministers their will to reach an agreement.
With regard to the two-speed Europe, I am going to say something very fundamental: the problem is not so much that there are two speeds, but rather how to persuade those who are applying the brakes every day to stop doing so.
I believe that that is the crux of the issue at the moment, that is to say, we cannot make progress if there are a number of countries which are applying the brakes entirely.
I believe that would be a good start.
It is absolutely clear that we must try to prevent a second failure in the Intergovernmental Conference, but also, looking at it positively, it is very important that we are able to face our responsibilities.
Why?
Because the Convention, with the participation of the new Member States and with the participation of some countries still in negotiations, produced a text, and we must offer the electorate â whom we are going to consult very shortly â a result of our work which allows the Union to work and operate more democratically and more efficiently.
That is the responsibility which we share and, therefore, with a view to the elections, we must be able to take that position.
I would, however, add further elements to this yearâs timetable.
Firstly, there will be a new Parliament and new Commission, and we cannot now deny them the right to propose the modifications they consider appropriate as well.
The issue is not whether the next Presidency does it better, but that we may find ourselves in the situation of having to start from the beginning again, with the new Parliament and the new Commission.
That is an important point.
We are also dealing with important international decisions which will affect the European Union over the coming months: the reform of the United Nations, to which we Europeans are directly committed â tomorrow we will receive its Secretary-General â the situation in Iraq, the situation in the Middle East, and the European Union's international policy and responsibilities.
Furthermore, while not making any threats or accusations, it is clear that we must tackle and debate, jointly and immediately, because they are in the timetable, the updating of the Lisbon strategy and of the financial perspectives, in other words, the economic dimension and solidarity within our Union, and we must try to do so constructively.
It is unthinkable that we should make progress on the economic dimension and not do so on the political dimension.
It is therefore extremely urgent â and I welcome the Irish Presidencyâs will â that we act in a positive and proactive manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I also welcome the progress report from Minister Roche, my fellow .It is clear that we are moving on â sharpish â from the fiasco that we had at the summit in Brussels.
I trust that it will be possible to reach agreement before 1 May.
There are, however, three sets of problematical questions outstanding: the formula for qualified majority voting, the size and shape of the Commission and the scope of QMV.
It would be unfortunate if our obsession with those first two great patriotic questions obscured the third â the scope of QMV â which is in some ways more important.
The Italian presidency, mainly under pressure from Prime Minister Blair, unfortunately retreated in several ways from the Convention's modest and balanced proposals to extend the scope of QMV and codecision with the Parliament.
The Italian so-called 'final compromise package' is not acceptable to the Liberal Group â nor, I suspect, to a majority of this Parliament.
Especially objectionable would be a flight from QMV concerning the provisions on social security for migrant workers; the suppression of codecision from the clauses on the framework programme for research and development; the re-insertion of the national veto and the suspension of the legislative rights of this Parliament in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters; and the unwelcome supplement to the progressive clauses of a right of veto for any single national parliament â a certain recipe for frustrating the decisions of the European Council and for bringing on the ultimate sclerosis of the European political system.
The Irish presidency is quite correct in saying that all Member States must move for the IGC to be able to succeed and none more so than the British Prime Minister, whichever personality that might prove to be.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Constitution is said to reflect the will of both the people and states.
We know how the will of states is measured: it is decided by parliaments.
That is not necessarily the same thing as the will of the people.
If the Constitution is to be decided upon nationally, the large majority of our group think the will of the people should be measured by means of a referendum in all Member States.
Those countries which adopt the Constitution will establish a new Union. The intention is to continue the work of the old Union.
Under the Constitution the present Union will be suspended.
This must be a unanimous decision under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States.
If a country is in disagreement, that is its legal right.
If the Union that many countries joined after a referendum is suspended, a referendum will also have to be organised regarding accession to the new Union in as many Member States as possible.
The Constitution has been virtually finalised at an intergovernmental conference.
The articles on military matters, among which there is a new model for structural cooperation, were agreed at Naples.
These are not just about defence: a special additional protocol in it also provides for any demanding military operations that may be referred to as âpeacemakingâ, and which therefore also include invasion.
In fact the EU is not now preparing for defence, but attack.
Our group does not think this kind of militarisation of the EU is necessary.
Neither should the involvement of NATO be written into the Constitution as has now been done.
What still needs to be written into the Constitution is the rule that EU crisis management must be based on a mandate from the UN.
Our group is prepared to participate in structural work in a social Europe.
The draft Constitution, however, is not satisfactory in this area.
We want to make changes to it to safeguard the provision of services to all EU citizens.
We need social security and not European militarism.
Our group thus wants a social Europe but there have not been any satisfactory decisions taken by the Convention or the IGC in that area as far as we are concerned.
We do not think it appropriate that the Constitution was drafted in conjunction with talks on the EUâs new financial perspective.
Member States cannot be forced to accept a constitution which their citizens cannot agree to.
We need referenda.
Ninety-six members of the Convention called for a referendum.
They represented both the yes and the no vote in future referenda.
Referenda are peopleâs democracy.
Â Â  â Three brief comments, Mr President: the aim of constitutional reform is to make the European Union more democratic and more effective, and not to calculate the balance of power between Member States.
The Intergovernmental Conference has, however, stalled on this issue and it is clear that the decision-making method which allows the veto is the real cancer of the European Union, it is that which is killing Community solidarity of any kind.
For the majority of my group, the text adopted by the Convention represented â or represents â a step forward, but certainly not a revolution.
I am sure that there is a substantially large majority on that point in Parliament, but it seems to me that, in the words of the Presidency and in our debate, there is a fundamental ambiguity.
We are all optimistic and hopeful, we are encouraging the Irish Presidency to do its best, but what is it that we are encouraging it to do?
We are even turning down any parliamentary initiative that might upset the Presidency, we are deciding not to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Spinelli, of the formal adoption of the Convention.
I repeat, what is it we are encouraging it to do?
Mr HÃ€nsch, if democratisation is a criterion of your assessment, then we cannot accept the results of Naples for the simple fact that the results of Naples represent, in the majority of their proposals, a backward step with regard to the Convention and, in certain cases, in particular where the budget is concerned and even as regards the current situation.
How can you, as our representative, accept such a thing?
It is not possible!
It smacks of ambiguity, it is a contradiction in terms!
In my view, therefore, we really cannot be content with talking about whether the glass is half empty or half full.
With regard to the five or six points on which agreement was more or less reached in Naples, I should like to hear what the Irish Presidency has to say.
I should like to know what it will do and on what it will try to reach an agreement: on the text of the Convention or on what, Mr President, you have today defined as a good basis?
From what you said at the beginning of your Presidency, I gained the impression that the 82 points did not exist.
So then: do they or do they not exist?
Are they or are they not a basis?
Frankly, I have not understood, and it seems dangerous to me that our two representatives take the view that this is a good basis for negotiation, because actually it is not, and this is not Parliamentâs position.
Secondly, a quick point: frankly, it seems to me, once again, that the ideal way that we can help the Irish Presidency is to mobilise Members and public opinion around a project for democracy.
If we again decide to leave everything to the Intergovernmental Conference, in March and in May, we will end up with a project worse than that put forward in Naples.
I therefore call on Members, on the various parliamentary groups, which are in the majority compared to my group, to insist on the idea of meetings, to insist on the idea of a major parliamentary initiative in the month of May, so as to stand by and assist the Irish Presidency, not leave it alone with its colleagues who, by themselves, will not make a better Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I warmly welcome the statement made by Minister Roche on behalf of the Irish presidency here this afternoon.
I am glad to learn that at the meeting of the foreign ministers this week, there was a constructive exchange of views with regard to the need for the new treaty.
Clearly the events of the Brussels summit of EU leaders last December are now well behind us.
There is a strong, growing realisation that we must re-invigorate the process to put in place a new European Union treaty, and delay and prevarication, recrimination and confrontation do nothing whatsoever to move this political process forward.
That is why I welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council, our Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, is holding an extensive round of bilateral negotiations with European Union leaders at this particular time.
This week already he has been in Madrid at a meeting with the Spanish Prime Minster. Towards the end of this week he is to meet the Polish Prime Minster.
We will all be in a stronger position to make a judgment on the state of the negotiations to put in place a new European Union treaty when the Taoiseach gives a report of his bilateral discussions to the Council meeting of European Union leaders in March.
We all know what the bottom line issues are.
They are not a secret.
One of the clear benefits of the EU Convention process is that we have a draft treaty that forms a basis for the present discussions.
However, we need some European Union governments to move away from seemingly entrenched political positions.
That is essential.
A new treaty cannot be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process.
We should all remember that we have a lot to be proud of in Europe at the moment and that the impasse relating to the finalising of a new European Union treaty should not detract from that.
We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004.
This historic event will herald an end to the artificial divide that existed in Europe since the end of World War II.
The enlargement of the Union will strengthen Europe's voice on the international stage.
In conclusion, I believe we all support the intensification of talks between the European Union governments so as to ensure that agreement can be reached concerning the provisions of the treaty.
We urgently need to streamline the way we carry out our business in Europe and the sooner we secure agreement the better.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few days ago, the Polish Prime Minister gave what I thought was a quite astounding reason for reaching an agreement quickly on the constitution, saying that in six months time, it would basically have no use.
Either Mr Miller is a follower of Father Ubu, which would not be at all surprising for a Pole, or, more probably, this statement indicated that MrÂ Miller had concluded that, as this text would not in fact get us anywhere, there was not any point in delaying its adoption for much longer.
Because, my dear Commissioner Barnier, the debate is not between âprocrastinationâ and âNever-Neverâ, but between âsomewhereâ and ânowhereâ, and nowhere is exactly where this draft constitution is taking us.
In reality, the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament combined, are clinging to this supposed constitution as if it is their last hope, while their policies, particularly this year, have clearly failed, and while public opinion is generally disenchanted, if we believe the latest Euro-barometer, which I think is enlightening on this subject.
In reality, the only policies that are working at European level are those that are made outside of any institutional framework, as we saw with the joint approach by the French, German and British foreign ministers in Iran or as we are seeing with what we at least hope are the first steps of European defence, by the same three countries which have been able to break free of all institutional suggestions, all ministers and all commissioners wearing two or three hats.
There will be a constitution, because the European machine cannot be allowed to fail, as you have all said.
There will therefore be a constitution or something of that name.
However, if it is a democracy, and in my mind a constitution is the privilege of a democracy, as MrÂ Poettering often says, a European democracy can only be established in one way, perhaps with the risks that it carries: through a referendum.
If a referendum is not announced â and I regret that Parliamentâs text, as usual, avoids this issue â Mr Poettering and others can be sure that the electorate, in June, will show you what they think of your supposed democracy.
Â Â  â Mr President, even though we do not yet know where we are with the isolated agreements that were or were not reached at the IGC before the deadlock in December, some people, and in particular the European Parliament, are calling for the negotiations to be speeded up and brought to a close quickly.
We reject this idea for two reasons.
First of all, the period gained through the deadlock in the negotiations would be better used for further discussion on this constitution.
The deadlock point, which is the formula for the double majority vote, is not an insignificant one.
In fact, it was crucial for national sovereignty, as were many other provisions of this draft.
The chair of the delegation from the French National Assembly to the European Union, which supports this text, has acknowledged that, with regard to the double majority, and I quote: âfrom a national point of view, nevertheless our country had as much interest in the status quo as Spain and Poland â.
I think that the negotiators should consider this admission as a warning.
Secondly, we are hearing statements here and there about the negotiations possibly coming to an end just before the European elections.
In this respect, I would like to warn those who, once again, wish to catch the citizens off guard.
It appears that some people would like there to be an agreement just before the elections in order to shorten the debate and then be able to cite the election result, if it is sufficiently in favour of the federalist parties, in order to avoid a referendum on the constitution.
This would be an illegal manoeuvre, as the European elections are meant to elect representatives to the European Parliament to deal with a very wide range of subjects, but not the possible constitution, to which different methods of decision-making would apply.
We will fight any attempt to violate the law.
I also hope, Mr President, that this debate will retain a minimum standard of honesty and dignity.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is not difficult to get up again when you have fallen down, so, as Commissioner Barnier was saying, we need to remobilise public opinion and our national politicians.
This is the aim of the resolution that we are putting forward, which should be seen as an extremely strong political signal.
Imagine that in our respective national parliaments the four main parties in our countries tabled a joint resolution.
That would cause a stir.
Why is there this level of consensus?
It is because we all agree that we need to bring the enlargement and the deepening of the Union into step with each other.
The number of players is going to change, the playing field is changing, therefore the rules have to change.
Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this resolution should be seen as something helpful, an encouragement, a stimulus.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is extremely moderate.
On the one hand, it proposes that you use the Convention draft as a basis â in this respect, we hope that you will not move too far away from it â and on the other hand, it proposes, significantly, the date of 1 May and not 9 May.
After that we will have a last sitting in Parliament from 3 to 6 May.
We should not be politically forced to be a constituent assembly to compensate for the irresponsibility of the governments.
Â Â  Mr President, the resolution proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs sets 1 May as the date for a positive conclusion to the work of the IGC.
I want to explain the reasons why: immediately afterwards the electoral campaign will begin and, before it begins, the Constitution must have been finalised, first and foremost so as to get the electors to go out and vote â otherwise they will be deluded and will not vote â and therefore submit it to their judgment, which is our democratic duty, our basic law.
For the sake of clarity may I add, taking up the points made by Mr Duff and Mrs Frassoni, that for us the draft Constitution is the only thing on the table.
The eighty-two points referred to by the former Italian President-in-Office of the Council, or the 45 amendments now being referred to, have been examined closely by us: they contain many points which are confusing and ambiguous and take many steps backwards.
There is no consensus on them â at least not in the European Parliament â and I ask you, Mr President, to give that serious consideration.
Â Â  Mr President, I am acting in this Chamber as the spokesman for pensioners and old people throughout the whole of Europe, who, once again, have said to me: âWe do not have time to wait for the European Constitution.
We are eighty, ninety, one hundred years old: there is no time!â
So, I would ask the Irish Presidency to bear this in mind or, better still, remind all the other presidents of it.
In particular, if this cannot be done, I would suggest, as an alternative, that more time be given to old people and pensioners.
How?
Given that the President of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, appears to have grown ten years younger â as a result of plastic surgery, it is said â I would ask that all pensioners and old people in Europe be allowed to go down the same route, at the Stateâs expense, so that they can also become ten years younger and have time to wait for the European Council to eventually give us the Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I would also like to congratulate the Irish presidency on its approach and on the method it is taking, which I believe is the right one.
However, my Group is of the strong view that if, through no fault of its own, the Irish presidency does not begin to produce results within a reasonable period of time, it will not be possible for our Parliament to continue with âbusiness as usualâ.
It will become increasingly difficult for us and for many Member States in the Council to act as if this is an issue that can be set to one side for many months and years.
A solution has to be found quickly for reasons that my colleagues have already outlined.
May I also ask the presidency how it intends to find a compromise on the difficult issue of the voting system in the Council?
The overall majority wants the double majority system, yet one or two countries are holding out against it.
How does the presidency intend to bring these countries on board?
What kind of adjustment mechanism or declaration is likely to be used to make this voting system acceptable to these countries?
Â Â  MrÂ President, last year will probably not go down in history as the EUâs most successful.
That is worrying, not only in anticipation of the turn-out at the forthcoming parliamentary election, but also because there is a danger of confidence in the entire European project being undermined.
2004 will therefore need to be a very successful year, as it potentially can be, given the impending historic enlargement and unification of Europe.
It is interesting to observe that the Norwegian Social Democratic politician, ThorbjÃžrn Jagland, has nominated the EU for the Nobel Peace Prize.
A Norwegian, please note.
If this enlarged Europe is to work, irrespective of whether or not we receive the Nobel Prize, there must be clear rules and an orderly way of doing things.
That is why a Constitution needs to be adopted, and it is only fair that people also have their say about such a Constitution in conjunction with the parliamentary election.
It is unacceptable for certain countries not to wish to accept these rules but, instead, to want to proceed off their own bat.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can no doubt feel how much good will is directed towards you in this House.
If it were just up to you and ourselves, we should have this Constitution ready as soon as possible.
I hope that you can use all your diplomatic sleight of hand also to convince your friends in the Council of the urgency of the matter.
Â Â  Mr President in Office of the Council, given your familiarity with the text of the Convention, I would like you to tell me if, in all honesty, you are aware of a more complete, more appropriate text serving as a basis for a successful conclusion than the text of the Draft Convention?
I ask this question as you, like me, are well acquainted with the Draft Convention.
I should also be grateful if you could enlighten me with regard to a question before us today â and not only here today, but also elsewhere â the famous Naples text of which so much is spoken and written.
What exactly do we mean by âthe Naples textâ?
Is it the text of the Council of Naples that was on the table in Naples or what remains of it after being sifted through the Brussels Summit?
I should like you to clarify these two points for us with frankness and honesty.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, most of my colleagues have talked about the wonderful Europe, or about the Europe that should become a little more wonderful.
I am going to talk about the despicable, vile, revolting Europe, the Europe that Mr de Villepin talked about in Moscow two days ago, the Europe that says nothing about an open war in Chechnya.
Ten days ago, having had enough of this silence, I started a hunger strike, not to ask for the moon, not out of deadly desires or anorexia, as Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne said.
I think that it is our Europe that has deadly desires, the Europe that is doing nothing about Chechnya.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you, and the Commission, one small thing.
We have Article 14(3) of the EC Treaty, which allows the European Union to create blacklists of people who cannot enter European Union territory.
However, it also allows the creation of white lists, in other words lists enabling people, in this case, Chechens, to move around and live in European Union territory in order to highlight their peopleâs cause, the cause of a people who have suffered genocide.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if, during your Presidency, with the help of MrÂ Vitorino, you could get this reform adopted, I would be very grateful.
Â Â  Mr Dupuis, your political point is important, but we are discussing the draft Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Irish presidency has the chance to deliver on the great promise â made to the public ten years ago â that the European Union would become deeper before it was enlarged.
We in this House advocate that this constitution be brought to completion, before 1 May if at all possible, but at any rate hand in hand with enlargement and prior to the European elections.
I would also be interested to know what is still left for you to negotiate, and I urge you to stick as closely as possible to the Convention text.
Mr Berlusconi never told us what the 82 topics were on which agreement was reached in Naples; perhaps they could be made public some time.
I believe that the voting in the Council â this dual majority â must remain fundamental, as it is meant to facilitate decisions instead of more blockages.
That is what your benchmark should be, and if the constitution does not come to pass, we face the threat of a two-speed Europe, which is what we do not want.
Â Â  Mr President, as someone who is at least a quarter Irish, I welcome Irelandâs presidency.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is right: the British Conservatives do not mourn the demise of the European Union constitutional project and we give thanks for Spanish and Polish intransigence.
As a document it was far too centralising and federalist in content for our taste, far too long and both prescriptive and inflexible.
We say âRIPâ.
However, I hope that Irelandâs historic relations with the United States will serve to promote, if not a full, free trade EU-USA agreement â now that the WTO, post-Cancun, is fatally wounded â at least a common economic space for trade in goods and services, particularly financial services.
Much more also needs to be done to implement the Lisbon agenda, as we see Germany now saddled by a deep recession.
This is not helped by an overvalued euro and a one-size-fits-all monetary policy.
With the Commission now taking it to court over the breaches of the stability and growth pact, Germany is effectively hoisted by its own petard.
With enlargement, these six months will be great ones.
I wish the Irish presidency all the luck for which its people are so famous.
Â Â  â Mr President, we often talk about people washing their hands of the matter.
These words do not apply in this case, however, because, although they tried, the matter has not been washed away.
In spite of the Intergovernmental Conference, the draft Constitution produced by the Convention is still on the table, amongst other things because of the impetus given by this House and words such as those spoken by its President, Mr Cox, last Monday in Madrid, demanding that the IGC finish its work and finish it properly, in time â in other words â for the European elections and â why not? â before the end of this legislature.
Well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
I would ask the Irish Presidency to support, and place its confidence in, the process; but also to demand that work be done, â and, moreover, be done publicly and transparently â on the draft Convention and not on mysterious compromises and shady deals that are incomprehensible or that amount to retrograde steps.
Bilateral contacts may be useful, but the IGC is a body which must act jointly, debate and reach agreements on a final consensus.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to take up the old phrase used by Mr Poettering during his contribution to this debate: âwhere there is a will, there is a wayâ.
In this particular case, where there is a political will, a way can be found.
That is the reality as far as this constitutional treaty is concerned.
Members are aware, as I am, that the prize to be won in this debate, a constitutional treaty which is lucid and clear, even visionary, involving all the people of Europe, is a formidable prize.
The European people and the governments of the Member States in working together have indeed shown that Europe is capable of doing formidable things.
A huge amount of work has already been done and the Irish presidency is fully aware of this.
Many Members have asked about the particular text and its starting point.
The reality of all negotiations is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.
We are working day and night to bring about the political will.
On a humorous note, Mr Fatuzzo pointed out that we are all getting older.
Indeed, he is quite right: none of us are getting any younger.
He also suggested that we should offer plastic surgery to old-age pensioners.
As you know Mr President, Ireland is very famous for non-cash benefits to our OAPs â free travel, free television, free phone, free electricity and so on. We have not yet given consideration to free plastic surgery, but Mr Fatuzzo's point is well taken.
I am very grateful to this House for its good wishes.
They will be of great assistance to the presidency in encouraging the leaders of governments who have difficulties in this matter to take those few extra steps.
The prize is a formidable one, it would be marvellous if we could attain it sooner rather than later.
Â Â  Like the best plastic surgeons, Minister, thank you for those uplifting remarks!
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I am going to disappoint Mr Poettering by speaking on behalf of the Commission, in place of Mr Barnier.
But that is the price of collegiality.
I endorse everything that Mr Barnier said in his speech.
I would just like to clarify the Commissionâs position.
We consider the basis on which to work to be the Convention text and we think that on certain points, the Naples text clarified the Convention text.
While remaining faithful to the Conventionâs proposals, we can draw out positive trends on which we need to work.
However, certain aspects of the Naples text, and above all some of the bilateral negotiations that took place between Naples and the European Council in Brussels, reveal retrograde steps in very sensitive areas, such as budgetary powers or the scope of application of the qualified majority.
These steps back do not deserve any support from the Commission and we do not in any way consider them to be a negotiable result.
Indeed, as MrÂ Roche said, nothing is agreed until the whole thing has been agreed.
There are also parallel initiatives, however, that have been taken following Naples that deserve our agreement.
I will take the example of the agreement on defence.
Defence is a fundamental point and one of the major areas of development for the future of the EU.
The Commission welcomes the agreement that was achieved on defence at the Intergovernmental Conference, including the content of the protocol that was discussed following the conclave in Naples.
The example of defence is a very good one.
It is not about building a two-speed Europe on the basis of the agreement on defence.
The agreement reached in such a sensitive area as defence shows that we need to incorporate this agreement into the constitution as a whole and ensure an overall agreement on the constitution, including the defence dimension.
This is why we will continue to support the efforts of the Irish Presidency to secure an agreement on the European Constitution as quickly as possible and with as little delay as possible.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
I have received two motions for resolution to wind up the debate.(1)
The vote will be tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the Council statement on the Members' Statute.
Â Â  Mr President, at its meeting on 26Â January 2004, the Council examined the draft decision on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
The discussion was based on the text as voted by Parliament on 3 and 4 June 2003, and on its subsequent resolution voted on 17 December 2003.
In light of the request of Parliament that the Council respond as a matter of urgency to its resolution of 17 December, the presidency ensured that the matter was ready for consideration by ministers at the first available opportunity â last weekâs Council meeting.
Qualified majority support is, as Members will be aware, required for all Articles of the draft Statute with the exception of Article 12 which, in the consolidated text, deals with taxation, and that, of course, requires unanimity.
The presidency's approach, therefore, was to ascertain if a qualified majority existed on all aspects of the proposal other than taxation and â if that was the case â to reconfirm that the Council unanimously approved the taxation elements, an integral part of the overall proposal.
In the interests of full transparency, I want to clarify that the basis on which the presidency invited Council to take a decision was that the proposed salary level for MEPs would be 50% of the salary of a Judge at the Court of Justice at the time of the relevant Parliament resolution â EUR 8Â 670 a month.
The presidencyâs objective was to secure political agreement on the draft Statute.
Our approach has been clear all along.
In his speech to the Parliament on 14Â January 2004, the Taoiseach underlined the importance the presidency attached to the Members' Statute, welcomed the Parliamentâs vote in December 2003 and said that we would do all in our power as Presidency-in-Office to deliver a positive outcome.
In presenting the matter to the Council this week, the presidency restated in some detail its approach and its assessment of the situation.
While it was evident that most members of the Council could support the package, believing that the Parliament had responded to the concerns of the Council, four members of the Council expressed their continued difficulties with the proposals and could not give their support.
Following this indication of positions, the presidency was obliged to conclude that the requisite support for the draft Statute, in accordance with the terms of Article 190(5) of the Treaty, was not available.
It was therefore not necessary to test whether unanimity could be confirmed on the taxation elements.
The presidency undertook to report the outcome to Parliament.
I am availing of the opportunity to do so today.
It is important to be clear on one point in particular: the presidency spared no effort to ensure that Council would take an informed decision.
Intensive preparatory work was undertaken in advance of the discussions by ministers.
Clarification on particular areas of concern to Member States was sought from the Parliament and was, in our view, forthcoming.
In all of this, I would like to acknowledge the assistance and support the presidency received from this Parliament and in particular from you personally, President Cox.
Clearly I would have preferred to bring a different and more positive message to this House today.
Unfortunately that is not possible.
I feel it is important that, as presidency, I give you a clear and unambiguous statement of where matters stand.
I should like to thank you once again, Mr Cox, for all the support and effort you put into this very important venture.
Â Â  Although we do not propose to take a debate on this matter, I hope the House will permit me to make a brief response on its behalf.
First, I should like through you to thank the Irish presidency for the determined effort you have made in this regard, and for the integrity of purpose which you have brought to this task.
As you reported, the presidency was unable to secure a majority.
This is not a failure of the presidency; it may well be a failure of the Council, but one needs to distinguish between these things.
I regret the lost opportunity that your statement indicates.
I should like to point out - in relation to the work done by my predecessors and myself, and especially the unceasing work done by our rapporteur Mr Rothley and colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - that this is a very frustrating outcome from the point of view of the majority of this House after a long process of engagement between Parliament and Council, initiated in its most recent form at the Cardiff Summit during the British presidency in 1998.
I express a personal disappointment in this regard and I believe that we in this House have acted in entirely good faith throughout our negotiations and our engagement with the Council in this regard.
It is, I am bound to say, difficult to conclude an agreement with another instance of authority in the Union when the ground shifts and the goalposts are moved.
We believed that the majority in this House last December had sought to reconcile the various points of view indicated in good faith by all of the actors at that stage.
I believe this failure is, I regret to say, symptomatic of a Europe that is exhibiting a greater capacity for dysfunction than function on a key number of constitutional questions.
I hope we can rediscover the spirit of Europe and not what blocked this important - and, in its own small way - constitutional initiative.
I thank you again, Minister, for the work the presidency has done and again let me underline a strong personal view that the inability to deliver a positive result here today which you have conveyed to us is no reflection on the determined effort and the high integrity of purpose which the presidency and other presidencies in the past have brought to this important task.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not want to open a debate on this matter, but as you rightly said, this is a matter of constitutional concern.
Moreover, it is part of the legislative procedure.
It would be very useful for the House to obtain information from the presidency of the Council regarding the reasons behind and the justifications for the four previously mentioned governments' opposition to the Statute.
We could then, perhaps, make progress.
At this moment we do not know the reservations these governments have.
Â Â  If the Council is in a position, in due course, formally to enlighten us on this matter, I am sure we would appreciate such enlightenment.
I am bound to tell you that, for those who have followed the dossier as closely as I have, the failure to achieve a majority on this occasion was a question of mixed motives.
Perhaps we can, at a later date, have a fuller explanation.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on competition policy.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution presented today is based on the debate of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs held during the annual report on competition policy for 2002.
I want to give my sincere thanks to MrÂ Della Vedova for the important work he has done.
Also, Mr President, I want to say how much I appreciate and how vital for me was the excellent cooperation with the parliamentary committees, primarily the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The proposed resolution does, in my opinion, accurately reflect that committeeâs support for the Commissionâs competition policy.
I should like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the stage that competition policy is now at and give you an idea of the direction we want to take in the immediate future.
As you know, during the current Commissionâs term of office the reform of all competition rules has been started and, to a large extent, completed.
The common aim underlying the various aspects of that reform has been to make our control procedures more effective and eliminate superfluous red tape, without undermining the substance of the competition rules.
I believe that this can help to increase competitiveness, growth and employment in Europe.
I should like to say a few words on each of the three main areas with which competition policy is concerned: antitrust, concentrations, State aids.
In the antitrust sector, at the end of 2002, the Council adopted Regulation 1/2003 establishing a new framework for the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty.
This regulation opens up a new chapter in the application of Community competition rules; in fact it is the biggest antitrust reform since 1962 and will enter into force on 1 May 2004.
The following are the two main aspects of the new system: abolishing the notification system in respect of agreements between undertakings and establishing uniform conditions under which undertakings are to operate in the context of the common market.
The application of Community competition rules shall become the norm enabling undertakings to carry out projects in a much simpler manner than happens under the present system where agreements between undertakings are governed not just by Community provisions, but also by 25 national legal systems.
Simultaneously, under the new system undertakings are freed from the onerous burdens of notification and the Commission can concentrate all its resources on pursuing the most serious infringements of the competition rules.
The reform mobilises the full potential of national competition authorities and national courts to contribute to the application of European antitrust regulations.
A network of the 25 national authorities is currently being set up for the purpose of ensuring that tasks are more effectively and more efficiently allocated between the Commission and the national authorities; the Commission shall have the task â which is certainly demanding â of guaranteeing that the regulations are applied in a coherent manner.
I could give much more detail, but I do not intend to do so now.
I should, however, like to stress an aspect of this competition policy which will be proactive, based less on waiting for notifications and more on initiatives taken by the Commission and the national competition authorities; we wanted to give a special role to consumers, who are the ultimate beneficiaries towards whom our competition policy is actually directed, by means of, for example, a number of provisions designed to make consumer associations more involved in investigations into matters concerning competition, whilst also encouraging them to register complaints.
I now come to the second part of our reform, which concerns the control of concentrations.
I should like to point out at the outset that this control is not so interventionist as it might appear to be at first sight.
The Commission certainly has no intention of hindering the restructuring of markets; concentrations are necessary to respond to the challenges of a developing economy.
In fact, if we look at the statistics, we see that since 1990, of more than 2200 concentrations that have been notified, the Commission has blocked only 18: it is therefore an extremely small proportion, but blocking a concentration is of course more newsworthy than authorising it.
The recently adopted reform of the regulation governing concentrations introduces a certain degree of flexibility into the time-limits for examining the operation, strengthens the one-stop-shop principle which is extremely beneficial for undertakings and stipulates that the essential criterion on which operations are to be assessed is that concerned with all types of harmful situations, whether involving the dominant position of a single undertaking or the effects of a situation where there is an oligopoly that could damage consumer interests.
As regards the internal organisation of the Commission, in the area concerned with competition we have introduced a number of fairly radical innovations â which various Members have followed extremely closely and encouraged â including giving greater weight to economic analysis in the assessment of competition cases.
As from September 2003, there has been a new figure, the Chief Competition Economist, operating within the Directorate General for Competition, who is providing a new input into our decision-making procedure in terms of economic analysis.
I now come briefly, Mr President, to the third area on which competition policy is based, that is to say the control of State aids.
Parliament and the Council have repeatedly and rightly insisted that the overall amount of State aids must be reduced and that, at the same time, State aids must be geared more to supporting horizontal objectives than to supporting, often artificially, specific sectors or single undertakings.
As you know, Parliament has supported this move: in July 2001 we established an assessment framework â a score board for State aids â and the latest figures, from last spring, confirmed that there was a trend towards a reduction in the level of aids; when the new figures are issued this April we shall see whether this trend has continued.
As regards State aids, just as I said a few moments ago in relation to antitrust and concentrations, we have attempted to redirect the Commissionâs work towards those activities which are capable of causing most damage to competition in Europe.
We still have an intensive work programme, from now until the end of the present Commissionâs term of office, in relation to the State aids sector, a programme which is focussed on three main aspects: more effective amendments to working methods and procedures; developing simpler methods for dealing with less important cases of aid; reviewing the current substantive regulations governing State aids.
Work on procedural reform is already quite advanced: we are in the process of preparing a regulation which lays down the implementing provisions of the Councilâs procedural rules and we want to develop new instruments for simplifying the treatment of those aids which do not raise any significant competition problems.
As a follow-up to the Commissionâs Green Paper on services of general economic interest, in which this Parliament has shown such great interest, major priority will be given to clarifying the control mechanism governing the payment of compensation for costs associated with the supply of services of general economic interest.
I shall stop now in order not to overrun the time allocated to me, but not before saying a few very brief words, Mr President, on what we have done during this time, once again with Parliamentâs support, as regards the international dimension of competition policy, both by further developing certain bilateral cooperation relations between antitrust authorities â primarily with those in the US â and by setting up with other partners the first multilateral body on competition, the International Competition Network.
We are hopeful that in this sector the governance of globalisation is flourishing, and not withering away, as is unfortunately happening in other sectors.
I am, of course, available to listen to and, where necessary, comment on the speeches that follow.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Commissioner Monti for this report, which, as he stressed, follows on from the work done by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Most of your speech, Commissioner, you devoted to the technical work of reviewing competitiveness and to improving it.
I believe, though, that where we have to exert more influence is on the issue of what must be done to make Europe more competitive.
Reading the Commissionâs report on competitiveness in 2003, it is quite clear to me that the businesses that achieved high levels of production growth were those in which organisational improvements go hand in hand with investment in new technologies, and especially in information and communications technology.
What this means is that we have to be quicker off the mark, more flexible, more mobile, more industrious, more willing to embrace reform, starting by becoming more European in our thinking and then becoming more open to the world.
We must, then, give all the participants in the internal market a level playing field, and do away with whatever obstructs the internal market and impairs its competitiveness.
We have to make the internal market an internal market; our problems with competences in the areas of fiscal policy, labour law and working times mean that it is not one.
Because social systems are a matter for the Member States alone, the EU, in all these policy areas, can do no more than beg and implore them to do the necessary homework.
This means that it is important that we should now recognise the connections between the quality of the internal market, the EUâs ability to compete, the fulfilment of the Lisbon targets and the achievement of growth and job creation.
Underlying all of them are our social market economy and stability.
I urge you to waste no time in presenting the Member States with your list of requirements, with clear figures and timescales showing how we can make Europe more competitive and what homework the Member States have to do.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would be quite happy to agree with the points Mr Karas has just made, for there is little to be objected to in what he said, but, nevertheless, if we carry on debating with each other much longer â as the members of the committee already have been â very profound differences will keep on cropping up here and there, and I think we have to say something about these in order to understand each other a bit better.
What is clear is that competition policy is an important and indispensable instrument, enabling the European internal market to function and facilitating ever-deeper integration, so that the gains in terms of prosperity and efficiency resulting from a large and integrated market can be put to good use.
I called competition policy an instrument, and that is what it is, rather than an end in itself; if it were an end in itself, it would very rapidly degenerate into something purely ideological.
Competition policy is an instrument that has to be subject to social and civil policy objectives and must help achieve them.
The fact is, then, that we do not live and move in a free market economy, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairsâ draft resolution puts it, but in an environmentally-responsible and social market economy.
Mr Karas, you have just used the term âsocial market economyâ, but you voted against it in the committee.
It is astonishing how the Conservatives and Christian Democrats in this House have refused to talk in terms of the social market economy, and I can tell the Members on the other side of the House that they can correct their groupâs embarrassing mistake in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in tomorrowâs plenary vote, by voting in favour of our amendments.
Although we are in favour of tight controls on mergers, their strength must lie in their taking into account their effects on society and on employment and in their giving workers and those who represent their interests a say in decision-making processes.
That is a suggestion for the Commissioner.
We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are also in favour of tight controls on subsidies, but subsidies can be eminently justifiable if they lead to modernisation, improved competitiveness, innovation, sustainable growth and the creation of long-term employment.
What I would like to see is even greater attention being given, when assessing subsidies, to the effects â including the positive ones â on the whole chain of exploitation within which the subsidy is made.
We have already had a whole series of debates on this.
My time is running out, so I will end with a question to the Commissioner.
Commissioner Monti, you have now become acquainted with our resolution â from the last part-session in Strasbourg â on services of general interest, in which we spoke out plainly in favour of codecision by this House on a legal framework, which means that it cannot be regarded as assent only to a block exemption regulation â which is the impression I got from the Commissionâs reaction.
We have also asked whether there is to be a follow-up within the life of this Parliament, which has not much longer left to run.
We cannot have any more long-drawn-out discussions, and so I would like to know how work on this within the Commission is progressing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I wish to do as the Commissioner did and note that his area is one of the most important for European consumers.
We have a number of current issues that, in actual fact, have a very great deal of bearing upon consumers: those of competition within the car sector, the decision concerning Microsoft and intellectual property rights.
We know that, in October 2002, the new regulation, with exemptions for sales and service, came into force within the motor vehicle sector.
Our intention was that it should increase competition and give consumers more.
Unfortunately, it has had quite the opposite effect in the country I know best, namely Finland.
