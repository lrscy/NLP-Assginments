These are all the more evident in view of the simultaneous launch of new strategic instruments such as the European Research Council.
It should also be noted that the financial resources of the Seventh Framework Programme were cut by 30% following the agreement on the Financial Perspective.
In view of the limitations on funding for research at the European level, we need to ensure that the European Institute of Technology will not attract resources that would otherwise have been destined for other activities in the sector.
The funding should be added as a supplement to the current Financial Perspective and the new resources should come from various sources - Community, national, regional and private.
Firstly, a transparent selection procedure needs to be ensured for the management committee, in which the Commission should at the right moment be called on to refer to the other institutions.
In addition, the European Parliament and the Council must be able to express their consent in relation to the strategic priorities of the European Institute of Technology prior to final approval by the Commission.
Finally, the Institute's accounts should be fully visible to the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors.
I believe that only after a comprehensive review of a pilot programme on the basis of an independent external assessment will it be possible to establish whether it is advisable to set up the European Institute of Technology as a permanent Community body or whether Europe could gain more benefit by directing the funding towards other Community activities relating to research and development.
Mr President, it is a shame that the Commission launched the European Institute of Technology project without first securing funding for it.
The Committee on Culture and Education approved the proposal after clarifying certain points, such as the award of training qualifications. This will in fact remain under the competence of the Member States and the partner higher education institutions.
These training qualifications will bear the EIT label as a European mark of excellence, although the training qualification will aim to take account of the diversity of the higher education landscape in the European Union.
In addition, the EIT must make a positive contribution towards student mobility. In this respect, the issue of the transferability of grants still needs to be resolved.
I am asking Members to vote in favour of Amendment 36 to encourage student mobility.
Did you know that only 3% of European university students have taken advantage of mobility?
The EIT is a fascinating future project for cooperation, innovation and research, and the private sector will help ensure that higher education institutions are involved. This will be a real challenge for the future for European competitiveness.
I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, and I would like to thank the Commission and the German Presidency, who really helped to make progress on the text.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Mr President, the idea that was floated in 2005, of setting up a European Institute of Technology, is in every way deserving of support.
The proposed structure of the network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities has a chance to become an excellent stimulator of innovation throughout the EU.
Providing a proper legal basis and consequently enabling permanent funding of the Institute was my priority as draftsman of the committee asked for an opinion under the Committee on Legal Affairs.
In this context, conferring on the Institute the status of an agency on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, and specifically part C of it and Article 47, is of immeasurable importance, as is the Committee's proposal concerning the increase in the margin in section 1A in the budget for 2007-2013, guaranteeing the Institute EUR 309 million.
The birth of the EIT is especially important for the scientific milieu in the new part of the united Europe, which has an inherent vast and so far unexploited potential.
I therefore warmly support the decision of the authorities in WrocÅaw who are seeking to get the Governing Board or one of the knowledge communities to set up their offices in the city, where as many as 140 000 students are studying.
Finally may I convey my warmest congratulations and thanks to Reino Paasilinna for excellent cooperation, and my congratulations on a superb report.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) Mr President.
Our brief began with the report by Wim Kok.
His message was clear.
We were responsible for guiding the Lisbon Strategy towards its most important objectives and for giving it the appropriate content.
Together we devised the Seventh Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.
We thereby gave a European dimension to research and enterprise.
However, we were uncertain as to whether this was enough to increase European innovation.
We were aware that there was a shortage of around 100 000 engineers and researchers in Europe and that we could not stimulate innovation per se merely by direct incentives and projects.
We still had no a link with the universities and thus no human resources management.
This deficiency is covered by the EIT.
Its added value is the link it establishes between the research sector and the academic and business world.
The research and academic groups which will become members of the knowledge and innovation community within the EIT will have to demonstrate their excellence.
The EIT mark, which participants will be able to use, will therefore also be an external mark of the group's quality.
I expect that participants will use the label to their advantage as a label of their quality.
At the same time, the EIT mark should also assist potential business customers.
They must provide the critical mass of appropriately trained employees and respond to short- and long-term problems with research and development projects.
The EIT mark will facilitate the choice of partners or managers for training and research projects.
The provision of appropriate funds for the EIT's operation has been an awkward sticking point in previous negotiations.
We believe that we will be successful in securing public funds but that is only a small part.
It will soon also be the turn of business, of the private sector, to respond to globalisation with the same commitment we have shown.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would, of course, first of all like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Paasilinna, on this laborious work.
It is truly a very difficult birth - not just the report to this Parliament, but also the Institute as such.
In fact, it is sad that the EIT has to begin such an important job with so little enthusiasm, particularly on the part of some Council members and perhaps on the part of the Commission too.
I fully agree with the essence of the Commissioner's comments, even those concerning the KICs.
As Mr Paasilinna, whom I warmly congratulate on his work, has also proposed, we need a limited number in order to assemble any pilot schemes at all.
This is absolutely right.
I hope that the schemes will also produce positive results.
As regards financing, I am also in agreement.
It was very frivolous of some Council members to say: you want to do something new, alright, but nothing will come from new funding.
Simply take the money that is available to you in the budget.
There should be no frivolity where something new has to be created.
The fact that we are essentially using research funds is totally acceptable, but it is absolutely right to seek new funding opportunities, for this project as well as for Galileo for example, partly in the context of surplus budgeted funds, funds that have not been spent, and partly with new commitments by the individual Member States.
One important point - and Mr Paasilinna has also brought this up - is that the EIT and the KICs have helped us in holding on to, as well as winning back, high-calibre employees in Europe.
We know from many analyses that people are leaving not necessarily because of finance, but because of opportunity.
If we can recreate new opportunities through these institutions so that high-calibre employees stay in Europe or come back from America or other countries, then a substantial contribution will have been made to Europe once again becoming a hub for new technologies.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Paasilinna for his very effective cooperation.
It was a very difficult piece of work, but you were always prepared to cooperate.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for the tenaciousness he has shown over many months and the loyalty he has shown to the project.
You will see, Commissioner, that your persistence will pay off in the end, despite all the resistance you have experienced, right from the very beginning, especially from the scientific world.
Since President Barroso was obviously inspired by the MIT and sowed the idea of creating a European institute of technology, this idea, this project, has been transformed.
Today it looks different from the original version.
This is just as well, because at the outset we were still somewhat vague as to the structure.
A European project has now emerged and something new has evolved.
We are a continent of ideas.
We know that.
We are very good at research; we are very good at science; but where we have difficulty is in converting these wonderful ideas that have revolutionised the world into tangible products.
That is our problem.
Therefore, when it comes to defining research as financial investment in knowledge, innovation would be the reverse process.
Out of knowledge comes a product, a licence, a patent, which turns back into money again.
This is our weakness in Europe and it is precisely here that the EIT, the European Institute of Technology, can help.
It goes without saying that this regulation text is not an unqualified success.
This we can say straight away.
But it is a good compromise and it is now up to us to take it to the people and particularly to clarify it with those involved.
The rapporteurs have been working very well together.
We should not lose sight of the great objective in its entirety because the target audience of this EIT is small and medium-sized enterprises specifically.
The aim is also to access knowledge at university institutions, but it mainly involves this networking process, which is not working so well for us.
I would like to respond to a few controversial points.
The Commission is proposing that it should set the EIT's strategic agenda itself.
To this I would say we should not be doing so.
There must be autonomy here, too, as for the European Research Council.
Otherwise the private sector has little chance.
The question of intellectual property then needs to be dealt with in such a way that it also becomes attractive for a medium-sized enterprise to participate in the EIT.
Of course we need an EIT, which is a brand and has a brand name.
We want a strong EIT and we do not just want a pilot project either because that would deter many investors, and we need investors.
Let me say something else about financing.
I have been personally addressing the subject of the 'Lisbonisation' of our budget for some time now.
This means we can 'Lisbonise' the large budget that we have in the sector of agricultural and regional policy and we are evidently at a point where we are talking about the subject of Galileo and EIT being lumped together.
This is already coming very close to 'Lisbonisation', namely that we are investing in innovation.
Therefore: let us get on with it.
I call upon Parliament to endorse this compromise tomorrow with a large majority.
Congratulations to you once again, Mr Paasilinna, on your work.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, it is excellent that, despite earlier doubts, we now have the opportunity for constructive comments to be made in Parliament on the subject of the establishment of a European Institute of Technology.
I would very much like this initiative to be a truly European one.
I think we should place emphasis on the principle of an even geographical distribution of the Knowledge and Information Communities.
We should try to ensure that European funding of this project is a priority for a number of reasons, not least the weakness of patent protection in Europe.
We will not be able to shift this burden onto private business.
Europe needs this institution.
The best evidence of this is the lively response from businesspeople, local authorities and the scientific community in Lower Silesia.
Before the legislative procedure for this has been completed, we already have a specially set up company, EIT+, we have a willingness to involve structural funds, we have letters of intent from the largest businesses in Lower Silesia, and we also have 35 000 signatures of people who live in Lower Silesia, who are calling for the Institute or institutions forming part of it to be located in WrocÅaw.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we are really sorry, but this proposal is not serious.
Once again Europe wants to act but cannot.
The Greens were in favour of the Institute project, but of a real project, and the proposals that are on the table are inadequate and incoherent.
After the negotiations, the question of funding has still not been resolved.
The European proposal of EUR 308 million is clearly inadequate and, moreover, it is a much, much lower figure than what the European Commission itself proposed based on its studies.
We therefore have before us an invitation to gobble up and weaken other European projects such as the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
If the European Commission really wants to establish the Institute, as we do, the negotiations will have to be restarted on the financial perspective and a real budget will have to be created, a large budget of more than EUR 2 billion, which is what is needed.
In short, if we want to promote research and technology, we need to back it, we cannot give cannon fodder to the eurosceptics, as we are doing with such an incoherent project.
There are also problems with the content.
We have removed the ceiling on administrative expenditure; we have required a ceiling for all projects, but here we have removed it.
We have also removed one of the main issues of life in general - climate change - which was going to be one of the issues, one of the main ones in fact, and has been removed.
This is very shocking, very shocking.
In short, here we have a project that obviously has no ambition, no money behind it and does not have a coherent project, which we deeply regret.

on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, adding an institute of technology to stand with the existing universities sounds a good idea, but that is not what is on offer.
It is proposed to set up an institution with the Commission vetting the board, which then selects the knowledge and innovation centres with which it will at first work but which it will, in time, subsume unto itself.
It will even issue qualifications bearing the EU logo, with no reference to the universities of which it has made use.
Surely, this is about innovation, but you do not get that by wishing it.
Especially this one, by encroaching on universities, will stifle enterprise, not promote it.
If you want to encourage innovation, look to individuals coming through universities.
Look to individuals in the SMEs, and offer resources to help them develop and promote their ideas.
If you are suggesting a network to enhance and spread ideas, do not bother.
This Community already communicates across the world.
Good ideas soon become international.
For goodness' sake, drop this attempt to harmonise universities and consider the value of the varying contributions made by these different institutions.
If you have money to spare, use it to support innovators.
They work alone or in concert with small teams.
Europeans like Archimedes, Newton, Pasteur, Ehrlich, RÃ¶ntgen, Fermi, Teller and Watson-Watt were brought on by no institute.
They just needed time and space to think and conduct research.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the few areas in which we recognise that the European Union can offer real added value compared with national initiatives is research.
That is why we are in favour of establishing a European Institute of Technology.
We also share the concerns, or questions, of the rapporteur.
The future EIT must be complementary and must not compete with initiatives already carried out at European level in the field of research and innovation.
Above all, it must not drain the budget allocated to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development - which is already meagre enough - but should receive additional funding.
In view of its design, which consists of bringing public and private partners together, it would be much better if its resources came mainly from private funding and from its operating revenue.
This would be a sign of its usefulness and effectiveness.
Furthermore, the European Union should provide the impetus, rather than create yet another bureaucratic organisation that is a burden on European taxpayers.
For these reasons, it seems that the EIT label is a better idea than the possibility of the Institute issuing its own degrees and diplomas.
On this point also, the EU must offer added value and not try to replace what already exists.
Finally, this fear of pointless duplication, as well as financial and functional competition with other programmes, has led us to support an evaluation at an earlier stage than that proposed by the Commission, although the frequency of subsequent evaluations, extended to every seven years, seems too long.
If our fears materialise, we would have to act swiftly to make the necessary adjustments, or even substantial amendments, to the regulation. Alternatively, even though this is not the norm for Europe, we would have to put an end to the experiment.
Mr President, here we go again: more posturing, another hubristic attempt to emulate America.
The US has the dollar, so we must have the euro; the US has a GPS system, so we must have Galileo; the US has MIT, so we must have EIT.
We have perhaps forgotten that MIT is privately financed, not state funded, which is a key reason for its success.
Great academic institutions grow from the bottom up, not from the top down.
They do not spring up from the ground fully formed at the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen.
No one questions the need for innovation and research in Europe, but this is the wrong way to do it.
State-imposed solutions will not work.
The proposed EIT will duplicate and conflict with existing EU programmes, like the Framework Programme for Research, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the Lifelong Learning Programme.
This proposal exists outside the current Financial Perspective and its funding is by no means assured.
No wonder that established and excellent academic institutions in Europe are concerned that they may lose funding, they may lose key staff and they may lose research projects to the EIT.
I can well understand President Barroso thinking of his legacy, but we must not let his legacy damage European universities and research facilities.
Mr President, we need to support innovations and research all over Europe.
That is a crucial task for business life, universities and research institutes, Member States and the Union.
It will require much more funding for research and innovations.
That is why I would like to underline what the Commissioner stated earlier - that, regarding the EIT, the key issue now is the financing and funding.
This is because we need to ensure that, not only is the EIT funded, but also that it is not funded and getting its finances via money that otherwise would have financed research and innovation in other programmes and projects.
I think this cannot be underlined too much, as the funding for the EIT must come from other items in the budget than those which today contribute to the efforts of innovations and research in the Seventh Framework Programme, in the CIP or other items under the 1A heading.
If we can manage to do that, then we can manage to bring additional resources to innovations and research in Europe and can contribute to the innovations.
From the perspective of my group, I would like to underline that that is the crucial test that the Commission has to live up to and we need to contribute to because, if so, we can all contribute to Europe with more and better innovations.
If we succeed with this, we will succeed with innovations.
(FR) Mr President, the rationale behind the European Institute of Technology is a fair one: namely that research is central to any economic progress.
Research depends on scientists educated at leading universities.
Universities must be able to count on significant and foreseeable public and private funding.
The European Union is lagging behind in all of these areas.
Our funds for research are, on average across the EU, way below the public - and especially private - research budgets of Japan and the US.
The EU - population 500 million - employs 1.2 million scientists.
The US - population 300 million - has 1.3 million.
On average in Europe, public and private funding for higher education represents 1.3% of GDP, compared with 3.3% in the US.
Europe spends less than EUR 10 000 per student, the US more than EUR 35 000.
However, all is not a bed of roses on the other side of the Atlantic.
Out of 2 500 universities, only around 100 are truly excellent and these share EUR 32 billion each year of research funding.
This figure should be compared with the paltry funds proposed for the EIT.
If our governments do not set aside more money for research, the EIT and other schemes will fall by the wayside.
Each year, the US produces some 40 000 doctors.
One third come from the rest of the world.
In physical and life sciences, the proportion of non-Americans is more than 50%.
Why is this the case?
Because the US still believes in scientific progress.
Where Europeans are quick to see risks and hide fearfully behind the precautionary principle, Americans see new opportunities.
This applies to biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, even when it comes to tackling climate change. While Europe focuses on regrets, the US extols technological and scientific progress.
Fear of the future and fear of progress are at the root of Europe's failings.
Without a change in attitude, Mr President, the EIT will not make any difference.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to express the hope that the Knowledge and Innovation Communities that make up the European Institute of Technology will be spread evenly across the European Union.
This is particularly important because the Institute should be an instrument that mobilises the whole of the Community uniformly, and should boost competitiveness and technological progress, with the corollary of economic development for all the European Union, not just the old Member States.
I would also like to use this opportunity to give my firm support to the Polish proposal to locate the offices of the Institute's Governing Board in WrocÅaw.
This is a rapidly developing city on the boundary between old and new Europe, on the borders of four states: Poland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.
It is a city with some excellent higher education institutions and nearly 150 000 students.
Both the national authorities in Poland and the WrocÅaw local authorities, as well as the Polish academic world, are fully prepared to put this task into effect.
I would like to stress that locating the Institute's Governing Board and the Knowledge and Innovation Community in WrocÅaw will not in any way clash with the fundamental criterion for the EIT - the criterion of excellence; in fact quite the contrary.
Polish research and academia is at a high European level, and in many instances is leading the world.
The Institute must become an instrument that promotes higher levels of innovation throughout the European Union.
This is the only way for us to have a chance to meet the challenges of a global knowledge-based economy.
(PL) Mr President, before the European Institute of Technology has even been born, its name has already been changed to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
If this is supposed to help it to come into being, I am sure no one will have any objections.
It is worth pointing out that, in parallel to the work going on in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, some important matters have also come before our Budget Committee in connection with the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
It has been agreed that about EUR 400 million will be earmarked for this purpose for next year, and by 2013 the budget will be six times greater than this.
The problem is, though: who do we take from to give to this Institute, since no provision has been made in the seven-year budget; not a single euro has been allotted.
It is as if we were thinking that the Lisbon Strategy, of which this Institute was supposed to form a significant part, is just another piece of paper, and that these are just more politicians' fairy tales.
I mean, the Commission did previously inform the Parliament, formally or informally, of the intention to set up the Institute, and at the same time we did not allocate so much as five euros to it.
This demonstrates a certain lack of compatibility, xxx or even some sort of schizophrenia.
My city of WrocÅaw meets all the criteria to become the headquarters of the Governing Board of a European Institute of Technology.
A decision on this should be taken by the European Commission as soon as possible.
Mr President, surely in modern politics one of the most difficult things for a politician to say - other than 'I was wrong' - is 'let us stop and think again'.
We could do with that in this debate.
I am the first to acknowledge the hard work, in this House and in other places, that has gone into this proposal and into this report, and it is a matter of great regret to me that the end result really does not justify it.
It is a great regret for me personally because I was initially very enthusiastic about this proposal.
I myself sold it to our universities in Scotland, to our SMEs, to various other parties, and I have watched the proposal become increasingly weaker, diluted, muddled, precarious and, increasingly, underfunded.
Surely, we all agree in this Chamber that Europe does not commercialise our research enough.
We have agreed on the need to do something, but 'we must do something; this is something, therefore we must do this' is surely a bad logic, which will result in a bad, artificial, weak EU creation that will not achieve our hopes.
So let us be brave and rip this up and start again, and innovate and research a better EIT for Europe's future.
Mr President, according to legend, the scientists in Los Alamos who developed the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project in the US during the Second World War spoke Hungarian among themselves.
They turned to English only in the presence of Robert Oppenheimer.
Indeed, Edward Teller, E. P. Wigner and Leo Szilard were born in Hungary and they studied in Budapest.
We Hungarians belong to a relatively small nation, but we are proud to have 50 Nobel Prize winners, mostly in the natural sciences.
As our language is isolated, many talented young Hungarians attracted by the natural sciences seek to carry out activities where there are no linguistic barriers.
Our scientists and young researchers, mainly in mathematics, physics, chemistry and in the life sciences, are very respected all over the world.
That is why my country, my compatriots and I are pleased to offer Budapest as a seat of the governing board and a centre of the European Institute of Technology (EIT).
Of course, I urge that the decision on the seat should be taken as soon as possible.
As a new Member State, without the seat of any EU institutions, on the one hand, and with extremely rich experiences in natural sciences, on the other hand, Budapest would serve as an ideal seat of the EIT.
I fully support Mr Paasilinna's report.
We do not need a huge bureaucratic organisation, just a network of the knowledge communities.
An open and transparent selection procedure on a competitiveness basis for such communities is also of high importance.
University research centres and enterprises should cooperate and we have to do our best to involve business in the work of the EIT.
Making the EIT visible by labelling the qualifications added through such knowledge communities is likely to bring further added value.
As regards financing, I do not support the idea of financing the EIT from the common agricultural policy fund, as nobody can foresee the next year's harvest in agriculture.
(FI) Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Paasilinna for an excellent report.
The idea of a European Institute of Technology was only born in the Commission after the EU's multiannual financial framework had already been adopted.
That is the reason why the financing for it was sporadic and its mission statement was vague.
After Parliament's debate the proposal was considerably improved, even if there is still much to clarify.
EU financing is still problematic.
Just as Mrs Å kottovÃ¡ said, most of the financing is assumed to be coming from the Structural Funds and the EU research programmes.
This is not at all obvious, however, because the Member States decide on how the Structural Funds are used according to their own priorities.
Most funding for research is granted for reasons of competition.
Despite the Commission's assurance, the principle of fair competition might be difficult to adhere to when the applicant is someone's 'own baby'.
Financing for the EIT's networks of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) is also, in principle, open.
If funds are to be granted from EU programmes, the KICs should have to provide their own funds as well.
EU budget money cannot be used for that: it has to come from elsewhere.
How this will be done is not clear either.
The amendment to the Financial Perspective proposed by the Commission last week is a partial solution to these problems.
Hopefully things can only get better.
The EU's development into a viable European institution will take hard work.
It cannot be achieved with money alone.
That is why I wish the project success in the future.
(PT) In March 2006 the Council recognised that the European Institute of Technology proposed by President Barroso would represent an important step to fill the gap between higher education, research and innovation.
That is understandable.
Since European research and innovation are known to be inferior to those of North America, it would be fitting to devise instruments enabling us effectively to compete with the United States in this area.
We all know that researchers enjoy much better working conditions and pay in the United States and also that investment in the public sector, in particular linked to the defence industries, universities and the private sector are incomparably higher than those in Europe.
To be able to compete we therefore need a real European engine capable of reaching this goal and that engine needs to be given enough fuel, that is, sufficient budgetary means.
The plan therefore was to identify and select public and private investors, with part coming from the EU's own resources, but Parliament took fright at that suggestion.
It ceased to consider the fundamental objectives, turning its attention to that point, to some extent putting the cart before the horse.
What we should do is give the Council the responsibility for providing the EIT with the necessary means as regards the Union's contribution.
Budgetary temerity and probably some corporate academic interests soured the whole discussion.
If the fundamental questions relating to the launch of the MIT had been dealt with in this way, there would still be no MIT today.
Thus I am very much afraid, Mr President, that when the Commission proposed a high-performance Ferrari, Parliament gave it only a small pedal tricycle.
I shall vote in favour of the resolution, since it is the only one we have, because it is the only one left, but I regret that it did not go much further, which moreover might have entailed a special added value for us, ladies and gentlemen, since the building where we hold our sessions would become the seat of the EIT, thus doing away once and for all with the political, judicial, functional and financial aberration of having to come to Strasbourg every month for these plenary sessions.
(PL) Mr President, I hope I will be able to speak for two minutes.
I congratulate the rapporteur on a balanced report and I thank the Commissioner for two and a half years of hard work.
This project has changed considerably in comparison with what it was in the beginning, and the changes have been very positive.
Competitiveness and innovation in Europe have perhaps been the most important issues for each successive presidency in recent times.
And what we are talking about is very much that future competitiveness of Europe that the appearance of the European Institute of Technology is meant to promote.
I have four points to make on this subject.
Firstly, the European Union already has a Joint Research Centre, it has its own Research Council, and it is currently instigating joint technology initiatives.
It is very important that we do not allow European science and innovation in the European market to become fragmented.
These institutions must not just begin working for themselves, in isolation.
This is also a very important task for the European Commission.
Secondly, we must bear in mind that the institutions to which I have referred cannot erase the differences that exist between them.
So let us not forget that the European Institute of Technology is meant to serve the full triangle of knowledge.
Particular emphasis needs to be placed on cooperation in education/innovation, since no European institution is working on this de facto.
This means that we have to promote education for innovation, as research is, after all, not required for every specific innovation.
Sometimes a good engineer is all that is needed.
Thirdly, I support the creation of an institute, but all these scientific and research and development institutions will not be able to resolve every problem, as they only serve to pump innovation into the economy.
Care needs to be taken to ensure that this mechanism works in another direction, and that depends on whether our market is open, whether we shall have sensibly restricted public assistance.
In other words, it depends on how the common and free European market is going to function.
And fourthly, science, student exchanges, exchanges of competent engineers and innovations have always been the basis of integration between peoples and countries.
The same can be the case now, and that is why institutions linked to the European Institute of Technology should be located in the new Member States.
I would urgently appeal for this to be the case.
(ES) Mr President, congratulations Mr Paasilinna, on your excellent work.
It has not been easy.
A great deal of effort has been made to design a viable institute, inspired by other models of excellence, but with the necessary adaptation to the complexity and diversity of Europe.
The result means that I can now express my support for the EIT, insofar as it is a new and promising instrument for integrating the three axes of knowledge: education, research and innovation, which we hope will add value to the existing instruments.
The EIT should also be a focus of excellence, based on a model of integrating the research institutions with companies, which we hope will serve as a catalyst for a culture of innovation, which is so essential for improving our competitiveness.
The funding of the EIT is the big agreement still to be reached.
I agree that the initial funding and its governing structure should come from the Community budget, and that both the public contributions from Member States and the private contributions should be used to develop innovation and knowledge communities that are in line with the Institute's priorities.
(NL) Mr President, we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have, through excellent collaboration and consultation, added innovation to the name European Institute of Innovation and Technology, as it now reads.
This is excellent.
Commissioner Figel has also led me to understand that the Commission would also like to adopt this.
Indeed, it is all about introducing (a) education, academics, engineers and (b) innovation from knowledge institutions and companies onto the market.
The knowledge-skill-till chain is encountering increasingly strong competition worldwide and requires even more intelligent organisation.
We must close this European gap with innovation and not allow ourselves to remain bogged down with education alone.
Mr Paasilinna arrested our attention with great enthusiasm whilst discussing this subject.
A second observation is that it is no bad thing that we are now opting for a limited set-up and a restricted financial basis.
If the formula is successful, we will also see from within the business community that that public partner, together with the public partner in the Member States, will start to provide financial support by means of structural funding or otherwise.
The EIT title must be desired.
In this instance, 'excellence' stands for 'world leader'.
That is where you want to belong and there is also support for this.
If you listen to the universities, the nanotechnology industry and the emerging climate-related industry, there is wide support for this.
Having listened to the many arguments for WrocÅaw, I also ask whether a choice has already been made with regard to establishing a control centre in an effective location within central Europe.
I hear that there is enthusiasm for this in many locations.
Finally, Mr President, there is a true niche, a gap between what we have in the previous instruments and educational programmes, between the various programmes.
It must be created with daring and ambition.
A strong leader is required.
Something really must come of this and then, in 2010, we will say: sure enough, that was a good move.
Investment pays off in time.
(RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, first of all, I congratulate Mr. Rapporteur Paasilinna, who almost entirely rewrote the Commission's document, making it functional.
The triangle of knowledge - innovation, research and education - made up of universities, research centres and institutes and companies is indispensable for achieving the Lisbon strategy objectives, namely to have 3% of the gross domestic product invested in research, of which two thirds should come from the private environment.
The knowledge and innovation communities will be a bridge between the private sector and the academic and research community.
I believe that the pilot projects proposed by Mr. Paasilinna are necessary and I hope to have such a pilot project in Romania as well.
Investments are required all the way through, from production to dissemination and use of the research and innovation results.
The financing of this institute is the first step, but we also need investments in the field of small and medium-sized companies and in the private sector, because there are people and resources for co-financing the research projects.
There has to be a long term strategy.
Intellectual property is important, but we have to be careful for this initiative not to overlap common initiatives, joint undertakings.
I hope this institute would work more in the field of climate changes, the information society and nanotechnologies.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the planned European Institute of Technology, often said to be the flagship of European innovation, links the three elements of the triangle of knowledge: innovation, research and education.
The key to the success of this undertaking is, in my opinion, good cooperation between academic centres and business environments.
The European Institute of Technology must first and foremost be in a position to accumulate large amounts of private funding.
Today I want to draw the European Parliament's attention to the preparations being made for WrocÅaw to become the headquarters of the Institute, or else one of the centres of its Knowledge and Innovation Communities.
WrocÅaw may be a symbol of European history; it is often called the Strasbourg of Central and Eastern Europe.
There are currently more than 140 000 students studying in WrocÅaw; the city is one of Poland's main research centres.
It has given birth to the EIT+ Centre for Innovation and Technology, which is lobbying to have the Institute located in WrocÅaw.
One final comment.
In the last ten years, WrocÅaw has become a city of modern financial services, a place that draws in capital from all over the world, a symbol of European creative energy and development, and a positive symbol of globalisation.
(NL) Madam President, yet another new institute.
That may well be this evening's conclusion.
In addition to the European Research Council and the technology platforms, the joint technology initiatives, Eureka, the CIP, the Seventh Framework Programme and the JRC, we now have yet another knowledge institute.
The added value is innovation, because that is what is lacking in comparison with the United States, Japan and China.
The idea behind this is that there are enough good ideas and scientific insights within Europe, but that they are not developed into concrete products.
The question is of course whether a new institute can help in this process.
The question is also whether SMEs can find their way amongst all these knowledge and research institutes.
The lack of innovation should perhaps be ascribed to the complex legislation that hinders innovation, rather than to a lack of institutes.
Nonetheless, the new institute with its Knowledge and Innovation Communities may provide a contribution and I hope that the EIT can provide a major contribution and will excel in the field of climate policy, because a great deal of reform and innovation is sorely needed in this area.
Despite my doubts, I wish the EIT an excellent start and a successful future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The European Institute of Technology has the ability to reduce innovation gaps between the European Union and its external competitors and to gain the interest of millions of young researchers all over Europe.
In order to achieve these objectives, it is essential to ensure the feasibility of the project.
The EIT, in the form proposed by the Commission, will use over 1.2 billion out of the funds designated for the cohesion policy and will draw from the resources of programmes that operate successfully in order to achieve the Lisbon strategy.
This would mean centralizing the research funds into a single European project and reducing the financing possibilities open to private companies.
The EIT should be a complementary innovation institution in Europe, not a substitute for small research and development centres.
For this reason, together with the Council, we must find another financing formula for this project.
One of the provisions in the report states the necessity for the institute to be established in a European Union country where there are "centres of European academic excellence and reputationâ.
As a country with an important research and innovation tradition, Romania possesses important academic centres and well-qualified series of graduates in technology.
Selecting Romania as the host country for the European Institute of Technology would stimulate economic development in the entire region and would contribute to balancing the gaps still existing in the European Union.
in writing. - Education, research and innovation are windows to the future.
They are the building blocks of what is called the 'knowledge triangle'.
We need to be competitive.
The knowledge triangle is one of the keys.
Therefore I see the European Institute of Technology (EIT) as an investment to the future.
There has been scepticism to the added value EIT could offer.
The network structure supported in this, Mr Paasilinna's, report will be a good solution.
The expertise lies in the participating universities and higher education institutions.
Therefore, rather than what the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has called a 'flagship' of European research, the EIT will try to be a label branding European research.
I support this idea.
Remembering my academic years, I also support the report's idea of the EIT's 'Knowledge and Innovation Communities' (KICs) being autonomous.
This way the EIT KICs will give the best kicks to European innovation.
Towards a common European foreign policy on energy (debate)
The next item is the report by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a common European foreign policy on energy.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I am presenting to you an own-initiative report recommended by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Our report advocates a common EU foreign policy on energy in order to face challenges of energy security.
It would bring necessary and substantial added value to efforts made at national level, according to the subsidiarity principle, and would allow better protection of Europe's energy interests.
What should this policy look like?
It should be based on the following four principles: diversification; unity in defending the EU's interests and the EU speaking with one voice; solidarity in crisis; and strengthened cooperation with partners.
We need to develop a proactive broad energy diplomacy aimed at strengthening our cooperation with all major producer, transit and consumer countries, and to create an energy market based on the principle of reciprocity.
The report welcomes the proposals of the third energy package, as adopted last week by the Commission, which addresses these concerns and is in line with the report.
The EU has to be active, determined and united.
The geopolitical dimension of energy security has been so far neglected and it is high time to fill the gap.
Hopefully the new Treaty will equip the EU with a legal basis for energy solidarity, thus allowing for the EU's institutional competence to negotiate an energy security framework with third countries.
The report recommends including in our agreements with producer and transit countries a so-called energy security clause which lays down a code of conduct and explicitly outlines measures to be taken in the event of disruption of supply.
We should replace the current EU Member States' preference for energy unilateralism with a new common policy of energy solidarity based on a multilateralist approach.
Meanwhile, there is a necessity to establish a good practice of consultation among Member States on strategic decisions which may affect the EU or one of its members.
The new common foreign policy on energy must be consistent with all EU policies having an external aspect, e.g. internal market, competition, transport, trade, environment, consumer protection, budget and others.
One cannot create a new common policy overnight.
We propose, therefore, to adopt a gradual approach and furthermore, to be efficient, this new policy should be equipped with appropriate instruments.
We suggest the creation of a new post of High Official for Foreign Energy Policy after the new Treaty enters - hopefully - into force.
This office would allow for the coordination of all the above-mentioned sectoral policies of the Union and especially those aspects related to the external side of energy security, working under the authority of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who would, in future, also be Vice-President of the European Commission.
That would reinforce the synergies inside the Union.
This institutional novelty therefore constitutes an important anchorage of the new approach.
We also propose to elaborate a precise roadmap indicating short-, medium- and long-term objectives with a specific timeframe for implementing them and obviously subject to the European Parliament's scrutiny.
To be successful, we need to engage the EU's internal dynamic and to secure the necessary public support.
The citizens' interest is in secure and affordable energy.
This interest of our citizens should be at the core of the project, thus constituting one of the targets of our 'Europe of results' approach.
Common threats to secure energy for Europe should therefore produce a common response.
But we may also achieve more: a new common policy can become a trigger for further European integration, giving it a new impetus and new strength to the EU as a global actor.
A demanding and courageous approach should be an ambition of the European Parliament.
Today's European Union started a long time ago with energy.
Then, it was coal giving an initial push to our reconstruction.
We should not miss the opportunity to let it happen once again.
We need energy for Europe, indeed, both in literal and in metaphorical terms.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome very much the initiative of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in particular the chairman, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, to propose a report on a common European foreign policy on energy.
Recent developments have confirmed that this is a very timely initiative.
The report serves to underline the growing importance of energy issues in the Community context, particularly the external aspects and the importance of the European Union speaking with one voice on external energy issues.
I appreciate that the report clearly highlights that substantial progress has been made over the past year by the European Union and its institutions towards the goal of speaking with one voice.
This includes the establishment of the Network of Energy Security Correspondents (NESCO), in addition to the existing gas coordination group and oil supply group.
NESCO has been active since the early summer, which has permitted a very useful and early exchange of energy information between Member States.
However, an earlier exchange of information on planned initiatives by particular Member States would still be highly welcome.
Therefore, as the report underlines, a lot still remains to be done.
The call for a suitable Treaty basis for energy and energy security is particularly important and timely, as is the call for concrete provisions in the Treaties that will lead to the creation of a common European foreign policy on energy.
I very much welcome this approach, including the proposal from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy that the principles of the common energy policy be included in the EC Treaty at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, so that there will be a solid basis for joint action in the energy field directed towards third countries.
I also note that the Committee has reflected further on the proposal on how to anchor external energy policies more firmly both in the Commission and the Council.
We will need to reflect further on this important subject.
I believe that this version of the report is also balanced geographically, recognising the importance of enhancing our energy relations not only with our eastern neighbours but also with our Mediterranean, Middle East, Asian and other partners.
I already enjoy the genuine energy partnership with the United States but I do believe that we can achieve more in this area.
I also believe that we need to continue to work with like-minded energy partners, such as Norway, Canada and Australia, to strengthen the consensus on the value of open, transparent and competitive international energy markets.
Recognising the value of the Energy Charter Treaty, I agree with the Committee that Russia's ratification would be very important.
However, at the same time I firmly believe that the principles of the Charter also need to be included in a robust energy agreement within the framework of the post-PCA agreement with Russia.
I do have a practical concern about the number of reports that it is suggested that the Commission should produce.
I know that each of them per se is important but I believe that most of the issues raised will be covered in the framework of the regular review of the Energy Action Plan or are already covered in the Commission's annual reports on the application of competition law.
I do, however, favour more involvement by Parliament and I will examine the suggestions proposed to my colleagues in the College to determine what, in practical terms, the Commission can do to address the concerns raised.
Finally, with respect to the substance, the Commission intends to press ahead with the work in which we are engaged since early last year and which reflects most of the priorities identified in the report, in particular, on the feasibility study to examine the existing legal arrangements in the EU if its neighbours' energy sectors fall short, and how to strengthen them.
Equally, it is important to put concrete proposals on the table on reciprocity, and I welcome the fact that your report recognises the importance of reciprocity measures aimed at protecting our internal energy market.
This is a very timely report, both politically and also in terms of substance.
The Commission has been actively working over the past year and a half to reinforce the EU's external policy on energy and, as the report recognises, there have been a number of significant achievements.
However, we do need to go further and I therefore fully support the call in this report for concrete provisions in the Treaties that will lead to the creation of a common European foreign policy on energy.
With energy security, we are talking about the security of our economies and our way of life.
As the EU is becoming increasingly dependent on imports of energy, it is crucial that we have a coherent and focused response to the challenges that this presents, not least in our relations with our major external energy suppliers.
This has already been reflected in the Commission's latest package on the internal electricity and gas markets, and I very much welcome your appreciation of the proposal.
I can also announce that the Commission will be a holding a rapid and in-depth review of the wider aspects of the EU's external policy in energy and that we will definitely make the results of that work public.
I would like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs and particularly the chairman, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for taking this initiative and for giving Parliament an opportunity to debate this extremely important issue for Europe, and I look forward to continuing our cooperation in the future.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate my colleague and friend Mr Saryusz-Wolski for his excellent report.
It is now time for Europe to speak with one voice on energy, because we face serious threats to security of supply, transit and investment.
However, it is a shame that paragraph 62 of the report is too categorical as regards full ownership unbundling of energy production, transmission and distribution, since other solutions exist to reconcile the creation of a European energy market with the essential political security that we must maintain over our networks.
In terms of international trade, we need to insist on the inclusion of chapters on energy in any new trade agreement.
Fair competition must be established at international level, particularly through and under the supervision of the World Trade Organization.
Finally, we must support international scientific initiatives such as the ITER thermonuclear experimental reactor programme, which, apart from the European Union, also involves a number of other partner countries around the world.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the depletion of fossil fuels and changes in the geopolitical situation have placed energy security at the top of the European Union's political agenda.
The European Union's growing dependence on external energy supplies, mainly from unstable countries, gives rise to concerns regarding the economic and political interests of the Member States as well as the EU's overall security.
I do not believe, however, that we can respond to these challenges and problems solely by increasing production and supplies from abroad, but should rather seek a response to energy demand within Europe.
It is for this reason that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety urged a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources during the next decade, as the major way of reducing dependency on oil and gas.
Since production and consumption of energy are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, an integrated approach to the environment and energy is required to achieve the objectives of a sustainable energy policy.
Therefore, combating climate change should not remain the preserve of environmental policies, but ought to lie at the heart of the European Union's policies, both internal and commercial.
For example, with regard to biofuels it is vital for the European Union to ensure that they will not threaten security of food supplies worldwide and will not create pressure on the economy of the global South to expand monoculture and deforestation.
Support for the development and use of renewables can ensure a fair transfer of technologies to non-EU countries and bring benefits in terms of European leadership in the development of international markets.
The proposal for energy partnership with Africa is therefore important, and we should add similar partnerships with China and India in view of the growth of these countries.
The attainment of the millennium objectives for developing countries is a priority.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Madam President, the cornerstones of the energy policy for the European Union are transparency, reciprocity and the rule of law.
And, as we have all experienced in the last two years, this is also a vitally important issue when it comes to energy and foreign relations.
We already have problems in Europe when it comes to security of supply, consumer rights and environmental concerns, and we have to do something about the greenhouse effect.
We also have a disturbance on the market that is severe, which Neelie Kroes's report showed us very clearly and which puts on the table the need to unbundle, which is also a foreign relations concern.
This is a very important aspect of this issue.
So we have to rebuild our energy system in Europe with regard to production, distribution and consumption.
I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Saryusz-Wolski for very good cooperation.
He has taken account of all the texts from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
What I am not so happy about is what he added with regard to the new Solana-like function, to be able to talk with one voice for the European Union.
This new institution would, as I see it, cause uncertainty of roles, a divide-and-conquer situation, and it takes completely the opposite approach to our cornerstones in our energy policy.
We cannot check on reciprocity with an institution like this, transparency is ruled out and the powers of Parliament are diminished, which is also completely the opposite of what we want in all other areas.
We have therefore asked for a split vote on this topic tomorrow.
Finally, I want to agree with the Commissioner that it is vitally important that we add the energy issue to the new Treaty.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, this report is a serious, thorough and inspirational piece of work.
The rapporteur has rallied support across the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also across the other four committees that we have just heard from.
In my view it will meet with widespread acclamation tomorrow, including my own support, and, I am very happy to say, that of my British colleagues.
Commissioner Piebalgs, you went a very long way in your introduction to support the initiative that the Committee chairman, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, has raised with, as I say, a lot of innovation and skill, because, to many, there were challenges.
I have two specific questions to which perhaps you might reply.
You stated, in terms of one of our major suppliers, Russia, that you look forward to a new agreement under the action plan.
What is wrong with the old agreement that Russia has actually signed, the Energy Charter, including the Transit Protocol?
Because, if our neighbours and suppliers, with whom we have mutual dependency, constantly renege on agreements, what confidence can we have in the future?
We are looking for harmonious relations, but we have to defend our own corner and not merely agree with those who are in a supply situation.
I disagree with Ms Ek in her reservations - perhaps she might listen - about the High Official.
It seems to me that Mr Saryusz-Wolski is absolutely right in that we must have an institutional representative, whether it is yourself or whether it is, as we foresee, a double-hatted responsibility - both the Commission and Council.
I disagree thoroughly with Ms Ek.
This increases transparency, because Parliament would have a direct contact in the Vice-President of the Commission role of this High Official.
Could you dwell, in your reply, a little bit on this institutional issue, which seems to me to be extremely important and which Parliament is going to stress very strongly?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (LT) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my thanks for the good cooperation in coordinating the changes to the report on this new, brave issue.
The European Union is uneasily implementing its common foreign and security policy and is just starting to create its energy policy.
It is proposing to go even further, that is, to create a common European foreign policy on energy.
I believe that this is the right step, because the interlacing of foreign and energy policy is becoming more and more apparent and we need to look to the future.
Those countries that manage energy sources can fall into the temptation of managing the entire world or at least having a special impact on certain regions.
This report presents ways of avoiding this by using a justified EU measure - solidarity.
I am sure that the creation of a High Representative for Foreign Energy Policy with dual subordination is very important.
Bringing to mind Henry Kissinger's well-known expression, the officials of countries that supply resources, transit countries and the representatives of large companies would call him and he would not be able to stop calls from the capitals of the EU Member States.
The Members of the European Parliament would expect to receive reports from the European Commission on the implementation of the proposed policy and the assessment of how third countries are complying with the principles of transparency and mutuality.
If this policy is acceptable to the European Union, we will avoid any stumbling when bilateral agreements are concluded, bypassing their neighbours in the European Union.
The EU and Russia depend on one another in the areas of energy imports and exports.
Both are searching for possibilities to diversify and they will not stop doing this.
However, they will still remain natural partners in supplementing one another for quite some time.
It is very important that agreements between the EU and Russia are based on international law and are transparent and clearly monitored.
The way forward for this is also presented in this report.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski, who has written an excellent report on a very important and topical issue, and I would like to thank you for working together, for your cooperation and your willingness to reach a compromise.
There is no doubt that the issue of energy security is one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union.
Nowadays this is not primarily a technical issue, or an economic issue, or even a matter of energy sector management.
Fundamentally, it is a strategic issue.
The European Union as a whole currently obtains 50% of its energy requirements from outside the EU.
According to estimates by experts, by 2030 it will be importing 70% of its energy requirements.
This means that its energy dependency is very high.
Even now, many Member States depend to a much greater degree on energy supplies from abroad, and a good few of the new Member States depend on a single external supplier.
Moreover, this supplier is one that is increasingly exploiting energy as a means of asserting its own political interests.
Sometimes it is bent on punishing the Member States, at other times dividing them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am referring to Russia.
A common energy policy is urgently needed, an energy policy based on unity and solidarity, exactly as Mr Saryusz-Wolski has just set out.
It is vital that we diversify our sources and our transport corridors since the areas of the world we are dealing with in both cases are unstable, or largely unstable, and this also poses a threat to our security of supply.
The report proposes appointing a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, but the ALDE group does not support this.
We are concerned that it could lead to conflicts over competences; we are concerned that the European Parliament's powers of scrutiny would be curtailed and we fear that it would not represent real added value.
At the same time, however, we believe a very important aspect of the report is that it highlights the significance of energy projects, notably Nabucco, as a major common energy undertaking of the European Union, which could represent the first step towards a real common foreign policy on energy.
The report, and Mr Saryusz-Wolski, deserve particular credit for drawing attention to the concerns surrounding the Nord Stream pipeline.
These concerns are partly environmental, but they are also at least as much political, and this pipeline can only be constructed if we find satisfactory solutions and satisfactory answers to all of these concerns.
The Energy Charter Treaty is especially important because it is the basis of European cooperation on energy matters, and Russia too must ratify it.
Thank you.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) We have a good chance of achieving a common energy policy.
The most recent communication from the Commission indicates that we are on the right road.
The report from Mr Saryusz-Wolski is also an important step in this direction.
In the first place, we have here a reasonable picture of the problems of energy trade in the context of foreign policy.
The European Union has been avoiding this for a long time.
It took the hostile abuse of energy by Russia to make us realise that trade in energy had become a narrowly political instrument.
The report builds energy security into the EU's security priorities.
What we find here is a well-defined principle of solidarity and the requirement to diversify suppliers and transport corridors.
We find very reasonable doubts about the Nord Stream pipeline, the demand for Russia to respect the principles of the Energy Charter, the involvement of the WTO and the expansion of our energy policy beyond the context of European Union Member States.
For all of these reasons, our political group is happy to support this report.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the assessment of the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, concerning the problems of dependence on imports and the growing dependence on imports of energy fuels and I have little disagreement with it - the report describes it very well.
I do not, however, agree with the solutions this report puts forward and am of the opinion that important strategic objectives of internal, intra-European energy policy should have been reflected in this report.
In my opinion, the most important instrument for reducing this growing dependence on imports is the reduction of energy consumption in all areas and I am also of the opinion that the 20% increase in energy efficiency which Europe has undertaken to achieve by the year 2020 has to be a target that must leave its mark on strategic foreign energy policy.
When we realise that in the construction sector in Russia alone, as much gas is consumed unnecessarily as is otherwise exported from Russia to the European Union, then it is clear how much we can gain if we implement our efficiency strategies at home and then also turn the outward-looking energy strategy of the European Union into a viable method for Russia.
This would therefore also involve influencing Russia's internal energy policy by example.
On the subject of oil - dependence on OPEC is always a disadvantage in the light of the heated debate about Russia - I would say: if Europe manages to make economical, efficient cars on a pilot model and implement an aviation fuel tax for aviation gasoline, then we would gain more than with heated debates with OPEC on markets and export opportunities.
We support some parts, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, but not other parts!
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, this is in some respects a very honest report.
The wording is clear.
There has been no Treaty basis for this energy policy to date.
Correct!
Then for me the question is: why is this initiative being taken?
The initiative is being taken - we have now heard this more clearly in the spoken contributions than could be read in the report itself - on account of Russia's energy policy.
This base line is precisely the thread that runs through the entire report.
It is an anti-Russian report - as clearly worded in a variety of ways at various points - and it is a report that clearly states that the European Union wants to be a global player and a foreign policy on energy is virtually a means to that end.
This, too, is honest in some respects and something which may or may not be politically desirable.
We do not want this!
Clear demands are being made in relation to certain projects.
The lobbying policy for the Nabucco pipeline project, which is also being pursued within this Parliament, can also be found in this report.
Countries are dealt with collectively: Turkey is regarded almost exclusively as the transit hub for energy supplies.
However, Turkey is rather more than this.
I find the wording with regard to the USA particularly good.
Here it states: 'underlined the importance of enhanced energy dialogue with the US and other key energy partners that share EU values.'
I would just remind you that the USA is conducting a war in Iraq with a range of allies, also partly because of energy issues.
If these are the same values, we must be very clear about saying 'no' to this development!
The wording is clear that, in the G8, the various Member States involved will be backing interests in the energy sector, and a link will be established with the military components.
As I have said: it is in some respects a very honest report.
A colleague of mine has described it thus: this report has a whiff of the Cold War about it.
I believe this is right and my Group will therefore be rejecting this report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, time is pressing for concrete steps to be taken towards a European external energy policy.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report does not push forward the Nabucco project in particular without good reason.
Our Commissioner for Energy, Mr Piebalgs, eloquently dubbed this gas pipeline 'an embodiment of the existence of a common European energy policy'.
Sure enough, words must be followed by action and it is for that reason that we also greatly welcome the appointment of Jozias van Aartsen to the position of EU coordinator for the Nabucco project.
The recent British and Austrian missions in respect of potential gas suppliers for Nabucco, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also serve as evidence of European decisiveness.
In any event, the positive responses from Ashgabat and Baku offer perspective.
Two issues are of essential importance for an effective follow-up to the Nabucco project, the cost of which runs into billions of euros.
First of all, there must be harmony between the current group holders.
In short, Austrian project manager OMV must immediately discontinue its stubborn attempts at a hostile takeover of group partner, Hungarian oil and gas firm MOL.
A clearly urgent task for the new Nabucco coordinator and on behalf of the EU will be for Mr Van Aartsen to also be on the alert for further attempts on the part of Russia to infiltrate this interesting energy diversification project.
Madam President, in the event that the Nabucco project and similar European plans are unsuccessful, there will be insufficient energy diversification for the new EU Member States.
This will result in a fragmentation of the European energy market and the diplomatic curtain will then unfortunately fall on a European external energy policy.
The European institutions must never let it come to this.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in common with the rapporteur, I also believe that it is necessary and important to align foreign policy with energy policy.
I hope it is not necessary to elaborate on how appropriate coherence between the two policies, which would both be strengthened by a common strategy, would lead to economic growth and prosperity for European citizens as well as greater political stability worldwide, and a probable domino effect for our major European partners.
The priority, however, should not relate exclusively to security of supply, but we should at the same time focus on a sustainable, efficient energy policy that makes Europe increasingly self-sufficient in energy terms and thus independent of external pressures that may have an influence, and at times a strong one, on the EU's commitment to the promotion of democracy, human rights and peace.
An effective common policy must be based on increased resources for research into renewable energy as well as investment in nuclear power, and so we should focus on what we have: skills, professionalism and technologies.
If we also add political will, we can transform the European energy crisis into a unique opportunity: gaining a full technological advantage in order, when the imminent world energy crisis arrives, to beat our major competitors at the economic challenge.
Madam President, today's debate could well be titled 'who is going to have the upper hand in conducting the EU's foreign policies?'
Will it be big corporations and third countries or will it be the EU institutions?
By creating a common policy on energy, as proposed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski, the EU will become a much stronger player on the world stage, better placed to defend the interests of all its Members.
A common energy policy has to become an essential part of our common security policy.
As late as January 2006, the EU countries started to realise that energy has been used and will be used by Russia as a central instrument of its foreign policies.
President Putin has openly defined the state-owned Gazprom in such a role.
For my country, Estonia, this is nothing new: Estonia experienced a full-scale energy blockade 16 years ago, when Russia punished its former colony for trying to become genuinely independent.
This report shows that it is high time for a united approach.
Too often, bilateral agreements have in fact led to looking away from democratic standards and have caused real damage to the EU's unity and credibility.
For example, the Baltic Sea gas pipeline project should be seen first of all as a political tool, which will enable Putin's Russia to further divide the EU, by playing certain states against the others.
Therefore, I strongly support two key ideas of this report: creating a special EU official to coordinate foreign energy policies and including an energy solidarity clause in the future Treaties.
But I am especially encouraged by Commissioner Piebalgs for his deeply professional, constructive and forthcoming approach and I look forward to our good cooperation.
(DE) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for the opportunity to work with him well and to be able to reach a compromise.
One of these compromises has just been mentioned and concerns those responsible for a foreign policy on energy.
I know this is a difficult field, not without controversy, and the Commissioner will still have to do a great deal more work on it.
If it comes to it, not only will the foreign affairs politicians need to be involved, but also the Commission's energy politicians.
One important aim of our foreign policy on energy is diversification.
This does not mean that we want to take action against those countries from which we obtain crude oil or natural gas, but we do want to tap other sources.
Even Russia is trying to gain access to sources in order to supply crude oil or natural gas to Europe.
It is our legitimate right to try to gain this sort of access as well.
In addition, the question of reciprocity is an important aspect in relation to Russia.
For our Group this does not entail a policy vis-Ã -vis Russia, but a policy of equal rights.
If Russia is opening up its markets, we shall do so too.
But we cannot be asked to open everything up while Russia is closing everything down.
It makes no sense for us.
The final point I would like to mention is a very difficult matter, also included in the amendment, and that is the relationship between energy policy and human rights policy.
When I was in Azerbaijan for a short time with my colleagues, we did discuss this.
Unfortunately, most of our sources of supply are in countries where the issue of human rights is not the top priority.
This cannot lead us to say we will not source any more energy from these countries.
But it must mean - if we want to remain credible - that we will do both: energy policy, but also human rights policy, and improving the human rights situation in these countries.
It cannot mean that we say 'we are sourcing energy; nothing else is of interest to us'.
We must offer a parallel strategy.
This is the only credible thing to do.
(FI) Madam President, I too wish to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski on an excellent report on a very important issue.
The report shows that the Union still has much to do to establish a common policy on energy.
I would like to emphasise the importance of renewable energy as a way to improve self-sufficiency in energy, diversify energy sources and control climate change.
We still need to invest considerably in research and product development if we are to increase the share of renewable energy.
Member States must be able to maintain their right to take decisions on energy and exploit their own energy sources, but at the same time we need cooperation, an exchange of best experience and also common rules and regulations to promote the establishment of a common energy policy.
It is also important to implement joint projects on renewable energy in collaboration with the Union's neighbouring countries, so that all Europe's renewable energy resources can be used more efficiently, effectively and sustainably.
(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for his very comprehensive and extremely topical report.
Energy is a sphere in which EU competence is shared with the Member States.
It is clear that under these circumstances working towards a common foreign policy in the energy sphere is not an easy task.
Resolving the situation as quickly as possible, however, makes us dependent, for our energy supplies, on unstable countries with doubtful democratic credentials.
Security of energy supply is an important element of general security.
Experience to date has shown that energy can be a highly effective instrument of political pressure.
The only counter-measure is a common policy and solidarity.
One of the largest suppliers to the European Union is Russia, with whom a new partnership and cooperation agreement is currently being prepared.
The principles of the Energy Charter need to be worked into this agreement, and of course Russia must ratify the charter.
In relation to non-EU countries in which a growing need for energy can be observed, the European Union ought to ensure that technology relating to renewable energy sources is supplied to them on preferential terms.
This will definitely be worthwhile in many ways in the future.
Last week the Commission published a proposal for further liberalisation of the market.
Unfortunately, this immediately met with opposition from certain Member States and from Russia.
It is symptomatic that opposition comes from those countries where businesses have attempted in the recent past to benefit from the creation of special bilateral relations, ignoring the rights and interests of other Member States, as is the case, for instance, with regard to the north European gas pipeline project.
I would like to hope that we will nonetheless be able to agree, and that this will also make us stronger in foreign relations.
Thank you.
(FR) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur.
Energy has become a geostrategic issue once again.
It is also the Achilles heel of the European Union.
Since it cannot meet its energy needs alone, the EU is striving to diversify its sources of supply under trade agreements signed with countries in Latin America, Africa and Eurasia.
The recent disagreement between the European Union and Russia over the Energy Charter is a sign that energy security has entered a new era.
Faced with dwindling oil resources, the ever-present nuclear risk and the advent of energy powers such as Russia and Brazil, it is also vital to restate the EU's sustainable development policy.
In this respect, a coherent foreign policy will reflect the renewable energy targets set by the Spring European Council.
It will also make energy efficiency a premise of our external relations.
It is not enough to insist on guarantees of uninterrupted supply from other countries, particularly neighbouring countries.
We must also ensure that there is real coordination between the 27 Member States.
In fact, energy security means a loss of sovereignty in a European sector which has now become strategic.
The pressure that energy supply places on governments should not make us rush these decisions or neglect the principles we have worked on together.
As the previous President of the European Parliament reminded President Putin, human rights cannot be negotiated in return for our energy needs.
On the contrary, we must make our supply conditional on respect for human rights.
(PT) This report starts with a real problem - the Union's energy dependence - but it comes to the wrong conclusion.
The enemy is not Russia, whatever our opinion of Puttin, nor Algeria, whether or not we approve of their armed forces.
Climate change, the fossil fuel burden and a way of life that involves high energy consumption, those are our adversaries - internal and external.
We shall not beat them by focusing on security issues belonging to the Cold War era.
The obsession with security undermines cooperation and leads to an 'anything goes' internal policy: from nuclear fusion to reliance on biofuels.
Only yesterday Le Monde revealed Paul Crutzen's conclusions: a litre of agrofuel can contribute up to twice as much to the greenhouse effect as the equivalent amount of fossil fuel.
In conclusion I should like to paraphrase JosÃ© SÃ³crates: It would perhaps be a good idea to start listening to the scientists and economists once again rather than to couch geostrategists.
Madam President, when the EU talks of a common foreign policy on energy, you need to be very aware of exactly who you propose to do business with.
President Putin is on record as saying 'The Commission should be under no illusions.
If it wants to buy Russian gas, it has to deal with the Russian state.'
Gazprom is not a private company.
It is a state-controlled tool of Russian foreign policy.
It is, moreover, in the hands of President Putin's political henchmen and, allegedly, organised crime.
Take, for example, Alisher Usmanov.
This gentleman, the son of a Communist apparatchik, is Chairman of Gazprom Invest Holdings, the group that handles Gazprom's business activities outside Russia.
He is the man we are doing business with.
He is the man who cuts off gas supplies if client states dare to question Gazprom's demands.
Allegedly a gangster and racketeer, he served a six-year jail sentence in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, his eventual pardon coming at the behest of Uzbek mafia chief and heroin overlord Gafur Rakhimov, described as Usmanov's mentor.
Usmanov bought the newspaper Kommersant.
Three months later the journalist Ivan Safronov, a critic of the Putin regime who just weeks earlier had been vigorously interrogated by the FSB, as the KGB is now called, mysteriously fell to his death from his apartment window, still clutching a recently purchased bag of shopping.
According to Craig Murray, the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, it was Usmanov who ordered the cutting off of supplies to Georgia earlier this year.
Please take note, Madam President, the Kremlin has now refused to sanction the construction of a pipeline to the EU over Georgian territory.
These are the people you want to do business with.
These are the people around whom you want to mould your foreign policy on energy.
Commissioner, good luck.
You will need it.
(DE) Madam President, first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
You can see by the very high attendance at this late hour how important the report is and you can also hear how emotionally charged the atmosphere is as we listen to the various contributions from different nationalities and groups.
It is therefore a compliment that the paper has actually been written and adopted.
As rapporteur for trade and economic relations between the EU and Russia, I would like to raise two aspects and then make a general comment.
The first aspect concerns the bilateral energy agreements.
If I read it correctly, the Saryusz-Wolski report is 'towards a common European foreign policy on energy'.
In other words, this common foreign policy on energy does not yet exist.
While it still does not exist, it must therefore be possible to find other ways to talk about energy.
The Member States are able effectively to agree among themselves - this is highly desirable, it is not a chore.
It is not possible to impose a veto on bilateral agreements.
It is a credit to the rapporteur's realism - because I know that he wanted something else - that he has written this in his report in this way.
My second point: combining the energy charter with Russia's WTO membership.
Linking ratification of the energy charter with accession to the WTO is a backward step.
It is also advantageous for the EU if Russia is a member of the WTO.
Moreover, we are not able to make a decision on this alone.
The rapporteur's report in favour of the common energy policy leans towards Russia, but this is simply consistent with the situation today.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is increasingly dependent on traditional energy sources, in particular oil and natural gas.
Many important measures must be taken to limit and reduce this dependence.
For instance, it is necessary to make substantial energy savings and step up research in this area.
It is necessary to start making greater use of alternative fuels, from wind, water and biomass to nuclear reactors.
It is necessary to ensure territorial diversification of supply, with a greater variety of countries and routes.
All these challenges and tasks cannot be approached independently, at national level alone.
It is becoming clear - and even the politicians in many Eurosceptic countries are beginning to understand this - that we have to find the solution together, through our common European policies.
This also applies to the common European foreign policy on energy.
I therefore welcome the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski as a necessary step and a vital element in the debate on introducing this policy.
The report contains important principles and recommendations: the European Union should follow them so that it can defend the interests of all its members, so that it can speak with one voice, including to those outside the Union.
Among these tenets and important principles is the very important principle of solidarity, solidarity in situations of crisis.
It is possible to support all these tenets and principles.
However, in order to realise them we also need a new, stronger legal basis, in other words we need a Reform Treaty.
In my opinion, we should bear this aspect in mind when debating the establishment of our common foreign policy on energy.
(SV) Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for seeking to make the Russo-German Nord Stream project into a common concern for the EU.
Indeed that is what it is in reality.
The EU needs gas, and Russia needs its export income.
At the same time the project gives rise to fear and anxiety among the inhabitants of the Baltic region and is perceived as a threat.
We need confidence-building measures in order to dispel this mistrust.
Russia cannot continue to fan the flames of antagonism between itself and the peoples around its most important export route.
But only a united EU can turn what is now perceived as a threat into an opportunity and a step forward in relations with Russia.
For the project to be given the green light, the EU must demand the following: a reliable assessment of its consequences for the environment, guarantees of compensation in the event that the gas pipeline causes accidents and full inspection of operations by a monitoring body with representatives from the countries around the Baltic Sea.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make the point that, from the aspect of individual countries and societies, there are three types of security that are paramount: energy security, food security and personal security.
So my thanks go to the author of the report on European foreign policy on energy, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for drawing up this complex set of ideas on the subject of European Union energy security.
May I at the same time express the hope that a common energy policy will be written into the European Union reform treaty.
Poland, which I represent, is experiencing for itself the effects of a divergence of interests in energy policy between individual Member States.
A striking example of this is the way in which Russia and Germany are implementing their Baltic Sea gas pipeline investment to the detriment of the interests of both Poland and the other Baltic States.
Two years ago, at a meeting of the EU Council, Poland announced a proposal for a common energy policy which could be described by the slogan 'one for all and all for one'.
It is good that the report being discussed today is moving in that direction by proposing common solutions that would put the above principle into effect.
There can, after all, be no doubt that without unity in protecting the energy interests of the European Union, without observance of the principle of solidarity in crisis situations, the European Union will not be viewed as a single body.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank and congratulate you and Mr Saryusz-Wolski for your current work and achievements.
Allow me today to open a debate on a new proposal, not on a high commissioner but on a whole new issue.
Let us create a European fund for alternative energy resources.
You might be surprised at why I am speaking about this issue.
Have you ever heard about one terrific night in a frozen US in 1965 which led to the baby boom?
You must be able to recall early May 1986 - Chernobyl - hours, days and months afterwards.
And, Commissioner, you probably did not have the opportunity to land and stay in Kuwait in 1991 when 300 oilfields were burning.
These are all cases of a lack of energy security.
Why do we have this lack of energy security?
Because we do not have freedom of choice; we are heavily dependent.
As a granddaughter of the founder of ÄEZ, I know that we can say that the ÄeskÃ¡ republika is no longer 'ÄeskÃ¡', but 'ÄEZkÃ¡'!
When you asked for 2020 for 20% of renewables, Prime Minister TopolÃ¡nek came to us and he told us, I could sign it because it is total nonsense.
With this approach, we will stay insecure because we will not have freedom of choice.
How to achieve it?
Of course, not only by external diversification - we Europeans have to find our own resources.
Therefore, using energy tariffs to create a European fund for alternative energy can help us, not to create another Lisbon Strategy for 2020, but to really reach such people as TopolÃ¡nek and give us the ability to have new resources, so as not to be dependent.
(PT) This resolution reveals the glaring inadequacies of European policies in the field of energy.
In fact, the European Union is not a global actor here.
Those who, like me, believe that the European Union should guarantee itself a minimum strategic autonomy, can only view with consternation our vulnerability in this matter.
It is not a question of aiming for a Utopian self-sufficiency, but rather of recognising the need for greater coordination of national policies, ensuring there is solidarity between Member States and developing relationships with global partners which are less asymmetrical but predictable and based on a truly European approach.
For example, it is up to us Europeans to work against the 'divide and rule' attitude which has marked relations with Russia in this area.
This report underlines the political dimension of the European energy market.
As long as the Member States, in an approach comparable to that adopted in the European defence equipment market, continue to insist on promoting, internally, a sovereignist and anachronistic protectionism and, externally, a liberalism that is more 'Adam Smithian' than Adam Smith's, then Europe will remain out of step in a world in which all the principal actors regard energy as an eminently political and strategic issue.
The rapporteur's proposal to create a post of High Official is therefore helpful and we should act upon it as quickly as possible.
However, in this area the EU not only faces the strategic imperative of guaranteeing security of supply.
The actual sustainability of the European energy policy and the environmental implications of lack of diversification of our energy sources require an urgent change of course.
Europe cannot therefore continue to support corrupt and oppressive regimes in oil-producing countries.
The EU's external energy policy must include imperatives concerning human rights, good governance and environmental sustainability.
In conclusion, pollution and the post-Kyoto scenario, oil prices, moral and human rights imperatives, political and economic instability due to dependence on hydrocarbons, the potential of new environment-friendly technologies to stimulate a new industrial revolution in Europe and throughout the world, everything around us means the EU must develop a multi-faceted yet coherent external policy.
Finally, Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
(LT) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.
I will repeat myself once again by saying that it is very necessary and well-timed, if it is not too late.
I have already emphasised the issues of the common energy policy and the security of energy supply several times because these are issues of vital importance for Lithuania and the other Baltic counties.
Remember the report by Mrs Laperrouze on guidelines for trans-European networks considered two years ago.
Unfortunately, here in Parliament, the understanding was completely different and still remains so in some countries, for example regarding the Nord Stream project.
Life will show who is right.
Today it is gratifying that the situation is changing and the European Commission has taken brave initiatives.
On 19 September the package with this report has finally begun to meet our expectations.
(SV) Madam President, first let me congratulate the rapporteur on a report which is not just extremely good but is also timely.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski has done an extremely important job in shifting the focus from energy as a matter of our convenience to energy as a question of geopolitical importance.
It is precisely the geopolitical and security dimension which is uppermost in the minds of those of us who were born behind the Iron Curtain, but which western Europe has long neglected.
For that reason, perhaps, it is the most important element that the rapporteur brings to this debate.
We need to develop a common policy in order to protect our common interests better in this extremely important strategic area.
I am grateful to Mr Saryusz-Wolski for having the courage to present this report, which contains a number of important and innovative ideas.
We should indeed bear in mind that secure energy supplies are of vital interest to hundreds of millions of Europe's citizens.
Finally, Mr Saryusz-Wolski is quite right to say that we need to speak with one voice on this matter, precisely because the energy question is also quite clearly a security question.
All our experience of foreign and security policy shows that, every time we have failed to speak with a single voice, we have lost out and our citizens have paid the price.
Hence I can only urge that we support Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report in its entirety.
Madam President, Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report is important and timely.
Energy today is strategic for the European Union, as coal and steel were decades ago.
Yes, the European Union needs a common European foreign policy in energy.
Starting from this statement, I believe two questions are legitimate.
Firstly, how could one have a common external energy policy without a common internal energy policy?

We need a common agency for technological development in this field; we need a European budget funded in an appropriate way and from appropriate sources; we need a coherent strategy for the energy production; we need an integrated network of energy transportation, compatible systems of distribution and a European Union policy to balance consumption and production.
We need a truly free internal energy market.
Secondly, how could one have a common foreign policy on energy without a general common foreign policy?
The Russian factor is crucial.
Unfortunately, Russia perceives any common European strategy on energy as being directed against its interests.
How can we figure out a convincing win-win strategy on energy in our relations with Russia?
Russia's behaviour today is unacceptable.
However, we could not only tell Russia to behave, we have to motivate it to behave.
Therefore, I believe we should welcome Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report, but we should see it as one necessary important step in a long way towards our common goal.
(ES) Madam President, Mr Saryusz-Wolski should be congratulated because his report clearly states the essential points that the Union should take into account in order to establish a genuine common foreign policy on energy: reciprocity with exporting countries, the need to better coordinate our energy diplomacy at European level, and the importance of establishing an integrated and competitive market.
In the field of external energy policy it is crucial to remember that a business that controls its market from generation to the final sale, as is the case for electricity, is not the same as another business whose product is dependent on factors that are largely out of its control, as is the case for gas.
Moreover, we should not confuse protectionism, which we condemn, with protection, which is a cautious measure.
We need to refocus the problem from the point of view of interdependence, as the Union represents around 500 million consumers, which gives us considerable weight on the global market.
However, we are repeating the error of not harmonising diplomatic efforts at national and European level, which weaken us economically and geopolitically.
We need to ensure that the bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries do not endanger the efforts made at European level.
A considerable number of Member States depend on imports for more than 90% of their energy consumption, which obliges us to maintain well functioning and stable relations with producer countries.
However, there are times when the links are weakened due to unexpected events, which tends to bring negative consequences for trade between regions, that we are currently suffering from in Spain and that we saw in Poland and other Member States in the very recent past.
I will conclude, Madam President; it is only through a genuine European external energy policy that we will be able to avoid similar situations in the future, and therefore any new legal basis and any new institutional instrument that contributes to building this has to be...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur for the laborious work and the openness showed in approaching the multiple aspects of a joint European policy in the field of energy.
One of these aspects that I would like to mention in my speech is the importance of the Black Sea region in the above-mentioned future policy.
Over the last years, we have witnessed several energy crises that have also affected the European Union.
The objectives of ensuring stable energy delivery, as well as a transparent market, have become an unquestionable priority for the European Union.
In this context, the Black Sea region represents an important key to securing the European energy sector by diversifying the energy sources and transit networks, and the European initiative to consolidate the Black Sea regional cooperation, by creating synergies, and should be used to the maximum for this purpose.
I particularly emphasize the strategic importance of the Nabucco and ConstanÅ£a-Trieste projects.
Consequently, I welcome the attention given to these projects in Mr. Sarvusz-Wolski's report, as well as the recent appointment of a European coordinator of the Nabucco project.
The objectives to consolidate the network of energy coordinators and to implement the Energy Community Treaty are no less important.
I hope that these initiatives will be followed by even firmer steps in establishing a joint energy policy, steps that will turn to good account the Black Sea region and will lay the foundations of a dialogue with the external partners, based upon reciprocity and mutual confidence, joint values and, of course, on complying with the international obligations.
(PL) Madam President, this excellent report from Jacek Saryusz-Wolski shows that the most important aspect of the EU's energy policy is currently security of supply.
We are already half dependent on foreign supplies: in the case of gas this is actually 57%, and in the case of oil 82%.
What this means is that any crisis involving a supplier and the European Union, or involving a supplier and a transit country, could have a disastrous impact on our economies and our citizens.
This makes it all the more important to introduce the principle of solidarity between Member States in the event of crises into our legal order together with the reform treaty.
For this principle to be observable in practice, however, it is essential that we set up a system of strategic reserves, increase the number of links between transport networks, and, in short, construct a working response mechanism that would provide technical assistance to countries that have suffered the most as a result of crises.
Solidarity between Member States must also be manifested in the shape of a common foreign policy on energy, and it is good that the Commission is assuring us that it has the intention of creating such a policy, as we have heard from the lips of Mr Piebalgs, the Commissioner.
Member States still need to be convinced of this, to get them to give up their self-interests in favour of a common approach and the common good.
It is important that this policy be based on the principle of diversification of both sources and suppliers, and further, of routes and methods of delivery of energy.
It is therefore necessary to ensure political and financial support for new infrastructure projects like the Odessa-Brody-PÅock pipeline, or the Nabucco gas pipeline.
However we are also obliged to act against projects that are divisive, for example the Baltic gas pipeline.
And finally a constant element in the game the European Union plays with its neighbours, especially the nearest ones, as part of the European neighbourhood policy, should be an energy clause following the model of the anti-terrorist clauses which we in this place, the European Parliament, insist are included in agreements with third countries.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will start by thanking the rapporteur.
I think you see how complex the issue is, and it is very difficult to address all aspects, but it is good to try to address the complexity of the issue.
In my work, I am not pretending to be 'Mr Energy'.
There are three pillars of external energy relations: one is supply transit (and here I work with my colleagues Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Peter Mandelson); the second pillar is clean energy and energy efficiency such as launching a global energy efficiency platform (here I work with Stavros Dimas and Janez PotoÄnik; and the third pillar addresses energy poverty (where I work with Louis Michel).
That indicates how complex this is, and on top of it we have the Member States.
The Treaty, and also the Reform Treaty, says a very important thing: each Member State is responsible for its energy mix.
That is why I think the report calls for speaking with one voice.
I think that is the main message that I got from the report.
This is far from simple, and we are far from being there.
I believe that this report gives us a good chance of advancing the whole Union along this path.
I now come to Mr Beazley's question, because I think it was addressing the heart of the whole process: Why do energy issues need to be addressed in a partnership and cooperation agreement, a post-PCA agreement with Russia, if you have an Energy Charter?
The Energy Charter is a multilateral instrument.
For Russia, our relations on energy are definitely much bigger.
We invest in Russia.
Russia invests here.
A Russian nuclear reactor will perhaps be constructed in Belarus.
That means we need to build confidence on both sides, and confidence could be built if there are very clear legal requirements describing both sides' duties and also rights.
If these are described, then we can also conclude that there are areas where we also need an External Energy Representative.
I hear this call for a High Official coming from other partners.
If we have Treaty provisions making provision for Union development then we should agree to a mandate - by a mandate I mean on a basis like Committee 133 for external trade policy - then on the basis of this mandate the person delegated could speak with external suppliers, transit countries, or any other participants in the energy market.
If we deal with this separately, then definitely it loses all power.
We should see it as a symbiosis because it is not a separate issue from speaking with one voice.
If you do not speak with one voice, then you do not need a messenger.
If you speak with one voice, then you definitely need a messenger.
So I will stay with this position.
I would like to thank you for a very good debate.
It was very interesting.
After the Commission produces this paper on external energy relations, I believe that Parliament will return to the issue because you cannot resolve this issue with just one report.
That would be too optimistic.
Again, I should like to thank the rapporteur for very good work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Today, more than ever, economic powers are scrambling for energy resources.
China is providing enormous amount of aid without strings to developing countries in recompense for energy supplies.
Russia is using its gas and oil clout so as to become once more a global player.
The United States is foreseeing a future more dependent on nuclear technology.
Where does this leave the European Union?
It has become essential to close ranks for the supply and security of energy.
Problems facing those EU countries such as Malta which have the potential of becoming energy suppliers have to be dealt with by the European Union as a whole.
Just as in issues of illegal immigration, where questions of energy arise, it is the EU which should intervene.
A common foreign policy on energy should not only be limited to supply and security but must also encompass two essential subjects: the emission of greenhouse gases and secondly the quest for alternative energy.
A common foreign policy on energy can only make sense in this wider context, a triangle, with supply and security at the top, climate change and alternative sources at its base.
in writing. - In our efforts to tackle climate change we should not jeopardise efforts to protect biodiversity, ecosystems and Europe's food security.
The 8/9 March Council conclusions specify that the 10% target for biofuels is an appropriate target only if it is subject to sustainable production.
The impacts of first-generation biofuels maybe greater than originally thought, for instance the USA's desire to use bioethanol has led to a massive increase in the use of grain for biofuels production.
This demand is having a negative effect on European grain supplies with predictions that it will get much worse as the US surplus of grain diminishes.
The OECD-FAO foresees a significant impact of biofuels production on agriculture commodity prices with possible knock on effects on food importing countries.
A comprehensive international certification scheme for biofuels is therefore needed - as referred both in the Saryusz-Wolski and Thomsen reports - where both exports and imports to the EU are certified.
The certification criteria should be designed to ensure that biofuels provide significant greenhouse gas savings over the whole life cycle and that their production does not cause a loss in biodiversity or major socioeconomic problems such as serious food price inflation.
in writing. - (HU) The report entitled 'Towards a common European foreign policy on energy' makes the important point that Europe's energy supply depends to a growing extent on unstable and non-democratic countries.
This increasingly evident dependency is exacerbated by the fact that energy is being used more and more often as a means of exerting political pressure.
These processes make it all the more urgent to create a common European energy policy based on solidarity.
Large-scale European energy management projects may be the way to implement a common policy in practice.
The recent appointment by the European Union of a coordinator to head the most important of these projects, Nabucco, is therefore to be welcomed.
This, along with the fact that the hitherto reluctant Hungarian government has decided to support the construction of the pipeline, could mean that the gas pipeline connecting European consumers with energy sources in the Caspian Sea region could now become the symbol of a successful common energy policy instead of being an emblem of vacillation.
Within a few years the Nabucco pipeline, which represents a diversification both in terms of sources and transport corridors, may demonstrate that common action means increasing security of supply and affordable prices for consumers.
This is in the interests of all Member States, but it is especially important for Hungary, which at present is reliant solely on Russian gas.
in writing. - (RO) The European energy policy has focused on creating, stabilizing and regulating the internal market, a visible trend in the latest energy package of the European Commission as well.
It has been believed that the internal market liberalization will turn the EU into an important actor on the international energy scene, but it has been found that, in fact, the Union lacks an external and homogenous energy policy dimension.
The new reality, in which competition and liberalization are interconnected with climate changes and security of resources, generates not only external challenges (fear of energy dependence on a single supplier, which uses its position as a political weapon), but also an important internal challenge, which tests the Member States' ability to place their national interest second in order to create the premises for developing a joint and coherent energy policy.
The next step is to diversify resources through enhanced cooperation with neighbouring countries, especially with those from Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
This way, the convergent development of Member States and their neighbours is ensured and regional and interregional cooperation is encouraged, which is indispensable for making the European external energy policy more efficient.
The enlargement of the European Energy Community towards the East would stimulate the completion of energy liberalization, providing a joint advantage for possible future European Union enlargement.
in writing. - It is vital we ensure that the principles and goals of the EU's development policy are respected and promoted through the measures foreseen in the field of energy and foreign policy.
Access to energy is an essential enabling factor for economic growth and for the provision of basic living conditions for all human beings.
EU Member States and European energy companies cooperate extensively with developing countries in the field of energy, yet it is not always clear how much the citizens of these resources actually benefit.
For this reason, I support all steps aimed at promoting transparency, the rule of law and improved governance in the energy sector.
Economic development does not have to mean repeating the polluting practices of the industrialised countries.
Many developing countries are heavily dependent on high carbon-emitting sources of energy.
They need assistance to be able to diversify their sources of energy to achieve a more sustainable mix.
I deplore the widespread use of coal-fired power stations in China.
We should take all reasonable steps to encourage their transition to clean technologies through building sustainable energy capacity and facilitating the transfer of clean technologies.
Set aside for year 2008 (debate)
The next item is the proposal for a Council regulation, under examination by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards set aside for year 2008 - C6-0302/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I can tell you that the cereal market outlook is clearly at the forefront of our minds, as we are in a situation where the prices have shown unprecedented growth in the recent months.
This is not only the case within the European Union but all over the world.
With too much rain in certain parts of Europe and with droughts in other parts of Europe, the climatic conditions within our own regions this year have been adverse to cereal production and, with an estimated output of 258 million tonnes, the 2007 harvest is below average.
A compulsory set-aside of the present 10% in the old Member States, the EU-15, is not compatible with the present market situation.
Against this background, the Commission has proposed to set 0% on set-aside for the autumn 2007 harvest and the sowing in spring 2008.
According to our estimates, this will mean extra production within the European Union of between 10 and 17 million tonnes, and I think this will send a positive signal to the sector and, hopefully, also contribute to stabilisation within the grain sector.
A rapid decision on this matter is clearly needed so that farmers can decide their next production year and, in this context, I am actually very thankful for the fact that Parliament obviously understood the urgency of the matter and agreed to follow the fast-track procedure.
I really am very grateful.
Finally, our legal proposal will be as short and as simple as possible and it will not imply any new administrative burdens.
Looking further ahead, it is necessary, within the health check, to take a good look at whether the set-aside is still an appropriate tool in the present and in the future market circumstances.
We also need to consider how we can retain the environmental benefits within our set-aside system, such as maintenance of permanent pastures, the protection of riparian strips and measures that are also linked to climate change.
So, thank you for a quick reaction.
It is nice to see that Parliament can really move when it is badly needed.
chairman of the AGRI committee. - Madam President, Commissioner, yes, Parliament can move very quickly.
Of course, the thought that Parliament could be blamed for the fact that farmers would not know what to plant on their land this year did concentrate our minds quite a lot, so we were delighted to work with you to be able to get to this firm decision.
I also compliment my own committee, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on its unanimous decision.
The points I would like to raise really is, what a difference a year makes!
Twelve months ago we were talking about EUR 90/tonne for wheat.
Now we are talking about EUR 250-270, so we are talking three times the price.
Now is the time, therefore, to look seriously at bringing set-aside down to 0%.
I would even go further back than that.
When you think that for 20 odd years now in Europe we have been talking about food surpluses, farmers are not really needed, that we have to turn the land over to something else and that food security does not really matter.
All of a sudden food security does matter.
I think there is a moral argument here as well.
When the world has plenty of food, then perhaps Europe does not need altogether to do its share of production, but when the world is short of food and the prices go up, then Europe is morally obliged to produce food.
Europe is never going to starve, whatever the price of food is, because we basically have money to pay for it, but many parts of the world will.
All of a sudden we are in a different world and one that we must face up to.
The Commission is proposing a set-aside of 0% for 2008 and at the beginning of the marketing year 2008, like I said, the market is characteristically high in price.
As the Commissioner said, we have had droughts in some parts of Europe and we have had floods in others.
We also see, throughout the world, changing situations on grain, where in Australia you have salt coming up through the land and it is becoming very difficult to plant.
We are also seeing China and India taking in unprecedented amounts of food because of their economies increasing and wanting more food.
All this is taking its toll on the wheat and cereal production throughout the world.
We are now probably at about half the stocks that we historically have and stocks are getting low, so now is the time to do it.
I believe, Commissioner, and I am sure you do too, that if we have a common agricultural policy that is decoupled away from production, we cannot really have set-aside in many respects because, if ever there was a policy that was linked to production, then set-aside must be that, so now is very much the time to remove it.
As we remove set-aside, we must remember that there have been some environmental benefits to it and we must remember, too, that farmers will have the choice now as to whether to plough up set-aside land or not.
Under single farm payment systems they could still carry on using it if they so chose, but the economic benefits of actually growing cereals will mean that many of them will plough the land.
We can still have the six-metre strips around the fields and hedgerows on environmental means and I think that is also very good.
It is not really something to be debated tonight, but I think, in the health check, one of the things we will deal with is that there is no doubt that we will have to move to second generation biofuels and not actually use wheat and oil seed rape for biofuels.
Again, a year ago I was very much in favour of that when prices were low, but now when prices are high we will literally only fuel that.
I recommend to Parliament that we deal with this swiftly.
I thank all the groups for their support and I thank the Commissioner very much for her speedy response.
Together I think we can come to the right decision.
There are a few amendments here from the PSE Group and the Verts/ALE Group, most of which we will be able to support.
One, however, I cannot accept - and that is a tax on the export of grain, because farmers have suffered low prices in the past.
As soon as prices rise, please do not actually put a tax on it because that would not be quite right in my opinion.
If we are going to deal with market forces we are going to have to face up to the realities of life.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner for her presence this morning and now once again at this debate, which was added to the agenda at the last minute.
Most of all, however, I would like to thank her for her proposal to remove the compulsory set-aside for the coming season.
She complimented us on our speed, but the Commission has also shown that it is able to respond relatively quickly to developments within the market, which is now enduring a period of dwindling cereal supplies in the EU.
It is expected that stocks will reach an all-time low at the end of this season at worldwide level too.
An instrument to control supplies, such as the compulsory set-aside that was introduced in 1992, therefore no longer has any real purpose.
Consequently, it is only logical that the Commission is proposing that this obligation now be removed.
It is also logical that the Commission is retaining the set-aside system and is only reducing the compulsory percentage from the current 10% to 0%.
This will keep the debate on track.
After all, only when it is time for the health check is it time to discuss a potential change to the existing regulations and structures.
Furthermore, I understand that, should we agree to this proposal and should the Council also make a swift decision, it is likely that we will break a record for passing legislation quickly.
This will also send out a signal to citizens and to farmers in particular that, when necessary, the EU can also make rapid decisions.
There is just one more thing, however, that I would like to get off my chest, Madam President - not as a PPE spokesperson, but as a member of the CDA in the European Parliament from the Netherlands.
There are yet other sectors in which, given the current market development, a certain degree of flexibility would seem appropriate.
Take the dairy industry, for example, in which demand is increasing sharply and Europe is probably not making the most of its full potential.
One option is probably to make quotas that are not fully utilised in certain Member States marketable across borders, or to increase the quota even further on 1 April 2008 by a few percent.
Finally, Madam President, I would therefore like to make a personal appeal to the European Commission to show the same drive that is now being exhibited in respect of cereals in other sectors too, as and when necessary.
I too am pleased to see the Commissioner here and should like to say that current conditions on the cereals market oblige us to reflect, but above all to act, and I congratulate the Commission on its proactive stance.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament shares the Commissioner's analysis of the present situation and agrees that, within the health check, we shall have the opportunity to examine this issue in depth and take more fitting definitive decisions for the future.
We are also fully aware that the problem facing us cannot be solved merely by eliminating set-aside in the context of the transitional measures we are preparing to take, but agree that they might help significantly to redress the balance of the market in the coming year.
We share the opinion that this measure might, in a pessimistic scenario, bring at least half of the current 3.89 million hectares back into production and that could represent, in a year with normal climate conditions, additional production of between 5 and 10 million tonnes at least, even though some land is of the less productive variety, which is naturally why the farmers set them aside.
We think, however, that in order to achieve this objective, it would be appropriate for the Commission to extend this derogation slightly, that is to extend the validity of the measure to two years rather than one; and it is understandable that it should be prolonged because it is obvious that there is a lack of programming for agriculture and at the beginning of the next Autumn-Winter season we shall still not have a definitive decision on the outcome of the debate we shall be holding within the health check.
I therefore call on the Commission to take into account the amendment we will be tabling to that effect and which, I am sure, will merit a majority in tomorrow's plenary session.
On the other hand, we are all aware that bringing all this area back into production will have obvious negative impacts both as regards the release of CO2 from the ground, and as regards biodiversity, since everyone nowadays acknowledges the environmental added value which set-aside brought.
We therefore think that it would be appropriate for the Commission to carry out an impact study as soon as possible so that we are able to have all the relevant factors available for taking the decision which we shall be obliged to take within a year on this same subject.
(DE) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, yes, we have worked quickly, but the Commission has also been late in submitting its proposals.
This has been discussed for a long time and the growers' impatience has pretty much been fuelled by the question of when it will finally be over.
We have not held up anything, that is true, nor did we want to do that.
Your justification is that prices are high and some stabilisation was needed here.
I hope we are both pleased - and especially your husband with his enterprise - that money will finally be reaching the enterprises.
This has been long overdue, and we should be careful to say here that we must do something to push down prices.
What is more, this somewhat contradicts your statement this morning in relation to sugar.
You will remember that you said: with the price of grain as it is, people are now perhaps going faster into cereals and out of sugar.
If you force grain prices down again now, your own logic and your own intention could be undermined with it.
You address the fact that this entails crop rotations.
Yes, that is correct.
Originally, this was a measure associated with crop rotation, since crop rotation also needed vegetation.
This means we have to attend to the environmental aspect, even though this has been very much neglected in recent years, simply by making continual set-aside possible, whereby a large proportion would be taken into production for energy products.
We are asking you in an amendment not just to deal with what you have in mind for 2008, but also to tell us in Parliament how crop rotations are to be arranged with a view to environmental protection.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Parliament ought to see this as a new element, one which opens up a new period of reflection and a new debate on agricultural production in Europe.
The point is not only that we have had a change in climate and that in some rural areas we have had production difficulties.
The issue is that the entire system of agricultural production in this sphere is changing because, and there were some references to this in the previous debate, today many crops are being produced using different production systems, as we have heard.
The point is that we should now review the policy implemented for agricultural production in recent years by the European Community.
It is not only grains that are the issue, but in a few months' time we will also have to tackle the problems of meat production and dairy production, because there are already changes in production and drops in production in this field.
I therefore believe that the Commissioner and the Commission ought to have a careful period of reflection and enable Parliament to give a definitive response to these problems, to avoid the current situation: a rise in food costs that is causing problems for many families in Europe and elsewhere.
Madam President, at a time of spiralling and punitive increases in feedstuff prices, which is so hurting our intensive sector, it would be criminal to lock out of production land capable of decreasing our reliance on foreign imports.
Thus set-aside must go and must go now.
But more is needed, including a proactive plan to address the looming crisis in our intensive sectors.
For my part, such must include hands-on pressure on the multinational supermarket chains to give up the pricing strategy which suppresses farm-gate prices.
If this does not happen, we are facing wipe-out in much of our intensive sector.
Such would be the greatest failure of agricultural policy of our time and something, Madam Commissioner, which you must urgently address.
(ES) Mr President, to start with, I welcome the European Parliament's decision to adopt, by urgent procedure, the immediate abolition of mandatory set-aside.
I think that European consumers and farmers are the main victims of the massive increase in the price of agricultural raw materials.
I think that the current situation should lead us to undertake an in-depth discussion on the shift that is currently occurring in the common agricultural policy, and we should ensure that the decisions adopted in this area are in harmony with the global context, in which the demands of third countries are growing at a staggering rate, in particular due to the growth in consumption of countries such as India and China, which play a decisive role in the global economy.
If this deficit situation continues, I think that the European Union should think about creating new mechanisms to avoid unsustainable increases in food prices.
For years we have been hearing that the common agricultural policy involves excessive costs for European taxpayers, but I would now like governments to explain to citizens why they will now have to pay more for bread and milk.
I would also like governments to explain the measures that they are prepared to adopt in order to guarantee a fair price to consumers and prevent an excessive burden being placed on producers, which would endanger the profitability of many farms.
The world needs more and more food, and the exponential growth in consumption will not be resolved by an agricultural policy that is increasingly mean and stingy towards European producers.
I think that European leaders should think twice before putting producers between a rock and a hard place.
I think that the European Union should use the health check on the common agricultural policy to introduce mechanisms that avoid serious deficit situations in the future, if we do not want other global producers to monopolise the international markets.
(ES) Madam President, it is true that cereal stocks have decreased in recent years and we have already heard some reasons relating to the current climate - increasing consumption in emerging countries, adverse climate conditions in producer countries or production being reserved for internal consumption in exporting countries.
Neither can we forget the impact of certain speculative movements on the markets concerned, such as Paris or Chicago.
All of these issues have contributed to prices reaching historic highs.
However, according to data from the International Cereals Council, in addition to the problem of supply there is a problem of reserves: global reserves, which are below 17%, which according to the FAO guarantee food security, and Community reserves, which are practically exhausted in a market with prices that are above international levels.
In my opinion, Commissioner, in view of the health check we should think about the role in this crisis of the disappearance of the Community instruments to regulate the market.
The European Union is obsessed with the costs of managing stocks and the pressure from the World Trade Organization; it has reoriented its agriculture policy towards containing production and liberalising the markets and has turned its back on producers and consumers, abandoning the fundamental principal of the CAP: guaranteeing self sufficiency.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my support for the recultivation, on a voluntary basis, of land that is currently set aside in order to boost European production of cereals and oilseeds, to replenish stocks and thus ensure our self-sufficiency.
However, two production and marketing years seem necessary to allow farmers to adapt to this change.
It is also important that we apply quotas to cereal exports so that Europe's needs are met first.
Conversely, I am more cautious about the proposal for a measure abolishing taxes on animal feed.
I am well aware that the increase in food prices makes things very difficult for farmers, but I would not want this measure to open the floodgates to imports of genetically modified soya and maize.
However, I am in favour of promoting and encouraging the development of a European GMO-free animal feed industry, which would be in a better position to guarantee both our food security and our independence.
I would also like to point out that, although set-aside is no longer economically justified, it is vital for biodiversity and for soil and river protection, and this should be recognised and maintained.
The Socialist Group is therefore asking the Commission to carry out an environmental impact assessment of the effects of scrapping the set-aside scheme.
I am mainly thinking of the consequences that the abolition of set-aside would have on the necessary diversity of sources of pollen and nectar for bees, at a time when this sector is going through a serious crisis.
Finally, abolishing set-aside now will not help us resolve all of the problems at the heart of the CAP review in 2008 and 2009.
Member of the Commission. - Thank you, Madam President, and I should like to thank the Members very much for all the positive comments, for all the endeavours to stabilise our cereal market.
I feel quite well equipped now to continue this discussion in the Council tomorrow with the Member States and I hope that the legal act can be published within a short period.
I am quite sure farmers will be keeping an eye on us to see what decision will be taken here in Parliament and in the Council tomorrow.
I shall just speak briefly on the four different groups of amendments.
On the idea of extending this one-year 0% set-aside to two years, I must say that we will have the possibility of discussing the communication during the winter and the legal proposals next spring and summer, when we will have a clear idea of which direction we are moving in.
So I will not be able to support the idea of extending the one-year period, but we will return to this issue.
On the environmental benefits of the set-aside, it is obvious, as I said in my first intervention, that we will have to look into this in the health check to see whether we can find solutions to maintain the benefits of the environmental biodiversity issue in the set-aside.
On the monitoring of the cereal market, it is obvious that we will do everything possible to keep up a strong dialogue with Member States, stakeholders and the public at large to see in which direction the market is moving.
On Amendment 8 on export restrictions and the possible introduction of an export tax, I must say that this is not the way we want to follow.
It will send totally different and wrong signals to the market.
It will bring us into a situation similar to that of Russia and Ukraine, which we have both accused of using this tool to keep their production for themselves, and therefore this is not the way to follow.
