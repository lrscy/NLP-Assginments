I am sorry, but I must recommend that the Commission proposal be rejected.
As you know, cigarettes are not a tax-free commodity.
They are already subject to excise and value added tax and in Europe these taxes are extremely high, accounting for 70% to 80% of their price.
The Commission has proposed a fixed minimum tax of EUR 70, in addition to the system of proportional taxation which already applies.
The argument is that, instead of converging, taxation diverges from one country to another in the Union.
That is the first mistake.
It is not true that there are tax divergences; there is no particular convergence, but that is not the same as divergence.
There is greater convergence on cigarettes than there is with numerous other items, as confirmed in the independent study by the Directorate-General of Research of the European Parliament, which naturally was not written solely to back me up.
Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge?
Because they are one reason why prices differ, which is one reason why smuggling and tax fraud are on the rise.
Of course, these need to be stamped out and Parliament has repeatedly proposed measures which, unfortunately, have not been taken up, in order to stamp out cigarette smuggling.
But if price differences are to be wiped out, the difference in price itself needs to be wiped out.
The Commission has admitted that we do not know if tax convergence will bring about price convergence.
It is certain there will be no convergence because the industry is a monopoly industry and can therefore engage in strategic price setting.
These prices are not the result of market forces, they are competitive weapons used by the monopolies and we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we expect them to level out.
Similarly, the Commission proposal makes no provision whatsoever to harmonise value added tax, which fluctuates from one Member State to another by as much as 100%.
How can taxation be harmonised unless value added tax on cigarettes is harmonised at the same time?

Indeed smuggling - if it is smuggling to buy cheap cigarettes in one country of the Union in which the tax on them has been paid and sell them in another country in the Union in which they are more expensive, which in my view it is not, it is the normal working of the single market, but insofar as it is smuggling or if the tax is not paid, as in the case of England, where the situation will not change and which has a serious cigarette smuggling problem, with 50% of cigarettes smoked in England smuggled in, precisely because the tax costs as much as the price of the cigarettes, the situation will not be affected in England because the Commission proposal will not affect prices in Belgium, Holland or France, which is where the smuggled cigarettes come from.
On the contrary, prices will rise in the Member States in the south, especially, of course, if we accept the candidate countries into the European Union; or rather when we accept them, which I hope we shall, prices will rise there as a result of this directive by up to 200% to 400%.
Just imagine if there are derogations to cover this sort of price increase and just imagine what will happen with smuggling from the Ukraine or Russia or from China or India if we allow this sort of price increase.
The public health argument, that is, that higher prices reduce smoking, has also been wheeled out.
How do we know it will?
Because we have statistics.
But the statistics are based on legal cigarettes.
The increase in the price of cigarettes does indeed reduce legal smoking, but it encourages illegal smoking and in England the mafia is having a field day and has put the cigarette market completely out of kilter for precisely this reason.
Furthermore, Commissioner, I must say that the Council has not demonstrated the necessary respect or tact vis-Ã -vis Parliament, because a week before we submitted our opinion, it presented us with a political agreement in which it attempts to force our opinion.
I hardly think that is the way to run democratic institutions but if, nonetheless, that is how Parliament is to be run, then one wonders why we won the Cold War.
And I heard you say in your previous speech that you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal.
This makes we wonder how you can come along and support a measure from which, in the economic sector, only large monopolies stand to gain for reasons which, unfortunately, I cannot go into now, but you know full well that I am right, while, in the political sector, you come along with something which looks to me very much like totalitarianism.
I think that this sort of difference between the theory which we espouse and the practice which we follow should give you food for thought.
Mr President, the rapporteur is proposing rejection of the Commission's proposal.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are rather reluctant to do this without telling the Commission why, at least without giving the Commission a written explanation.
However, in conclusion it has to be said that the directive cannot remain as it is.
In its opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also made a number of comments.
It confined its comments to its particular field.
The issue of health protection undoubtedly has a role to play in this proposal for a directive.
However, this is not an issue for our committee.
The question of whether the minimum excise duty should be EUR 140, 120, 100, 80 or 60 is also undoubtedly significant in connection with health protection, but not for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
For us, it was exclusively legal considerations that mattered.
In this respect, the directive would appear to have two essential weaknesses, which mean that it does not stand up to scrutiny against reasonable internal market considerations.
Firstly, the system of having a minimum incidence of excise duty comes under pressure from the fact that value added tax is imposed on top of this minimum rate.
If I take a country where the rate of excise duty is the bare minimum required and the rate of value added tax is also very low, then I have to conclude that there are distortions of competition if I compare it with a country where the rate of excise duty perhaps exceeds the minimum and there is a relatively high rate of value added tax.
That is why we think that in the future, instead of requiring a minimum incidence of excise duty exclusive of value added tax, it would be appropriate to work on the basis of a system which provides for a minimum rate of excise duty inclusive of the applicable value added tax.
The second point concerns Article 3(1).
We think that this proposal no longer draws a proper distinction between cigarettes and cigarillos or cigars.
The proposal tries to give the impression that cigarillos with filters are cigarettes with dark-coloured wrappers and that they should be taxed accordingly, like cigarettes.
We believe that this is wrong.
The health effects of filters can certainly be disputed, but it ought to be indisputable that a cigarillo with a filter is in any case slightly more healthy than a cigarillo without a filter.
If, however, I treat cigarillos with filters as equivalent to cigarettes for tax purposes - and I am not a cigarillo smoker! - then I penalise the fundamentally healthier product by taxing it like a cigarette.
That is why I think that improvements also need to be made here.
We agree with the conclusion that the proposal should be rejected.
Even if it sounds harsh, technical improvements are necessary.
. (NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I would thank the Commission for the proposal on upward convergence of excise on tobacco.
Parliament requested this a few years ago and the Commission is now meeting this request.
In our view, the proposal is an improvement on the current situation and also solves a number of problems, including that of continuing to allow for exceptions, as is the case for Sweden now and the accession countries in future.
For that reason, we believe it is a considered proposal.
We did, however, table a number of amendments.
Firstly, there is the issue of VAT which Messrs Katiforis and Wieland also mentioned.
I share their point of view on this score, and that is why my group has re-tabled the amendment that was already adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, namely to include VAT in the equation.
Secondly, our committee was of the opinion that the issue should be clearly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, for the latter plays a major role in this.
Thirdly, we believe that a great deal must be done against smuggling.
I do not subscribe to the rapporteur' s point of view that an increase in excise will, in itself, promote smuggling or, vice versa, that a reduction in excise will lead to a drop in the incidence of smuggling.
I am of the opinion that completely different measures should be taken against smuggling, which are, in fact, the topic of debate in the World Trade Organisation.
Furthermore, we have tabled an amendment on tobacco subsidies, a much-debated topic which is also relevant in this context.
We have also tabled an amendment in which we state that, concerning products which are less unhealthy, we should be working towards a system, maybe not now, but in 2005, whereby the excise on those products would also be lower.
We therefore support the gist of the Commission proposal, as well as the position which the Council has already adopted in this respect.
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions on which I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, not because we talk the same language or are from the same country, but because we agree on what is called common sense.
I am sorry, but common sense is nowhere to be seen in this proposal for a directive, which we, too, propose should be rejected in its entirety.
If it is not rejected, we are all in danger of exposing ourselves because, if this sort of directive is adopted, it will have exactly the opposite of, what the Council says, are the desired results.
I should also like to point out that it would be most useful if the Council were present rather than absent, like their common sense.
The Council says that the aim is to combat tax evasion and cigarette smuggling.
If we increase tax, then we shall increase tax evasion.
We all know that, the higher the tax, the more attractive tax evasion becomes.
If we increase the price of cigarettes, as is proposed, then we shall, without question, increase cigarette smuggling because we shall be making legal cigarettes more expensive than smuggled cigarettes.
So we shall be working counter to our aims.
Again, the Council tells us that one of its aims is to protect public health and that this aim will be achieved by people giving up smoking because cigarettes are more expensive.
And who can say that people stop smoking when cigarettes go up in price?
The best case scenario is that there will be no change in the consumption of cigarettes.
The worst case scenario is that smokers on low incomes will change to cheaper, that is, more harmful cigarettes.
Is that what we want to achieve?
How clever of us!
Similarly, the proposals in the proposed directive are wrong because, first of all, they restrict application to five, mainly southern countries.
The other ten are not affected because they are already at the topmost point.
Secondly, the cost of living will rise in these five countries, four of which are southern countries, without any increase in wages, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures.
I also think we should ask ourselves what the candidate countries have to say about this proposal for a directive?
Do they think it shows the European Union's concern for them?
And it would be helpful to know how their governments are going to persuade them that integration into the European Union will benefit consumers, when they will have to pay 200 to 500% more for cigarettes under this sort of directive.
Finally, I should like to express my disappointment with Ecofin for its rushed attempt to pre-empt tomorrow's vote here by issuing details of its compromise agreement.
That was a mistake on their part.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for this proposal.
The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him.
Only yesterday in this House we passed a resolution giving the European Parliament's opinion on the third round of negotiations for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
This House should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union. It is like no other product.
Each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco. In Scotland, which I represent, 13,000 people died last year due to smoking.
The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking.
This proposal will introduce a cash minimum amount of cigarette duty.
Currently the rule is expressed as a percentage of tax, inclusive of the retail selling price, and therefore has little effect on Member States and applicant countries where retail prices are already low.
The more expensive a packet of cigarettes, the bigger the incentive to stop smoking.
Some say that the most effective way to help smokers cure their addiction is to make cost the issue.
Therefore any measures to reduce smoking are more than welcome and are more important to my mind than any arguments which support the tobacco industry.
As regards smuggling, unlike the rapporteur I believe this proposal will prevent smuggling within the EU.
Minimum EU rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling.
The Commission's proposal is a good proposal and therefore should be wholeheartedly supported.
Mr President, it strikes me that the Katiforis report does not explain why the European Commission proposal to change excise duty rates for tobacco is being rejected.
It appears impossible to underpin this position.
As this new proposal introduces changes to existing directives, the legal base is not at issue.
One of the reasons for change is the fact that the Member States miss out on a huge amount of excise on account of fraud and smuggling.
The internal market, therefore, still leaves something to be desired, and there is also competitive distortion.
If the discrepancies between the Member States become less pronounced, fraud and smuggling will be discouraged and will, hopefully, even vanish altogether.
Furthermore, the necessary increase in tobacco excise for a number of Member States, following on from this proposal, will not cause any damage to health.
For the reasons already stated, I welcome a minimum excise duty of 57%.
Where smuggling practices persist and even involve tobacco manufacturers, the European Commission will need to take additional measures.
I have already called for the dismantling of tobacco subsidies several times.
The amendments by Mr Maaten therefore receive my unqualified support.
The European Union is still very much lacking credibility on this score.
On the one hand, tobacco consumption is discouraged by warning labels, bans on tobacco advertising and higher excise, while on the other hand EUR 1 billion goes up in smoke in the form of tobacco subsidies.
Supporting tobacco growers in the switch to another crop which also entails subsidies, is a very generous solution and therefore deserves Parliament' s support.
I call on the Council to support the European Commission proposals and to stand up to the pressure exerted by one or two Member States.
Moreover, I object to Mr Folias' appropriation of common sense.
I could claim with just as much justification that everyone is entitled to their own stupidity.
Mr President, the position taken by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal under discussion has surprised me.
It diverges considerably from the position taken by this Parliament in 1996.
At that time, Parliament urged the Commission to make proposals for upward harmonisation of tobacco prices, based upon higher duty rates across the Union for reasons including health protection, and to consider measures to reduce the scope for price manipulation by cigarette producers applying widely diverging pre-tax on the markets of each Member State.
The present Commission proposal is consistent with that opinion.
That is why I say that the advice of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has greatly surprised me.
The Commission is doing what Parliament wanted in 1996 and therefore it is odd that the report should not accept the Commission's proposal.
The changes proposed will bring about increased convergence in duty rates within the European Union and, as such, improve the functioning of the internal market, both now and as it will be after enlargement.
They will also reduce the incentive for excise fraud within the Union.
More surprisingly - and Mr Blokland has just drawn attention to this - the draft report does not set out the reasons for rejecting the Commission proposal.
That is the least that the Commission would have expected.
According to the working document presented by the rapporteur to EMAC in June, the main justification is that the introduction of a minimum amount of taxation of EUR 70 for cigarettes constitutes a shift towards specific taxation, and would disadvantage small- and medium-sized producers in southern Member States.
I would like to emphasise that this is emphatically not the view of the Commission.
The introduction of a fixed amount in euro does not alter the structure of excise duties on cigarettes.
Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount will retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportions of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation, as other rules remain unchanged.
I would also like to point out that the Commission proposal has received broad support in the Council.
Last week in the Ecofin Council the Member States unanimously agreed a compromise text produced by the Belgian Presidency, which is clearly in line with the Commission's proposal.
For cigarette taxation, the most significant element is the introduction of a minimum amount of duty of EUR 60 at the initial stage and EUR 64 at a later stage, rather than the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission.
The adoption of the proposal is also extremely important in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union eastwards.
Mr Folias has quite rightly drawn our attention to that aspect of the proposal.
The existing minimum taxation requirement - the so-called 57% rule - allows for a higher degree of price manipulation and would not in itself be sufficient to reduce to a sustainable level the gap between the tax and price levels of the present Member States and the candidate countries.
Such a situation would result in substantial revenue loss for present Member States, especially those having borders with candidate countries.
The requirement for a minimum amount of duty will avoid this happening and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market after enlargement.
The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries.
Therefore, it has proposed that the Council grant limited transitional periods to candidate countries for reaching the minimum rate of taxation.
Next, I was pleased to see that the two Parliament committees that have issued opinions on the proposal - the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with Mr Maaten as draftsman, and the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mr Wieland as draftsman - accepted the general thrust of the proposal, subject to a number of amendments.
Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's report have been re-tabled in this plenary.
The Commission broadly shares the concerns of Mr Maaten on the need to pay more attention to health policy and to combat fraud and smuggling.
I do not see why Mr Katiforis cannot accept the arguments relating to health.
It is a well known fact - and I am sure he is aware of it - that 75% of smokers started before the age of 18.
Report after report and study after study confirm that for young people under the age of 18, price clearly is a determining factor in terms of smoking.
I was pleased to hear both Mrs Stihler and Mr Blokland support the view of the Commission that there is a direct link between price and quantity consumed and that therefore the price very definitely has a bearing on health.
Mr Folias said that if the price goes up then cheaper cigarettes will be purchased and smoked.
According to that reasoning, if the price went down then more expensive cigarettes would also be purchased.
That is something that, in reality, is not noticeable.
Therefore, with all due respect to Mr Folias, his reasoning is not in line with reality.
While I am answering specific questions by Parliament, I have to say that I do not understand the argument by Mr Wieland - referring to the legal aspects of the case - when he says that the interplay of VAT and excise taxes would be illegal.
Of course they have a bearing on competition and smuggling, as we all know, but why should this be illegal, as he maintains?
The point of view of his committee is based on the legal state of affairs.
He says that there is a problem in that cigarillos of a certain dimension and character should be treated as cigars and not as cigarettes.
Well, I have some here.
If you showed an average citizen of the European Union this packet of cigarillos, took one of them out - of the same dimensions and weight as an ordinary cigarette - and asked them if it was more like a cigarette or more like a cigar, I would wager Mr Wieland 144 packets of cigarettes or cigarillos - whichever he prefers - that the average citizen of the European Union would classify them as cigarettes.
Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's opinion have been retabled for this plenary.
The Commission broadly shares these concerns on the need to pay more attention to health policy.
But the amendments require no change to the proposal.
According to the existing review requirements, the Commission already has the obligation to take into account the wider Treaty objectives, including health.
New developments, resulting for instance from the conclusion of a WHO framework convention on tobacco control, will thus automatically have to be taken into consideration in a subsequent review.
The Commission and the Member States have also taken a number of initiatives to combat fraud and smuggling following the conclusions of the high-level group on fraud in the field of excise duties.
To conclude, for the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and still considers the proposals by the Commission to be a direct reply to Parliament's own opinion expressed in 1996.
Therefore the Commission invites all Members of Parliament who have expressed an opinion contrary to that of the Commission to reconsider their position on this issue very carefully before tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have just shown us an example.
May I ask you whether the Commission is of the view that tobacco products, like Commissioners, should be assessed not on their packaging but on their content?
Mr President, the Commission always looks at content, rather than form.
But the form in this respect is important.
If you ask the ordinary citizen of the European Union, "What is this?
Is this more like a cigarette or more like a cigar?" Because it is exactly the same size as a cigarette, has the same width and the same weight limits, he will say, without a shadow of a doubt, "This is like a cigarette" and not "This is like a cigar".
That is the Commission's opinion too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European Council in spring 2002
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0528/01) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's synthesis report in preparation for the Spring 2002 European Council.
Mr President, in March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set out a new strategy for the coming decade.
At that time we were working on the basis of very optimistic economic data and really thought that we could bring about sustainable growth of at least 3%, along with economic reform, full employment and also social inclusion.
Today our starting point is more difficult because the global economy has gone in the opposite direction and even the European Union, despite its readiness to reform and the reforms which it has already implemented, is experiencing an economic downturn.
That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described?
This question is all the more pertinent for the spring summit in Barcelona because, after evaluating a strategy of this kind for two years, it ought to be possible to identify the areas where national and European policy have actually been guided by the quantitative and qualitative objectives and see to what extent it has been possible to bundle measures together and make them visible.
The Member States' budgets have actually shown uniform increases across the board in investment in research and development, innovation and further development of the information and communication society.
The few figures which are available to us in the European Parliament unfortunately do not yet speak the specific language which we would have liked, because we had hoped that the Lisbon strategy and its consistent implementation would also have yielded visible added value as a result of economic, financial, employment and social policy being coordinated at European level, so as to demonstrate to the public the benefits which European policy can have for them and quite specifically how it can improve their quality of life and work.
We should certainly also ask what approach has been adopted to achieve the ambitious aim of increasing investment in the European Union.
How has cross-border investment in infrastructure actually been made visible apart from through reports?
The European Parliament needs to ask all of these questions because, in drafting its synthesis report, the Commission has the duty of actually producing a blueprint for the further consultations at the spring summit, which will then, of course, in the end, form the broad guidelines of the future economic policy of the European Union and its Member States.
In the current economic downturn and at a time when we are also facing particular challenges because of the adverse economic consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September - and in considering these issues we have to take into account a new aspect, the collapse of consumer confidence - we must also ask ourselves the following question: what can we do to stop a self-fulfilling prophecy, which states that we are sliding into recession, from becoming a reality?
The Commission therefore bears great responsibility for taking more of a lead on setting targets and taking more practical action to reform the economy, not only with respect to the labour market, but also with respect to the other markets, full employment and also social inclusion, by issuing specific guidance on these areas.
Of course this also raises the question, and I should also like to address this particularly to you, Commissioner, of whether the tax situation, where unfortunately we still have countries pursuing independent national policies rather than coordinated ones, does not have an adverse impact on investment in the European Union and, in particular, on cross-border investment.
Commissioner, the European Parliament is still not clear about how it is actually, finally to be involved in this whole process, which is now approaching its second spring summit.
So far we have not been involved as partners in the macro-economic dialogue.
There are no plans to organise another forum with all of the stakeholders, as was done before the Lisbon meeting.
It really is legitimate to ask whether the European Parliament's involvement is adequate and whether it is therefore able to represent the interests of the people in this process of setting priorities for the European Union's economic and structural policy.
We really are in a situation where we need to mobilise our forces and rally optimism.
How do you envisage doing this in your synthesis report?
What working methods do you intend to choose and which guidelines do you intend to issue in it?
Mr President, in reply to the questions from Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say first of all that the Commission's synthesis report for the spring European Council in March 2002 is currently being prepared.
As requested by the European Council, that report will assess the progress made on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the Lisbon strategy.
I mention the environmental dimension in particular since the GÃ¶teborg Summit.
Part of this assessment will consider the progress made by Council and Parliament on the Lisbon reform agenda.
The assessment will draw on the series of structural indicators which have been proposed by the Commission in its communication of 30 October 2001.
As Mrs Randzio-Plath knows, those structural indicators are a very accurate reflection of the progress made and the Commission thinks it is a valuable instrument.
The objective of sustainable development will underpin the assessment of each strand of that strategy.
The focus of the synthesis report will also depend on further work by this Parliament and the Council up to the end of this year.
It is somewhat early, therefore, to be specific about the contents and structure of the reports at this stage.
I agree nevertheless with Mrs Randzio-Plath that the synthesis report will need to take account of the likely situation by the time the Barcelona European Council is held. This means, on the one hand, the new international situation to which she has referred, and, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro on 1 January next year.
At the recent informal summit in Ghent, Heads of State and Government and the Commission renewed their commitment to pursuing the Lisbon strategy of structural and economic reform and social renewal with determination as a response to both those factors, the new environment and the introduction of the euro.
Continuity and the long-term focus of the reform agenda will need to be maintained, especially in view of the current economic downturn.
The economic situation in the euro area and worldwide has made it necessary to adjust economic policy.
But the confirmation by the Ghent European Council of its commitment to the stability and growth pact has brought confidence that the basic policy framework of economic and monetary union will be preserved and it has certainly facilitated the recent further adjustments in monetary policy.
This shows that economic policy coordination is working.
Nonetheless there is still further scope for strengthening economic policy coordination in line with the proposals put forward by the Commission, with a view to fostering a common assessment of the economic situation and appropriate economic policy responses.
To reinforce that message, Mr Prodi is writing to this Parliament, to the President of the Council and to the Heads of State and Government this week, urging them to continue their efforts to make progress before Barcelona on key elements of the Lisbon reforms, such as the Community patent and the telecoms review, in line with the existing timetable, as well as on a number of the financial services proposals.
The synthesis report by its nature covers a wide area of the Commission's activity.
A number of Commission services are therefore contributing to its preparation and this work is being monitored at political level by a group of Commissioners dealing with growth, competitiveness, employment and sustainable development.
The report should be adopted by the Commission on 15 January 2002 and will be submitted to this Parliament on the same day.
By submitting the report at an early stage, it is intended to allow the other European institutions to give their views on the report in good time in order to contribute to the work of the European Council in Barcelona.
I believe that is precisely what Mrs Randzio-Plath wants.
Lastly, with regard to the open method of coordination, that is largely intended in the context of the Lisbon strategy to develop indicators at Member State level and to share best practice and experience.
It is used in line with the principles set out in the White Paper on governance in areas where legislative action under the methode communataire, the Community method, is not possible.
I hope I have answered the questions put by Mrs Randzio-Plath.
As I have said on earlier occasions, I shall be delighted to come and make a presentation to her committee and discuss what the Commission intends to do at the Barcelona Summit in further detail.
But it would be useful if my future discussion with the EMAC committee could take place after 15 January, because by then both Parliament and I will be in possession of the documents that will be the Commission's input into the Barcelona Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to support the position expressed by the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the issue we are debating.
I am pleased that Commissioner Bolkestein has said that he is willing to discuss the content of the proposed synthesis report in committee, since it must be the basis for a discussion at a meeting which we hope will be very important and which will take place in my city and the city of the President for this sitting.
We therefore have a special interest in Barcelona being a genuine success and that it be remembered as a truly significant advance in terms of the commitments we have been taking on since the meeting in Lisbon last year.
I would like to insist on one aspect which both the Commission and the Liberal Group have been highlighting.
This is the need to consolidate and clarify the mechanisms and objectives in the field of economic and monetary policy.
There is a degree of confusion, as you know, and this has been discussed both in the Commission and in this House, between the Europe of the euro (which, as the Commissioner has said, is now close to completing its final stage with the introduction of notes and coins), the external representation of the euro and, on the other hand, the system for adopting decisions in the field of economic and monetary policy.
We know that this situation is unsatisfactory and the current crisis highlights this.
We hope that the present situation can be genuinely overcome, in the way that Commissioner Bolkestein' s colleague, Commissioner Solbes, has often said optimistically. However, at the same time he has been obliged to lower the growth forecasts.
I would therefore like to insist on this aspect and on another which the Commissioner has not mentioned and which I believe is very important within the various elements of Lisbon and their subsequent implementation: the training and technology element.
Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010, in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States, which was the term of reference established in Lisbon.
I believe that this is an element which also has to be introduced into this synthesis report, and at subsequent meetings views have been expressed in agreement with this.
I thank Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and Mrs Randzio-Plath for the remarks they have made.
I stress the fact that progress made since Lisbon has been insufficient.
In the area of financial services, for example, the Commission intends to have a mid-term review meeting in February next year to stimulate more political interest in perfecting the internal market and achieving the difficult targets we were set by the Lisbon European Council.
But I stress that we have not done what we should have.
Considerable difficulties remain and we must use the meeting in Lisbon to make further progress.
It would be a good thing if Ecofin ministers were present in Barcelona so that they could do, on the spot, what members of the European Council want them to do.
So far members of the European Council have engaged in laudatory statements but when ministers have to deal with the subjects at hand the political will seems to evaporate.
If the Ecofin ministers were to be present at the Barcelona Council perhaps they could solve these problems there and then.
In the case of patents, the European Council has instructed the Council to come to a decision before Christmas this year.
I am not optimistic.
That underscores the need for the Barcelona European Council to be practical and emphasises the need to make more progress than have been made up until now.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]
Mr President, the European Parliament is offering the Commission the opportunity to correct the proposed regulation it delivered to Parliament and the Council.
The intention of the report, approved by the Committee on Fisheries that we are discussing at the moment, is to correct the rigidity of this proposal, which is currently preventing progress being made in finding solutions to problems for the people affected by the non-renewal of the EC-Morocco fisheries agreement.
From the time the agreement expired, on 30 November 1999, until the time it became clear that a new agreement would not be reached, owners of more than 400 vessels and some 4 300 fishermen were both hopeful and fearful at the time when negotiations between the Community and Morocco were being prolonged.
It was not until 26 March 2001 that Commissioner Fischler announced that it had been impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
From that moment, the Community set itself the objective of converting the affected fishing fleet.
By presenting this proposed regulation, the Commission is conforming to the guidelines set by the Nice European Council of 7 December 2000.
At that Summit, the European Council ordered the Commission to propose a specific action plan for the restructuring of this Community fleet.
I must state clearly that this proposed regulation does not conform to the needs of the sector in question.
Once again the Commission seems to be presenting proposals, the objective of which we do not understand, that do not amount to decisive action in support of a fleet and certain regions which are suffering a serious crisis.
In fact, rather than helping to preserve most of the fleet and its economic activity, the Commission is presenting a rigid proposal which, if the Council approves it without the substantial amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, will have the effect of breaking up a fleet for which the ship owners and local authorities of those regions feel capable of finding alternatives.
This proposal must therefore be amended in the way approved by the Committee on Fisheries, so that the actions proposed may have a beneficial effect on the sector in question.
The Committee on Fisheries does not share the Commission' s breaking-up approach.
The Commission could have focussed on the existing opportunities in alternative sectors, such as the processing industry, aquiculture and especially the promotion of fisheries products.
In the same way, the proposal excludes sectors directly affected by the non-renewal of the agreement, such as the non-extractive fisheries industries.
The land-based companies, during the long negotiation process, have suffered a series of economic setbacks that have led to employment rationalisations and redundancies, leading to considerable losses.
Today they are faced with a future just as uncertain as that of the fleet they depend on.
Faced with this breaking-up approach, the sector affected and the regional authorities have reached verbal agreements with companies and ship owners from various Maghreb countries to create mixed companies, and in this way, according to the estimates of the sector, in the small-scale sector, around a hundred vessels could be relocated with the help of this specific measure, if it were more flexible, thereby reducing to 26 those vessels destined for scrapping.
This would maintain an economic activity which is vital to certain regions and ensure that those who want to continue being ship owners and fishermen are able to do so.
The amendments contained in the Committee on Fisheries' report, in summary, modify the proposed regulation in the following fashion:
In addition to ship owners and fishermen, the land-based fisheries industry which was directly linked to the existence of this agreement are included, provided that their losses exceed 70%.
The requirement that the people affected must have been subsidised for a period of at least nine consecutive months as a result of inactivity in order to benefit now from this specific measure is removed.
This requirement leads to the exclusion of those people who, sometimes temporarily, found alternative work while waiting for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco to be reached.
This is all the more serious if we bear in mind that these ship owners and fishermen had not been warned that, if they found an activity, they would be penalised when it came to conversion.
The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the requirement to return aid granted for modernisation.
It is not right to apply penalties of a backdated nature in the case of aid which was not subject to these conditions at the time of being granted.
The Commission' s proposal intends to increase public aid per ship owner by 20% in the case of scrapping or transfer to a third country.
The Committee on Fisheries believes that fishermen must also benefit from this increase of 20%.
We have also redistributed the sum allocated to this specific measure in such a way that the amount intended for scrapping is 30%, for the creation of mixed companies, 35%, and for socio-economic measures, also 35%.
This would lead to better implementation of the specific measure.
Lastly, I will mention the budgetary aspect.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Nice European Council, the Commission proposes granting up to EUR 197 million for this specific measure.
It proposes implementing the flexibility instrument in 2002 and allocating the appropriations corresponding to heading 2 of the financial perspectives.
The saving resulting from the non-renewal of the agreement has been EUR 500 million.
It is natural that the Community should also contribute to the cost of converting this fleet.
Mr President, this House may be listening for the last time to words relating to what, for fourteen years, we have known as the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
Tomorrow, on voting on the report we are debating today, our institution will write the last page of a story that has been told since August 1987, when the European Union signed its first fisheries agreement with that country, but which for Spain goes back almost twenty-five years.
There are therefore Community fishermen and ship owners whose lives have been exclusively linked with the existence of the Moroccan fishing grounds.
Our obligation today is to close this chapter with the greatest possible dignity and responsibility towards this sector, which is going to suffer an unprecedented fisheries conversion.
We must thank the Commission for their efforts over the last two long years to try to make tomorrow' s vote unnecessary.
But, given that the situation is irreversible, we must also recognise the solidarity contained in the Commission' s proposal, its recognition that the end of an era cannot be marked by the spectacle of us being miserly towards those people who are waiting anxiously for this plan in order to carry on living and working, the financial cost of which is fully justified.
We hope that the other institutions have sufficient dignity to accept this need.
The amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries, above all, contribute to adding a greater degree of flexibility in order to allow Community solidarity to truly benefit a very heterogeneous fleet, which over the last two years has not ceased to seek its own solutions; solutions which greater legislative rigidity may contribute to blocking.
Furthermore, our main obligation is to approve this report in order to provide the necessary legal basis so that on second reading of the budget the necessary appropriations can be provided to finance the restructuring plan. This restructuring plan will no doubt put an end to part of an historic fleet, but it must not mean the end of fisheries relations with Morocco.
It is impossible to imagine that Morocco really wants to turn its back on the European Union, amongst other things because we share two seas and we are obliged to be neighbours, and Morocco can only benefit from this proximity.
I therefore ask the Commission to remain receptive and promote any mutually beneficial fishing cooperation initiative which may arise in the future.
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for the wonderful work she has done.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council regulation on the promotion of the conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, which is the subject of the excellent report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, deserves our unreserved approval.
The proposal shows that the European Union cares about the fate of such vulnerable and fragile activities, whose survival depended on the renewal or non-renewal of a fishing agreement with Morocco.
European solidarity works and continues to work.
That is for the sceptics.
The Commission proposal considers the problems of conversion from its economic and social angles.
It also has the merit of mobilising new money, EUR 197 million, which is compatible with the mobilisation of other resources already allocated under the Structural Funds.
In Portugal there are 570 fishermen who receive support under this programme, 400 of whom live in Sesimbra, a small, attractive fishing and tourist town very close to Lisbon.
Of these 400 who live in Sesimbra, 150 are already over 55 years old, which means they can be moved into early retirement, since at this age it is difficult to retrain them for a different job.
In simple terms, while the shipowners are liable to receive supplements of 20%, the same is not true for the fishermen, which to me seems an injustice.
Now, the fishermen will be able to get EUR 10 000 euros over one year if they do not do any other work.
The possibility of a 20% increase, although modest, would allow them to raise that sum to EUR 12 000, which would make it rather more attractive.
Furthermore, the proposal has quite a rigid structure and should be made more flexible, allowing the Member States, in this case Portugal and Spain, to adapt better to situations that are truly complex and sometimes do not fit within the rigid stays of the regulation.
This flexibility should be accepted so that the aid already granted by the end of 2001 should not all be accounted for under the part of FIFG Article 4 intended for socio-economic measures, and all of it within the Lisbon and Tagus valley region, and it would be better if it could be diluted in other programmes.
Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I entirely agree with the content and proposals of the report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, which I think are lucid and sensible, particularly those dealing with the possibility of supporting processing activities that were dependent on fishing.
Indeed, it does not make sense that certain fishery-dependent processing and marketing activities, which in this case have been hit very hard, should not also be funded.
For this reason, too, we are grateful for the report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
Mr President, I am pleased to inform the House that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement will enter into force on 11 December. This follows the thirtieth ratification by Malta, shamefully with no ratifications by the EU.
Turning to Morocco, the Greens will be voting against this proposal, not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work, but because we oppose this particular package.
Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people, those involved in Morocco.
This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners.
Secondly, it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries, including flags of convenience, and there are still no controls in place to prevent this.
Thirdly, it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise, we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers' money.
Clearly, the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed.
Morocco is the first, but there are more to come.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs MiguÃ©lez for the excellent work she has done.
Its quality is all the more notable insofar as it deals with an issue which is hugely traumatic for a large number of people who depend on fishing in Portugal and in Galicia, Andalucia and the Canary Islands in Spain.
It is a question of finding the best possible way to alleviate the effects of what I believe to be, if you pardon the expression, the chronicle of a death foretold.
For a long time my group has been warning the House of the risks of not linking the fisheries agreement with Morocco to the association agreement.
Today all I can say is that the Kingdom of Morocco has not shown the willingness to negotiate that we expect from a trading partner.
I would like to acknowledge the Commission' s efforts to lessen the impact of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but I am not going to repeat what has already been said.
It is sufficient to refer to the interventions of the rapporteur and Mrs Fraga, for example, to realise that the Committee on Fisheries has considerably improved on the Commission' s proposal, by making it fairer.
In this respect, it only remains for me to ask, as my group will do, the House to approve the report of the Committee on Fisheries, written by Mrs MiguÃ©lez, tomorrow, and that, once approved by Parliament, the report may quickly be provided with the appropriate financial instruments so that it can be implemented.
And, in this respect, I would like to make it clear that the budgetary flexibility instrument is essential.
Ladies and gentlemen, it would be horrendous, to give an example, if an Objective 1 region, with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, which also suffers the consequences of the competition created by the very favourable agreements which we, Europeans, have granted to Morocco in the fruit products sector, not only suffered the effects of a tough conversion as a result of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but that, furthermore, as a result of the budgetary miserliness of certain people, it also ended up without Structural Funds.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it is so late, I will try to be very brief and concise.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs MiguÃ©lez, for the good work she has done despite the urgency of the issue.
I would also like to congratulate all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the work they have done.
I believe that together we have all been able to meet the demands of the circumstances: the rapporteur, the authors of the amendments, those who have made it possible to reach compromises and the Members who have supported us. I thank them all for their understanding and solidarity.
The urgency procedure, as I said, always obliges us to work more quickly than we would have liked, but, even so, the result has been very positive.
I now hope the Commission takes account of the significant improvements which the Committee on Fisheries has introduced into its proposal.
I will highlight the extension of aid, better coverage and, above all, the flexibility introduced into the application of the various measures under discussion.
Secondly, we must speak about the funding of this plan, although this is not strictly an issue for our committee.
In Nice, the Council made a political commitment at the highest level, at the level of Heads of State and Government, to the people affected by the dramatic situation created following the failure of the negotiations with Morocco.
I believe that the European Commission has also been able to meet the demands of the circumstances, and I would like to acknowledge that here: the use of the flexibility instrument and the EUR 197 million it proposes for funding demonstrate this.
I therefore congratulate them.
I now ask Parliament' s Committee on Budgets and the Council to support the European Commission and the European Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and reach the necessary compromise so that this essential EUR 197 million can be used for the proposed purpose.
There is a political commitment and a favourable opinion from this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and we strongly urge that they be complied with.
Mr President, it is vital that this report should be approved so that a decision can be taken at the next Fisheries Council on the restructuring programme for the fleet that operated in Morocco and that has been idle since the end of 1999, affecting Portuguese and Spanish fishermen and shipowners and the populations of the areas where they live.
The fact is that compensation for the stoppage finishes at the end of this year.
The central question, then, is the allocation of EUR 197 million for the restructuring programme that is to commence in January 2002, which should be improved along the lines proposed in the MiguÃ©lez Ramos report.
For our part, we consider the proposal the Commission has made of using a flexibility instrument in the budget to be acceptable, and we regret that the matter was not made clearer during the first reading of the budget by the European Parliament, inserting the amounts on the line and requesting the use of the flexibility instrument, as in fact the Committee on Fisheries had proposed, as our chairman has just reminded us.
It is, therefore, important that the next Budgetary Council should stop blocking and take these proposals into account, creating the solution that will allow the fleet restructuring programme to come into force early next year.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is late, but we are awake, wide-awake even.
The alarm bells are ringing, the Gordian knot has not yet been hacked in two, but Parliament, I hope, is not giving up.
What is at stake here?
At stake are jobs and the way the people of Europe perceive the EU.
Thanks to the emergency motion tabled by our colleague, Daniel Varela, we have an opportunity this evening to discuss an issue which is as problematic as it is urgent.
It concerns how to deal openly and honestly with the consequences which the failure of the negotiations with Morocco have had for the Iberian peninsular.
The bare facts are quickly stated: since November 1990, we have heard, the EU fleet - in practice deep-sea fishermen from Spain and Portugal - has no longer been able to fall back on the resources off the coast of Morocco.
The 4 300 fishermen and 400 vessels affected are hoping that the compensation payments will be continued when they expire in December 2001, as Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos has explained to us so convincingly.
Behind these figures there are people, families and whole communities who are committed to a traditional industry and we now need to give that industry prospects for the future.
In so doing, our efforts should certainly not be confined solely to giving financial handouts.
It is much more important that we - and here I would bring the Commission and the Council on board too - succeed in producing a comprehensive plan which is convincing and whose aim is to provide reduced, but no less profitable, fishing activity, or alternative work.
I would take this report as a further direct indication of how extremely important and urgent it is to reform the European Union's common fisheries policy, a task which is occupying all of us at the moment.
It is no coincidence that the individual key words - external relations, trade agreements, capacity reduction and extensive restructuring - are also a leitmotif in the working documents on the reform.
The current situation in Spain and Portugal also highlights the fact that it is now high time to conclude a package which is really worthy of the name reform.
It is unacceptable to reduce members of a proud industry to the level of being simply recipients of charity.
As a Community of values we must not allow this.
Falling yields have, I believe, helped us to recognise the huge challenges.
Let us now work together to identify the right action to take and let us show the flexibility which the rapporteur and also other colleagues have reminded us is so important.
Mr President, the proposal that the Commission is putting forward is to be welcomed but needs improving.
I shall highlight three aspects in this regard: the first is that there is no sense in the rigidity that the draft regulation imposes regarding the percentage of the funding to be allocated to each type of measure.
What would make sense would be to allow each Member State the flexibility, within the overall envelope, to allocate these funds according to its own needs, with clear rules.
For instance, in the case of Portugal, funds for destroying vessels should be reduced and funds for restructuring some of these ships and for the social part should be increased.
Secondly, an envelope of this kind should also include funding for the economic conversion of the areas most affected by fishing, and include in this compensation framework collateral activities such as the processing industry.
This would mean, right from the outset, that the financial envelope would need reinforcing, which unfortunately has not happened in this proposal by the Commission, which even so is arguing about certain problems of budgetary procedure.
The third aspect I should like to highlight is that, in the Commission' s view, the aim of this aid is essentially to close a chapter in the common fisheries policy, which was the agreement with Morocco, without making the effort which I believe was needed to expand the fishing possibilities for these countries in third countries' waters, and without duly providing for measures, which again were needed, to help these companies become more international more easily.
The Committee on Fisheries has tabled some amendments, and I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, who has made such an effort in this process.
We, ourselves, have also tried to do our part with amendments that will clearly improve this proposal where it has gaps.
As Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez said, since there was no political ability to negotiate at the right time, I hope that there will now be dignity in the answers we are going to give to the fishermen affected.
I also hope that this House will approve the proposal by the Committee on Fisheries and that the Council will do the job it has to do.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, the vice-chairperson of the Committee on Fisheries, for her report on this extremely important regulation which aims at facilitating conversion for those thousands of fishermen and hundreds of vessels whose activity has been suddenly cancelled because it has not been possible to conclude a new fishery agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco.
Beyond the availability of existing instruments, the Community has decided to make a special effort with a twofold initiative.
Firstly, the Council regulation aiming at widening the scope of existing provisions and, secondly, additional credits for a specific action.
While the proposal for additional credits is currently being discussed by the budgetary authority, today's debate focuses on the legislative proposal.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the emergency procedure should allow the adoption of the regulation by the end of November instead of the end of December.
The report includes 18 amendments, which may be grouped in a few categories, which I shall review now.
The first group consists of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 10, 11 and 13.
The Commission does not believe that the land-based industries - that is to say, fish-processing factories, as well as services to vessels - ought to benefit from the new regulation, nor should the coastal regions themselves.
Indeed, regional development programmes already exist, and those industries in need of conversion or those coastal communities in need of diversification should benefit from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.
Aquaculture and the fish-processing industry should benefit from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance.
The second group of amendments consists of Amendments Nos 3 and 4.
The Commission does not believe that all fishermen and vessel owners who have received indemnities in 2000-2001, irrespective of the actual duration of the cessation of activity, should benefit from the new regulation.
Therefore a minimum duration of compensation, as a simple criterion, has been proposed and a nine-month duration has been considered a reasonable minimum.
Moreover, until now, no evidence has been given that such a duration would penalise those who have tried to find alternative activities and are still in a difficult situation.
The third group consists of Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8.
With respect to the age of vessels to be withdrawn, the Commission has proposed to reduce the minimum age to five years in the case of the exporting of vessels.
All other rules should be maintained.
Moreover, the Commission has proposed that the accumulation of grants for construction should be prevented premiums for withdrawal.
Any alternative rule would be against the sound management of public money, and therefore the Commission could not support those amendments.
On Amendments Nos 9 and 12, the Commission would stress that social premiums for fishermen are already available in the existing regulation.
Nonetheless, it may support increasing those premiums in the new regulation.
However, Spain and Portugal should guarantee that such increased premiums do not create distortion in relation to equivalent social premiums that may be available for workers of other industries in the same Member States.
I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15.
The additional credits are not structural funds.
Providing them allows the Commission to set up some rules.
Those rules should be in line with today' s priorities, which amount to scrapping redundant vessels and also to social measures.
No 'adjustment' or 'variation' should be allowed.
Then there is Amendment No 16.
From the Commission' s perspective, granting a joint enterprise in the fisheries sector is quite a risky action.
Two legal provisions limit that risk: firstly a bank guarantee, and secondly, a partially delayed payment (that is, after two years of satisfactory operation).
The budget rules for using additional credits imply the relaxation of the second provision, but the Commission is willing to maintain its financial risk at the same level.
Therefore it has proposed to balance that loss by increasing the bank guarantee to 40% of the premium.
But that is a purely mechanical calculation.
Then there is Amendment No 17.
If the budgetary authority decides to earmark all the commitment credits dedicated to the specific action in the budgetary year 2002, the wording of that article should remain unchanged.
Otherwise it should be adjusted accordingly.
Lastly, Amendment No 18, which has no practical consequence.
The wording of Article 7 should remain consistent with the wording of the equivalent articles of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.
In conclusion, the Commission has a favourable opinion of Amendments Nos 9 and 12, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, will propose to the Fisheries Council that it includes them in the new regulation.
Amendment No17 may be considered, depending upon the decision taken by the budgetary authority.
I was speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, I am sure, will deal with any questions that I was unable to answer.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Madam President, I had not managed to reach my seat.
I wanted to make a very brief comment: my name does not appear on the attendance register and I wanted to say that I was present at both the sitting and the corresponding vote.
I know that this relates to Monday's sitting, but I did want to have it included in the Minutes.
Many thanks.
Obviously I did not sign in, but I was here and I did take part.
Thank you!
Very well, Mr Ebner, it will be rectified.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
Madam President, before the debate begins, I just want to pass on the feelings of the people in Ireland regarding the future of our national airline Aer Lingus.
Prior to the terrorism in New York, it was a star performer in the airline industry, carrying 1.1 million passengers.
It is a great provider to our national economy.
There is a great wish that it not be regarded as the government giving national aid to keep this flying.
That is not really a comment about the Minutes, and besides, there is going to be a debate on that subject.
Are there any other comments about the Minutes?
(The Minutes were approved).
Madam President, I just wanted to bring to your attention the arrest in Greece a week ago of twelve British subjects and two Dutch subjects.
Among the British subjects were two of my constituents, Paul and Lesley Coppin from Mildenhall in Suffolk.
They have been arrested by the Greek authorities on charges of espionage.
These people are plane spotters, aviation enthusiasts, on holiday in Greece.
It does seem to me rather extraordinary that they are still being held in custody in a fellow Member State, and I wonder if there is something that you can do to bring this matter to the attention of the Greek authorities in order they be released as soon as possible.
Mr Van Orden, we have taken note of your comments and we shall take whatever action is appropriate.
Economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors
The next item calls for statements by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors.
Mrs Durant will now speak on behalf of the Council.
Madam President, European air transport policy had and still has serious structural weaknesses.
The events of 11 September have exacerbated the current situation exponentially.
The number of passengers on the main carriers has fallen dramatically and has now bottomed out at 20% lower than in 2000.
The airlines recently announced 30,000 redundancies.
Two national carriers, Sabena and Swissair, have folded.
When Sabena folded, 7,500 people lost their jobs from one day to the next.
And we cannot exclude the possibility of further job losses in the industry at European level.
Last week I met European partners representing all sectors of the air transport industry.
Their description was most interesting.
The airlines operate in a global village.
A global village which has been hit by an earthquake and all its buildings, both large and small, strong and weak, are teetering.
So how are we to cope at European level with part of a problem of truly global dimensions?
I think that it is important for us to send out a clear message, and I agree completely with Minister Durant here: we shall not be doing the industry any favours if we allow the economic crisis provoked by 11 September to delay decisions to restructure and unify the industry.
The main message must be that the proper response is to restructure the airline industry.
It is important that we agree that we cannot help the industry with a massive injection of public funds but, at the same time, we must understand that we cannot restructure in a time of crisis without additional economic and social tools.
The communication which the European Commission approved on 10 October entitled "The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry" is an initial reaction to this extraordinary situation and therefore focuses on restoring confidence by planning additional safety measures, coupled with economic measures to support the industry.
Of course, I fully agree with the Minister that, because of our institutional configuration and specific policies in the European Union, we are unable, unlike the United States of America, to react directly and support European airlines.
This communication contains a number of important points and measures.
The European Commission is examining measures, in the light of state aid rules, on compensating airlines for the damage which they sustained over the four days during which American airspace was closed.
This compensation must be granted without exception to all airlines licensed by the Member State.
The European Commission will examine various measures, again in the light of state aid rules, on compensation for the cost of additional insurance and continuing state intervention up to the end of this year.
The Commission is currently checking a number of medium-term monthly insurance plans on the basis of competition rules and internal market legislation relating to insurance.
And it is examining the possibility of a longer-term solution to the problem of insurance within the framework of the European Commission.
Finally, the Commission and the Council of Transport Ministers have called on the Member States to check that third world carriers can provide the same level of insurance cover as that which is going to be required of European airlines.
If we are to be able to restructure and stabilise the air transport industry as we must, the problem of ownership and control needs to be resolved now more than ever.
The restrictions imposed on airlines by traditional rules of ownership and control in bilateral air transport service agreements make mergers and acquisitions and external investment very difficult, even if the companies are in dire economic straits, which is why the Community desperately needs a dynamic common policy in the external relations sector.
The European Commission has been asking the Council for years now for negotiating guidelines on an EU/USA air traffic agreement in order to set the procedure in question in motion.
This sort of agreement would benefit our air transport industry.
Finally, given the rules on landing and take-off slots, the Commission takes the view that the situation is highly critical and agrees to propose that airport coordinators allow carriers to keep the slots which they did not use during the summer of 2001 and during the current 2001/2002 winter period for the same programming periods next year.
The President-in-Office of the Council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct European policy and agreement at European level very clearly.
I will not go over them again; instead I shall focus a little longer on the question of the social crisis.
As I mentioned earlier, there have already been 30,000 redundancies in the space of a few weeks across all sectors and we are currently conducting a study to see what the repercussions will be on sectors working with the airlines.
The analysis of the cause of the redundancies is throwing up many and varied factors.
Some are due to the crisis per se, which started last spring.
Others are due to a fall in demand.
Some to the delay in adjusting capacity in order to correct the ratio between supply and demand after years of strong growth.
It is difficult to analyse the causes for all the redundancies immediately, but we shall certainly have to see where we can intervene directly and what part the European Union and the European Commission should play.
First of all, there is a relatively complete legal framework which allows companies to negotiate with their employees in order to find new working models in a bid to keep redundancies to a minimum.
British Airways and Alitalia, which have made a great many employees redundant, are already working with and keeping the workers' representatives abreast of developments.
But of course legislation cannot stop the current round of redundancies, which is why available Community resources need to be used to deal with the fallout from the crisis.

There is an economic tool at European level - I refer to the European Social Fund - which can be used in three ways: first through the European Employment Strategy, for training and retraining employees made redundant or, often, in order to help them maintain their skills, which they risk losing on such a specialised job market.
The second way is by subsidising salaried employees whose jobs are at risk.
The problem of small and medium-sized satellite enterprises surrounding the airlines has already been raised.
The third way is for local and regional authorities to mobilise action programmes through the Social Fund to deal, for example, with the closure of small airports or local problems caused by redundancies or crises in specific sectors, so that they can be dealt with at regional level.
As far as the financial regulations for the European Social Fund are concerned, it is regulated at European level, but we have the flexibility to redirect funds in times of crisis or in special circumstances.
Certain measures for Sabena will be jointly funded by the European Social Fund.
These are the legislative and social tools currently available.
Of course, one of the most important tools in times of crisis is social dialogue and discussion with the social partners.
The European Commission set the European sectoral dialogue on air transport issues in motion following the crisis on 11 September.
We have already held meetings with the social partners through the Social Dialogue Committee and it has been decided that a European workshop will be held on 3 December, attended by all the sectors at social partner level and by national delegates from the fifteen Member States, in order to discuss the specific question of the repercussions on employment and the nascent social problems, in a bid to reach a joint agreement on measures which we can take into direct consideration.
Madam President, at this time of crisis, when it is hard to find answers and a recipe for recovery, we need proper and direct collaboration both between the European institutions and between the European institutions and the social partners before taking further steps.
Mr President, the reason for this urgent resolution is self-evident.
I should like firstly to thank the representatives from the other groups involved in drawing together this compromise.
It is true to say that since the attacks on the USA in September the aviation industry has suffered catastrophic consequences, not least on passenger confidence, but in addition for the tens of thousands of jobs which have already been lost worldwide and in particular across Europe.
Unfortunately this situation is not confined to the airline industry.
The knock-on effects are now evident, both in the aerospace manufacturing sector and in tourism.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, the slow recovery following the foot-and-mouth epidemic has suffered a major setback which is truly hard to bear.
Whatever the failures of some of the companies in the European Union to face the challenges of the business world, the vast majority of businesses have, through no fault of their own, found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, or even worse.
I recall my own government, along with other national leaders, insisting within three or four days of the incident that help would be given as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, apart from the short-term assistance concerning insurance cover, which should have been 180 days as at the outset in the United States, no financial help has been forthcoming.
I am not aware of any compensation for financial losses due to the closure of US airspace and airports, or for the additional security measures that the aviation industry has been expected to put in place.
It is Member States which should assume responsibility for security costs.
In short, the situation is a disgrace, not least because job losses outlined two months ago by many businesses are already escalating due to the lack of help.
We in this Parliament want action - and we want it now.
We are not interested in waiting for some case-by-case consideration by the Commission which may be agreed some time in the future.
We demand that interim financial aid packages be made available now to those eligible.
In conclusion, I must inform the Commission and the Council that it is my intention to keep this issue at the top of the agenda and I expect at the very least a report back to this Parliament at the November II part-session on the progress that has been made.
I hope that fellow MEPs will support the comments I have made, because we must remember that thousands of livelihoods are at stake.
Inaction is not an option, nor is a lecture on environmental issues, because at the rate we are going we will not have an aviation industry to worry about.
Madam President, I came to the Chamber this morning with a prepared speech about the situation in the airline industry.
I have radically altered that, in view of what I have heard from the President-in-Office and the Commissioner this morning.
Frankly, what we have heard is totally unacceptable.
We are faced with a classic scenario of the Council of Ministers fiddling like some modern-day Nero while the aviation industry of the European Union burns.
Madam President-in-Office, we are in a deep crisis.
You, more than anybody else, should know that from your own Member State. Airlines have gone bankrupt.
Others are on the brink of bankruptcy - and what response do we get?
We get a suggestion that the Commission can go and sit down with the Americans and talk to them about the aid they are giving to try and level the playing field.
By the time that happens there will not be a European civil aviation industry left to put on that level playing field!
We need action now.
We do not want fiddling at the edges, we want direct action so that our civil aviation industry can survive and have a future of its own.
The response from the United States after the events of 11 September was direct and straight to the point.
They made USD 5 billion available to their airlines straight away and offered another USD 10 billion in indirect aid to help them over other crises should they arise.
And what did we do?
We fiddled at the edges and said, "Well, we might do this" and, as Mrs Foster said, "Well, we said you could pay compensation for the lost days".
That is not enough.
We need direct action now.
What appalled me today was the tone of the contribution from the Commission and the President-in-Office.
It is as if they are accepting that airlines will have to go bust and that thousands of jobs will have to go, without doing anything to stop it.
Before today I suspected that Member States wanted to use this crisis to consolidate the industry, to get rid of some of the airlines.
Well, today the President-in-Office all but admitted that this is the case.
If that is so, then I condemn it.
Members of the trade unions are with us today in the gallery.
I say to them: I give you the support of my group in the quest to keep a European civil aviation industry alive.
Sadly, from what I have heard today, a similar commitment from the Council of Ministers seems to be a good way off.
I just wonder, Madam President-in-Office, whether people in history will remember the Belgian presidency of the year 2001 as the presidency that oversaw the demise of Europe's civil aviation industry.
Madam President, I feel that a situation such as this requires us to keep calm.
My group supported the motion and is prepared to take part in any way it can in any action addressing the current situation quickly and immediately - and, I hope, effectively. Three lines of action must be pursued: defending European industry fully against any unfair competition from the United States in the future; speeding up the restructuring of European industry itself; and meeting the obligations, which we had, moreover, already established before the crisis, to ensure, in any event, improved conditions of safety and respect for the environment than those hitherto in operation.
Europe has many objectives, which it must pursue simultaneously if we are to pull ourselves out of this situation.
This certainly means that we need the Council to confer a negotiating mandate upon the Commission as soon as possible, we need to be able to speak with one voice before the United States and we need to be able to monitor what happens on that front. In other words, we must either defend ourselves or ensure that we all play according to the same rules in this situation.
However, the need to defend ourselves against attack from an industry which has taken less time to complete restructuring, which has regained its competitiveness first, must not be used an excuse not to change the current situation.
Therefore, we need to honour our aid commitments, within the limits laid down for aid for the past financial year, for insurance costs and for the extra security costs, but no more than this.
We must consistently maintain state aid within this framework and, what is more, be very astute in our management of the restructuring phases.
There is no doubt that European industry will have to go through some rather painful stages as it re-establishes itself and, therefore, it is quite likely that there may be more bankruptcies.
However, there are different ways of handling them.
That is a fundamental point, one on which it might be appropriate for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission to do more, to produce a few more proposals on how the transitions are to be handled.
One tiny example: the bankruptcy of Sabena or the restructuring of the new Sabena has led to a debate now on the allocation of slots on European routes.
There are small, competitive companies able to take on, to employ people who would be willing to take part in co-sharing operations on European routes.
Well then, we must not restrict ourselves to defence but be open to these possibilities too, in short, to a faster developing market: we must have the courage and the ability to keep up with it with active as well as defensive measures.
In this way, I feel we will also be able to meet the needs of the trade unions and workers very well, aware that this is the right way to ensure that there genuinely will be jobs in the long term.
One last point: this issue affects the services related to the aviation industry as well as airlines; it affects the whole tourist industry.
If we do not succeed in restoring the confidence of our fellow citizens and persuading them to start flying again, much of the work we are doing will be wasted.
I have not yet heard anyone address this matter, but I feel it is the final task before us all.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group supports the policies set out by the Council Presidency and the Commission.
I believe that we should be careful not to miss the point here.
The air transport sector is experiencing a cyclical and structural crisis, as has been pointed out, but the whole of the European economy - and of the world economy - is also in crisis.
The real response to the employment problem is therefore, of course, to relaunch growth and general policies of social solidarity and job creation.
As far as the air transport sector is concerned, and in connection with the meeting on the social dialogue referred to by Mrs Diamantopoulou, I believe that the deterioration in working conditions and wages that is starting to occur in this sector is obviously a point to which we must pay a great deal of attention.
Moreover, at the level of the European Union, we would like to see the Community' s competition policy adopted and, far from preventing the restructuring of the sector, coming to the aid of that sector, and we should also like this medium-term restructuring policy to be compatible with the policies set out in the White Paper on transport policy, in other words the development of a multi-mode transport policy which reflects, in the medium term, the real situation regarding costs for all sectors as a whole.
Finally, and I believe that it is necessary to draw attention to this point, this Parliament has always voted, by a clear majority, against any spiralling in state aids.
I would find it hard to understand if the majority of this House were to unleash a spiralling growth in state aid to one particular sector.
Finally, on the subject of the United States, let us be clear among ourselves.
The United States of America have presented us with a policy which is a fait accompli.
Their position on aid to their air transport sector is unacceptable and contrary to fair competition at international level.
Since we cannot, apparently, take the issue to the WTO, it is essential that in the context of the overall partnership between the United States and Europe, the European Union should be able to protect those legitimate interests which will, in the long term, work to the benefit of both the American and the European airlines.
Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the economic and employment situation in the airline industry and in the related industrial and services sectors is critical.
Although this situation was not caused solely by the events of 11 September, it was made much more acute as a result.
Air passengers' confidence has fallen leading to a reduction in passenger numbers, losses have been incurred because of the closure of American airspace and airports, insurance cover has been withdrawn and there has been a decline in the numbers of tourists from the USA and the Far East: these are the main causes, as is the cancellation or postponing of orders for new aircraft.
The fundamental causes of this crisis are, however, of a structural nature: crippling competition between the airlines, built-in overcapacity, a general economic recession and bad decisions by management.
This motion for a European Parliament resolution refers to a host of necessary measures, for example compensation for the closure of airspace and airports, financial support or guarantees from the Member States to compensate for insurance cover being withdrawn, proposals on providing financial support to the European air transport sector so as to establish a level playing field with the United States and strategies to safeguard or create jobs.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports this motion, although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term measure and can only constitute a first step, but a step which should be taken immediately.
In the medium and long term, we need a harmonised European airspace, higher standards of quality and safety, highly trained staff, high social standards and no low wages.
The mass redundancies which were announced in the air transport sector even before 11 September are absolutely unacceptable to us.
We need a strategy to coordinate the different modes of transport; we need an all-embracing European transport strategy.
This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis.
Mr President, after the shock of 11 September, the tragic scale of the crisis in the aviation industry and its related services was already apparent, but the situation has become even more complex with the events of recent days.
We are now faced with a problem: the problem of the crisis in general and a problem of safety too, which, if the theory on the plane crash should prove to be true, would prompt us to focus more closely on the issue of servicing of aircraft for safety purposes.
Without a doubt, the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair. As has already been pointed out, the crisis, due to many different causes, not least - there is no doubt - clear strategic mismanagement of the sector, with airlines (which we might describe as too individualistic) unwilling to form consortia, which would have allowed them to streamline human, structural and financial resources; we have seen pricing policies which are misguided and often seeking to evade competition law; there are airports - such as Malpensa, to quote an example from my country - which are unreliable in terms of safety as well.
It is clear today that, in the current situation, the issue has reached dramatic, critical proportions, with the loss of at least 30 thousand jobs in Europe and 180 thousand jobs worldwide.
In Italy, my country' s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation.
It is preparing itself to take draconian measures, with a further 1 000 job cuts on top of the 2 500 already announced.
Italiatour, Eurofly and the IT services company Sigma Travel will be drastically reduced in size, if not abolished.
The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels.
The Commission had already authorised, on 17 October, payment of a public subsidy of EUR 387 million, but Alitalia needs EUR 1.5 billion and we do not know how useful the shares created by the Treasury by issuing bonds will be.
Strengthening commercial links with Air France or joining the Skyteam consortium are likely to be more effective in terms of structural reform.
In conclusion, we endorse the joint motion for a resolution and we feel that the situation calls for various different types of action from the European Union, extremely urgent action which, with the precious help of the European social partners, will succeed in firmly stopping the severely critical situation from further deteriorating now.
Subsequently, however, it will be necessary to plan action to modernise and streamline the sector and to take clear, incisive measures to boost tourism, which, as has already been pointed out, is a sector which, all too often, to be honest, is discussed at length but in which very little is as yet being done.
Lastly, we hope that the forthcoming reflections on the White Paper on transport will lead to resolute, incisive undertakings to support the transport and tourism sector' s economy, helping the many workers and their families, in particular, who must not be allowed to suffer further misfortune.
Madam President, the terrorist massacres of 11 September and last Monday' s aircraft disaster have jolted us into an awareness of the transience of life and to the way in which our society is interconnected.
An attack in the United States is also an attack on the rest of the civilised world, and vice versa.
Now the effects are making themselves increasingly felt, we must also look to solve the economic implications.
In our opinion, the solution should fit into the line that the European Union has adopted in the transport sector.
In principle, businesses must operate without direct government subsidies.
Whether or not we should make an exception in this case should, however, be placed in the correct context.
After all, aviation is a worldwide market.
It is not acceptable, therefore, for European companies to go under because governments refuse to grant emergency aid, while elsewhere, government participation keeps companies afloat.
In view of the measures which the United States has taken, the zero option has been ruled out for the European Union.
We will need to establish, therefore, how far we can, want, and are able to, go, and the sooner the better.
This question is not restricted to aviation.
Indeed, in addition to aviation, there are all kinds of related industries, including tourism, that have been hit hard.
We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures.
In the first instance, aid must remain restricted to the industry affected and to the damage which is the direct result of 11 September.
The payment of insurance costs is logical and, in principle, a certain compensation for lost income is also necessary, because otherwise there would probably only be a few airline companies left in the European Union.
However, that does not mean that we will prevent already financially unstable businesses from folding under the veil of compensation.
I would now like to focus on the longer term. Since aviation has acquired a global character and attractive services are on offer, businesses are increasingly forced to seek economies of scale.
As a result, fewer companies will remain in business, not only in the European Union, but also outside.
The sector will then become truly global.
National and bilateral legislation, as well as certain existing rights, must be tailored to this.
It is not national claims, but the market that plays a decisive role in respect of such rights.
In that light, I endorse the measures which the European Commission is proposing and I expect that they will also be able to benefit the European Union in other areas.
Madam President, the bankruptcy of the Belgian airline company Sabena a few days ago is not only the biggest bankruptcy in Belgian history, but it is first and foremost a human and social tragedy for between approximately 7 500 and 12 000 workers.
It has already been said, and it is obvious, that Sabena is not an isolated incident.
There are a huge number of airline companies that are going through very difficult times, and the events of 11 September have only made matters worse.
I am aware of this, but with regard to Sabena, it has to be said that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Durant, has kept two fundamental facts from this Parliament.
Firstly, Sabena has been continuously loss making for the last 40 years, except for one year, and that was probably thanks to an accountancy trick.
For the past 40 years, the taxpayers have had to inject no less than BEF 62 billion into that company.
Secondly, the cause.
Sabena was a Belgian public company with all the hallmarks of the Belgian State and of the Parti Socialiste.
That translated into political profiteering, political appointments of the manifestly incompetent and political interference by the Belgian Royal House to keep the company in French-speaking hands.
For that reason, the alliance with KLM was sabotaged.
Everyone knows that in my country.
In fact, parliament is currently setting up a parliamentary inquiry committee in order to scrutinise years of mismanagement, and, in my country, this is saying something.
We are all agreed that the airline industry is having a bumpy ride, and we must find a solution in Europe on the basis of a policy of "Europe first" as long as the Americans are putting "America first" .
However, in the Sabena dossier, we must first of all identify those responsible, notably in the Belgian Royal House and in the successive Belgian Governments.
Mr President, needless to say, airline companies, the aviation industry and tourism are the primary and most visible victims of 11 September, but let us not forget that outside tourism, many small- and medium-sized enterprises and their workers in the supply industry and in the geographical vicinity of airports, will also be directly affected by the tragedy.
In Belgium, the small- and medium-sized enterprises expect one redundancy per job lost at Sabena.
In our view, it should be ensured that government aid, in whatever form, benefits all industries affected.
We are also relying on the fact that the measures which the Commission can take are carried out promptly and on a large scale.
The following measures spring to mind in the first instance: the creating of scope for government investments in the safety of air transport, the prompt handling of specific financial aid dossiers and extended flexibility, albeit limited in time, in slot management.
The extremely difficult situation should also prompt the Commission to clamp down on competition-distorting practices in transatlantic relations.
In this day and age, we are dependent on many factors.
If they all go wrong at the same time, we will end up with a right mess, and Sabena is a tragic case in point.
As a Belgian MP, I would urge that DAT be treated like any other airline company that is being affected by the effects of 11 September.
DAT should also be seen as a company that is being restructured, and must have access to the same facilities which other companies would have at their disposal in the same situation.
Finally, I wish the workers and independent businesses that are the victims of this situation a great deal of strength, and I hope that we can offer them better prospects in the short term.
Mr President, faced with the social catastrophe which the collapse of Sabena represents for Belgium, I should like to add a little humanity to this sitting, by dedicating my first words to all those who, from one day to the next, found themselves, to put it bluntly, deprived of their jobs.
I would ask those who would seek to use this specific issue in order to criticise public enterprises to measure well the responsibilities of all those concerned.
Yes, Europe is responsible when, along with the Commission, certain parties urge rapid, inhumane and brutal liberalisation, and yes, Europe now appears to everyone to be the real driving force behind this process.
People no longer want this kind of Europe.
They now want to construct with us a social Europe, the Europe that we defended at Lisbon, which develops convergence indicators in order to increase employment and combat unemployment, in other words a Europe which refuses to be dictated to by the market.
The 12 000 Sabena workers who were dismissed at the beginning of this month are the first victims of this wave of liberalisation in civil aviation.
The results of other European companies are giving cause for concern.
Thousands of people are afraid of being thrown out of work, and they cannot understand the intransigence of the European Commission over repayment times for bridging loans to the Belgian company, while the United States are spending billions of dollars on subsidising their national airlines so that they can keep their European slots.
They find it unacceptable that the Commission should give preference to sanctions and ukases, in the name of the virtues of liberalism and the market, while at the same time that out-of-control liberalism culminates in companies in Europe closing down one after the other.
By setting up the Lisbon process, the Community authorities and the Member States have proved that they are capable of taking into account the human and territorial consequences implied by every decision.
Such blind liberalisation will do nothing to advance the cause of the European idea or to increase confidence in Europe' s institutions and in our plans for peace and social progress.
It will inevitably lead the public to reject this European and simplistic vision.
Commissioner, the European Parliament' s vote on the Langen report two days ago, confirmed that there are certain sectors that should not be open to competition, and among those sectors are the sectors with which you are concerned.
Let us be clear about this, we do not reject the idea of modern and efficient public enterprises, and we do not want them to be sacrificed and ridiculed.
We are waiting for a forward-looking vision of economic development, a project which is humane and intelligent, and which will enable sustainable development to be achieved.
I hope that that is what we shall see on 3 December.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what has happened with Sabena in my country is very tragic, and I am pleased that the Belgian Government is making a huge effort to try to cushion the direct and indirect social effects.
Needless to say, that is never entirely possible with a bankruptcy of this scale, but it is important nevertheless that an effort is also being made indirectly, in the area of training and in-service training.
I should also like to ask the Commissioner to advise soon whether something will also be done at European level, what the amounts will be that are involved and what kind of efforts will be made in respect of various airline companies.
Sabena is, of course, a spectacular case, but social tragedies are also unfolding in other airline companies.
That is where a European approach and European support are needed, so that people know that Europe is doing something, for my fellow MEP quite rightly pointed out that at the moment we have a one-sided image of Europe which, in my view, should be rectified.
One thing is clear to me.
In my opinion, the role of the Member States and of an individual approach to aviation per Member State is over.
We have been saying this for years, even if some people in this Parliament still believe that a national approach must be maintained.
That era should finally come to an end, in my view.
We must opt for a European approach.
National state aid to airline companies makes no sense whatsoever.
We must decide very quickly on whether - and I share your view in this, Mr Simpson - European aid to a European sector is possible and on the conditions under which that can be done.
However, I do not think the problem is solved by saying: OK, they put USD 5 billion on the table, we will put EUR 5 billion on the table.
In my view, the problem will not be solved in that way, for this financial solution must be accompanied by a simultaneous restructuring scheme.
There was no point in getting the Belgian Government, or possibly the European Government, to bail out Sabena once again and to keep it in the air. Sabena had to restructure and do something, which happened in too painful a manner.
They have waited for too long to do this rationally. Instead, it is now happening in a chaotic manner.
That is unfortunate, but I believe we should learn from this.
The fact that Sabena is the first national airline company to go bankrupt in the Union speaks volumes.
We tend to hold on to national airline companies, and those days are over, as various MEPs have stated today.
We must adopt a European approach.
That implies air traffic control, security measures and agreements with third countries.
Mrs Durant, I am pleased that you are offering a window in this respect, but I hope that you can convince all your colleagues, for that is exactly what the opposition in the Council was about.
Member States are reluctant to relinquish this authority, and refuse to join forces at European level, and we are now paying the price for this. the Americans are able to adopt a joint policy, but we are not.
You are not represented at international level when aviation is at issue.
It is the fifteen Member States that conclude agreements with open skies etc. and that compete with each other politically.
I hope, therefore, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be able to convince your colleagues.
And I hope that everyone here in this Parliament is convinced of the fact that we must at long last respond at European, rather than national, level.
Mr President, I actually believe that, faced with the recession in the aviation industry and in air transport, we need some strong decisions in order to restore confidence and open up real prospects.
I personally am not satisfied with the Commission' s response, which favours the speeding up of restructuring in the air transport sector.
I am in favour of a European approach. We can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later.
As for restoring confidence, I believe that confidence is actually a product of safety, and the safety dimension in this sector, as in others, is dependent upon the expertise, competence and qualifications of the staff employed.
Commissioner, I am absolutely in agreement with you on the urgent need to develop the social dialogue, but we cannot just be content with a social dialogue at a time when people are facing the problem of redundancies.
Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned?
They too have comments, and thoughts, and proposals, and in view of what we have just decided regarding the consultation of workers, perhaps that could be implemented much more rapidly.
I also believe that restoring confidence involves learning lessons from the present crisis and putting a stop to the process of liberalisation that is currently underway.
Frankly, I do not believe that the liberalisation that has developed in this sector has contributed towards its development. In fact I would rather say that it has contributed towards its difficulties.
Restoring confidence also means, at any given moment, taking responsibility for providing assistance.
I believe that the limited targeted measures are insufficient to cope with this crisis.
Since the American aid is considerable, I believe that there should be compensatory aid in the air transport sector, but that it should also be made conditional upon maintaining jobs.
Finally, I believe that we also need to open up prospects.
It seems to me that among our long-term prospects we should be looking at how the European Union can work, not towards concentrations, but towards the development of international cooperation, on safety and the management of air traffic, between the airlines and the public authorities.
Mr President, I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport, and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks.
Mr President, the terrorist attacks in September have disrupted the operations of many airline companies in Europe, resulting in job losses in the aviation industry and a reduction in the number of overseas tourists coming to Europe.
We want to ensure that we retain competitive airline companies in Europe.
I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today.
It is important that the Commission works out a set of proposals which make it possible for the European airline industry to withstand the competition resulting from the massive help which the American Government is giving American airlines at this time.
We must ensure that the European aviation industry receives equal treatment vis-Ã -vis our American airline counterparts, particularly when it comes to addressing transatlantic arrangements.
For example, from an Irish perspective, Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel.
Other EU airlines also make a substantial profit from their transatlantic routes.
It is important that these EU airlines can compete against the American airlines which have received state aid from the American Government in recent times.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to comment on just two aspects, socially acceptable and economically reasonable restructuring in the aviation industry.
Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently.
I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies - whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid - are granted or not granted in all of the Member States.
It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market.
This cannot work.
We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines.
As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market.
Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary.
Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines.
They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market.
This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together.
Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market.
I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points.
Mr President, in making our decisions on the aviation industry in Europe we have to take account of the interconnectedness of our economies and politics in Europe and globally as well.
The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic.
Clearly, 11 September virtually wiped out that business.
Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland.
Our airline is an important asset in that area of the industry.
If we allow that to go down the drain, who is going to service the Irish tourist economy?
The Council and the Commission are, I am afraid, confused.
They are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the Irish airline.
That is perceived to be so by the workers of Aer Lingus and the Irish people in general. We will pay the price in Europe for that perception.
It is important that we recognise that the national carrier in every Member State in Europe is as important as the national anthem or the national flag.
You can shake your head, but that is the reality.
We have to take that into account.
We may regret it, but we must take it into account in dealing with this crisis.
Finally, there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address.
There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September.
There is an urgent need for the reform of the competition rules.
There is an urgent need for assistance to help companies create alliances at a European level, which will ensure that the national carriers are not annihilated.
Finally, we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today.
Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December, not next June.
Mr President, the fact of the matter is that, even in the air transport industry, the law of the jungle and the savage neo-liberal policy which applies are such that mergers have taken place and national airlines which enjoyed periods of strong growth in the past have gone bankrupt, a blatant example being the bankruptcy of Swissair and Sabena.
And no doubt others will follow. In the medium term at least, two or three large airlines will survive in Europe to share the pickings with the American behemoths which, with the connivance of our governments, have taken pains to penetrate and take over the European market.
The terrorist attacks on 11 September have intensified the crisis and been used as an excuse for cutbacks and mass redundancies.
And in what is already a dismal situation for many national carriers, along comes the Commission to administer the coup de grace by prohibiting state aid, at a time when the US government is injecting its behemoths with massive amounts in aid.
There can be no doubt that this situation is here to stay and, the more capital is concentrated, the more the workers and consumers will be expected to pick up the tab in the form of job losses and more and more expensive tickets.
That is why the only solution is to support the fight to get this policy reversed and get rid of those who apply it.
Mr President, we have to restore public confidence in aviation and we have to let the market decide what happens to the airlines themselves.
Restoring public confidence means getting security screening right and improving the quality of staff, training, job procedures, pay and conditions.
It means, perhaps, ensuring that there is a state-run security operation at airports and paying accordingly.
That may well create more jobs.
So far as the airlines and their financial viability are concerned, we do not want more intervention, more bureaucracy and more delay.
We need targeted assistance in areas like insurance and the cost of security.
We must let the market decide what the future of the airline industry shall be.
As was said earlier, Sabena made a profit in only one year out of the many years that it has been in existence.
Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Air France and KLM are not far behind.
Why the devil should we support Aer Lingus when Ryanair can make money without any difficulties at all - like Easyjet, like GO, like Buzz?
All those airlines can make money at a difficult time.
Why should we therefore bail out the Sabenas and the Aer Linguses with their overcapacity, with too many routes, too few passengers and too much state pride?
I have two specific questions that I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council.
Firstly, I am led to believe that there are problems with the Sabena slots that have been offered, in Britain, for example, to British Midland and British European Airways.
They may have them for a short time but there is some suggestion from the coordinator that they may be lost in six months time if DAT is reformed and wants those slots back.
That is unacceptable.
If Sabena cannot fill those slots then others should be allowed to use them.
Secondly, what is being done to ensure that the staff at Brussels airport does not restrict the movement of those new-slot airlines as a result of picketing and delays at the airport?
We need guarantees of freedom of movement on the ground as well as in the air.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it would be a shame if, at this difficult time, the European institutions were to fall into the trap of being both overzealous and too market-oriented at the same time.
On the one hand, in the name of what is in this case totally blinkered liberalisation, they require full adherence to the State aid system, which prevents any action being taken to support airlines. On the other hand, there is a genuine danger that we will find ourselves - there have already been 30 000 job losses within the space of 30 days - with 100 000 jobs being lost in 100 days, in a sector which, moreover, enjoys little in the way of social protection.
For two months, we have been saying that 11 September changed the world and the balance of society.
It would be a shame if we were to miss the political significance of this and fail to review the order of our priorities.
In European integration based on social cohesion, in a Europe built on the fundamental principle of work, what priority should we today give to the risk of an uncontrolled wave of unemployment?
Do we still think we can prevent the inevitable market crisis?
We are all aware that this crisis has roots in the past, that it is more than just a consequence of the events of 11 September, that it is also the result of excessive market fragmentation.
However, we do not feel that going to the opposite extreme - bringing about a huge merger which would ultimately only save three national airlines: the French, British and German companies - would be a healthy solution.
We are actually not so very far off this situation, considering what happened to Sabena and the engineered drop in the nominal value of the shares of a large number of airlines which are in danger of selling at a loss. A prime example is Alitalia.
Lastly, Mr President, I welcome the code of conduct for US airlines intended to avoid piracy in the market, provided that, as others have said, the European governments do genuinely intend to enforce it, for otherwise it will be just another list of unfulfilled good intentions.
Mr President, the International Transport Agency anticipates that a total of 200 000 people will lose their jobs in the airline industry worldwide in the wake of the attacks.
This organisation also expects that the total losses incurred in this industry will amount to 7 billion this year, and that it will take twelve months before the industry will recover.
That is what we are facing here: a worldwide crisis which has major ramifications for Europe.
That is point one.
Point two - and this has already been mentioned by a number of speakers - is that this industry had been in a very bad way for a long time.
I often have to take the floor when we deal with enormous job losses, and it is always a sad occasion.
This time is no exception.
However, there is something peculiar about it this time round.
Part of the guilty party is sitting directly opposite me, namely the Council itself.
We ask in our resolution for a European airline industry and a European airline policy.
What the Council has offered us is a policy of national carriers where everyone acts in their own self-interest and everyone wants to conclude their own agreements with the United States.
Mr De Rossa said that the national carrier is as sacred as the national anthem.
If that is the attitude, then we will never solve the problem, of course.
If we all act in our own self-interest, we will be unable to reach a European solution.
We will then end up in a frosty restructuring programme, which is exactly what is now threatening to happen.
I think we are all agreed that that should not happen, but we must get the idea out of our heads that we can still have national carriers in this internal market.
It is impossible to pursue sound social policy if the economic backdrop is in total disarray, and as far as that is concerned, the Council is innocent in all of this.
The Commission has made a very good effort.
There are many proposals before us, but these have all been rejected by the Council.
The first thing the Council should allow the Commission to do is to talk with the United States on its own.
If that is not done, other things should not be discussed either.
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come.
Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe, rather than the major cities like London, Birmingham and Paris, because they will survive and receive support.
We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out, and then Aer Lingus, which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland.
The Republic of Ireland's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland, but the first time there is a bit of trouble, it runs away!
That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with!
No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right.
British Airways stayed in Northern Ireland and stood by its staff through bombs and bullets.
What has it done?
It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well!
I condemn it for that.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them.
I certainly feel very strongly about this.
I am not in favour of giving large amounts of money to bail out inefficient companies.
To some extent Mr Atkins is right: there are other companies out there which are making money and they have to be supported.
I say to the Commission and the Council that they cannot come here and give us a lecture.
They will have to come back with firm and positive proposals.
It is time for action and time for a dose of realism.
If the Council and the Commission cannot do it now, we will harry them until they do!
Mr President, briefly, on the subject of the discussion that we have just heard, I do not believe that anyone here, either the Council, or the Commission, or any one of us, has exclusive rights to indignation in the face of the social problems that are occurring now for each of these airlines, and perhaps for some of them more than others.
I am particularly well-placed to know all about that.
I believe that this social crisis that is being experienced by a certain number of those who operate and work in the air transport sector is obviously a challenge to all of us.
However, I also believe that, despite this challenge and the need to react to this problem, to follow the road that we took in the past, via massive state aid, would be to avoid or conceal a situation which was already in existence before 11 September.
This is a fragile sector, in which the profit margins have been extremely low in recent years. Therefore, despite the indignation that we all feel in the face of the current social problem, I believe that to imagine that simply returning to massive structural aid will solve the problems in this sector would be to evade an obstacle which will confront us again later, in an even more dramatic form.
I really believe, on behalf of the Council, even though this debate has only just started in the Council, that it will not be easy, and what you have said today demonstrates that.
We well know how much Member States are attached to their national airlines and how important that attachment is, and here I am speaking more on my own account than on behalf of the Council, where we shall soon have to start these discussions.
We have made an immediate start by giving immediate and specific responses in this sector.
Yes, there is aid in various forms.
There are specific and targeted forms of aid with regard to the closure of airspace, and the possibility of providing even more, on the basis of objective criteria.
There has been aid in connection with insurance facilities.
There are other types of aid, not financial aid, regarding the problem of time slots, so as to enable the airlines to keep their heads above water, or at least not to sink any deeper.
There have been responses.
I also believe that what we have done regarding the matter of security is an immediate response concerning those elements which will restore passengers' confidence in the safety and security aspects, which are obviously so essential if the public is to regain confidence.
I therefore believe that the responses which have been given by the Council and the Commission are immediate responses.
It is true that the social crises which we are experiencing in various European airlines, and particularly in Belgium, and which also call for social responses involving taking these problems into consideration, should not cover up the urgent need to begin a debate, within the Council, on a more structural consolidation of the sector. This is without a doubt the only way of giving to this sector, in structural terms, not only the social responses which it needs, but also economic responses, and responses which will guarantee its long-term survival, not forgetting - as some of you have mentioned - the need for multi-mode transport systems, the need to place air transport too in the context of short-distance journeys at European level, the development of the high-speed train and any other alternatives which will enable us, in that context too, to provide responses at the level of a common transport policy.
However, I really believe that a return to massive state aid would be a step in the wrong direction, a step backwards, and a step which would, above all, risk leading us, at a later date, into even more serious difficulties.
By contrast, we have provided specific responses, and there are other responses to come: the security regulation, which I hope we shall be able to agree on on 7 December.
I also hope that it will be possible for Parliament to contribute its views on this subject to the debate as well.
There is still an enormous amount of work to do, but I really think that the time has come to begin these discussions on structural consolidation, in addition to the specific responses which have already been provided and which were necessary in the very short term.
Mr President, this has been a highly political debate in which the problem now facing all the Member States has been aired, as have the widely differing views and approaches which are reflected in both the European Parliament and the Council.
Two major sets of issues have been debated.
The first relates to the restructuring of the airlines. The second relates to the need for social intervention.
As far as the first is concerned, I think that all the speakers agreed on the need for restructuring and for a new airline model in Europe.
There are three points worth making here: first, the present traditional model of ownership and control obviously will not allow the degree of restructuring we would like, or rather the degree of restructuring required.
Meaning that we need a new approach, with a more European dimension.
The second point is that, in today's global world, Europe is not negotiating with one voice. This works to the detriment of the European airlines.
And the third point relates to state aid.
The point was made that we are debating whether or not to support the airlines and that, when we finally make our decision, it will be too late, because the European airlines will already have gone out of business.
The law on state aid is not the Koran.
Let us assume that a decision is taken on state aid.
What tool do we have at European level?
Can we decide to give state aid to airlines?
Of course not.
What we can decide at European level is a yes or a no and the facility to grant state aid then shifts to the national level.
Meaning that we have national governments with different capabilities, different frameworks and different airlines.
Meaning that we will probably end up with a direct distortion of competition and the internal market.
Consequently, the state aid path is a hard path to tread as things currently stand in Europe.
To focus on three of the points of the dialogue, I would simply highlight what was said repeatedly by the members and the Belgian minister. That now more than ever we need a European transport policy, not national policies which at the moment are leading nowhere fast.
As far as the second line of approach - social policy - is concerned, I analysed the potential for intervention under the Social Fund in my first intervention.
Policy to deal with the social fallout and employment needs to be taken, of course, at local, national and European level.
As far as intervention under the Social Fund is concerned, as we have been asked directly to table proposals, I should like to say that, depending on their particular circumstances and the problems which redundancies cause them, the Member States will need to table proposals to change their current programme for the community support framework so that it can be approved by the Commission.
This has already been done in other sectors with large companies being restructured both in Great Britain and France.
Consequently, it is up to the Member States to act fast and adjust their Social Fund programmes along these lines.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Combating social exclusion
The next item is the report (A5-0372/2001), by Mrs Figueiredo, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between the Member States to combat social exclusion [C5-0439/2001 - 2000/0157(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as is well-known, and as the recent Commission report on social inclusion confirms, poverty remains at excessively high levels.
Although the latest available data on incomes in the Member States does not capture the whole complexity and multi-faceted nature of the scale of poverty and social exclusion, it does show that in 1997, around 18% of the population of European Union, in other words, more than 60 million people, lived in homes in which the income was less than 60% of the average national income and that around half of these 60 million people had lived below the relative poverty threshold for three consecutive years.
This situation shows how crucial it is that we implement a global strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion, defending human rights in all their aspects, and that this programme is an instrument that must be implemented urgently.
One year ago, in this House, we approved at first reading the report on this Community programme of providing incentives for cooperation between Member States in the fight against social exclusion as an important aspect of the strategy to combat poverty which the Council spoke of so much at the Lisbon summit in March of 2000.
At the same time, however, the Member States have given new commitments, with the definition, in Nice, of the objectives of the fight against poverty, and in Stockholm, where they committed themselves to promoting sustainable development and quality jobs, confirming their desire to thereby contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion.
National plans for social inclusion were also drawn up, identifying a set of factors that considerably increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion, such as unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, low income, low-quality employment, lack of proper housing, unstable health, immigration, early school-leaving, gender inequality, discrimination and racism, disability, old age, family breakdown, drug addiction and alcoholism, and living in a highly disadvantaged area.
Sometimes, these risk factors interact and combine over time, and it is therefore necessary to break the recurring cycle of poverty and to prevent intergenerational poverty and new forms of poverty, including info-exclusion.
It is in this context that the programme becomes especially significant, as yet another instrument with which to fight poverty and social exclusion, which as we see, is continuing to increase.
Lastly, after overcoming the Council' s intransigence on aspects that Parliament has always considered to be essential, specifically with regard to the programme' s budget, the participation of NGOs and financial support for them, the role of the European Parliament and the promotion of innovative approaches, we have reached the end of a long process that includes a second reading on 17 May this year, various working meetings with the Belgian presidency and conciliation, in which, finally, consensus was reached on 18 September.
With regard to the agreement that has been reached, it is important to mention the aspects dealing with the budget and its increase by EUR 5 million to EUR 75 million for the five years of the programme, which is still insufficient, but, given the Council' s intransigence, not reaching an agreement would have meant the programme not coming into force at the beginning of next year.
A decision was also reached on promoting innovative approaches and financial support for actions undertaken by NGOs, which has increased from 80% to 90% in exceptional circumstances.
It is also worth noting that agreement was reached on the participation of NGOs, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, in preparing and holding the annual Round table on the situation' s development and the programme' s implementation.
It is also important to point out that the role of the European Parliament has been acknowledged, specifically in the timely consideration of the synthesis report for the Spring Council, which the Commission will draw up annually and which will examine the overall coherence of policies with social cohesion, including the progress made under this programme.
Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and contributed to this proposal' s success and for the consensus reached in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Mr President, may I express my political group's satisfaction with the fact that, for the first time at European level, we are now ready to apply a Community strategy to combat social exclusion.
We have urgent challenges to meet.
Not only is it unacceptable for so many million citizens in the European Union and candidate countries to be living below the poverty line, but the knowledge society which we are creating and the increasingly multicultural society in which we live in Europe harbour new risks of social exclusion.
What is important is that this social programme will give us the chance to process our policies on the basis of modern scientific data, on the basis of statistical studies and on the basis of exchanges of best practices, including with countries outside the European Union, such as those in the European Economic Area.
This is particularly important for Member States unused to applying strategies based on social research, the very countries which now face the most serious social problems.
The European Parliament, as the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo has just said, had high hopes of this Community programme.
Nevertheless, it supports the joint text brokered during conciliation with the Council and is satisfied with the constructive part played by the European Commission.
The rapporteur has already listed the main points of this conciliation.
We particularly wanted to highlight the innovative approach which the European Commission has promised to promote in order to ensure that citizens with special difficulties are integrated into society.
The ground which we need to cover between now and 2010, the timeframe and political milestone set in Lisbon, will be a long, hard haul and it is crucial, in our view, that the European Council in Laeken set its stamp very firmly on this effort.
We have special need of such decisiveness at this time when, as the previous debate highlighted, we are feeling the economic and social fallout from the crisis provoked by 11 September more and more acutely in Europe; at the same time, the Member States need to move into action by instigating public dialogue and integrating the fight against social exclusion into all their policies.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had quite a struggle over this issue of combating social exclusion.
I should like to point out that it was more or less unanimous throughout the procedure, and was served by an excellent rapporteur.
However, conciliation, which we had thought would be easy, since we were so much in accord with the Council' s motives when it adopted the Commission' s proposal, proved surprisingly tough and difficult.
I should therefore like to remind the House, briefly, of the reasons for our insistence.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and, I am sure, Parliament as a whole, approves the choice of the open-cooperation method.
It has proved its worth in this area.
We also agree that social exclusion is a complex and multi-facetted process, and that it is necessary to study it in greater depth, particularly as regards its links with poverty.
There are people on the margins of society who are not poor, and not all poor people are excluded, but the area of overlapping is a very large one.
It is not possible to separate the two problems.
However, one of the major strengths of the open-cooperation method is the fact that it allows the exchange of good practice.
It is here that Europe has a responsibility, or I would prefer to say a duty, to experiment and to lead by example.
The information already collected enables us to launch innovative schemes and pilot projects with confidence.
In addition, Commissioner, you are a politician, as we are.
How could you imagine for a moment that we could sell to our voters the idea that, on a problem as serious and as evident as social exclusion, Europe is able only to finance studies, and is not able to take any practical action?
This sort of thing is suicidal as far as Europe' s image is concerned, hence the innovatory approaches that you have finally conceded to us.
Fortunately you have other mechanisms, we know, but given the importance of this preoccupation it was necessary to include it.
The controversy over the budget arises from this. You have granted us only five million.
Since we know that you had plans ready for carrying out these studies, we would like to have a guarantee that there will be money available for innovative experiments.
In the same way, the NGOs must be able to work without having to look for unlikely external sponsors.
Well, we have achieved this, and the text has been improved.
I wish the Commission all the best in carrying out the task that lies before it.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her serious and very committed work on this issue and also the work that our own committee has done, as Mr Rocard has just pointed out.
This action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the European Union.
It is part of the recognition of the huge problem of social exclusion which is not only the result of poverty, although it is of course linked to it.
Some of those links are picked up in the excellent report by Mrs Lynne which we will be debating later, concerning the European Year of Disabled People, and in Mr Nobilia's report which recognises the problems faced by elderly or disabled people in exercising, for example, their freedom of movement because disability benefits are not included in the coordination of social security systems.
In our discussions on this action programme, Parliament has insisted on the need for civil society to be involved in the programme itself and its evaluation.
This involvement is critical.
It is clear that the top-down policies, and the hope that overall economic growth would somehow overcome the poverty and lift the poorest out of that state, have not worked.
It is the constructive involvement of the people themselves that is part of the solution.
We therefore expect that the research and programmes funded with this modestly increased amount of money, a limited range as Mr Rocard has just said, will not just concentrate on policy but also on the process of policy formulation and funding decisions, which in itself could be an innovative dimension.
I recently attended a local government conference looking at the national social inclusion plans.
Speakers representing organisations from groups which often experience social exclusion - poor people, those with disabilities, those from minority ethnic groups etc. were asked whether they would rather see the implementation of a few policies that have worked elsewhere or have a full programme of real consultation, even if they did not then get what they wanted.
The answer, without exception, was that they wanted to be consulted because that implied respect for their experience and their opinions.
It is also my hope that the activities funded under this programme will not just concentrate on work as the answer to exclusion.
It is not a solution if the work is poorly paid and exploitative.
I, like many others, look forward to reading and evaluating the results of this programme and hope that they will make real progress in tackling social exclusion.
Mr President, like Mrs Figueiredo, we also welcome this action plan against social exclusion.
We think that certain things have been achieved - as always, in conciliation processes not everything we want is achieved - and, although the budget is still low, the budget for NGOs has been raised and the role that the European Parliament plays is very important.
I think that there is some fine wording in this document: I would remind you of Article 2 - which asks for a high level of employment and a fight against poverty - and point out that the Council considers the current levels of poverty that still exist in the European Union to be unacceptable.
However, we are running the risk that applying this action plan - whose implementation next year is welcomed by all of us - will be like putting a small sticking plaster onto a large gaping wound.
In the previous debate we talked about the virtues of the market in terms of sustaining airlines, yet we talk less of the 12 000 jobs at Sabena.
We run the risk of losing much blood whilst we try to stem its flow with a small sticking plaster.
Nevertheless, Mr President, this plan against social exclusion is very welcome.
Mr President, I should like to warmly welcome the final outcome of the conciliation procedure and make a point of congratulating Mrs Figueiredo who, thanks to her meticulous work and by working with all sides, managed in the end to give us this tool much more quickly than we anticipated.
Mr President, the speakers referred - and this is important - to the shortcomings and limited potential of this tool as it stands.
However, we have to start from the fact that we are talking about a policy area which does not come under European jurisdiction.
We have no jurisdiction to exercise policy but, for the first time, the Member States have decided to work together.
So, within the framework of this joint decision to work together, three things have happened.
First, national action plans against exclusion and poverty are being submitted, for the first time.
Secondly, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission are working together to find a joint policy framework, again for the first time.
May I remind you that we do not even have a common definition of the word "poverty" in the European Union.
Thirdly, we have the programme, which is a first tool, but an important tool nevertheless.
What is important is that, first, the budget has been increased as a result of significant pressure and intervention on the part of the European Parliament and, secondly, we have achieved a common position between the Commission and Parliament during conciliation on 90% funding for organisations which really do not have any resources of their own.
So what does this tool do?
I can sum up the basic elements of this tool in seven points.
One, it supports and helps the structures in the Member States to collate data and analyse and research the situation in all the Member States. Two, it helps us work together and develop joint social indicators, for the first time.
Three, it supports the procedures used to monitor and implement national action plan programmes on employment.
Four, it supports the exchange of best practices and programmes.
Five, it involves all the agencies, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, governments, foundations and universities. Six - and I should like to highlight this point - it specifically involves associations of people who are the victims of poverty and exclusion and, seven, it allows us to raise public awareness of the huge problem of poverty, which cannot be dealt with simply by governments and European programmes but which needs to galvanise the whole of society into action.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
First of all, ladies and gentlemen, I have some information which I would advise you, if I may, to listen to.
In view of the fact that the World Trade Organization meeting in Qatar lasted longer than expected, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to attend our sitting this afternoon.
I therefore propose that we should continue our debates between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., while we should stick to the planned timetable for topical and urgent subjects of major importance, and of course for the vote.
Madam President, when will my report be debated - the Lynne report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, 2003?
Will that now be at around 3.30 p.m.?
We have a sign language interpreter arriving now for the debate at 5.30 p.m. because everything has been changed around so much that we do not know when this report is being debated.
I have deaf members of the public attending and we have the sign language interpreter.
So can we please stick to some sort of timetable?
Mrs Lynne, you were quite right to bring this information to my attention.
I think that we can at least leave your report at the time that was originally planned for it, in other words at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, we understand the reasons why Commissioners Lamy and Fischler cannot be with us this afternoon.
Could you confirm, however, that there will be an opportunity for those two commissioners to report to us on the important negotiations at Doha and whether the EU's views were accepted or not.
Of course, Mrs McNally, we shall certainly be holding this debate with the Commission in December, but we cannot really blame the commissioners in question for not being able to come back any earlier.
Madam President, I wish to say a few brief words, just to clarify something.
I was not able to take part in yesterday' s vote on the Caudron report, and consequently did not spot a mistake that I would like to point out to my fellow Members.
As a result of a mistake by Parliament staff, a proposal for an amendment - No 20 - that we had tabled to the Caudron report on the research programme was mistakenly included in the Euratom report.
I do not intend to dwell on this subject, because other amendments by other Members have addressed the same issue.
I do wish to make this observation, however, because people were probably surprised that the insertion of the amendment made no sense at all in the context of Euratom.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro, we are happy to take note of what you have said, and we shall see that the necessary correction is made.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I was in the Members' Bar before we started voting.
I saw a piece of baggage on a chair.
For approximately 15 minutes nobody came for it.
A man approached and I asked him whether it was his bag.
I told him that, in view of the security situation, it was advisable to stay with one's baggage and that, in addition, to be in the Members' Bar you had to be invited by a Member.
He was extremely arrogant and annoyed.
He took his bag and marched away.
He said that he knew Mrs Muscardini.
She then arrived in the bar; I asked her that if she knew the gentlemen, and said that due to the security problems, I had informed him politely of the situation.
I should like to say to this House that we as Members of this Parliament also have a responsibility.
We have been asking for security measures to be stepped up and we all, therefore, must take responsibility for the people we bring here or allow here in our name.
I would just ask you, Madam President, to remind the House of our responsibilities for future security.
I congratulate you, Mrs Foster, on your vigilance. You acted very properly in the circumstances.
Vote
Madam President, I should like to make it clear to my fellow MEPs that, if Amendment No 9, tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is adopted, the issue will be sent back to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That will be the correct method of proceeding, for it will give us more time to investigate the legal consequences of this proposal.
I received an answer from the Council yesterday, stating that it did not want to express an opinion on the proposal' s legal validity as long as the proposal was being debated in the Council.
I simply believe it would be wrong for us to proceed to a vote here in Parliament before such a legal evaluation has been made available to us.
I find the Council' s answer totally unacceptable.
I would ask my fellow MEPs to support Amendment No 9 so that we can obtain a new reading in the committee.
Thank you, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, for having so clearly explained the significance of this amendment, which I shall now put to a roll-call vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
