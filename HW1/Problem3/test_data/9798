The climatic and agricultural conditions prevailing in Poland mean that biofuels should have priority for immediate support, with geothermal energy in second place.
The experience gained to date, however, does not paint a particularly rosy picture concerning the production of electricity from solid biomass.
Amongst other reasons this is due to the low efficiency of conversion of heat energy into electrical energy, and also to logistical and environmental problems.
In addition, wood-based biomass has to be dried to remove about 20% of its water content, and this process consumes additional energy.
Another priority for Poland could be energy contained in municipal waste.
Not only is this energy source constantly renewing itself, but is actually increasing at a dramatic and alarming rate.
By definition, it is certainly a renewable source of energy.
Existing technologies such as pyrolysis make it possible to obtain hydrocarbons from the waste and convert them efficiently into electrical energy.
The benefits are twofold: energy as well as a form of secondary recycling and liquidation of landfill sites.
The Commission should recognise this type of energy as renewable energy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, MrÂ Turmes, has, in his own inimitable manner, produced a thorough report, this time on a strategy for the use of renewable energies.
The report deserves credit and speaks for itself.
It is predicted that the worldâs population and use of energy will continue to grow.
When we speak of renewable biofuels and the cultivation of energy crops, it must be realised that energy production competes with food production for the same area of land.
Considering the current prices of oil and grain, it may be cheaper to use grain rather than oil as a heating fuel.
At the same time, a large number of people in the world are starving.
That is the way the market mechanisms work.
While following the Greensâ energy strategy â and MrÂ Turmes is a Green â I have noticed that there is a hostile attitude to research into the use of fusion energy.
Like MrÂ Turmes, we are in favour of financing research into renewable energy sources and energy efficiency under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.
That, however, cannot be allowed to happen at the expense of research into nuclear fusion.
Mankind needs to explore this possibility for energy production thoroughly.
It is an energy resource which is halfway between being renewable and non-renewable.
We are faced with problems, and solving them will rely on the coordination of population growth, food production and renewable energy production.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on a highly informative report on the 21 types of renewable energy, which will play an ever-increasing role in the 21st century, whether from a climate-change perspective or that of the security of supply of fossil fuels and increasing prices.
My own country, Ireland, is uniquely placed for the development of green energy and green fuel: we have the technological base, the climate and amongst the strongest wind and waves in Europe off our Atlantic coast.
Just yesterday our minister announced a new scheme to support another 400 megawatts of renewable capacity.
However, despite all of that, the ambition of our renewables sector is completely frustrated.
Again the minister has got it wrong: his proposal is an attempt to defy economic gravity.
He is proposing the only scheme in Europe to cap prices and quantities.
This will totally distort competition in a market that is already stacked against independent renewable generators.
We do not have de facto liberalisation of the electricity market in Ireland.
The investigation into anti-competitiveness practices in the electricity market announced six months ago by Commissioner Kroes will no doubt show that the ESB â our Electricity Supply Board â like its French counterpart EDF, still holds an effective monopoly and abuses its dominant position as the gatekeeper of the national grid, instead of ring-fencing generation from grid operation with cross-subsidisation of uneconomic fossil fuel generation with the national grid profits.
The fear that the ESB could switch off the lights at any time causes the regulators to take a softly, softly approach to the opening up of the market.
There is nothing the government can do!
It has relinquished all power to form policy in this particular area.
The 1999 Act, which set up the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation, had an in-built provision for ministerial policy directions to be cut off in 2002.
Conveniently the author of that act is now head of the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation, which has carte blanche to regulate without any government input or supervision.
Necessary independent arbitration should not preclude ministerial policy directions.
We have what is effectively a marginal grid policy, where each project requires an upgrade of the grid and has to fight for access on an ad hoc basis.
The bureaucracy and financial uncertainty this causes for renewables is considerable.
It is high time the Irish Government took back control over shaping a progressive renewables policy in Ireland.
Â Â  I represent a Member State which certainly occupies penultimate place in the European Union in the use of renewable energy.
The reason for this is Estoniaâs heavily-polluting and very inefficient â and yet monopolistic â oil shale-based energy.
The only partly unavoidable reason for using this energy source is the fact that the value of oil shale is not based on the world price, but has instead been determined by a committee at the Ministry of Economics and Communications.
Thus, in heating buildings, we have been independent of price fluctuations on the world market.
Now, however, companies which produce oil from oil shale have apparently raised their prices considerably through a cartel agreement.
Since sustainable energy has not been seriously implemented in Estonia, many consumers have no other options.
As we all know, it is the poor who suffer the most from price increases.
Today, from morning till evening, the European Parliament has been discussing possible measures for the alleviation of both the social and economic consequences.
Our Minister of Economics and Communications, however, has shrugged his shoulders and claimed that there is nothing he can do if oil shale companies have tied the price of oil shale to the price of oil.
The price of oil shale itself, however, has not risen.
The moral is that the European Union must increase pressure on those Member Statesâ governments that are burying their heads in the sand.
I wish all power to representative Andris Piebalgs, and I would like to thank MEP Claude Turmes for taking a large step in the right direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to make some brief remarks.
First, I can assure you that the Commission will do everything within its legal powers to implement the existing directives.
Second, there has been enough evidence given today about the necessity for a directive using renewables in heating and cooling.
The arguments in favour of that are very strong.
I would also like to mention that it is extremely important that the Committees on the Environment and Agriculture were consulted but, if the objective of renewables is to be successful, then other committees should also take these questions on board.
As long as it is just the Committee on Energy, the goals will not be achieved.
It is a much broader issue â the committee responsible for taxation questions and other committees, especially those that are concerned with economic development, should deal with these issues.
The report on the situation of the internal market will be ready in November.
Then I will be glad to discuss with you the situation and challenges in different Member States.
Definitely the situation of market liberalisation differs from one Member State to another.
I thank the rapporteur and everyone else who contributed to this very good report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
I strongly welcome the Turmes report outlining the future of renewables according to the overall guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy.
I also agree that within the framework of a consistent European energy policy, renewable energy sources can have a positive impact on job creation, environment protection, market integration, research and development, innovation, as well as sustainable economic development in the coming decades.
However, I would like to point out that technologies using renewable energy are very expensive, both in terms of their absolute value and their efficiency.
Having said that, the price of energy, especially under current circumstances, is a highly sensitive issue in many of the Member States, to such an extent that it can even endanger social cohesion itself.
Therefore I believe that before starting to prepare an overly ambitious policy on renewable energy it is extremely important to support cohesion between regions, Member States and small regions as well as the integration of the European energy market by a comprehensive energy policy based on reasonable balance.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission declaration on the human rights of minority groups in Kosovo.
Â Â  . Mr President, this declaration covers answers to three questions posed by honourable Members relating to the human rights situation of the Roma in Kosovo.
Generally, it would be fair to say that the return process for all minorities has thus far failed in Kosovo, with only 13Â 000 returnees since 1999.
Furthermore it would be a fair assessment to say that the Roma community is in a very disadvantaged position in Kosovo.
The Commission is concerned that the forced returns of members of the Roma community may be happening in a framework that does not ensure their safe and sustained reintegration into Kosovo society after they return.
Meanwhile the Commission supports the Roma community where it can, notably through our assistance programmes to improve the overall sustainability of their living conditions.
At the same time, we do not target forced returnees specifically.
The second question concerns the issue of whether the principle of non-refoulement is being fully respected in the event of the forcible repatriation of Roma refugees to Kosovo.
It is not within the Commission's remit to establish whether the principle of non-refoulement is fully respected or not.
The ultimate administrative responsibility falls to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, as well as to the European Union Member States that have decided to forcibly return members of the Roma community to Kosovo.
Meanwhile in March 2005 the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, assessed that returns should be considered unsafe for Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Roma, as well as Kosovo Albanians where they are in a minority situation.
Returns for Ashkali, Egyptians as well as Gorani and Bosniak people are considered safer.
As far as the Commission is aware, the agreement between UNMIK and the German government on forced returns concerns the Ashkali and Egyptian minorities only, and not the Roma and other minority groups.
Thirdly, the question on Roma in Kosovo in general.
All progress reports contain a chapter on the political situation and the criteria as laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993.
This chapter contains a section on minorities and minority protection in candidate and potential candidate countries, including the Western Balkan countries.
This year's progress report on Kosovo will be no exception and thus provides an assessment of the situation of minorities, including Roma.
This issue will also be regularly monitored and addressed in future progress reports and in the Commission's political dialogue with Kosovo.
Of course we will very carefully study what Ambassador Kia Eide will present in his standard report on Kosovo, which is due in a few weeks.
This will concern the implementation of the decentralisation measures and the critical issue of minority protection.
That report will be indispensable when it comes to determining the likely start of the status talks on Kosovo in the course of this autumn.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, our opinions differ on many issues, but I hope that we shall at least succeed in reaching a certain consensus in the field of minority rights.
The Commissionerâs home country, Finland, has in place an exemplary settlement for its Swedish minority.
There was once one of our own fellow Members in this House who had the same surname as you, and she belonged to that minority.
It is high time that the European Union developed uniform standards for minorities, not only within the EU â where, to be frank, there are no standards at all for minorities, which is a problem â but also in our external relations with the candidate countries and with the associated countries.
We cannot keep arbitrarily picking out this or that minority in this or that country, but instead should make a real attempt to arrive at a common basis.
I believe that the Kosovan Constitution, which President Rugova developed whilst underground, contains exemplary minority rights.
Then there was the mass expulsion of the Albanians inÂ 1999, and since then the wounds of the war have been bleeding.
A few years after a war such as this, the return of the displaced persons is of course the most difficult chapter.
Yet we should begin with the right to vote.
The right to vote does exist, and seats in the Kosovan Parliament are reserved for minorities.
I should like to ask the Commissioner what he, and what the EU, is doing to ensure that all minorities actually take up the seats in the Kosovan Parliament to which they are entitled.
Secondly, is the Commissioner aware that, in neighbouring Serbia, there are no seats at all for minorities?
What is the Commissioner doing to ensure that the same standards are applied to the Serbian Parliament regarding the right to vote as are applied in Kosovo?
In Kosovo, minorities have a disproportionately large parliamentary representation, whilst in Serbia, in view of the 5% threshold and the fact that Serbia is a single constituency, there are no seats at all for minorities.
These are glaring differences.
How do you see the outcome of the status question, which has to be resolved taking these issues into account?
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to make a point of thanking Commissioner Rehn for his objective presentation of the drastic situation of minorities in Kosovo.
It truly is worrying that this is the first time since 1999 that the European Parliament has debated the question of minority rights in Kosovo.
This policy of double standards, this selective sensitivity towards the Serb minority and towards other minorities in Kosovo is truly worrying.
If we look at the situation as described in the reports by both the High Commissioner for Refugees and the special UN envoy, we see that, since 2004, after the bloody events and the murder of Serbs and other minorities, nothing has improved in Kosovo as regards the protection of minority rights.
We see constant ethnic bloodshed, not to say ethnic cleansing against the minorities in Kosovo by the hard-line nationalistic gangs in Albania.
Not only is UN Resolution 1244/1999 not being applied, it is also being undermined.
None of the eight criteria set on the basis of the principle of 'standards before status' is being applied, it has not been implemented and I should like to ask the Commissioner what the European Union's policy is, if it will assent to the start of negotiations at the UN on the final status of Kosovo without these criteria having been met.
The European Union designed a European strategy on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council in Thessaloniki.
We support a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo which will move towards future integration into the European institutions.
That being so, however, we must help to shape stable democratic institutions.
The European Commission must make use of Community programmes, such as CARDS to fund development programmes, and of education, culture and youth programmes for the benefit of all the citizens of Kosovo.
The restoration of the churches and cultural monuments of the minorities, especially the Serb minority, must also be funded.
To close, the European Parliament must take its responsibilities.
Â Â  . Mr President, at the end of June I became aware of the fact that 35 thousand refugees are in deep trouble in Germany.
They had all arrived from Kosovo six years ago.
All of them are Roma. It does not matter whether we call them Ashkalis or âEgyptiansâ.
In the first half of July, the chairmen of the fractions â except for the conservatives â urged the German Government in a letter to re-consider its decision.
Namely, Germany has decided to repatriate 35 thousand Roma to Kosovo.
To the very country where only six thousand Roma remained out of 150 thousand, and even this small group continues to live there in inhuman circumstances. They live in refugee camps in their own land.
Severe lead pollution was detected in the refugee camp situated in northern Mitrovica, with lead levels six times higher than normal, resulting in many children being born with various impairments ever since.
The houses that had been used by Roma before the war are now illegally occupied by Albanians or other people, or have been demolished.
Germany has been thinking for six years about whether or not to grant refugee status to the Roma, and has now decided to send them back to Kosovo, to nothing.
Another approximately 70 thousand Roma are living mostly illegally in other European or Balkan states, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Macedonia, Serbia, etc.
We have no mother country to take us in when we find ourselves in such a situation.
When I propounded this debate, I actually asked that Europe as a whole take a position in this matter, and not that ten MEPs discuss the issue of minorities after 11Â p.m. here in the European Parliament.
We, the Members of the European Parliament, must exert an influence on Germany.
Deportation must be stopped and the problem of Kosovo must be tackled.
Â Â  . Mr President, since the arrival of the UN Mission in Kosovo in 1990, the Kosovo Liberation Army, or UCK, has been using torture, rape, targeted killings, arson and burning of Roma houses as methods of ethnic cleansing against the Roma community from Kosovo, Ashkali and Egyptians included.
The UN administration did not find any appropriate measures to calm down the Kosovo-Albanian majority.
On the contrary, many clear cases of anti-gypsyism are not prosecuted and charges are not even brought.
Today Kosovo is a human rights vacuum.
Access of Roma to housing, healthcare and jobs remains extremely difficult, while children stop attending school for security reasons or due to lack of money.
It cannot be a surprise that many returnees are selling their property, unwilling to live in fear and indignity.
In wartime citizens of all ethnic backgrounds flee.
When war is over it is unacceptable that one or two ethnic groups are welcomed as citizens and codecision makers, whereas the others find themselves changed into disadvantaged groups, minorities and IDPs.
This double standard approach on the basis of ethnic background is the worst scenario for the founding of an independent state.
With the final status discussions drawing near, the exclusion of the Roma from the decision-making process would be one more proof of the lack of respect for East European citizens.
The high level pan-European consortium ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, while we have been sitting in this House today, the German television station ARD has been presenting the 2005 Media Prizes for Cultural Diversity and Integration in Europe.
The television prize in the information category was awarded to a report on forced deportations of asylum seekers and refugees at dawn.
This is a harsh reality for what are possibly soon to be thousands of Ashkali and Egyptians, who in principle belong to the Roma family of peoples, and other Kosovars, who have often been living in Germany or other European countries for more than ten years, and whose children were born and have become socially integrated there.
Sadly, in Kosovo they do not find even the most basic conditions for starting a new life.
Their houses have been destroyed; the unemployment rate stands at approximately 60%.
There is no free access to education, particularly for minorities.
I find this irresponsible.
I would appeal to the Commissioner to make every effort to prevent Member States carrying out forced returns, or for him to at least press for an increase in financial support.
This also applies to the unacceptable situation, which has already been mentioned, of approximately 700 Roma living in camps in northern Mitrovica, for whose resettlement there are insufficient resources.
This is a violation of fundamental human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for those remarks, of which I have taken due note.
We will take them into account in our future work.
I will begin by responding to the questions from Members MohÃ¡csi, de Groen-Kouwenhoven and Kallenbach.
There are three camps of internally displaced persons in northern Mitrovica for Roma Ashkali and Egyptian people.
These sites suffer from major lead pollution as a result of the activities of the former Trepca mining complex and this poses a serious health risk to the inhabitants.
In July 2004, the World Health Organization released a report on elevated platelet levels in those communities and recommended a set of emergency measures, including the evacuation of the centres.
An agreement was signed in April 2005 by UNMIK, UNHCR, OSCE and the President of the Mitrovica Municipal Assembly, creating a framework for the return of former residents of the Roma Mahala to their homes in southern Mitrovica.
Unfortunately, however, this process has not yet started.
In the case of the Roma Mahala, we could not easily make funding available and so have communicated the request to all EU Member States through the Management Committee, asking them to consider making sufficient funds available.
We will continue to raise this issue on the ground through our EU liaison office and the European Agency for Reconstruction, which works in that area.
I would also like to respond to Mr Posselt's question concerning minority rights in different countries, in the EU, in accession countries and in our partner countries.
It is true, as Mr Posselt said, that there are many violations inside the European Union.
The minimum rights of minorities are set out in the relevant documents of the Council of Europe and the Convention on Human Rights.
Some countries inside the European Union stick close to the minimum standards, while others go beyond that and have a very high level of minority rights and protection.
As the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, I am faced with difficult situations, because it is hard for us to go beyond what some EU Member States practice.
Nevertheless, we must practice what we preach when we are dealing with our partners, whether they are accession countries or countries in the wider world.
That has to be taken into account, nevertheless.
I agree that there is a case for working towards a more uniform definition of minority rights.
In my view, human rights in general and the rights of minorities are at the heart of the European idea and of the European Union.
Therefore, we should not see it as a static product but as a dynamic process which develops these rights at ever higher levels inside the European Union and throughout Europe.
Finally, concerning the questions raised by several Members on the future of Kosovo and its standards and status, there is clearly an urgent need for the economic and social development of Kosovo.
The level of unemployment depends on which statistics you look at.
However, it is at least 40% and often more than 50%, and the situation on the ground is extremely difficult.
People have no hope at the moment.
Therefore it is high time to move from stability and reconstruction towards defining the status and working for economic and social development and for the real needs of citizens.
That is why it is time for the European Union to move from a policy of standards before status to a policy of standards status so that we move forward in the status talks, ensuring that they can start soon and be conducted and concluded without unnecessary delay.
In that context, it is worth noting that the Council has reached an agreement at working group level on the negotiating guidelines for the stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro.
That is important because it enables us to open the negotiations on the stabilisation and accession agreement around the fifth anniversary of the democratic transition in Belgrade and, moreover, because it will make Serbia and Montenegro's European prospects concrete and tangible and will also pave the way for a genuine dialogue on Kosovo and a resolution of the question of its status without undue and unnecessary delays.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Roma living in Kosovo become victims of racial discrimination on a regular basis. Discrimination affects them in all areas of their lives.
They live in the internment camp of Mitrovica in inhuman circumstances, their health is endangered by poisonous water in the wells, and the local authorities do not take appropriate measures to eliminate the problem.
Refugee status must be granted to Roma coming from Kosovo.
We often hear about Roma being repatriated, in spite of the fact that the prevailing international law clearly prohibits the repatriation of refugees.
In this context I would also like to call to your attention the right to family reunification, which grants Roma, just like all other immigrants, the right for protection together with their families within the Member States.
According to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, legal immigration must be made possible to all victims of inhuman treatment and war who were forced to leave their country because they had lived in constant fear and danger, were persecuted, their homes were burnt down and their lives were in constant jeopardy.
We must find a solution for the protection of these victims.
Special attention must be paid to the situation of children because they are especially vulnerable.
In my opinion, the issue of migration must soon be re-considered so that a solid European immigration policy can be developed.
Opportunities for illegal immigration must be reduced and appropriate protection must be ensured for each legal immigrant within the European Union.
There are rumours of 38 thousand refugees in Western Europe who have been forcibly repatriated to a country where their human rights are not granted.
I would respectfully ask for the support of all fellow Members on this issue so that such a situation can never occur in our Europe.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0225/2005) by Ari Vatanen on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission communication âEuropean Road Safety Action Programme: halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibilityâ [2004/2162(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a pity that this debate is taking place so late, because when you drive home on an empty stomach that can be a safety hazard too.
Debate on traffic safety is a question of attitude.
It is a question and a test of how we value human life.
That is what it amounts to: is human life precious to us?
The figures regarding traffic safety are as bleak and grim as the weather outside tonight.
There are about 50 000 deaths per year, about 2 million people are injured.
It is the main cause of death in the under-50s age group.
It costs about 2% of GNP, equivalent to EUR 200 billion.
But that is only money.
We have to realise that what is at stake is the human suffering.
Why do we do so little?
It is because it is not the Concorde which crashes, it is not the pride of the UK and France which crashes.
When that happened, all Concordes were grounded immediately.
No stone was left unturned in seeking to remedy the problem.
But when it comes to traffic safety, it is just one family crying here, another family crying there.
Their lives are shattered, amputated.
You do not recover from it.
You have to live with it.
And perhaps only those people who have experienced that know what the grief of a family means.
When I was a small boy I was with my entire family in a motor car when my father was killed.
I remember him leaning against the steering wheel, that anxiety in my chest.
I am sure that experience has left me with a bigger internal handicap than I dare to admit.
There is still so much that we could do and can do.
First of all law enforcement.
Okay, that is not an EU matter, it is not within our competence, but that is by far the most efficient way to get things done - through law enforcement, just abiding by and obeying the current rules.
On the way here tonight I saw the French police carrying out an alcohol check.
When more radars appeared on French roads, immediately fatalities came down.
Sometimes I think that, although it is a matter for subsidiarity, EU citizens should be protected from their respective governments.
I am sorry to say that, but that is how it is, because we do not seem to realise the magnitude of the problem.
There are incredible discrepancies between different States.
It is up to eight times safer in the UK or in Sweden than in some of the new Member States - eight times - imagine that incredible diversity!
We have to learn from one another.
From now on we must carry out a systematic scrutiny of what is going from country to country.
We have to render that transparent, so that people know about it, so that they make a noise about it, so that they create political pressure.
We must coordinate our actions and we must disseminate our best practices.
If we make mistakes, why should those mistakes be made in those countries which are still on the road to development?
We have to name, shame and fame.
That leads to action.
When people have been woken up they will demand action from the politicians in their various Member States.
At an EU level we can promote new technology, we can promote new cars with fiscal incentives.
At the moment a Chinese car is coming onto the European market, with no EU approval.
That should be stopped, because it is downright dangerous.
We must invest more money in infrastructure.
We should have an infrastructure directive on TEN roads.
Europeans are mobile thanks to the European road network. It is not justified, or fair on European competitiveness, that we should spend so much money on railways, which serve so little purpose compared to the road network.
We have to be just in that allocation.
Yet things are not so bleak.
Traffic has grown threefold since 1970 and yet fatalities have been halved.
So cultures can be changed.
We must believe in the new generation.
At the end of the day, whatever we do, responsibility always lies with the individual.
At the end of the day we are responsible.
Mr President, I know my time is up.
The EU must act decisively.
When our time really up, hopefully it will not happen on a road.
There are still many small boys out there waiting for their fathers.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking MrÂ Vatanen for his excellent work.
Over the next few months, the Commission will provide an assessment of the third Road Safety Action Programme and MrÂ Vatanenâs comprehensive and balanced report will provide useful fodder for the considerations that the Commission needs to take to prepare this mid-term review.
This report demonstrates the need for common initiatives at European level.
To follow up on the 2001 White Paper on European transport policy, the European Union had already set the objective of halving the number of deaths on the roads of the 15Â Member States at that time by 2010.
The benefit of this objective was that it mobilised each country within the framework of its national competences.
The results are noticeable.
Today, in the enlarged EU, some Member States have made remarkable progress in implementing credible and dissuasive control and sanction policies.
In other countries, however, progress has been more modest and shows that considerable efforts remain to be made.
We must recognise that the Unionâs policy on road safety has remained in the embryonic stages for too long, because of the subsidiarity principle.
You just have to think back to the unsuccessful debate on setting a general blood alcohol limit; and the current difficulties in making certain Member States adopt the revised directive on driving licences, even though it is essential for preventing fraud, also bear witness to this.
Without anticipating the mid-term review that the Commission will publish shortly, three points in MrÂ Vatanenâs report are worth commenting on.
Firstly, we need to ensure that the essential rules, whether with regard to speed limits, blood alcohol limits or the requirement to wear a seatbelt, are respected.
At the moment, we cannot help but notice that Member Statesâ interventions against drivers who breach these rules are limited, in the absence of cross-border cooperation.
I am particularly grateful to MrÂ Vatanen for advocating considerably closer cooperation between Member States to control and deal with offences.
I would point out to you that the Commission intends to launch an initiative next year to improve the organisation of cross-border enforcement.
My second comment relates to the improvement of infrastructure.
Progress could be made everywhere and, in some Member States, considerable efforts are needed.
The European Union, via the cofinancing that it provides under the Structural Funds, already contributes to the construction of safer and more modern infrastructure.
A legislative instrument, as MrÂ Vatanen said, could prove necessary to make impact assessments, audits and road safety inspections, including dealing with black spots, more systematic.
My third comment is that technological innovation in vehicles is a decisive element in road safety.
A dialogue has been launched between the Commission and the European automotive industry.
This relates to the initiative known as CARSÂ 21, as part of which your Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will soon organise a Parliamentary forum.
The technical standards needed to enable innovations play an important role, but we must, as MrÂ Vatanen points out, properly understand the costs and benefits of these innovations before we bring them into widespread use.
It is in this spirit that the Commission is currently assessing the possibilities for new initiatives to encourage the installation of mirrors that eliminate the blind spot and the use of daytime running lights.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that opinion polls show that European citizens put road safety at the top of their list of concerns, thus echoing what MrÂ Vatanen explained so well, illustrating his speech with some personal memories, which were very moving.
The European Union cannot continue to do nothing in the face of the citizensâ worries.
Of course, we must take subsidiarity into account, but, in view of the increase in international traffic on trans-European networks, in other words the number of foreign drivers on the main arterial routes of each country, we cannot avoid asking ourselves whether the limits currently set on the EUâs actions are the right ones and whether we should simply decide, in the name of subsidiarity, to leave the Member States to face this scourge alone.
In order to achieve our consistent collective objective of reducing the number of deaths on the roads by 2010, above and beyond the initiatives that I have already mentioned, the exchanges of good practice and the initial considerations need to be as open as possible, and relate particularly to the adoption of measures targeted at professional drivers and at young drivers, who are particularly prone to accidents.
MrÂ Vatanenâs report is therefore very timely.
I would like to thank him for his very open reflections on the problem as a whole and I will listen attentively, MrÂ President, to the comments by the Members, who I know are keen to make progress on the good cause of road safety.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, imagine it is 31Â December and the news tickers are announcing 50Â 000 dead and several million injured, some seriously, in Europe.
What horror, what an outcry this information should provoke.
Yet people are indifferent, unmoved.
Was it a false alarm?
No; it was only that yearâs statistics on victims of road accidents in the European Union.
Have we really done enough to combat indifference towards road accidents and to improve road safety?
Could it be that vehicles are, after all, modern weapons in the hands of millions of Europeans?
There is no need to worry: no one in this House is considering banning vehicles; it is only in the way we use them that a decisive improvement is needed.
I should like to extend my thanks and congratulations to MrÂ Vatanen for his excellent report.
He succeeded in showing the complexity and interactions of hazards on our roads, so that both the Commission and the Member States can be obliged to do more towards the achievement of road safety in Europe.
We urge the Commission to help towards accelerating the implementation of the Action Programme, and we also encourage it to develop a long-term road-safety concept, which goes far beyond 2010 and is oriented towards the âzero visionâ, namely the avoidance of all fatalities caused by road accidents.
I welcome the choice of an integrated approach, which takes into account all three components of road traffic: road users â drivers and pedestrians â the vehicles themselves, and also infrastructure such as roads and tunnels.
Vehicles can be equipped with the latest technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Intelligent Speed Adaptation or eCall, but there will be no improvement in safety unless there is intelligent interaction with the person actually doing the driving.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank Mr Vatanen for the huge job he has done on this report and for his dedication to it, and I would also like once again to express the frustration I feel given the great sense of expectation and potential I felt, knowing that Mr Vatanen was the rapporteur for this report.
In his report, it is clear that his diagnosis is not wrong, in fact he acknowledges it, he emphasises it and presents it in such a dramatic fashion as the figures.
The full magnitude of the problem is not therefore expressed.
He also points out that there is a great discrepancy between the safety percentages of the different Member States, but I believe that that discrepancy does not exist in the diagnoses or in the most useful instrument: the legislation, setting limits and dissuasive measures.
What is truly frustrating is to see that what we are proposing today for the European Union, for a Union in which, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, we citizens are seeking a strong message and added value, in terms of what each Member State has been wisely imposing, there are great differences and, sometimes, enormous deficiencies, in relation to the legislation on speed limits, limits for alcohol in the blood and the use of safety belts.
In this regard, we believe that this is the time to take that step and the Socialist Group has presented an amendment in which we call upon the Commission, following the evaluation of the Recommendation, specifically in the case of limits for alcohol in the blood, also to offer us the necessary legislative measures applicable to those three aspects that are fundamental, which all the European citizens and all the Member States recognise.
But they also recognise that there are problems.
And it is in relation to these coordination problems that the greatest weakness lies.
We would therefore call on the Commission to be understanding and to accept our amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin my minute-long speech by thanking the rapporteur, Ari Vatanen, for this excellent and thorough report.
The report reflects MrÂ Vatanenâs expertise and experience.
Moreover, his calling as someone who preaches road safety is reflected in this report in the form of positive mediation and action to support the aim to actually halve road deaths by the year 2010, which is our common objective.
The report contains some excellent proposals concerning compliance with rules and legal provisions relating to seatbelts, speed limits and alcohol.
It is very important to invest in roads and to remember the importance of education and enlightened attitudes.
In addition to this, we need awareness, since the biggest threat on the roads is always to be found between the steering wheel and the driverâs seat.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too should like to say thank you for, above all, the first part of MrÂ Vatanenâs introduction today.
I thought it was a quite brilliant description of the extent of the problem.
The problem is on a horribly huge scale, and it is appalling that we are not doing anything more serious about it.
Indeed, I have to say that the proposals produced by MrÂ Vatanen really have no bearing on the extent of the problem.
The larger and broader roads would be there for many more cars to drive faster on.
We can say with some certainty that the result would be more accidents when, instead, we should be limiting traffic.
I am delighted that the report mentions vulnerable road users and that the aim is to have no accidents at all.
The fact is, however, that this report would offer no protection at all to vulnerable road users unless we were to have the amendments adopted that would set fixed speed limits in Europe, namely a maximum of 130 km per hour on motorways and 30 km per hour in towns, and unless, at the same time, something serious were done to have these requirements complied with.
I think that the proposals, pathetic as they are, fall spectacularly short of dealing with the problems so splendidly described by MrÂ Vatanen.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank MrÂ Vatanen for this report and for a notable piece of work.
What we face is a serious problem, but I want to point out that we are on the right road in Europe.
We have a huge number of fatalities â far too many; indeed, no figure is acceptable â but the numbers are going down.
It is important for Europe to be a model in the global work to promote road safety, and that is something we can be.
We are a model where technical development is concerned.
If we obtain better cars in Europe and the rest of the world, we shall reduce the number of fatalities.
We must make use of constructive examples, such as the proposal we have in AmendmentÂ 5 whereby those purchasing haulage services would be urged to demand road safety from those selling the services.
Use can be made of legislation, for example in relation to alcohol and driving, for we know that no one should ever drive when drunk.
I do not, however, think that legislation should be used as a tool where speed is concerned, because the state of a road can vary a very great deal, and one road be in a different condition to another.
We need, then, not to take a uniform view of road safety.
In that way, we can set a good example to the rest of the world.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I will be fairly brief, but that is not to say that I am underestimating this problem, which is a major one.
I am therefore very pleased with this debate.
I find comfort in the conviction that effective control is vital.
It is true that we must have a better influence on the behaviour of drivers, particularly of young drivers.
We must also not forget the importance of education from a very early age and we must mobilise all our energy and gather all our resources to combat this scourge.
That is clearly a responsibility shared between the European Union, our Member States and our regions, but also by every one of us.
I would like to say quite simply, echoing MrÂ Vatanenâs report, that the three institutions of the Union now seem to be converging towards the same objective: namely the desire to make progress down this path.
It is about time, because we have gone from 50Â 000 deaths to 43Â 000 deaths in the 25 Member States.
We are a long way from reaching the targets we set ourselves.
As a consequence, we are going to have to redouble our efforts.
As for the Council, on 4 and 5Â November we will hold an informal meeting in Verona on the subject of road safety.
I also know that the Austrian Presidency will also want to work hard to come up with new solutions.
I am therefore delighted that Parliament feels so committed and I must say that, with regard to the Commissionâs commitment and to my own personal commitment, you can be certain that I really will make every possible effort both to convince the Member States to get involved in considerably more courageous policies and to assess what the European Union, at its level, can provide and require.
That is why this report is so very apropos, and it comes as a wake-up call for consciences in this matter, which, indeed, requires from all of us resolute and determined ethical behaviour.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The target of achieving a further reduction of 50 % of road accident victims by 2010 might be ambitious but not impossible through proper and combined measures.
The setting of targets, allocation of responsibilities and proper planning can contribute to the success of this ambitious programme.
Legislation, social acceptance, planning and monitoring are integrated elements of this strategy.
There is a striking diversity between Member States in many aspects which should be taken into consideration: cultural, diversity in attitude and, one of the biggest difference, economic wealth, the latter being the major cause of bad quality of road, limited length of highways.
This is also one of the reasons of grave road safety records of most of the ten new Member States this is mainly why we are lagging far behind the EU-15.
Iâm sure that the introduction of the European driving licence, the strict conditions to get that licence and enabling the physical and mental faculties of drivers and their driving skills checked over time is a must.
It is extremely important that proper continuously updated information and monitoring network throughout the EU should be established which could help a lot with cooperation of authorities in road safety surveillance.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Commission on the textile industry.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European textile and clothing industry is, and will remain, an essential part of the EU's industrial and social fabric.
The figures speak for themselves: around 2.5 million employees, about 4% of EU GNP.
There has been a significant reduction in employment in the sector over the past years.
That is unavoidable in an increasingly open world economy, but this fact is of no consolation to the worker who loses his or her job.
The role of the Commission and the European Union as such is to provide a predictable framework for the European producers and importers in the context of an open economy.
However, this framework must be a compromise between widely differing objectives.
On the one hand, we must and will ensure continued protection of our industry against unfair trade practices.
Also, if there are genuinely unforeseeable and major surges in imports, the European Commission should be ready to provide temporary relief to the European textile and clothing industry without neglecting other interests at stake, such as those of importers, traders and distribution or of industry that is sourcing abroad.
On the other hand, we must respect our commitments to China and help it to become a responsible WTO member.
China, provided it avoids unfair trade practices, is entitled to enjoy the benefits of its comparative advantages and its WTO accession, while managing its integration into the global economy in a way that avoids trade disruption.
This is what we have called the 'smooth transition'.
As far as the textile and clothing sector is concerned, the scene for what is happening today was set a decade ago.
It was agreed during the Uruguay Round that we would gradually abolish the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports in the textile and clothing sector by 1 January 2005, after a decade of transition.
However, few anticipated the scale and speed of China's rise in this sector.
There is a need to create a positive environment in international trade for textiles and clothing after the end of the textile and clothing agreement.
The European textile and clothing sector has already proved that it can adjust to difficult situations and that it has the capacity to compete.
One fact is often ignored: the EU remains the world's second largest exporter of textiles and clothing.
This fact contradicts the view of those who see globalisation and the rise of China, and India in particular, as a swamping of European markets by low-cost producers.
The truth is that the EU can compete globally but it involves a process of restructuring and adjustment playing to our strengths, not to the strengths of other countries.
We should focus on innovative, high-tech, valued-added textiles in which we are strong.
It also requires that other countries, not least the most competitive textiles and clothing exporting countries, should open their markets to competition too.
That is why the current negotiations in the Doha development round are so important and China has to fulfil the commitments it made when it joined the WTO.
When China joined the World Trade Organization it accepted a formal commitment that allowed the importing countries to apply special textile-specific safeguard measures if imports from China were to increase very rapidly and cause prejudice to the industry of importing countries.
It did not apply unilateral measures.
The EU and China reached a reasonable and balanced memorandum of understanding on 11 June 2005.
This agreement was the result of months of patient and difficult negotiations aimed at dealing with this problem in a negotiated way with China, rather than through unilateral safeguard action which would inevitably have had unwelcome repercussions.
Above all it enables the European Union and China to focus on a more positive overall trade agenda and to continue building a solid trade and economic partnership in the textile and clothing sector as well.
Let me recall that this memorandum of understanding gives a breathing space to the European industry, giving it extra time to adjust.
It also provides a predictable and sure trading environment between the EU and China for the textile and clothing sector enabling businesses, including both the manufacturing industry and importers, to plan their investments with more time and to adjust.
It affords temporary protection to the current position of many vulnerable and poorer countries in the EU market and avoids a wide-ranging trade dispute with the EU's second largest trading partner.
What has been agreed is the maximum we could have extracted from China in terms of an agreed limitation of their exports, against the background of their and our WTO obligations.
On 5 September the EU and China decided through agreed minutes to fine-tune the implementation of the memorandum of understanding.
These agreed minutes aim to unblock as a matter of urgency goods shipped after 13 July, the day following the entry into force of the regulation implementing the 11 June memorandum of understanding, in excess of the agreed levels set out in the memorandum of understanding.
These agreed minutes entered into force on 13 September enabling from that moment the issuance of the necessary import licences and the release into free circulation of the merchandise which had been blocked on entry to the EU because of the exhaustion of the quantitative limits.
Through the agreed minutes, and in the spirit of close cooperation set up with the Chinese since the June memorandum of understanding, both parties decided to share the burden of the agreed solution.
Half of the blocked amounts were unblocked by advance transfers from the 2006 agreed limits, plus transfers between different categories for 2005.
The other half was unblocked through a unilateral increase by the EU of the import for 2005.
The Lucas report, which we will be discussing later, expresses concerns about the way the memorandum of understanding has been implemented, causing disruption to retailers and importers.
In the implementation of the memorandum of understanding, the Commission has acted diligently and transparently.
We have to remember that, in this case, we are dealing with unprecedented volumes of trade in clothes, which are creating unforeseen circumstances.
The difficulties arising from the transitional phase of the implementation of the memorandum of understanding should not recur due to an improved monitoring and control system applicable from now on.
Should implementation problems arise in the future, the Commission will take expeditiously the necessary measures to ensure full respect of the memorandum of understanding as complemented by the agreed minutes of 5Â September.
But we insist that from now on, importers need to make sure that they conduct their operations in compliance with current EU regulations and that they verify that the quantities are available from the agreed limits.
Looking to the future, European industry now has an additional two-and-a-half years of predictability ahead, at least with respect to the product categories covered by the memorandum of understanding.
The challenge for European industry now is to use this time to the maximum extent possible, in order to adjust to the new competitive situation that began to emerge regularly ten years ago.
The difficulty of the challenge that faces the industry should not be underestimated, especially in those sectors where China's advantages, arising out of cheap labour, make it exceedingly difficult to compete.
The Commission, aware of the difficulties that the sector is experiencing, will continue its work in several other trade policy areas to provide the best possible environment for the industry to thrive in the current competitive environment.
Among our priorities will be: securing better and effective market access in third countries, notably through the Doha development agenda negotiations, but also through bilateral contacts; fighting fraud, counterfeiting and piracy; and acting on allegations on unfair trading practices where justified.
These and other measures are being examined in the context of the high-level group on textiles and clothing.
The Commission is determined to take the necessary steps to give new momentum to those measures, which are destined to help the industry overcome successfully this transitional period.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, on 10Â June, MrÂ Mandelson concluded an agreement with China that makes it possible to monitor and limit imports of certain Chinese textiles to the European Union until the end of 2008.
However, the implementation of this agreement has run into some difficulties, such as the piling up of many goods in European ports, on which subject you have already spoken to us.
Today, following the agreement of 5Â September, we hope, Commissioner, that we can avoid new supply blockages, and avoid the entry onto European markets of additional quantities outside the Shanghai Agreement.
Similarly, we would hope that the revised agreement could take appropriate account of the interests not only of the European textile industry, which has put a great deal of effort into adjusting, but also of textile producers in developing countries who have suffered the consequences of the liberalisation of this sector.
Finally, Commissioner, how can we envisage building a sustainable future for the European textile industry beyond 2008?
In the light of the recommendations of the Textiles High Level Group and of the European Parliamentâs own-initiative report, what are the foundations for this future?
In addition, the crisis linked to Chinese textiles has taken on, in addition to social and industrial aspects, a geopolitical dimension.
I therefore think that we must now ask ourselves how, in the long term, the European Union views its commercial relations with its major partners, particularly with China.
We will also have the opportunity to debate this point when we discuss MrsÂ Lucasâs report.
In the meantime, we must identify new avenues of development for the European Unionâs industrial sectors, which will, in future, enable us to anticipate imbalances and to provide a competitive response to all global challenges.
The European Union must, at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, support its partnersâ efforts to combat the counterfeiting and piracy of textiles and clothing by effectively implementing the agreement on intellectual property rights, negotiate reciprocal access to the market by insisting on the removal of technical barriers to trade, and see to it that the social and environmental standards are applied by all.
Would that not, Commissioner, be the best way of ensuring that, ultimately, we could all trade on an equal footing?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on concluding the textile negotiations with a positive outcome.
We know how complicated and how difficult that was and our Group would like to congratulate you warmly on that.
I very much regret that the Council is not present for this debate.
We have just seen how necessary it is for the Member States to act coherently, and I find the Councilâs absence from this debate most unfortunate; I would like it to be informed that we are not happy about it.
I would like to return to a few points that Mrs SaÃ¯fi has already raised.
The safeguard measures were introduced in the context of the WTO negotiations; that also shows how skilfully the Commission, the Member States and the relevant parliamentary committee negotiated at the time.
We in Parliament have always said that this is necessary.
Regarding the first crisis we have just seen with safeguard measures, Commissioner, I would like to ask you something on behalf of my Group. Do you believe that the safeguard measures proposed during the WTO talks and agreed to by China are adequate in the light of the crisis?
Do you think that the safeguard measures perhaps need to be reviewed again and possibly amended?
When you reply, which you are welcome to do in writing, I should be grateful if you would again make an assessment of the Member Statesâ role in this crisis and suggest what must be changed in future.
There is one point you raised, Commissioner, with which I wholeheartedly agree.
You said that China has already become a political and economic world power.
That clearly shows, of course, that many of the talks we have held in the past, in the WTO or in connection with other international agreements, are now presenting us with a new challenge.
We are now dealing with major world powers: China, India, too, in other areas with its software industry, Brazil when it comes to sugar.
What challenges do you believe the European Union will have to face in the future in the light of this situation?
You said that business is capable of taking on the competition and pointed out that we are the second largest exporter.
My question, on behalf of my Group, is this: do you believe that is enough?
Do we need to do more, especially for small and medium-sized businesses?
Do you think the aid we sometimes give to firms, many of which even then are guilty of outsourcing, is sufficient?
Or would you as the Commission suggest that we need more controls to keep a proper check on it?
My final question is this.
What do you think of the idea of introducing a European label for products, including textiles, so people can see the conditions under which they were made and the standards to which they were produced?
Finally, thank you again and I look forward to your answer.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I have been trying to figure out for some time why people have not seen the disturbing developments of textile dumping from China coming any sooner, even though these developments could be clearly deduced from the product categories that were liberalised before.
I hope you will not mind me saying this, but the measures that were taken on 5 September to eliminate the quotas, particularly those on the textile products that were blocked in European ports, are reminiscent of a game of panic football.
It is obvious that the memorandum of understanding, which Commissioner Mandelson brokered with China in June, and which entailed the imposition of quantitative import restrictions on ten product categories, was very badly prepared.
How else can we explain why less than two months later, the quota for 2005 has already been used up?
The blocked goods were hurriedly cleared, and the June agreement ignored, with all the confusion that this entailed for producers, traders, buyers and consumers in the textile industry.
I have a few very concrete questions, Commissioner.
Where do we go from here?
How can the existing uncertainty and confusion be dispelled in an industry that is struggling as it is?
How do people envisage the further implementation of Juneâs memorandum of understanding?
How will imports from China be monitored in the coming months?
And what if, within a few weeksâ time, another load of clothing is stuck in European ports?
And what about the quotas laid down for subsequent years?
As you can see, the latest agreement with China clearly produces far more questions than it answers, and I fear, Commissioner, that the Commission does not have those answers either.
I hope you can convince me otherwise.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now seeing in the textile sector is the beginning of a trend or the emergence of a trend that has been going on for some time and is going to accelerate and become more acute.
We are faced with the fact that world trade is no longer what we used to imagine it would be in the future.
We always assumed that we here in Europe would do high-tech, while everyone else would supply us with cheap raw materials and cover our basic needs, as it were.
That strategy is not working because development has proceeded much quicker, as with textiles in China, for example.
If we are now saying that the agreement, the memorandum of understanding, has given us a breathing space, then it really is nothing more than that and will at best only slow the trend down somewhat, but it will not solve the underlying problems.
Europe is not adapting quickly enough.
I also note that European interests are divided in this matter, between consumers, traders and politicians.
Consumers want cheap T-shirts.
At the same time, a growing number of people in Europe are supporting campaigns like the Clean Clothes Campaign, promoting products that have been made under fairer conditions.
People want ethical standards in production; they also want ecological standards in production.
At the same time, however, everyone wants to have these low-cost products.
The traders are the same.
I would like to ask you a question, Commissioner.
If you say you believe the Commission acted diligently, how could the fact that any amount of Chinese-made products have piled up in the ports within a very short space of time be overlooked?
I fail to understand how European Heads of Government can attend the opening of firms that have relocated to China and then come home and complain about competition from China.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, there is none so deaf as he who will not hear.
This is a proverb that applies very well to the Commission and to Commissioner Mandelson.
At a time when the textile sector is experiencing a true industrial and social disaster, they were listening, but they were not hearing.
In the matter that put us in opposition to China, the European Union threw in the towel by agreeing to reassess the import quotas.
The proposals and calls for help from employeesâ unions and professional associations in the sector went unheeded.
The only winners in this affair are the dealers that fear neither God nor man, the saboteurs of European industry, masters of delocalisation at all costs.
Demonstrating quite extraordinary courage, the Commission and the Commissioner jointly decided that, faced with hundreds of thousands of job losses, faced with the closure of thousands of businesses, they urgently needed to do nothing.
They therefore hid behind this schoolyard phrase â20Â million Chinese or Indian shirts equals one Airbusâ.
This equation is particularly stupid, because even an absolute imbecile knows that it is not the textile producers who buy Airbuses but the airlines.
I can even tell you a secret: when these companies buy aeroplanes, it is because they need them, and they expect to fund these purchases from their activities, not by selling shirts.
Moreover, the United States was able to sell its Boeings at the same time as taking the necessary measures to protect its textile industry.
Faced with these pressures, with the anger of European workers and, above all, with the approach of the French referendum on the Constitution, you very strategically pulled out some tempting proposals, which were immediately received enthusiastically by all your friends in the club of two-faced hypocrites but which very quickly turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors.
As you declared so cynically, globalisation is a game in which there are winners and losers, but we cannot say that to the people, so we are sometimes required to take tactical measures.
In order to defend the interests of employees in the textile industry ...
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the textile industry is in crisis.
Two egocentric ideas are threatening it: the single-minded attitude that refuses to see what is wrong with the new international division of labour.
Today, even the high-tech industries are leaving the continent.
We must fight against this deindustrialisation of Europe and not surrender to this mirage of the tertiary sector above all.
The other idea is that of the ideology of the EU which consists, in your view, Commissioner, in seeing this industry as a relict and China being forced to look outwards as a smooth transition.
We must open our eyes if we are to save this industry.
We must re-establish the principle of Community preference as provided for in the Treaty of Rome so that competition is not competition between social systems.
We must re-establish a competitive monetary policy so that we can fight on an equal footing against the monetary dumping of the dollar and of the yuan.
In the immediate future, let us encourage China to concentrate on supplying its internal market, let us re-establish the quotas according to the 2004 standards and let us not forget the poor textile-exporting countries that are the main victims of this irresponsible policy.
MrÂ Mandelson said that âthe EU is the most open economy in the worldâ.
I will translate: âIt is the least protected economy in the worldâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, seeing one child die every minute in the developing world from whooping cough or from measles, when there is a vaccine, is heartbreaking.
Well, it is the same for textiles and delocalisation.
Watching jobs dying, watching businesses dying by the thousand, seeing all of these diseases of globalisation, when there is the possibility of developing new customs technology, is an incredible piece of obscurantism.
I have explained this to MrÂ Mandelson.
Today, the old generation of customs duties is highly complex, with quotas, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers.
It is all technically complex and inefficient.
We could, however, make it much simpler.
We simply need to invent, as we in France did for VAT in 1954, a customs duty deduction.
Under this principle, the customs duty payable on the textiles would provide the Chinese exporter with a customs credit that would be deductible on his purchases in Europe.
The Chinese exporter could use this customs credit, either on the stock market or by rediscounting it to the banks, and, very simply, we would have invented customs VAT, which has taken 50 years to spread.
I have explained this to MrÂ Danet, Secretary-General of the World Customs Organisation.
I have sent a note to MrÂ Mandelson.
Seeing where we have ended up because of technological obscurantism, though, being unable to invent a new generation of customs duties, is heartbreaking, MrÂ President.
Â Â  â Mr President, the go-ahead for the unblocking of Chinese textiles was clearly a concession to China.
It is contrary to the Shanghai philosophy of a controlled increase in imports in order to give the European industry time to adapt.
The bureaucracy of the Commission bears a great deal of responsibility here.
The Commission has given preference to the interests of importers.
The crisis in a traditional industry, the European textile industry, comes before them.
Factories are closing one after the other.
Workers' jobs come before the interests of importers.
That is the European interest and the European Commission, the guardian of European interest, is being called on to protect it.
I personally am not in favour of neo-protectionist trends in international trade.
Nonetheless, aggressive Chinese imports demonstrate that the balance of the world trade system depends on converging systems, institutional transparency and converging social and environmental protection standards.
It also depends on effective protection for intellectual and industrial property and avoiding economic, social and ecological dumping practices.
In addition, I believe that effective measures for the gradual adaptation of the European textile industry are needed, as are the necessary balancing measures in keeping with WTO law.
The Commission needs to leave all the bombast behind.
We, Parliament, have Mrs SaÃ¯fi's report and the relevant motion which accompanies it; we are pointing out the way forward for the European Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the recent review of the memorandum of understanding with China, which took place on 5Â September, is perhaps today a lesser evil rather than an actual success.
This review stems from the Commissionâs apparent inability to guarantee compliance with the international agreements to which it is signatory.
The flood of textiles since January 2005 had been on the cards and it is appalling that the Commission was neither ready for it, nor sufficiently flexible to react to it.
Furthermore, the practice of reviewing in September an agreement to which it had signed up under oath three months earlier does the Commission no credit on the international stage and severely weakens it in future negotiations.
The Commissionâs fragility is alarming and has, worse, instilled among European businesses, producers and importers alike, an atmosphere of uncertainty in terms of marking out strategies, which we must act quickly to dispel.
I should therefore be grateful, Commissioner, for direct answers to the following four questions:
One: the Commission continues to regulate production in the EU, for example with the Reach Directive.
What specific plan does the Commission have in order to ensure that the opening up of Europeâs markets will actually be accompanied by international compliance with minimum rules on human rights, the environment and workersâ rights?
Two: the high-level textiles group has recommended a range of political measures aimed at speeding up the process of revitalising the competitiveness of European textile regions, a recommendation accepted by the Commission.
You referred to these initiatives, albeit very briefly.
What exactly is the state of play with regard to these measures and to what extent does their implementation depend on the financial perspective?
Question three: what guarantees can the Commission give us that the September agreement will not suffer the same fate as the June agreement?
What capacity and/or desire has the Commission acquired since that time to monitor the agreement and ensure that it is honoured?
Question four: given that the problems facing the footwear industry are similar to those of the textiles sector, can the Commission confirm the rumours that anti-dumping measures are in the pipeline for implementation in 2006?
Thank you very much in advance for your answer, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade.
The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom.
Much of that has changed over the years.
Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds.
It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level and many valued people found themselves with redundant skills overnight.
The provision of knowledge to empower and innovate was not catered for at a national level.
The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience, but rather a window through which we evolve our industry.
The so-called 'bra wars' have been the unfortunate side effect of our lack of foresight and preparation.
Nobody is expecting change overnight.
We should not forget how remarkable it is that China and Europe have found themselves able to reach such a compromise under immense pressure, but the first tentative steps must be taken immediately before the situation worsens.
We require management, not protectionist measures.
The agreement reached is a sticking plaster on future trade relations with China and European industry must find a way to compete with low-cost competitors.
Commissioner, I am sure you will agree that current circumstances cannot be allowed to continue.
What specific measures do you intend to initiate immediately to provide the management that EU producers so require?
We simply cannot be caught unprepared and off guard again.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish firstly to thank the Commission for not, as it happened, allowing things to go completely wrong.
If EU industry is to have a chance in the future, it will not be heavy industry that holds its own but industry that is leanest, most environmentally sound and most knowledge-intensive and that also goes easy on resources.
What we have witnessed in this case has, in fact, been quite shocking.
It is specifically the old-fashioned heavy industries that have tried to do others serious damage by invoking state protection in accordance with the most repellent traditions of the rich OECD countries whose desire has been to protect their own markets but force poor countries to open up theirs.
As a rule, the result has been twice as much harm caused to the poor.
The fact is, the rich countries must open themselves up and also pin their hopes on renewal.
It was of course in order to guarantee this whole process that ten years were spent on developing the Multifibre Agreement.
There are, in actual fact, countries that have taken these matters seriously and that have managed to adapt, and without job losses.
Going back on the agreements would penalise those countries, for they cannot possibly compete successfully with government-protected sunset industries.
This is of course exactly the same as what is happening within the chemical industry, where another âChemical Aliâ, backed by governments, is coming along and trying to destroy modern industries.
We must hope that the industry we obtain is one that can hold its own, even if the poor countries get their act together, and we must do everything we can to help the poor countries thrive.
That is not something I can go into here â there is not time to do so â but that is what the aim must be, rather than that of isolating ourselves again to the detriment of everyone concerned.
Â Â  â We had hoped for something fresh from the Commission.
We had hoped for practical measures backed by appropriate, urgently-needed resources to implement important proposals laid down in Parliamentâs resolution of 6Â September.
What we heard, however, was more of the same, and attempts at defending the indefensible.
Let us cast our minds back:
On 1Â January, the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing sector was accompanied by an exponential increase in imports to the EU.
The Barroso Commission had been warned of the grave social and economic consequences for countries such as Portugal, and of the pressing need to activate the safeguard clauses provided for in the trade agreements.
Yet it was not until 6Â April that it implemented these clauses, albeit watering down the impact of their implementation.
It then took until 17Â May for it to open talks on just two categories of textile products, leading to the presentation on 10Â June of an agreement, which quite apart from turning its back on the use of the safeguarded clauses, was laden with booby-traps.
Once again, because of the absence of regulation on implementation, it did not enter into force until 20Â July, which gave the large European multinational importers and distributors time to undermine the import limits agreed in June.
In September, the Commission, pandering to the wishes of the large multinationals, this time acted quickly, and forced the admission of millions of textile and clothing items, going back on what it had itself agreed.
The moral of the story is that those who have gained from the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing trade are the large importers and distributors; it is they who have raised their profit margins to ever more outlandish levels.
The losers are the European textiles industry, the workers and the thousands of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has agreed to restrict the import of Chinese textiles, which have swamped Europe and the developed world, even though it has unfortunately taken exactly one year to do so, during which time events have unfolded as expected.
Last year, when the Commission was informed of the forecast, and a few politicians, myself included, were sounding the alarm, Europe failed to say anything and sent no warning signals, either to China or to the retail chains, and failed to prepare in time for rapid monitoring.
It was a mistake not to make it clear to retailers before they signed contracts that the EU would take protective measures and limit the growth in imports to acceptable levels, and that we would not foolishly sit back and watch an industry that provides work for millions of women in southern and central Europe die out.
Unfortunately limits were imposed only after six months had passed, after massive import contracts had been signed, and after the goods had clogged up European ports.
It was clear that the Chinese expected vast quantities of goods to be allowed into Europe.
This agreement turned out to be a mere scrap of paper. This begs the question of whether it was meant in earnest.
Critics say that it was just a matter of reassuring the European Parliament.
I do not share this view, which is why, on behalf of Czech textile workers and others, I demand that the quotas be enforced for one further year, until the end of 2008.
This would balance out the agreed limits that were exceeded after June.
Above all, however, I would call for this respite to be used to change the EUâs trading strategy.
All economic and political levers should be used to force communist China to open its own markets on a reciprocal basis, to accept the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and thus to comply with minimum standards in the near future.
It should also be forced to stop circumventing the ban on state subsidies to exporting companies, to limit trade piracy and to assume partial responsibility for industrial waste and for repairing environmental damage.
I believe that the EU will ultimately become a strong player on the world stage, and that the Commissioner will become a strategic decision maker, rather than simply an arbitrator of the occasional dispute.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the reality is that the total opening up of the textile trade on 1 January of this year led to an avalanche of Chinese products.
The Commission proposed restricting these imports and, as a result, reached the agreement in June.
Taking advantage of the time period necessary to establish this agreement, however, certain European importers accumulated a large quantity of goods.
The new agreement of 5 September 2005 contributes to resolving this problem, which had reached a point at which it was not benefiting anybody.
But that agreement cannot be described as satisfactory, because it has given the impression that there has been a lack of rigour.
Some people have said, right here today, that the textile industry should have adapted more quickly because it had known what was going to happen for the last 10 years.
But I would predict that, if we do not deal with these challenges in an ordered manner, though we are talking about textiles today, tomorrow we may be talking about cars or communications and information technology products.
This is not an argument between free trade and protectionism, but rather what we want is increasing, but fair and transparent, trade, which respects minimum social and environmental standards.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a situation that is causing alarm in the sector.
In addition to the well-known distribution chains that produce goods in China at stable prices, unfamiliar makes have appeared that declare unusually low prices, which do not even cover the cost of the raw materials for the product.
For example, prices of trousers entering the Union can oscillate between EUR 6 and EUR 0.43; in both cases we are talking about trousers produced in China.
In my country, these practices represent around 40% of imports originating from China.
I suspect, Commissioner, that we are dealing with a case of fraud, in which the value declared in customs is being used to reduce the importerâs tax bill, both in terms of the Community tariff and in terms of VAT.
I would therefore like to know what decisions the Commission is going to take in this regard.
Â Â  MrÂ President, yet another business in the south-west of France has just announced that it intends to cease production.
As a result, 54 textile workers specialised in the production of luxury cloth are at risk of long-term unemployment in an already devastated region.
The situation we are experiencing is catastrophic.
Large numbers of jobs have been lost in this sector since the start of 2005.
The recommendations from the high-level group prepare for the future but what will happen in the short term?
Commissioner, you say that we have a respite period of two and a half years, following the agreements that you have signed.
However, we must act fast, and I would suggest a number of paths worth considering: authorise the Member States to use the Structural Funds reserve to assist businesses suffering cash-flow problems, and to help them to innovate and restructure; assist businesses in creating consortiums so that they can form a true commercial force able to conquer the Chinese market; impose social and environmental criteria; require product labelling that indicates the country of origin; and, finally, as the speakers before me have already said, create true European labels.
Â Â  â Mr President, the problems in the European textile industry were foreseeable several years ago and they would not have been an isolated example, given that similar situations exist in the production of other goods, such as footwear, automobiles, steel etc.
Capitalist restructurings in world trade, especially in the textile industry, result in huge profits for large textile export and distribution groups and big business in general.
At the same time, thousands of workers are being thrown out into the street of unemployment.
According to the official statistics of the European Textile Organisation, 1 million jobs will be lost in the Member States by the end of 2006.
What is all this talk of the invasion of Chinese products into the Member States trying to hide?
Obviously it is trying to hide the responsibilities of the European Union and the governments of the Member States, the anti-grass roots policy whose criteria are competitiveness and the profit of big companies, of big business.
The workers need to draw the necessary political conclusions, given that the statistic quoted in the relevant reports is this: that 60% of Chinese exports to the rest of the world come from foreign investments in China.
That is why radical changes are needed at the level of the economy and government for fair international trade and grass-roots prosperity.
Â Â  Mr President, the textile industry is highly wage- and labour-intensive.
It consists mainly of small and medium-sized firms and has successfully gone through a great deal of structural change in Europe in the last 30 years.
We are not at the beginning.
The crisis that has now been triggered by the dramatic rise in imports from China is not, however, affecting companies in the European Union alone; it is those in some of the worldâs poorest countries, Bangladesh for example, that are primarily affected.
They are the ones that are suffering the most.
So is our customs union partner Turkey.
It would be completely wrong for the European Union now to insist unilaterally on new subsidies.
As the Commissioner rightly said, we need to concentrate on innovation, on efficient methods of production.
On the international stage, of course, the Commission must enforce standards and try to ensure that fair conditions for competition prevail.
Unfortunately, I am unable to join in the eulogies that say the Commission got everything right in 2005.
It waited too long.
The high-level group constantly put us off.
Then it gave only half a response, did not know that imports were piling up in the ports.
The praise for the Commission is therefore very muted.
I would also like to make clear, however, that there are two sides to the question we are debating today.
Consumer prices are also involved.
We cannot ignore the fact that our consumers in the European Union like being able to buy low-price textiles.
Europeâs two largest groups, H[amp]M and Zara, are proving tremendously popular with consumers.
This, too, is connected with the fact that the international division of labour cannot be stopped in such a labour-intensive sector.
The Commission can however, especially this year, provide a better and more sensible environment for it than in the past.
I call on the Commissioner to act sooner and more decisively, not to devise new programmes of subsidies but to ensure that conditions are fair.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, in the course of this debate you have received a few congratulations and many criticisms.
I think that, above and beyond all the polemic, this is due to Parliamentâs grave concern regarding the future of the textile industry and above all, which is the striking aspect of this matter, due to the perceived lack of foresight on the part of the Commission and of the Member States.
True, you have mentioned an unprecedented increase in volume, but this increase in import volumes was anything but unpredictable.
Everyone knew what we were dealing with regarding the end of the multi-fibre agreement and the lifting of quotas on 1Â January this year.
Consequently, I cannot understand why we had to wait for so long for the Commission to react.
We had the option of bringing safeguard clauses into play, which is permitted under the WTOâs rules.
It was not at all necessary to wait for agreement from the Chinese, nor to wait until June.
Furthermore, we also question the conditions under which the protocol signed on 10Â June has been implemented and the way in which we ended up in this imbroglio of 85Â million products piled up in Customs and breaches of the quotas agreed for 2005.
How is it that appropriate measures were not provided for when the agreement was signed and what guarantee do we have that the conditions of this agreement can be kept for the two and a half years to which you referred and which are supposed to give the sector time to organise its restructuring.
The professional textile and clothing association has signalled the loss of 165Â 000 jobs since the beginning of the year and projects that one million jobs will be put at risk by the end of the year.
Can you confirm these figures?
What measures does the European Commission intend to take?
Can the restructuring fund, which was defended by MrÂ Å pidla and the previous Commission, be used to help the employment areas and businesses worst affected?
Finally, several speakers have referred to the structural problems now posed by competition with China, which distorts competition in reality, according to the WTOâs rules: export subsidies and hidden aid, such as the provision of electricity or interest-free loans given to state-owned businesses by state-owned banks.
We could also ask ourselves whether it is time to raise the question, along with the other partners of the European Union within the WTO that are targeted by this increase in Chinese imports â Bangladesh, Turkey, Tunisia and MoroccoÂ âÂ of fundamental social standards.
Does the Commission intend to talk to these partners and to put these subjects on the negotiating table, particularly at the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong?
Â Â  Mr President, the European textile industry is in crisis, and China is being blamed for that.
This Houseâs left-wing Members in particular are calling for the market to be sealed off again.
The Committee on Regional Development is calling for new programmes to support the European textile industry.
Sealing off and subsidies â if that is all we can think of in this age of globalisation, then this sector must be in a really bad way in Europe.
Fortunately, the European textile and clothing industry is a lot further ahead than the politicians, because the companies in question have been facing up to global competition for decades.
For a long time now, they have been strengthening their competitive core areas in the European Union: research, marketing and finishing, and developing supplier structures in the Far East, especially in China.
The European textile industry did not receive any subsidies for this structural change.
That is why more than 100Â 000 jobs were lost in the Dutch-German border region, for example.
Unemployment is nevertheless now far below average in the regions concerned. That is precisely because there were no subsidies to preserve the existing structure.
It is because the European Union supported structural change outside the textile industry, in technology centres and redevelopment, for example; you remember the RETEX programme from the past.
New programmes specifically to support the textile industry are not the way.
Firms in Europe that have regained their health by slimming down would not understand if their ârewardâ was now to have to compete with neighbours that were suddenly subsidised.
Instead of distorting competition with subsidies, we must shape the regulatory environment.
This includes, for example, making patent protection easier, prosecuting product and trademark pirates consistently and expanding research capacities, particularly in nanotechnology, new materials and production processes.
We must help the affected regions, not by using operating subsidies to delay structural change but by pursuing an active structural policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, the textile and clothing industry in Greece is in dire straits.
I should like to quote the Commission certain statistics: in 2004 alone, redundancies exceeded 15Â 000.
Recently, new textile factories have closed in areas of Greece such as Corinth, Thessaloniki and Thrace.
It is a crucial problem and the traditional productive fabric of the country is being damaged and unemployment is increasing.
However, this is a wider problem; it is a European, not a national problem.
That is why active rather than passive intervention is needed. The question is how is the European Union reacting and how is it making use of the mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation.
The question is what integrated European policy does Europe have at its disposal to modernise and strengthen the competition of the European textile industry.
European citizens do not believe today that the Shanghai agreement was the most correct framework; or they probably believe that it was very late coming.
Just as European citizens believe that the September agreement achieved by the Commission will not stand up.
The problem will bounce back even more strongly next year.
It is very difficult, Commissioner, to persuade the European citizens losing their jobs and finding themselves unemployed that the European Union has every interest in full liberalisation because it can export its goods and services to China.
This is simply because not all European countries have heavy industry, they do not all produce cars and airbuses.
The European Commission needs to formulate a new integrated strategy for the textile industry in the run-up to the crucial milestone of 2008.
It needs to be more proactive in defending the rights of the European Union at the World Trade Organisation.
To close, I call on the Commissioner for the European Commission to tell us what it intends to do about the textile companies financed from Community funds which then either relocated outside Europe or closed.
It is a particularly important issue which requires an immediate response from the European Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nothing is so susceptible to structural change as the textile industry.
We went through this painful experience in Austria a few years ago, when the textile industry in the province of Vorarlberg, where it had traditionally been based, collapsed overnight as a result of relocation to other countries â at that time to Hungary, and later to Romania, then Ukraine, now Serbia, and so on.
Today we are faced with a global phenomenon.
The trade conflict with China has made us all very much aware of this.
What did we do?
We adapted, we went in for modern technologies, we went into research, we created an economic environment that has made Vorarlberg one of the most modern high-tech locations in Europe and has made it competitive.
What I am saying is, we must create an environment where the European Union can be competitive, too.
What has happened in the past, wavering between liberalisation on the one hand and applying the brake by reintroducing protectionist measures on the other, cannot be the way.
We must find more sustainable solutions, sustainable solutions that also ensure that we know the conditions under which products are made.
It is clear that China is taking a lot of measures to help state enterprises that are also distorting competition here, such as interest-free loans from state banks, export subsidies, hidden subsidies in the form of free electricity supplies, etc.
I remember attending a short conference held by one of Europeâs textile manufacturers and traders, who pointed out that China is quite naturally pushing its textile products on to the market because half its earnings have to be in foreign currency.
If we are talking to China, we should therefore also be stressing that Chinese firms should be relieved of this pressure.
That would unquestionably help the European textile industry.
Â Â  Mr President, unlike many of the previous speakers I would like to say that the Commission has done well in the case of textiles, in this situation of conflict between industry and trade where everyone in the European Union was trying to go behind the otherâs back.
The Commission has done well with the measures it took in connection with the talks with China.
Before we spend a long time talking about where the textile industry is going and what we can keep here, it would be better â and I am saying this as a member of a textile trade union â to talk about an orderly withdrawal of the textile and clothing industry within the European Union.
That does not mean there will be no textile industry at all â quite the contrary.
There will still be the technical textile sector, high-tech with nanotechnology, the beginnings of which we already have.
That will be what remains of the textile industry in Europe.
There will still be a remnant of in the European Union, but it will be no more than a remnant.
That is why we must talk about an orderly withdrawal.
An orderly withdrawal of course needs alternatives for those employed in these sectors.
Today the Council is again conspicuous by its absence from this debate.
I am saying that specifically for the British Presidency, which has insisted there will be no more money for the European Union.
I am not asking for money for the textile industry.
I am asking for money for the regions where, despite agreements, employment will plummet by more than a million in the next few years.
That is what we need in the European Union.
We should also give some thought to a matter about which I would like to ask the Commissioner a question: should we not be talking about textile labelling?
Labelling must be discussed with the WTO.
I mean labelling that would cover both social and environmental aspects.
The WTO should also require China to implement human rights and ILO standards.
That is the best way for further development.
We must focus on our own workers and also on the workers and on development in China.
Then we will be ready for the development we need in world trade.
Â Â  Mr President, the question at issue here is the political management of globalisation, so that we can encourage the orderly development of trade and avoid market disruption.
A balance must be struck between EU textile protectionism, which costs an extra EURÂ 270 per year for each four-person household, and complete market distortion.
It is a difficult tightrope.
Yes, as politicians we are operating in the sphere of practical politics and not pure economic theory.
We cannot have a situation such as that which arose this summer, when the sale of 80 to 90 million items of clothing and textiles was blocked in the warehouses of Europe, paralysing European businesses and damaging their trade relations with Chinese counterparts.
We need more flexibility to manage unforeseen changes in global trade.
That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules.
It is essential that the Commission does its utmost to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU comply with international norms on workers' rights and environmental standards.
The Chinese have the advantage of cheap labour and sometimes, by our standards, questionable labour standards.
But let us be honest, the textile industry in Europe is one of the lowest paid too and the more educated our workforce becomes, the less inclined they are to take up the sewing machine.
There are a lot of circles to be squared here, less revisionism about what conditions were like in our industries years ago, and we need an honest, open dialogue.
There is tension, even within the EU, as to how it should be handled.
Since the setting-up of import quotas, Chinese textile exports to the EU are allowed to grow by between 8 and 12% for the next couple of years.
The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled, the British, Irish and the Nordic countries another view.
Those speaking on behalf of retailers and consumers take one view, whereas those in relation to producers have another view.
My own government has in recent years changed its policy and now actively encourages and assists Irish companies to source in the People's Republic of China and elsewhere.
We have no choice since we joined the European Union and lost our advantage to the Euro-Mediterranean producers.
We need open and honest dialogue and need to look to ourselves internally first.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the best thing to do concerning our trade relations with China and Asian markets in general is to desist from an unequal contest that will cause irreparable damage to European industry: the textile industry today, manufacturing tomorrow, then the car industry, technology and so on.
Trade relations should properly be based on mutual respect for Community laws and that is not happening at present.
One need only think of the indiscriminate use in those markets of materials, including chemicals, that are now prohibited in Europe and indeed of the abuse of workers who in that economy have no representation, the exploitation of children, prisoners, slaves and in short of those who lack any kind of protection by society.
The agreement that has just been reached and the unblocking of the blocked goods cannot constitute a definitive solution to the problems that have emerged.
We need a fundamental change of course to bring us back to equitable conditions and respect for rules binding on both parties.
Perhaps a first step might be to investigate the idea of bringing back quotas and customs duties, at any rate on a short-term basis, to limit the damage, as well as considering the issues of traceability and trademarks.
Something is now being done to remedy the previous lack of action by the Commission.
Last Julyâs text in defence of intellectual property and against counterfeiting and piracy certainly made a start in defending our textile businesses and our economy in general.
This is the aim, Mr President, of the two amendments tabled by over 40 Members on which voting will take place this morning.
I hope that they will be incorporated in the Lucas report: one of them welcomes the proposal for a directive on penal sanctions and the other concerns respect for environmental measures.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my gratitude for the congratulations and also for the understanding that has been shown for the difficulties of the situation.
I am also grateful for the concerns and critical remarks that have been voiced.
I have already addressed some of these in my introductory remarks.
The Commission is prepared to learn from the situation and to take on board all relevant concerns and criticisms.
When we deal with China, we of course take into consideration the geopolitical aspects and the important role China plays in the world.
However, in this particular case, we are giving preference to the aspects of trade policy, the interests of our textile industry and even to the possible social consequences of the situation.
Our trade policy vis-Ã -vis China â the memorandum of understanding and even the agreed minutes â are aimed at establishing a sustainable future for the European textile and clothing industry, which is basically competitive.
We are very strong in upmarket products, for instance, and we are the second largest exporter of textile and clothing products in the world.
The memorandum of understanding has given our textile and clothing industry additional time to prepare for the challenges it faces.
Measures are also aimed at protecting the interests of the Maghreb states, as well as those poor developing countries which export textile and clothing products.
The work on the reform of the rules of origin and origin-marking, which is being considered by the Commission, is also intended to help the developing countries.
Concerning the problems of implementation of the memorandum of understanding and the question of whether the Commission acted too late and lost time before May 2005, I would remind you that we first had to evaluate the situation and examine the quotas.
Some Member States were late in submitting or providing the necessary information.
It is true that there has been a huge stockpile of textile products and there were many reasons for that.
One of the reasons is that it occurred in a short period between the signing of the memorandum of understanding and its entry into force, and some importers even put in orders in an attempt â ultimately unsuccessful â to block the system.
At the end of the day, we had to apply a flexible solution, which was the advance use of the quotas for 2006, but of course this did not result in any increase in the quantity of the textile products which China will be able to export.
The agreed minutes and the monitoring will prevent similar problems, similar bottlenecks, and the Commission regularly makes the quotas public in order to inform importers.
Many speakers referred to the burning issue of counterfeiting and there is no question that the Commission is firmly committed to combating it.
I want to refer to the customs cooperation agreement we signed with China, which entered into force this spring and for which we have high expectations.
As far as the prospects for the European textile and clothing industry are concerned, several questioners asked whether the industry needs protection.
My answer is 'yes' and the measures concerned appear to be good enough, although we are prepared to review them.
One measure, for instance, is the ongoing anti-dumping investigation on footwear.
In reply to another question raised, Chinese garments are subject to the same provisions as EU products.
Of course, we cannot extend the quotas after 2008, but as far as other solutions like outsourcing are concerned, my answer is 'yes'.
However, the real solution is to further strengthen the competitiveness of the European textile industry through research, innovation and investment, but certainly not at the expense of environmental protection and environmental standards.
But we will urge, encourage and help China to respect these same standards, as well as urging it to respect ILO standards.
So, we understand the situation in its full complexity.
These were the most important points raised during the debate.
In the limited time available, of course, I cannot answer all the questions raised.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrsÂ CarolineÂ Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on prospects for trade relations between the EU and China (2005/2015(INI)) (A6-0262/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, it is very timely that we are having this debate on my China report straight after the debate on textiles.
The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg.
We are talking about textiles today, but tomorrow it will be footwear, the day after that it will be bicycles, and then automobiles, machine components or high-tech goods.
What we are facing here is not just a one-off issue limited to one sector, but a systemic issue, a challenge of much greater scope than I believe the Commission recognises.
What we have heard from Mr KovÃ¡cs echoes what we hear all the time from MrÂ Mandelson too.
To be honest, it is not very reassuring.
What we are hearing from the Commission is an extraordinarily complacent and also rather patronising attitude that somehow, all we need to do in the European Union is to move a little bit further up the higher value-added chain and even perhaps to give up what is left of our old manufacturing base and concentrate instead on the knowledge-based industries.
That kind of idea seems to be in complete denial of the fact that China is developing its own lower-cost but highly-skilled expertise in those areas too.
Almost 20% of China's exports are now classified as high-tech.
With over 2 million graduates every single year, there is every reason to believe that percentage will grow.
The traditional assumption that the EU and US will keep leading in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries will somehow just be left to focus on the lower-skilled areas, is rightly being seriously contested.
This is a patronising and complacent attitude and one that is completely out of date and out of tune with where we are today.
That is why my report calls on the Commission to rethink its strategy, to wake up to the fact that old fashioned concepts of national comparative advantage simply no longer apply in a world where brain power can zip round the globe at the flick of a computer key.
The importance of rethinking that old trade paradigm is crucial, not just for employment in the EU, but also for the survival of many developing countries' industries as well, including some of the poorest in the developing world.
To take the example of textiles again, we have heard already in the debate how countries such as Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal all depend on textile and clothing for the vast majority of their industrial exports.
Many of them face devastation as a result of increasing volumes of cheap Chinese exports.
Not only are they facing the closure of their own factories, but we are seeing Chinese competitive pressures forcing down social standards, This essentially savage free trade dogma means that some of the poorest countries in the world are being thrown into cut-throat competition with one another in a race to the bottom on wages, social standards and, basically, anything that can be made cheaper.
In the Philippines the government has ruled that the minimum wage will no longer apply in the textiles sector.
In Bangladesh restrictions on night work and overtime are being lifted.
We are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive.
As well as demanding a complete reassessment of the trade model, it is clear that we also urgently need to redouble our efforts to ensure that international trade is based on a platform of minimum social and environmental standards.
It is clear, unfortunately, that China's competitiveness is built, at least in part, on its exploitation of its workers and on its externalisation of social and environmental costs.
For example, although in theory at least China has strict laws when it comes to what is in its rule books, in practice those laws are flouted time and again.
It is a shocking fact that over 100Â 000 people per year are estimated to die in work-related accidents in China.
The report calls for minimum social standards, the ILO standards, trade union standards, and cooperation between European trade unions and those groups that are trying to set up similar bodies in China.
It also looks at the environmental impact of the development model which we in the West have also followed.
We need to change it, but what we see in China is the acceleration of that model.
The impact is clearly a massive one on the resources of other nations.
China is already the world's second largest consumer of oil and water and trails only the US in CO2 emissions.
It is only by challenging the key free trade model that we can really make sure that all workers in the world have the chance to earn a decent livelihood.
I urge Members to support this report.
Â Â  .
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament and the Committee on International Trade for putting this very timely and important issue on the agenda and I would also like to express my personal appreciation to the rapporteur, Ms Lucas, for the report.
The Commission highly appreciates this report and sees it as a very valuable contribution to its policy making.
China's rise is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity.
Both aspects are well reflected in this report.
When the report says that Chinese expansion will bring enormous beneficial possibilities but also raises legislative concerns for European industry, I can only agree, and it is in precisely this balance that we have to act.
Let me give you a few facts regarding the latest strengths of our trade relations with China.
It is clear that China is a big economy and will gradually become competitive in more and more industrial sectors.
Just like the EU or the US, China is likely to produce a broad range of industrial products.
The challenge for Europe is not only to trade Airbus planes for tee-shirts, but increasingly to trade similar products within the same sector, so that European firms prosper as a result of their products' distinctiveness and quality.
For example, parts of Europe's textile industry remain very competitive.
At present Europe's overall trading position remains strong due to its ability to sell upmarket products.
The EU is the first exporter of goods and services and the first direct investor abroad.
This is a key point for the linkage between competitiveness and the EU social model.
The EU produces value-added upmarket products and can sell them abroad due to settled non-price factors such as innovative features, quality and reputation, continuity over time or related services.
However, the EU position is under challenge.
The European industry is losing ground in high-technology products.
It is trailing behind in several high-tech products, whereas China is rapidly catching up.
The EU position is also at risk due to the geographical orientation of its exports which are strong in countries where demand is static, but less well-positioned in rapidly growing areas such as Asia.
It is more a race to the top than a race to the bottom.
EU companies cannot afford to miss market opportunities in these dynamic areas which already account for half of world import growth.
Europe's future is to focus on what we do well.
The EU has a strong global export profile in high-quality and high-tech products and services which now account for about half of European exports and a third of world demand.
However, continued innovation and investment in this comparative advantage is crucial.
Better respect and enforcement of intellectual property rights at international level is therefore of the utmost importance.
Addressing barriers to EU exports in third countries also accounts for the bulk of the potential to improve the competitive position of EU industry.
The EU stands to win from the further opening of markets worldwide.
By negotiating the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and promoting regulatory dialogues with our trading partners where appropriate, the EU can open new markets for its exporters.
Therefore the Commission's Lisbon Strategy, the strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness set out last February, rests on three pillars: opening markets to drive productivity and innovation; investing in education and research to enable us to compete; and reforming labour markets and welfare states to get people into jobs, improve employability and skills and extend opportunities to those whom economic developments are leaving behind.
We acknowledge the efforts China has undertaken to implement its WTO commitments as it enters into its fifth and last year of transition after its accession.
We also have to make clear that unsolved issues have to be addressed.
In sectors such as automotives, telecom and banking there is a clear call for action on the Chinese side to get fully in line with its commitments.
On our side we must use the whole range of instruments at hand to push these cases forward both bilaterally and multilaterally.
For good reason, this report gives special attention to lack of intellectual property rights implementation in China.
This report and the public at large are right to say that while we acknowledge China's competitive advantage in particular in labour-intensive production, it is only just that our intellectual property is equally acknowledged and protected.
We are not only speaking about CDs and handbags, but also machinery and hi-tech products.
China has made progress in adopting adequate IPR laws; we now have to focus on issues of implementation.
The conclusion of a customs cooperation and mutual assistance agreement between the European Commission and China, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, is an important concrete development in this field.
The fight against counterfeit and piracy, including the protection of intellectual property rights and security of the international supply chain, are the main EU priorities for closer cooperation in the customs area.
These issues, among others, will be discussed at the first meeting of the joint customs cooperation committee on 14 November 2005.
Joint activities are already ongoing in the area of intellectual property rights where a working visit of a team of EU custom experts is scheduled at the invitation of the Chinese customs.
More generally, the newly established EU-China working group on IPR will concentrate on concrete business issues.
We stand ready to assist China on this way forward.
Because, as the last OECD report has shown, it is very much in China's own interest, I am grateful that Parliament strongly backs our report on this issue.
As an advocate of high social standards the Commission believes it is in the interest of all countries to ratify key ILO conventions and other relevant international agreements.
We believe that high social and environmental standards are fundamental for sustainable development and cooperate with our trading partners to this end in all relevant instances, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The Commission supports China's recent efforts to take greater account of environmental considerations and is actively engaged with China on ways to develop further environmental cooperation including technical assistance in the area of trade and the environment.
We believe the carrot of cooperation to be much more effective than the stick of clauses and conditionality in trade agreements.
On several occasions this report mentions the need for in-depth knowledge of opportunities to do business with China.
The Commission has taken the initiative and launched a tender for a study and a seminar on the future opportunities and challenges of EU-China trade and investment relations, also comprising ten sectoral analyses.
The result will be presented during a conference in 2006 and will be yet another important input for our way ahead.
I also want to mention the prospects of negotiating a new framework agreement with China, reflecting the full breadth and depth of the strategic partnership between China and the European Union.
This framework agreement will of course have an important and forward-looking agenda on the trade and investment side.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was almost unanimously, let us say with one abstention, that this Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, on 13 July, adopted its opinion on the report by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, about the prospects for trade relations between the EU and China.
In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the issue of the arms embargo as well as the enforcement of human rights in the Peopleâs Republic of China.
With regard to some EU Member Statesâ intention to lift the arms embargo with Beijing, the Foreign Affairs Committee noted that such political action would be inappropriate at this time, mainly for three reasons.
First of all, there has not been a significant improvement in the enforcement of human rights in China.
Secondly, the adoption of the anti-secession law in March 2005 by the Chinese Parliament leaves the door open to Chinese military intervention in Taiwan.
Thirdly, the Foreign Affairs Committee would stress that lifting the arms embargo could seriously undermine regional stability in East Asia.
In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee does not mince its words where the protection of human rights in China is concerned.
It is deeply worried about the persistent violations of such basic rights as freedom of opinion, assembly and religion.
Not for nothing does the committee see a direct connection with the continuing Council debate on a possible lifting of the arms embargo.
In the unlikely event of the Council deciding in favour of lifting it, then this would certainly not prompt the Chinese authorities into taking respect for human rights seriously at long last.
What remains is considerable loss of face for the European Union internationally with regard to its own basic values.
I hope, as draftsman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that its position with regard to the Lucas report will strike a sympathetic chord with the European institutions and will be considered worth following.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have considered this matter very seriously and also very amicably in the last few weeks, and so I extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the other Members involved.
China joined the WTO in 2001. That means new rights, but also new obligations.
China is already claiming all those rights, but is failing to fulfil its obligations in many respects.
It is far from allowing foreign firms free access to its markets.
Requiring them to work with Chinese firms is clearly against the spirit of the WTO.
The effects are particularly harmful because intellectual property, patents and copyrights are not protected in China today.
Illegal copying of technical products, counterfeit textiles and utter disregard for intellectual property are intolerable.
The Commission will have to give a much higher priority to this in future. The Commission will have to speak to the Chinese much more plainly about this than it has so far.
Things cannot go on as they are.
Please tell that to Commissioner Mandelson.
There are a lot of other things that need to be put right.
The currency is still not allowed to float, China is not a democratic market economy, its public contracting is totally opaque, and the state looks on approvingly as protective duties are circumvented.
Social issues are still not being addressed, workers have almost no co-determination rights, there is no freedom to form strong trade unions, environmental pollution is unconscionable.
It is in these areas that China must make improvements, and that is what our resolution calls on it to do.
Only if China does that will proper world trade will be possible.
There are things we need to do too, however.
We must work hard to ensure that Europe remains a strong economy in the future.
We need more commercial freedom and more commercial responsibility.
We need more training and research and a greater willingness to face up to challenges.
The fact is that if China is a problem today, it will certainly be a major challenge in the future too.
China also, however, offers a great opportunity for creating new jobs in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate CarolineÂ Lucas on her report.
We have very little disagreement with the contents of the report; we have more problems with the content of her speech, which seemed not entirely to reflect the report as it stands.
I have had the opportunity to visit China recently, at the invitation of the Chinese Government, to look at developments in the country that represents a fifth of the world's population.
While man does not live by bread alone, the year-on-year growth rates of 10%-plus have transformed China from the country I first knew more than 20Â years ago.
Even the so-called depressed north-east of the country has a skyline littered with cranes that shows a level of economic activity that would be impressive anywhere in the world.
Across the country, 300Â million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty, even if more than 100 million remain in the more remote rural areas living on less than EURÂ 1 per day.
China is succeeding in manufacturing, not by a race to the bottom, as the flourishing department stores of Harbin and Chengde prove.
The result of this economic boom has transformed China into the world's fourth-largest exporter and, as we have seen in today's earlier debate, has made it extremely competitive in a number of industrial sectors.
We have to take care when dealing with those issues.
As a Member of this House back in the mid-80s, when Japan played out the role that China is playing today, I saw the wrong steps being taken.
The initial voluntary quotas on exports to the United States bought from the Japanese by President Nixon in exchange for the return of Okinawa to Japanese rule, later extended to Europe, led to a situation where unmet demand allowed Japanese corporations to make super-profits which, reinvested, exacerbated the problems in the long term.
Instead, we need to match China's exports to Europe with our own to China.
We have to recognise that economics is starting to transform Chinese society.
To echo MrÂ Caspary, there are a whole series of human rights and other problems.
We are particularly concerned in relation to this report at the restrictions of the rights of labour activists to organise free trade unions.
We hope the Commission will pressure European business operating in China to set an example by giving their own workers full trade union rights.
There are environmental problems in China, of course, and these should be addressed.
We should avoid the hypocrisy of asking China to refrain from doing what we are not prepared to do ourselves in Europe.
We cannot expect China to voluntarily restrict its use of energy below levels that we see in the European Union.
We have to move away from crisis management of economic and trade issues as we threaten to cascade from textiles, to footwear, to bicycles and an endless sequence of other products.
We need to build a serious partnership with China on economic and trade matters.
If we do not, others will.
We also need a serious political dialogue with China.
We have much to say to each other.
This report is not the place to raise these issues, but the decision by the Foreign Affairs Committee to draft a report on EU-China political relations is to be welcomed.
Â Â  . This is not the first time we have talked about China in Parliament.
When discussing the condition of textiles post 2005, Commission member Louis Michel expressed his view that the cause of the decline and potential collapse of the textile sector, and, evidently, other European industrial sectors, is the inability of countries to run their economies.
They were unable to transfer their manufacturing to countries with cheap labour.
No one, however, has discussed what we can offer the citizens of our own countries where we were elected.
Where will they work when we transfer all industry out of Europe?
In the Lucas report the consequences trade with China has on the economies of EU Member States are hardly even considered.
The report gives great attention to developing countries, which suffer from China's expansion into the world's textile markets.
A whole chapter of the report is even devoted to China's social problems, wage increases, welfare, while this is essentially a domestic affair.
Bear in mind that not even the EU itself has a common social policy, every State takes care of its employees' salaries, which in the EU vary from State to State, and are very low in some there are citizens living below the poverty level.
What should we do in the European Union to find an adequate response to the challenges posed by the global economy?
I call on the Commission to assess the impact of the application of the WTO rules on EU Member States, particularly the new ones, to review foreign trade policy, and to take steps and preventative action to eliminate negative consequences on EU textile, footwear, furniture, electronics, automobile and other industries.
However, once the condition of EU industry has been analysed, the most important thing is to prepare a long-term forecast for 2030-2050, establishing areas where EU manufacturers could be competitive and giving industry recommendations about sectors of the future, which ought to be invested in now.
I also call on you to take care of our own people, because, it seems, we cannot expect someone else to create jobs for us, to boost economic competitiveness, and maintain social welfare.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is no question that this is a fundamental problem.
On the one hand, it is because of the different production conditions, and hence prices, that international trade exists, but, on the other hand, completely free trade between economies operating with very different labour costs, as in the case of China and the European Union, involves several elements that distort the rules regulating competition.
What must we say in these circumstances?
Firstly, as consumers of Chinese products, we in the European Union have a greater responsibility, since we are Chinaâs main trading partner, above even the United States.
Secondly, Chinaâs development and its opening up to the world is good news that we must celebrate.
Thirdly, however, that that opening up must be conducted within a framework of respect for certain minimum and common rules, which guarantee clean and fair commercial relations, and also that the benefits of that opening up and trade should be enjoyed by the weakest parts of the production system, that is to say, the workers, while at the same time guaranteeing respect for international environmental rules.
The key is therefore not to promote free trade, but rather to promote fair trade.
This means establishing new rules in the trade between countries, which includes quotas based not on price but on production conditions, the establishment of traceability rules in order to guarantee respect for those conditions and, above all, regulation of the practices of large multinational companies, which are increasingly mobile and often indulge in a ârace to the bottomâ, seeking to produce in places with the fewest social, employment and environmental requirements.
Â Â  Mr President, the subject is âProspects for Trade Relationsâ and Mrs Lucas began by asking for support for her report.
She will have mine.
If we look at how things have developed, we find that both the European Union and China have become each otherâs second biggest trading partner.
What has changed?
A few years ago, the trade surplus was still on the European Unionâs side and now it is on the Chinese side.
I am convinced it will remain that way for the next few decades.
There are a number of unusual things about China.
It has an enormous internal market; at the same time, it has a great capacity for labour-intensive production and it is able to take full advantage of that because it has very low wage levels.
It also has high-tech production.
Labour-intensive production is increasingly moving away from many Member States of the European Union even though we have a very high level of productivity, which is a reason why we actually could keep it.
At the same time, if we look at the volume of trade we can see that European industry has benefited tremendously from exporting to China.
Today, we have been discussing the situation as regards textiles.
The European Union used to earn billions from the export of textile machinery.
If you look at todayâs export statistics, you can see how many steel works are exported, how many pressing tools for the motor industry, how many aluminium smelters for making bicycles.
It is perfectly clear that we will have the same problem in these industries in two or three yearsâ time.
The draft Constitutional Treaty spoke of an open market economy with free competition.
What we now have in the European Union in textiles is a result of that.
It is the result of an open, unprotected market economy with free competition.
That is why a majority of the French rejected it.
I believe we need a social market economy with fair competition.
That is something different.
If we are constantly saying that production in China is not up to European standards, that is correct.
It would be extremely easy, however, to get a rule laid down in the WTO to the effect that countries that fail to comply with ILO standards cannot export or that their goods will not be imported.
If anyone fails to comply properly with ILO occupational safety standards, his goods cannot be exported.
Anyone who uses chemicals that are banned worldwide or in most countries is not allowed to export.
Then we would immediately have a competition that was driving things upwards because producers would be forced to bring in better social, environmental and industrial standards.
I believe that is the right way forward.
Anyone who believes the European Union can survive in the long term simply by always making the sweeping statement that we must make more high-tech products is failing to recognise that China produces far more highly qualified college and university graduates every year than the entire European Union.
That cannot be the way either.
We must not delay in doing what we are always talking about.
We must invest much more in education.
If you look at the Member Statesâ budgets, however, you will see that they are not doing that either.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, it is wise to bear the facts in mind when discussing the Unionâs trade relations with China.
The Chinese economy has been growing by 9% a year for the last 25Â years.
Beijingâs currency reserves currently stand at USDÂ 700Â billion, whereas the Unionâs are a mere USDÂ 179Â billion.
The second greatest power in the world is not a democracy, nor does it have a market economy.
Together with the ASEAN countries, China is hoping to create a free trade area by 2010, and this would be the largest economic block in the world.
China is moving to expand its trade at global level.
The Chinese take-over of the US giant IBM is an example of this movement, as is the current Chinese attempt to take over Rover in the UK.
As we try to establish what all this means for us, we should consider the situation in the USA, where many jobs have been lost due to the disadvantageous balance of trade with China.
Whole branches of US industry have relocated in China, which has become the largest factory in the world.
Textiles aside, China is already producing two-thirds of all electronic goods.
At present, China is the Unionâs second largest trading partner.
In 2004 the Union had a trade deficit with China in excess of EURÂ 78Â billion.
Unfair competition is possible because China has a Socialist market economy, a type of primitive capitalism that disregards human rights.
In the interests of the future of our economy, we should adjust our relations with China. The latter should be deemed a strategic competitor rather than a strategic partner.
Strict import quotas on Chinese goods should also be introduced, so as to protect jobs in our countries.
Whenever we deal with China we should keep the following question in the forefront of our minds: will there be any jobs left for our children?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution to the report by Mrs Lucas â whom I should like to thank for the excellent work that she has carried out â I wanted to emphasise a fundamental aspect of the relationship between these two large trade areas: the need to obey the rules which in the field of trade are indeed the principles of the World Trade Organisation and the agreements that derive from it, but which in the political and social context relate to respect for basic human rights.
Hence the need for monitoring through ongoing negotiations between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, in order to guarantee the principles of freedom and democracy: respect for these must be a prerequisite in the development of Chinaâs trade relations with other economic areas.
In addition the latest news from China concerning the oppressive controls imposed on use of the Internet must be studied carefully.
The decision by the government in Beijing, which has announced new laws for controlling information on the Internet so as to prohibit any conceivable criticism of its policies towards religion and in general of its widespread intolerance towards religious preaching, must inevitably increase our concern.
In China the degree of freedom and democracy is in inverse proportion to the economic and commercial power that it imposes upon world markets.
We therefore call on the Commission, in the framework of the ongoing negotiations with the Chinese authorities that it proposes to institute to ensure equitable, shared management of trade relations with the Chinese continent, to think over and take due account of all the aspects that are linked to respect for the rights and freedoms of individuals and, by extension, the workforce.
We call for standards to ensure that goods originating in China conform to the security guarantees applied in Europe and that there are sanctions to prevent any trade with or within the Union for several years by those who illegally import goods or import illegal goods into Europe.
