on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Commissioner Frattini for his detailed report this afternoon.
In my opinion, Directive 2004/38/EC is a valid point of reference, guaranteeing full affirmation of the right of movement of EU citizens, avoiding any form of discrimination and establishing the principle of full integration.
This directive is essentially concerned with protecting the rights of someone residing in a Member State, as well as the rights of citizens of that Member State, in keeping with the principle of reciprocity.
It offers maximum protection for people working, studying and wanting to become integrated, but comes down hard on those people who break the rules.
It is on this latter point that Parliament must have a real discussion.
Not only are there rights, there are also duties and rules which must be respected.
We cannot continue to ignore the fact that there is a percentage - no doubt an absolute minority, but this percentage does exist - of people who travel to other Member States and who have no intention of reporting their presence to the host Member States, simply because they do not want to be officially recognised, because they have no intention of abiding by the laws and working legally.
We need to address properly the problem of who moves to and who enters a Member State, intent on remaining on the fringes of society.
No doubt the tools can be improved, but some of them are already available to the Member States under Directive 2004/38/EC.
This is why first we must call for the prompt, full, thorough and concrete application of the Directive in each Member State.
Perhaps it might also be worth refining the Directive, not only imposing an obligation on visitors to declare their presence in the territory of the host Member State on certain terms, but an obligation on the Member State to impose sanctions on anyone who does not abide by the rules.
In Italy for example, the decree implementing the directive sets forth certain terms and conditions, but it does not provide any sanctions, so the law is in fact completely ineffectual.
Above all, we need to make sure that immigrants are escorted back to their own country, obviously in cases where there are genuine reasons for doing so.
However, I should point out that anyone who commits a crime, anyone who violates human rights, because this is also important, who exploits children, who exploits women or who represents a threat to public safety, must be removed and returned in no uncertain terms to the authorities in his or her country of origin.
We also need laws for people who do not work, for people who have a hand-to-mouth existence and who can thus represent an excessive burden for the community of the host Member State.
I would like to finish by mentioning the Roma children and making the case for Italy.
There are around 50,000 children, or rather at least 50,000 exploited children in Italy.
They are of Roma origin, they are forced to beg, they are not vaccinated, they do not go to school and they live in absolutely deplorable sanitary conditions.
I would like to remind everyone that around a week before Mrs Reggiani was killed in Rome, in the same shanty town as the one in which Mrs Reggiani's killer lived, a two-month-old Roma child died of cold.
This was in Rome, one of Europe's foremost capital cities.
Therefore, I will finish by asking, is this truly integration?
Is this respect for human rights?
We have a duty to ask serious questions without hypocrisy and we have a duty to say that everyone is equal before the law.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 2 November Mr Frattini said that 'What has to be done is simple: go into a travellers' camp in Rome for example, and ask them: 'Can you tell me where you live?' If they say they do not know, take them and send them home to Romania'.
That is how the European directive works, plain and simple, and we need to pull down the travellers' camps immediately.
You also said that the UK, France and Germany habitually expel citizens who are out of work, that Italy does not do this and that therefore it has failed to implement Directive 2004/38/EC properly.
I am speaking to you as Co-president of a European political group and I am addressing you as a European Commissioner, therefore we must absolutely leave aside the fact that in Italy, we probably campaign in different coalitions, but here we are acting and should act as Europeans.
I think that the statements you made to Il Messaggero are unacceptable and furthermore are in complete contradiction with what you said here to us last night.
Which of the two Frattinis is the real one?
The one who said that we needed to pull down Roma camps or the one who said, as the directive quite rightly says, that citizens can be expelled based on precise rules and even more precise guarantees?
I would really appreciate an answer to this question.
With regard to the question of other European Member States, I would be grateful if you could explain the situation to me.
We have made a few inquiries and have discovered that none of the countries mentioned - the UK, France or Germany - has ever deported European citizens for economic reasons, which in any case is prohibited by the directive, and that no citizen has ever been found to be an excessive burden for the economy of the countries of residence.
Therefore, I would like to know whether you knew about this, because it seems to be crucial information.
I fully support the fact that this directive provides a precise framework.
However, I think that it could have been even more precise and better done, and I am even of the opinion that the case or cases that we are discussing today are symbolic of the way in which the directive must be applied and how the Member States perceive and see enlargement and freedom of movement, which is an absolute priority for us.
May I just say, Mr President, Mr Tajani and Mrs Angelilli, that a country where the mafia has a business of around EUR 90 billion and where events take place such as those of recent days can teach us very little on the subject of immigration.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our discussion here is not about Italy or Romania, it is about Europe and the life of its citizens: a woman was killed, and our thoughts and sympathies must go to her family; Roma and Romanian citizens are disgracefully attacked; our identity, our values, our laws and our history, including tragedies such as the persecution of the Roma people, let this all be called into question today and let us not forget and make sure that there is no room for racism of any sort.
These tragedies have taught us the importance of laws that sanction rights: there is no safety without the law.
This is how important our laws are, our treaties are, even our economic regulations, which sanction the value and right of mobility and residence, which are the legitimate rights of European citizens, and not concessions, which can be regulated but not denied.
European laws are clear: everyone has the right to mobility and residence, with removal only in extreme cases where national security is at stake.
Expulsion is strictly individual and never collective, and is accompanied by the guaranteed right to a defence.
These are proportional measures that always allow for the continued right of mobility, a right that will never be denied for economic reasons, because poverty cannot be a stigma or a reason to discriminate against citizens.
This is what Article 27 of the directive says, it is the law.
It is all the more sacred because it concerns rights.
The law applies to everyone, not least of all to Commissioners - and I must say Mr Frattini that in your numerous statements here in Parliament, I have had great trouble in finding the spirit and the letter of the law, in fact I cannot seem to find either of these - and to the Member States, who must transpose their membership of Europe and its directives for all of us.
There are still too many people dying in Europe today.
In Italy, a woman died from a violent attack by a Romanian man.
This is extremely distressing to me.
Anyone guilty of murder has to pay the price, but that has nothing to do with Roma or Romanian citizens, who have seen some of their own people unfairly attacked.
Blame is individual, never collective.
So many migrants die trying to get to Europe.
These people are overwhelmed and are calling on us to act.
This suffering is why we must make Europe a land of the law and of rights, of sacred laws, particularly when we talk about reception.
These laws form the basis of security.
We want this to be solemnly reaffirmed in Parliament with a vote so that there can be no more misinterpretation of our European laws.
In accordance with our rules of procedure, I would like to ask Members who are speaking not to quote other Members, for the simple reason that under the rules they could ask to speak later.
Therefore, to allow the debate to run smoothly, I would ask everyone to address Parliament in general, citing the facts; clearly this does not apply to the Commissioner, who will be fully entitled to explain his reasons at the end of the debate.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, my friends in the new NIP Party in Romania were furious when they learned about the expulsion of thousands of Romanians from Italy.
I understand them fully.
I phoned Commissioner Frattini, who assured me that no Romanian would be expelled without having met a judge.
There was a derogation, however: when people, after staying for three months, have no money to live on, they can be expelled without a decision from a judge.
I agree with this procedure if it is administered in good faith.
Free movement does not include a right to receive financial support from the state you visit.
You should be able to live on your own budget or have a job.
Criminals may also be expelled if it is decided by a judge, but it is not up to the police to decide who are criminals.
For such decisions, we must have independent judges.
I hope my friends in the Italian Government agree with this fundamental principle of the European Union.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Frattini for being here again, for his commitment and for making himself available to us.
You are an asset to your country.
It is a shame that I cannot say the same of other Italian representatives and I do not like this.
We have discussed - and are still discussing - the Schengen Agreement.
Despite all the social unrest that the free movement of citizens within the EU is undoubtedly causing in Italy, Mr Amato has decided that it would be a good idea to focus on other issues.
Something needs to be done to prevent this social unrest from reaching the levels witnessed in our country.
However, it does not appear that anything is being done, given the rising crime rate at all levels in Italy, ranging from anti-social behaviour to organised crime, not to mention the steady inflow of illegal immigrants into our country, and above all the fact that some people who come to Italy with study, work or tourist visas are not returning to their own countries when these expire.
This last point has not been widely covered by the media.
Furthermore, the current Italian administration and the Minister of the Interior seem to be unaware of the crime committed in Italy largely by foreigners, some of whom are European citizens, travellers or people who call themselves this.
This was highlighted a few months ago in the report by the Italian Prefect Mr Serra to the Italian Parliament.
The Italian government is becoming an embarrassment to an increasingly tired nation, and they are not alone.
This government, which is as incapable of understanding social unrest as it is of preventing it, cannot conceive of addressing the problem.
It does not occur to it - and one wonders how it could - to admit the failings of current migration policies or the lack of application of European directives, in this case Directive 2004/38/EC.
On this subject, the Italian government complains of having difficulty in identifying the exact date of entry.
It is clear that under the Schengen Agreement, these difficulties are growing out of all proportion.
It is also obvious that my party and I would like to revoke the Schengen Agreement.
Even the repeated acts of political hooliganism in Italy in recent months, suffered in many cases by my party, perpetrated by the followers of anarchic and boorish communism protected by representatives of the institutional left, are still being ignored by Mr Amato.
Unfortunately, Mr Amato and President Prodi, like so many mayors, not least of all Rome's, do not live in working-class areas, they have no contact with travellers' camps - legal or otherwise - and they do not use public transport or experience the bullying, violence and prevarication that even EU visitors face in Italy on a regular basis.
These irresponsible politicians talk about solidarity, in whose name an entire population is made to suffer their foolish decisions.
The European Union, rather than lament the fact that Italy has not asked for funding, should take note of what President Barroso said, in other words that if a Member State allows slums to develop on its territory, what can it expect the Commission to do?
Mr Amato chooses to be absent from meetings on the subject.
Meanwhile, Italians would like to do the only right thing: start voting and tell the government to go to hell.
(RO) The European Union is a community of values in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms prevails and its policies include the security of citizens and the fight against criminality, as well as the protection of children and the fight against instigation to violence.
I firmly condemn violence and offences and I deeply regret what happened in Italy!
But I believe that the abuses and injustice committed in the name of the law are unacceptable, induce fear and humiliation and may instigate hatred within human communities.
I have discovered a tendency to escalate this situation unjustifiably, also fueled by political and xenophobic statements uttered by certain politicians.
I am worried by the fact that, according to the information published so far, only Romanian citizens have been expelled from Italy.
All the Member States have the right and obligation to draw up legislative acts that would ensure and consolidate public order and safety.
All the European citizens, whatever their nationality, have the obligation to comply with the law and its provisions, wherever they are on the territory of the European Union.
Yet, at the same time, we have to condemn intolerance and xenophobia and, especially, the unjustified expansion of hard feelings and stigmatization from a few individuals, who are on bad terms with the law, to an entire ethnic group or, more seriously, to an entire nation.
I believe the Italian State, just like all the other Member States of the European Union, has the duty to protect the rights and liberties of the European citizens residing on its territory, who integrate into the community and obey the laws.
A common European approach of the policies of immigration and integration of minorities is required.
The issue of minorities and, especially, of the Roma minority, is a European issue and it should be approached in a coherent and unitary manner, not only in moments of crisis.
All the relevant bodies should cooperate, first of all the European Commission and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, as well as the relevant institutions in the Member States.
I call upon the European Commission to review the priorities and mechanisms of the European Social Fund in order to extend the financing of common actions, which would contribute to the social inclusion of the Roma minority.
At the same time, I ask the European Commission to urgently examine compliance of the decree law, issued by the Italian authorities, with the European legislation and to give assurance that the implementation of any provisions of this type shall not lead to abuses against honest people, irrespective of their nationality.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is right that our Parliament should send the family of Mrs Reggiani a message of condolence.
I would also like to censure the recent statements by Mr Frattini, who in interviews referred to earlier confused his role as representative of the Commission with that of a member of the opposition, denying Mr Tajani this pleasure, when he would have been better to use his prestigious role to brighten the national political climate.
It pains me to say it, because we have often supported Mr Frattini's proposals and initiatives.
Mr Frattini knows only too well that, as pointed out by some of my fellow Members, there is no European text that makes provision for the automatic expulsion of citizens from other Member States on economic grounds.
The recent provisions of the Italian government are in line with the European directive, respecting its spirit and strengthening certain aspects considered important in light of the situation in Italy.
All Italian institutions - and I say this to Mr Tajani, to Mrs Angelilli and to other members of the opposition - from the City of Rome to regional authorities, right down to the smallest local council, are committed to this.
It is undignified to sling mud at the degree of civilisation and integration that our country has achieved over the years.
I hope that the European Parliament will reaffirm its refusal of the principle of collective responsibility, which is used to incite hatred and violence in the heart of Europe.
What we need to affirm instead is the need to combat any form of racism and xenophobia, and any discrimination based on nationality and ethnic background.
We have a road map for this: the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is important that we do our best, as the Italian and Romanian Prime Ministers have asked, to ensure better social integration of disadvantaged peoples and cooperation between Member States, both in terms of managing the movements of our own migratory flows and through social development and welfare programmes financed by the Structural Funds.
What we need to do in future is simple: none of us must forget that immigration is a resource, it is part of our future, but it must be governed.
I therefore propose that the Member States act now to establish closer European coordination to regulate migratory movements in the European Union.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for addressing Parliament on this very important issue.
There has been a lot of emotion in Italy following the murder of an Italian woman by a Romanian citizen.
There has equally been a lot of emotion in Romania following reprisals against Romanian citizens by Italian gangs.
However, when we put away emotions, we get back to our basic values and principles: freedom of movement for all citizens, the rule of law and its conformity with European law.
Let me remind you, should it be necessary, that freedom of movement for European citizens is a fundamental right enshrined in the founding Treaties.
Unfortunately, these recent events have shown us that we need to make more effort to consolidate these rights and ensure they are enforced adequately throughout Europe.
In today's Europe we cannot accept irresponsible authorities pointing fingers at specific nationalities or ethnic groups.
Neither can we accept the claim that the free movement of workers might be a route to increasing criminality, because crime has neither nationality nor ethnicity.
This attitude can only lead to dangerous developments and more xenophobia.
On the contrary, I believe we must continue to encourage mobility of people and give workers the same opportunities all over Europe, to reinforce a strong European identity.
This was the founding fathers' genuine wish for the creation of the European Union.
While I reiterate that the European Union must ensure all its citizens live in an area of freedom, security and justice, I believe we should also pay more attention to integration and freedom of movement.
The answer to crime is not closing borders.
The answer to crime is not encouraging xenophobia, discrimination and stigmatisation of nationalities or ethnic origins.
The answer, in a modern Europe, is more police and judicial cooperation, more integration policies, more resources for those called to serve and protect all our citizens, whatever their nationality.
I would like to see a Europe where all citizens can live, work and circulate freely.
The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, must now ensure that these basic rights are correctly implemented and enforced.
I call on the Commission to stand firm on these principles.
Mr President, the situation of the Roma in Europe is getting worse.
The developments in Italy prove that to us.
We have all seen that unchallenged xenophobic and racist hysteria can overcome common sense.
The crime of one single person has fuelled an unprecedented media lynching.
This moved us towards restrictions on the fundamental rights of European citizens based on popular racist and xenophobic hysteria.
We must not let that happen.
Criminal issues are for the judges to deal with, not for politicians or civilians.
However horrible and condemnable the crime that took place in Rome is, it should not lead us to collective responsibility of a whole nation.
The events in Italy did uncover the reality of the campo nomadi, in which so many Roma live.
The fact that tensions and instability arise from such situations is not questionable.
That is why we must act.
My first assistant is a Roma.
Integration can proceed quickly.
In 2005 we adopted a resolution that asked for concerted EU and national action for speeding up the inclusion of Roma.
Therefore, I propose that we, as MEPs, show that we care, and urge decision-makers to join us.
I propose that the EP establish a permanent European Parliament rapporteur on Roma issues, who would monitor the situation of the Roma in Europe and come annually with recommendations to the Commission and governments.
In addition, we should call upon the Commission to establish an EU Roma inclusion fund, together with an EU strategy for Roma inclusion and a Roma unit within the European Commission.
This will ensure proper management of the EU Roma inclusion policies.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the brutal murder by a Romanian citizen of Giovanna Reggiani, whose family is offered our heartfelt condolences, many political groups in Italy have pointed the finger at Europe.
However, what happened is not due to enlargement, Schengen or other European directives on free movement within the European Union.
These are age-old problems that deserve a less superficial approach and which cannot be addressed with a decree rushed through Parliament to satisfy public opinion.
For this very reason, we need to be more attentive and re-examine the entire matter within a framework of legality, unfettered by emotions or urgent demands.
The rule of law requires that criminal responsibility should be individual and not collective.
To deviate from this principle would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to the criminalisation of certain migrant nationalities.
The potential effects that this might have are worrying.
In Italy, we have seen a witch-hunt culture emerge towards Romanian and Roma citizens, with many punitive expeditions: even children in schools have been the subject of scorn and mistreatment.
The issue of security is clearly legitimate, but we cannot fall into the trap of polemics and exploitation deliberately designed to fuel hatred and xenophobia merely for partisan reasons.
If objectivity could be restored to Italian politics, the public would learn that Italy was not overcrowded with delinquent migrants.
Immigration is certainly a subject that requires European coordination, but we cannot use Europe simply to limit the freedom of movement of migrants.
Mr Frattini's actions should be condemned.
He has used this opportunity to join the national polemic expressing opinions contrary to European directives.
It would have been better if the Commissioner had proposed a series of integration policies, for example based on the increased resources from the Integration Funds and the need to free national reception policies from the constraints of the Stability Pact, as has already been done for security policy.
It is also important that we insist on coordination and reinforcement of judicial instruments and police powers to tackle organised crime and trafficking, an odious crime which has now reached the transnational level.
The discussion of the application of Directive 2004/38/EC is the right sphere in which to have a debate on the expulsion of Romanian citizens in its proper legislative setting; it is an opportunity to confirm how the free movement of Romanian citizens is an inalienable right of European citizenship.
The directive is clear: people cannot be removed as a preventive measure, but personal accountability must be assessed, and this information should be used as a starting point so that government decrees can remain in line with the pro-European tradition of our country.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the courage and consistency that brooks no hypocrisy, which unfortunately often prevails in our institutions and which to a certain extent we have also heard here today.
Mr Guidoni, the decree you are attacking is a decree of your own government, so we need some clarification here.
The distressing events in Italy, and in Rome in particular, are only the latest in a series of incidents that have often gone unheeded or have been ignored.
Europe is founded on the principles of freedom and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Italian people have always shown that they support inalienable values such as non-discrimination, equality between peoples and democracy.
However, I believe it is only right to add, using the information from the official Caritas report produced in cooperation with the Italian Ministry of the Interior and which paints a fairly serious picture, that this has been happening since 1 January 2007, following the migration of Romanian citizens to Italy on an unprecedented scale in the EU.
I hate to say it, but we only need to run through a few of the figures to see the absurdity of the situation.
In 2006 alone, 17,900 Romanians were arrested in Italy.
This is not the fault of an entire people, it is the fault of individuals.
However, we need to reflect and the question automatically arises: why did the Italian government not ratify the decree transposing Directive 2004/38/EC sooner?
Furthermore, why does the decree not implement the provisions of the directive relating to residence after a period of three months?
Why did the Ministry of the Interior fail to provide adequate measures for application in relation to the conditions and requirements to be satisfied and the checks and controls and possible repatriation of EU citizens guilty of not respecting the imperative conditions provided by the directive?
This laxity has caused a culture of permissiveness which is beyond understanding.
It has resulted in the indiscriminate arrival of indigent people, fuelling each day the sense of despair that exists and leading people to the inevitable short cut of breaking the law.
For example, the Mayor of Rome tolerated the establishment of around a hundred Roma camps and shanty towns, where the most elementary human rights were compromised and where hygiene and personal dignity were completely ignored, before then deciding to dismantle them.
It was an act of thoughtlessness for which we are still paying today.
We are in favour of solidarity and reception, but this has to be in accordance with the law, guided by the certainty of the law and public policy.
Mr President, today I will try to forget that I am a Romanian.
I will try to forget, even if people are deported, attacked and killed within the borders of the European Union, simply because they are guilty of being Romanian either ethnically or by citizenship.
Today, I shall try to think as an Italian and as a European.
If I were Italian, I would think that I should have the right to feel secure in the country of my ancestors.
I would have been outraged by the miserable camps of miserable people around my country's wonderful towns.
I would have been disgusted to see an increasing number of criminals threatening the peaceful life of my compatriots.
But, while looking for my security, I would realise that this is consolidated daily by the creative work of more than one million immigrants who are producing Italian goods, offering services in areas left by Italian labour, buying Italian merchandise and paying taxes to the Italian authorities.
On the contrary, I would feel that my security would be weakened if those non-Italian residents left my country, if their human rights were violated and if they became the subject of xenophobic practices.
If the basic rights of a single human being are violated by my country's authorities, who try to hide their weaknesses by intensifying the law behind racist concepts, xenophobic excuses and discriminatory measures, my own rights - and, moreover, everybody's rights - are in jeopardy.
It is not the first time that security has been set against democratic and humanitarian values, when some believe that fewer human and civil rights mean more security, when insecure people look for refuge within their national community, wrongly thinking that ethnic similarity brings better protection.
This is false.
An ordinary crime has one or several victims.
Racism is also a crime, but it is an extraordinary crime and everybody, including the criminal, is a victim of racism and xenophobia.
Racism and racial rule are therefore sources of insecurity.
As a European democrat, I cannot possibly accept that diversity means more insecurity or that some criminals should be socially integrated while others should be excluded.
Some have the right to defence and others do not.
Some are given the benefit of the doubt and others are not, depending on their national or ethnic origin.
As a European, I would not allow one of the Member States - say, Romania - to become a ghetto for the Roma or a European Union Siberia where undesirable European citizens are deported.
I can understand that the extreme right is xenophobic, but I cannot understand when the democrats resort to xenophobic and racist speech.
I cannot understand the weaknesses and demagogical racist speech of the democrats, and I condemn them more than the extreme right for xenophobia.
For all those reasons, we should now take alarm and mobilise.
I hope that the European Parliament motion for a resolution to be adopted on this issue will bring us together in defending European values and the future of Europe.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the government of each Member State has the right and duty to clamp down on crime to ensure the safety of its citizens and of anyone living and working in the country.
The debate that we are engaged in today must avoid the twofold temptation of emotiveness and instrumental political reaction.
The preparation of a bill under the name of a 'security package' had been in the pipeline for some time in Italy.
The dramatic events of last October persuaded the government to convert it into a decree-law, which immediately began to have an effect.
There was nothing hasty or improvised about it, and in any case amendments will be tabled before Parliament, as we know.
Let us look at the substance of the question and we will understand that the content of the decree is absolutely fair: it is a case of targeting those who threaten law and order with their conduct, comprising public safety and harming all those who come to Italy to improve their lives by working.
This decree does not target everybody, but is in favour of people who come to Italy to be integrated in complete accordance with our laws and who in any case represent the vast majority.
The presence in Italy, as in any other country, of people who do not abide by the rules, makes integration more difficult for others.
What I mean is that a rejection mentality emerges which makes the integration process harder. Hence the prompt response of the Italian government, which has also been quick to avoid any instrumental political positions and dangerous signals, such as punitive expeditions or patrols that would send out a misleading or even perverse message to the public.
Mr President, according to the Directive, and in compliance with the principle of non-discrimination, all Union citizens and their family members residing in a Member State should enjoy equal treatment.
Alongside the right of freedom of movement, they are entitled to take up employment in the country of residence - regarded as related rights in Article 23 of the Directive.
In this sense, the freedom of movement of workers is a fundamental right, complying with the idea of a united Europe, whose citizens can be freely employed everywhere.
Unfortunately, this is not the case with the citizens of most of the new Member States, including Bulgaria and Romania, who are facing restrictions.
After a public debate on whether Bulgaria will or will not apply the Community law in this field, and whether to undertake a reciprocal approach, it was decided not to do so and to abide by the common Community goals, so that the European Union could respond adequately to the contemporary global challenges.
While saluting those Member States that have taken the same position so far, I call upon the other Member States to join in and take into consideration the fact that the transitional periods are obstacles to the development of a single European labour market and hamper its competitiveness.
The analyses point out that the old Member States that have opened up their markets have received much more benefits than problems with the workers received.
On the other hand, the new Member States already face serious shortages of qualified workers.
The recent Eurostat survey published today indicates that there has not been large-scale migration of Bulgarians and Romanians after accession.
The survey also shows that 80% of Bulgarians abroad are working, which is undoubtedly an employment quota a number of EU countries can only dream about.
Despite the progress achieved so far, the freedom to move still lags far behind other European freedoms.
The idea of EU citizenship is also distorted by creating first-, second- or third-class citizens, as we are witnessing in our debate today.
A real transition from EU common market citizens to EU citizens with full rights and responsibilities should effectively take place as soon as possible, for the benefit of all of us.
(HU) Thank you very much. Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, there are officially 560 thousand Romanian citizens living on the territory of Italy, but according to some estimates the number exceeds 1 million.
A large part of them live in settlements on the outskirts of Rome, Turin, Milan and Naples.
There are no excuses for the murder in Rome: if someone has committed a crime, he should answer to the court for his actions.
However, as a liberal, I do not and cannot accept that a criminal of any nationality, belonging to any ethnic group, should serve as the basis for passing judgment on the whole of the given group, making room for violent acts of extreme force, the targets and victims of which are innocent people, as is demonstrated by the regrettable events that followed the murder.
I would like to remind you that I spoke to Mr Rehn, the Commissioner for Enlargement, many times about the fact that the post-accession migration of people living in poor social conditions and in abject poverty in settlements in the two countries that acceded on 1 January 2007 might emerge as a serious problem in the Member States of the EU, precisely because of the lack of integration.
The warning was not followed by serious measures during the accession negotiations.
I would not even dare to estimate the number of Roma in Europe who are escaping from the new Member States to the Member States of Western and Northern Europe in the hope of a better life, expressing their dissatisfaction with the integration policy of the country they left.
Similarly, in the period before the accession of these two countries, I raised the importance of preparing for migration problems related to this, and many of my fellow members rejected it, viewing it as a restriction of the freedom of movement.
Our response to this might be: are we creating a government decree at an extraordinary session that forms a legal basis for expulsion?
Some serious concerns have emerged in connection with the constitutionality of the government decree and its relationship with international and EU law.
I am also thinking of infringements of the Free Movement Directive and the Racial Equality Directive.
Is this really how to face up to real problems?
The 27 countries of the EU cannot fall into a situation where we transfer the problems from one country to another within its borders.
Allow me to read out just a few pieces of data that I read in a report by the European Commission and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
In 2002-2003, more than half the pupils in special schools in Slovakia were Roma.
In Germany, only half of Roma children went to school, and 80% of those went to special institutions.
In Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovenia, Roma children are the majority of those attending special schools.
In 2003, 80% of Roma in Slovakia did not have a registered place of work, 80% of them in Romania and Bulgaria have incomes below the national poverty threshold, and I could list ... (the President cut off the speaker) I could list more of these cases.
Thank you.
(NL) Mr President, I believe we readily agree that an effective approach to crime deserves our support, and of course there is never any excuse for murder, but I believe we also agree that the right to reside in the Schengen area is a great asset and is tangible proof of European citizenship.
Anyone seeking to curtail it must be able to present very good arguments.
In particular, we must also beware of collective arrangements in this context, as when one talks about collective arrangements, one soon finds oneself talking about one group, and at this time we happen to be talking about the Roma. I think this very unfortunate.
I am pleased with Commissioner Frattini's remarks about the Roma and about the fact that the European Union could do more for this group, but I remain unhappy, of course, with his earlier remark about the Roma in connection with events in Italy.
There is a good deal of talk today about the consequences of the migration that has been taking place since the enlargement of the European Union and that also took place previously within the enlarged Union, and of course there are consequences to contend with.
I believe we must also look to some degree at the causes, however, and at ways in which we, the European Union, can do more for people travelling into the EU, as they are simply seeking better living conditions, employment, and better conditions for their families and children.
I am very much in favour of making better use of European funds in order to do more for the Roma, particularly in the new Member States, but I should like to reiterate that in the past this Parliament has already called for recognition of the Roma as a European minority - that is, a very special group, not comparable with other minorities.
Making the Roma a European minority would directly open up many more opportunities for the Union to do something about the problems.
I would reiterate our appeal to give a single Member of the Commission responsibility for Roma policy, rather than the current situation, where various Commissioners deal with this area, with one coordinating.
Competence must rest in one pair of hands.
Finally, as far as discrimination and social exclusion are concerned, these have been priorities of this Parliament, including during negotiations with the new Member States.
I am pointing the finger at the new Member States, but we know that there are also problems in the older ones.
At that time, all kinds of agreements were made with the governments of the new Member States, but these are being implemented unsatisfactorily or not at all.
I think that the European Union, the European Commission, must also play its part by revisiting the agreements made at the time of accession, particularly those concerning improving the situation of the Roma.
The issues concerned here are discrimination and social exclusion.
Hence our group's appeal to discuss this once more with these new Member States.
We shall certainly be doing this ourselves, but this is also an appeal to the Council and particularly to the Commission: not only Commissioner Frattini, but also his colleagues.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that even on this occasion, I must use the customary sincerity and frankness in addressing this Parliament, towards which I harbour the utmost respect, although this does not preclude me from replying to statements and considerations which I do not share.
I did not just start taking action and speaking out on this issue a few days ago.
Many of you have recalled one or two lines from an interview I gave - one of many - on 2 November.
I started taking a real interest in this question months and months ago.
This was at the request of Italian mayors, who as we know belong to different political parties, most of them in the centre-left.
At the conference of Italian mayors on 19 May, an important meeting which took place months ago - and considering how often I am quoted, I too keep a record - Italian mayors raised the issue of security in their cities with the Italian Minister of the Interior, blaming it on Europe.
At the end of that meeting, Mr Amato said that it was a grave mistake to think that the issue of security was exclusively the problem of the wealthy who had something to protect, and that it was a phenomenon which, unless addressed, would turn neighbours into enemies.
This led to the appeal to the European Commission issued that same day.
On 23 June, at the General Assembly of the ANCI - which as Italian MEPs will know, is the Italian local authority association, presided over by the Mayor of Florence - the Roma reception plan was unveiled following a meeting which had taken place a few days before between local authority representatives and myself.
At that meeting, which took place in Bari, the reception plan for the Roma people was unveiled and a request issued for European funding - which until then had not been requested by Italy - to cover the costs of the plan.
Italian mayors agreed that the integration system should be based on values of reciprocity, arguing that we had a duty to welcome and integrate immigrants provided that they accepted the rules of our country.
This was the position I adopted for months and months, ever since the start of the summer in fact, until an event promoted by the Mayors of Bologna and Florence led to a national campaign against people who clean car windscreens.
The Mayor of Florence - who clearly you know, he is not someone who can be suspected of having racist sympathies - even proposed criminalising homeless people who clean car windscreens.
I met with the mayors again, and then on 25 October, a few weeks ago, a memo from an Italian agency, after yet another meeting, said that 'the mayors do not agree, they want new laws immediately and are claiming that people do not understand the divisions that are forming within the majority.
These statements included an appeal from Italian mayors and from the Italian Minister of the Interior to me, because at that time no one thought that Europe had any tools like those subsequently adopted with the decree-law to tackle situations where there was a clear violation of Directive 2004/38/EC.
This is why I started taking an interest in this subject, and to all those who took the floor to criticise me, I say this: I do not think that you will find a single time when I did not make a positive and honest contribution and cooperate with Mr Amato, who is responsible for this matter in Italy.
I challenge you to prove otherwise, that I refused to collaborate when asked to do so by Mr Amato and that I did not respond to requests that the Italian government legitimately made to Europe, as happened a few days ago.
A few weeks after these events, the first figures were released - I remember it well because, as a member of the European Commission, I received protests from Bucharest - by the Mayor of Rome, claiming that Romanians were responsible for 75% of crimes committed in Italy, when in actual fact it was 75% of crimes committed by foreigners, and so a much lower percentage.
Many of you will remember that people took to the streets in Bucharest to protest against these statements, yet despite this, I was still holding talks with the Mayor of Rome, offering him the resources of the European Social Fund.
He sent me a letter, which is clearly on the record, asking for help and support from Europe in the form of integration measures.
I considered that this was my duty and I did this.
To conclude, I do not think that anyone in Parliament can be in any doubt over the fact that, apart from what some of you have decided to raise here today, which is just one aspect of a particular interview, I trust that none of you can overlook what I have achieved over the years.
I have worked and I still am working to ensure that the Schengen area is extended before Christmas to include the nine new Member States.
What is this if it does not make freedom of movement more effective?
If this happens, it will be partly down to my efforts.
I have been working on this for the past two and a half years and have never been afraid to say that the right of free movement is one of the pillars of the European Union.
I cannot believe that anyone can criticise me for being someone who does not want this right to be recognised.
A final word on the subject of Romania: I have listened to the Romanian MPs.
They more than anyone else know what I personally have done to help Romania join the EU, with reports, with advice, with the visits I have made.
Well, I do not think that anyone in Parliament can suspect even for a moment that I do not have, for Romania and for the Romanian people - not Romanian criminals, who I regard in the same way as Italian criminals - the utmost respect and deepest friendship, or I would not have done everything I have done over the last two years.
I do not think that extrapolating a single sentence from an interview can change these facts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (IT) International public opinion has been shaken by the recent tragic events in Rome.
I think it is unfortunate that some political groups are clumsily trying to exploit this situation for political ends, sometimes by evoking a dangerous and counter-productive return to the past.
European legislation establishes certain benchmarks that must be respected in all 27 Member States, bearing in mind that some countries, for geographical and logistical reasons, are easier to get to.
A system is needed that places rights above everything else, but which does not ignore the duties of the individual; it is the very synthesis of these two aspects that determines the efficiency of policies in this sector.
A fundamental approach must also be adopted which on the one hand obliges Member States to integrate law-abiding European citizens and on the other allows them to expel those who break the rules.
This is a challenge in which Europe has a fundamental role.
in writing. - (RO) Criminality has no nationality.
I regret and condemn any criminal act, wherever it happens, and justice should do its duty.
Yet, one cannot stigmatize an entire people or ethnic group for a crime committed by one of its members.
Fighting criminality should not infringe upon the free movement of persons, a fundamental principle of the European construction.
European citizens have the right to live and travel freely, without fear of being persecuted or subject to acts of violence in the Member States.
I ask the European Commission to examine the decree recently approved in Italy, which allows expulsions without granting any legal guarantees to the persons expelled, especially if they are citizens of the European Union.
This decree has allowed abuses that certain Romanian citizens have already suffered.
I ask the Italian State to take actions in order to stop the abuses.
I believe this situation should be urgently solved in order not to allow European Union citizens to be discriminated against, regardless of whether they are Romanian, Italian, German, Spanish or French.
I don't want this decree to become a dangerous precedent that would question the very respect of the Union's fundamental principles.
This might affect the internal credibility of the European Union, as well as its credibility as a world player.
Protection of soil - Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the protection of soil and amending Directive 2004/35/EC - C6-0307/2006 -, and
the report by Vittorio Prodi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection.
(DE) Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks.
Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect.
No authority in Europe has the right to go into some camp, ask a person 'How do you make your living?' and deport the person if they cannot answer immediately.
That is completely and utterly wrong, but that is what you said in the interview with Il Messaggero, so do not get into a huff when it is pointed out to you.
In any case the debate is closed.
I am sorry, but it is not possible.
I thought that you wanted to put an item on the agenda.
The debate is closed.
Let us proceed. ...
I am opposed to this intervention.
We cannot go any further with this, I thought that Mr Schulz wanted to add an item to the agenda.
Madam President, let me start by thanking the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the other committees, for their contribution during first reading.
The Commission's proposal for a thematic strategy for soil protection arises from work begun in 1998 on the initiative of the German Ministry of the Environment.
As a result of lengthy consultations with interested parties and the Member States, soil was recognised as a valuable natural resource and its degradation in Europe is becoming problematic.
The Commission has subsequently collaborated with the parties involved, above all with Parliament and the Council, so that soil protection issues can be better understood and a consensus can be reached in this area.
Î€he Parliament resolution on the 2002 Communication on soil protection made important recommendations to the Commission about the direction it must take to ensure proper soil protection in Europe.
With the conclusions approved in Majorca in 2002, the European Council asked the Commission to propose a comprehensive, far-reaching strategy on soil protection embracing general principles, appropriate quantitative and qualitative targets, and schedules for gauging and evaluating the planned measures.
Let me turn to some more specific issues.
I find it very satisfying that soil degradation is recognised as a grave problem that must be overcome.
In view of the present Parliament's keen interest in desertification, for example, it is important that here in Europe we should openly declare our commitment to dealing with the causes of this problem, both in Europe and around the world.
Climate change and certain unsuitable soil management practices are putting our soil at risk.
Determining the extent of degradation and then developing methods to ensure that soil is used sustainably represents a direct application of the knowledge-based approach that Parliament rightly values.
Thus efforts will be guaranteed to be more focused and resources will be used more effectively to serve our purposes.
Businesses are entitled to expect consistent application of Community legislation by Member States.
In the environmental impact analysis prepared by the Commission, it is estimated that there are about 3.5 million sites in the EU likely to have become contaminated.
A proportion of these, perhaps 15%, have definitely been contaminated.
It is therefore vital that businesses should be confident that similar procedures will be adopted for the designation of contaminated sites, thus allowing for planned investments.
We must also bear in mind that there is a direct relationship between climate change and soil.
For example, according to a recent research article published in the authoritative international scientific journal Nature, over the past 25 years in the United Kingdom alone, the soil has been releasing 13 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year - as much as would be given off by an additional 5 million cars each year.
It is also worth noting that the soil's ability to absorb carbon and convert it into useful humus has not yet been fully exploited.
In the light of this, allow me to summarise the basic aims of the measures proposed by the Commission:
Firstly, a highly flexible, but consistent and comprehensive European soil policy must be developed.
With the creation of a framework for sustainable soil use, and with the adoption of measures at source, this policy will prevent further degradation of the soil, whose vitally important social, environmental and economic functions will be preserved.
Secondly, the necessary information on the condition of soil in Europe must be gathered so that we can make knowledge-based policy decisions and focus our efforts where the most serious degradation has been noted.
Thirdly, degraded soils should where possible be restored on the basis of an analysis of soil condition, to be carried out by the Member States.
The aim of the restoration should be to achieve soil quality consistent at least with the current and intended use of the land.
Fourthly, minimum common rules should be adopted for the EU as a whole to ensure a consistent approach among the Member States on matters of soil protection.
These common rules will help establish transparency and avoid distortion of the internal market.
The aim of the strategy and the directive is to launch a long-term policy on soil protection in Europe, so that in a few years, time all the Member States will have made considerable progress in this area.
I should like to draw your attention to certain key aspects of the framework directive on soil protection:
Firstly, the document produced after the codecision process has to be unambiguous and provide legal clarity for the interested parties affected by this legislative process.
We must avoid introducing amendments with legal loopholes, unnecessarily restricting the scope of the directive.
Secondly, the proposal already contains a high degree of subsidiarity and flexibility.
I understand that certain amendments are being proposed to increase still further the degree of subsidiarity.
However, you must be sure that these amendments will not create difficulties in the application of the directive by all Member States.
This applies especially to the amendments concerning programmes of measures in the priority areas specified in the directive.
Thirdly, in order to achieve a high degree of environmental protection, we must agree on a consistent approach to be followed by all Member States for the identification of contaminated soils.
The proposed deletion of Annex II would prevent us from achieving our aim.
To conclude, let me state that from now on the Commission will follow developments during the discussion of its proposal in the Council and in the European Parliament.
It will then define its position accordingly.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, before discussing the proposal that is going to be voted on this morning, I would like to thank the rapporteurs from all the political groups, and I would especially like to thank Mrs Sornosa, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and our friend Mr Prodi, who have really worked side by side and have enriched the directive, as have the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and many other Members.
The document that is going to be voted on tomorrow has several amendments, which were the result of an agreement, and it has therefore been enriched by contributions from other political parties.
It is a document that is largely based on a consensus, which is unexpected in an environmental policy that it could be said is going to generate a new European policy and is opening up a new path.
This document is extremely innovative, as it is responding to a new way of tackling directives.
We were facing the problem that, out of 27 countries, only nine had soil protection legislation, and this is an issue that we are going to have to tackle again in the future.
Europe has developed asymmetrically, and there are currently many countries that are at doctorate level in terms of soil policy while others are only doing their A-levels.
How can we arrive at a policy of consensus, a common policy, when there are such huge differences?
This is the challenge with which we were faced.
What was the solution?
We went to the Treaty and saw that when defining directives, Article 249 states that directives are common objectives, but that the implementation and application of them can be left up to the Member States, and this is what was done.
Articles 1 and 2 have been strengthened right up to Article 6 in order to make the common objectives clear.
In other words, we have set out the goal.
We know the goal that we need to get to, and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals, but not all countries can move at the same pace.
Those who have not yet begun to advance cannot be asked to do the same as the rest.
We therefore ask for implementation to be left in the hands of the Member States, with maximum respect for subsidiarity, thus eliminating the fear in some countries that have already made progress that their official arrangements will be repeated.
There is no need for those countries that have clear soil protection to do it all over again.
This policy of flexibility also applies to recognising that, given the climate and conditions in each country, each one needs to be allowed to come to an agreement with its citizens in order to implement these policies.
Therefore, for example, in Article 8 we guarantee that farmers can make an agreement with their Member States on soil conservation, and those that have already done so will not have to repeat the legislation.
This means that at the same time we need to ensure that there is a clear policy on contaminated soil and, in this respect, the health of citizens comes before everything else, along with the objectives of protecting health and being transparent in providing information to citizens; this is clear.
Why do I think it is important for there to be a directive, in the face of the critics that do not want one?
It is important, ladies and gentlemen, because we have to build Europe based on our strengths, so we need to follow those countries that have done things well.
On the other hand, if we do not legislate we will enter into uncertainty and insecurity, and insecurity and uncertainty undermine the market and health.
Let us build Europe around its strengths, not its weaknesses.
This is the path that we have to take.
Moreover, subsidiarity is being guaranteed, and it is being stated that there does not need to be duplication of official arrangements or of legislation.
Member States are being given responsibility for carrying it out, and freedom means responsibility.
In a Europe of 27 members, we need to learn that environmental policy cannot be made by implementing it through the judicial system.
We cannot solely rely on prosecutors and the Court of Justice to apply it.
We need to rely on a common policy, and on faith in the credibility and capacity of the Member States to get going and carry out the best policies.
This is why we have largely looked to good practice.
Something else that is innovative about this directive is that, for the first time, it tackles climate change in relation to soil, dealing with adequate treatment of soil for floods, and for combating desertification and erosion.
There is another thing that we need to take into account: Europe and its countryside are the result of the work of man; they have been produced by farmers as the gardeners of the countryside.
We must take into account that the Europe of the future must be built by its citizens, and therefore, I repeat, we must set common objectives, but help them to take the path that will also ensure health and a commitment to transparency.
Thank you very much, and thank you once again to the political parties.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you and extend my thanks again to the rapporteur Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines.
It was a task that we worked on together and I hope that this has helped to improve the text.
The directive under discussion today is aimed at protecting European soil from phenomena such as desertification, erosion and salinisation, increasingly linked with climate change and specific soil pollution.
Paradoxically, despite the numerous regulations on the use and release into the environment of pollutants, there was no directive that made provision for any obligation to identify and certify soil that had been seriously polluted before improving it.
However, this seems to bother some people in Parliament and elsewhere, who are critical of what they call an attack on subsidiarity and the suffocating presence of the European institutions, which are using measures such as the Soil Framework Directive to harass groups of farmers or businesses, with unfair laws, unjust provisions and new administrative and/or financial burdens.
What are we talking about?
We are talking about the same directive that gives the Member States a period of some 25 years just to identify all areas in the national territory that might be considered seriously polluted, and thus compromised for various uses, both public and private, and all areas at serious risk in fact of desertification, erosion, salinisation and loss of compaction.
We are talking about guidelines for organising a systematic improvement scheme, where necessary, in the collective interest.
We are talking about the protection of human health alongside the protection of the environment.
We are talking about a framework directive that not only respects the autonomy of the Member States, but contains no onerous provisions.
I ask you then why this aversion on the part of certain Member States and Parliament - the usual suspects - to accepting a list of activities and sites that must undergo comprehensive investigation by the national authorities?
What do they have to hide?
Why so much aversion, when their representatives on the Council have already accepted the binding nature of the investigation into all sites proposed by the Commission in Annex II, and the principle of transparency which must prevail in soil-related transactions?
In addition, there is added value in a Europe-wide approach towards soil monitoring, which will improve the ability of the Member States to learn about their soil.
In any case reports to the Commission will be practically automatic, since they will be based on satellite surveys.
It is not common knowledge perhaps that a project of this type has already been carried out by the Commission, resulting in the Soil Atlas of Europe, which is a good example of what can be achieved if we work together.
However, there is another argument for a Community-based approach towards soil protection, which is climate change, a challenge facing all of Europe.
This challenge will consist of extreme climatic events: more rainfall, longer droughts, less snowfall and an increase in sea levels.
This means that we have a duty to manage the soil, precisely to combat these challenges, to increase water retention times across the entire territory to prevent flooding and encourage groundwater absorption, particularly along the coasts, and prevent saltwater infiltration, most likely due to rising sea levels.
Forestry management to control the risk of forest fires, since increased droughts will mean a greater risk of desertification in case of fire.
Incidentally, this type of land management will encourage the use of renewable energy such as hydro-energy and biomass.
Finally, we should not forget the part the soil plays in balancing greenhouse gases.
During the vote on Wednesday, I would ask you to consider that what we need more than anything is a strategy and a directive that can guarantee future generations the use and enjoyment of the soil that we now have in our safekeeping, bearing in mind that each Member State faces the same threats and the same environmental risks.
The soil is a resource, a resource that is scarce in Europe, and we must maximise its availability.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President, and thank you also to Commissioner Dimas for his decisive support for this directive.
We would like to welcome the Commission's proposal, as of course it aims to protect the soil and preserve its capacity to continue to carry out its environmental, economic, social and cultural functions, all of which are of course essential to human activity.
Moreover, as the Commissioner rightly said, it proposes flexible rules, which are ambitious in their objectives and not excessively prescriptive in their content.
Within a common framework, a minimum common denominator, the Member States are going to define their own level of intervention, enabling more efficient use of administrative capacity at national level.
Despite the exaggerated resistance to this directive from some sectors, it is evident that soil is a vital resource that is essentially non-renewable, which is suffering under growing environmental pressure for which human activity has significant responsibility.
According to the reports that have been discussed here, it has been calculated that the cost of soil degradation is approximately EUR 40 000 million per year, a cost that is borne by society in the form of damage to infrastructure, increases in the cost of healthcare and many other factors.
This directive is of course based on the precautionary and preventive action principles, and on the principle that environmental damage must be rectified at its origin and that the polluter pays.
This legislation will mitigate the cross-border effects of soil degradation, which do also exist, and it will help to ensure equal conditions in the internal market.
I would like to highlight this aspect, because the different obligations that economic operators may impose, in line with different national soil protection legislation, could distort competition.
To conclude, the soil protection directive is a step forward that will enable competition with greater transparency and will protect areas of common interest such as water, food safety and human health.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Soil Protection Directive and the Soil Framework Directive, together with the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, rank among the key topics in this part-session, as of course they have done in recent weeks and months in the committees.
Normally a strategy - in this case about soil - is dealt with before the relevant directive, for good reason.
The advantage of proceeding in stages is usually that interests are discussed openly early on, so that the newly gained points of view can be taken into account as the directive is formulated.
With regard to the strong criticism that has been directed at the Commission proposal on the Soil Protection Directive, prior discussion about the topic would undoubtedly have been helpful, including to calm tempers all round.
In contrast to the normal nature of a framework directive, the Commission proposal - and I share this opinion - includes very rigid, detailed regulations, and commits the Member States to numerous examinations and reports that would result in a considerable administrative load.
This is unacceptable.
The new Member States already have national soil protection legislation that functions well.
For them, the Commission proposal would in some cases require their systems to be completely restructured: a high level of regulatory duplication and additional bureaucratic burden.
Therefore, numerous Member States are sceptical about this Directive, as has already been stated.
Nevertheless, in the last few months I have been heavily involved in transforming the Commission proposal, rewriting it.
Essentially, it was a matter of allowing the Member States more scope within which to operate, while still pursuing the goal of curbing the growing deterioration of the soil at European level.
I hope that, in the end, together with our friend Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, we arrived at a sensible result, including with regard to the significance of the overall topic of soil protection, a result that can be a model worldwide as well as in Europe.
May I therefore express my warm thanks to the rapporteur once again for offering a solution that enabled a compromise to be found.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in European legislation important natural resources (water, air, species, the habitats of flora and fauna) have specific Community legislation, while soil as a resource does not have any.
It is time to resolve this imbalance, and I therefore thank the Commission for its proposal, and also thank the rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, for the work that she has done.
As many of us have said, soil is a non-renewable and therefore limited natural resource that carries out many important ecological and economic functions, and it is the basis of almost all human activities.
There is no doubt that the involvement of the European institutional legislative system in this area will provide an impetus for the improvement of legislation that is being put in place in many countries, by giving it a coherent framework that is supported by European regulation, and possibly European resources.
With regard to the immovable nature of soil, which appears to be cited as proof by some in order to justify their preferences for national or subsidiary treatment rather than a European policy, the European Commission's communication gives a sufficient argument as to why there needs to be a strategy at European level, and some colleagues, such as Mr Calabuig Rull, have mentioned this.
There are some Member States that are not very eager for the standardisation of soil protection at European level, and we therefore think that both the strategy and the directive are being given the right focus in terms of being a flexible legal instrument that is ambitious and not excessively prescriptive.
This means that each Member State can adapt it to its needs and to its social and economic situation, as a framework has been set out and long-term goals have been set.
In short, I think that the methodology of the proposal for a directive, based on prevention, raising awareness among citizens, providing information, identifying priority areas of degradation and making inventories of contaminated soil along with programmes of national measures and rehabilitation strategies is a coherent, efficient and flexible approach to dealing with the problem of soil degradation in Europe, while respecting the diversity of national situations and options.
I therefore ask this House, first of all, for a resounding 'no' to the outright rejection that this proposal has received in some sectors, and to support the compromise amendments, which we arrived at following lengthy negotiations.
Perhaps this is not the directive that everyone would like, but precisely because we are all in some way against this directive, it may be able to serve us for the future.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, I too should like to convey my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, who has expended a great deal of energy in the last few months acting as a broker between proponents and opponents of a directive and who, in the end, managed to prepare the basis of a workable compromise.
Nevertheless, I am, as I always have been, of the same opinion as the Members of this House who want to reject the Commission proposal.
Let there be no mistake: our soils are the basis of our existence.
Without healthy soil there is no agriculture, no natural cycle of nutrients and, in the long term, no life.
We are responsible for protecting our soils from harmful effects where possible, and keeping them in good condition.
However, this Directive is not the right way to achieve this.
I do not believe that the question here is whether we wish to protect our soils better or not; instead, at the European level the question as I see it is: is this within our jurisdiction or not?
I believe that it is not.
Obviously, many Member States have developed their own functioning soil protection legislation, with more concern for and better solutions to local problems than would be possible with centralised regulation from Brussels.
Therefore I would ask the House to support the amendments that retain operational scope for the Member States.
Apart from that, we are about to create vast amounts of new bureaucracy and expense for administrative bodies and businesses.
There are amendments that would use the mere establishment of an industrial business as a reason to require detailed examinations and reports.
Let me quickly give you just one example, that of the building of industrial gas plants.
These separate normal air, which is a mixture of gases, into its components -which does not harm the soil at all.
We should not be worrying about things like that, but only about things where there is justified concern that they may contaminate the soil.
I believe that it is high time we refrained from the preparation and publishing of soil status reports.
That is an encroachment on freedom of contract.
The sale of land is covered by civil law, with good reason, and it should stay this way.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, in the end, we shall achieve a Directive that really does guarantee protection of the soil and does not primarily increase administrative load.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a saying that is well known in many countries: 'better late than never'.
We are coming late to soil protection, after many decades of devastation, as is most evident in industrial regions, but it is good that we have come to realise that the soil feeds us and we must not destroy it.
We must not treat it like a commercial item and operate a policy under which the biggest business is the purchase of agricultural land and its alienation from agricultural production for other purposes.
This policy is already coming home to roost.
It is good that we can finally see this and begin to protect the soil, our provider.
May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture.
Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert.
On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I support the reports by Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we stand for a definite 'yes' to EU-wide soil protection.
We have heard that soil is our most important non-renewable resource.
Soil deterioration costs the EU more than EUR 38 billion every year.
In Germany, only 2% of the soil is still in its natural condition.
Twelve per cent of soils in the EU are affected by erosion.
Soil deterioration does not respect national borders.
Thus we are in the process of pulling the rug out from under our own feet by the way we are currently using our soils.
The EU proposal was good; it went in the right direction, and we should have liked to improve it.
I know that the rapporteur fought for it, but unfortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety watered down and further spoiled a great many points of the proposal under pressure from the conservatives and the agricultural lobby.
I cannot understand why we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed to maintain secrecy about soil containing inherited contamination.
I hope we shall still be able to correct this tomorrow.
It runs counter to transparency and also to the Aarhus Convention.
We also know that climate change and good-quality soil go hand in hand, that soil is an important carbon dioxide pool and is continually losing this ability to bind CO2.
Because of the watering down that has happened in the Committee on the Environment, I fear that an ambitious Soil Protection Directive is, unfortunately, impossible.
However, we need effective soil protection with a shared timeframe and common criteria.
In short, we need effective, specific goals to put a stop to the deterioration of soils in the European Union.
We must not give up on creating something that is legally binding because of this so-called compromise.
Only legally binding measures will enable us to set an ambitious soil strategy in motion.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important and positive directive.
I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, who handled this.
I say so myself, as a member of a group that often criticises directives and the Commission: this is not the case here.
This directive will be a huge step forward for Europe, both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness.
With the completion of the framework directives on the natural elements, the soil will be considered as a key part of the biosphere, a fundamental element of the environmental and climatic balance and not just a platform on which to build.
The soil is living, it absorbs CO2, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted.
Europe understands this.
We had a long and difficult discussion in the Committee, and I would like to thank Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines for being so passionate about the subject.
However, there is the risk that Parliament will interfere with the Commission's text.
I never like to see this happen, I always prefer it when Parliament is more advanced than the Commission.
Someone has even recommended that the directive should be rejected, but this would be a serious mistake.
Europe must look to the future.
The soil beneath us is soil that we all share, it is part of our planet.
It is the only soil we have and we must look after it.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I can see some of the logic in EU-level legislation regulating water and air quality.
We share these in the EU and, indeed, globally.
However, I find the logic fails with the protection of soils.
Soils are much less mobile and, other than the setting of reasonable standards of protection, should be the competence of Member States and, within them, the local authorities.
Before the EU takes too much control of soils maybe we need to do a bit of soul-searching.
In Ireland, some of the problematic policies in terms of soil degradation have come top-down from Europe.
For example, the EU sugar reform removed beet from the wheat rotation.
The insertion of beet conditioned the soil and made it more suitable for cereals.
Also, the EU forest grants over the years have resulted in unsuitable spruce plantations that, in growth, have made the soil more acidic and, in harvesting, have in some cases compacted the soil, rendering it infertile, whilst in others have loosened it from the hills, from which it has been washed into rivers and lakes.
Soil varies enormously but it should be living and renewing.
The EU should ban soil destruction but leave its care and management to the people who understand its composition in each area.
(SK) Before looking at the actual wording of the proposed framework directive on soil protection, we should consider whether EU legislation in this area is actually needed.
The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken into consideration.
It clearly rejected the need for soil protection legislation in the EU on the basis that soil does not have any cross-border implications and is therefore a regional issue.
Despite the fact that other committees, in their respective opinions, were essentially in favour of EU legislation in this matter, certain factions are somewhat hesitant.
For example, the amendment to Article 5 in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly indicates that the degradation of the soil has local or regional causes and effects and it is therefore essential to adopt national as opposed to European measures.
This appears to be in conflict with the remainder of the text, which is clearly in favour of the framework directive.
Similar wording can be found in the amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to Article 2.
On the other hand, it is important to recognise that the degradation of soil, as a non-renewable resource, has significant consequences on other aspects, for which legislation already exists, such as water quality, food safety, climate change, etc. Even if both sides were partly right with regards to the need for a framework directive, I believe that the decision to adopt or reject the European framework will be a political one.
I would like to comment on the change in the character of the report from negative to positive.
One example is the replacement of the term 'risk area' with 'priority area'.
I believe that for areas where soil degradation needs to be stopped urgently we must use urgent terminology; soil at risk must be indicated with a negative term to underscore the seriousness of the situation.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work on the proposal in question.
Unfortunately, however, I must endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which calls on the committee responsible to propose rejection of the Commission proposal.
The reasons cited by the committee are valid and remain so in spite of the substantial changes made to the proposal in the last few months.
Soil really does not have any cross-border implications and should therefore remain a competence of the Member States.
Therefore, despite the positive changes, this proposal continues to represent a breach of the principle of subsidiarity.
As far as proportionality is concerned, adopting such legislation could be seen as a waste of resources.
Moreover, it is important to remember that within the EU there are many different soil types, which are used in a variety of ways.
It is true that the Directive in question has become what could be described as a flexible framework directive.
In addition, as a result of our new philosophy, the Directive is binding as far as the results are concerned, but leaves the decision on the form and method up to the Member States.
It is very positive that the existing Member State legislation covering these objectives does not need to be revised.
As such, we are genuinely moving towards the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
A positive side effect of this legislation would be the pressure that would be brought to bear on Member States with inadequate soil protection legislation at present, but I am not sure if this is the best way to put pressure on them.
After having weighed up all the pros and cons, I believe that it is not necessary to adopt the proposed directive.
The Member States can protect their soil on their own.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate the words of the French philosopher who said that if a law is not essential it must not be written.
(DE) Madam President, I am another representative who believes that soil protection is very definitely a task for the European Union, and that the European Parliament should therefore adopt this Framework Directive.
Nor, to be honest, do I understand the comments that have been made about how the different soil types in our Member States have not been taken into account.
I am going to read this Directive through again and try to see what the other Members are referring to, for I did not notice these inflexible measures and proposals.
I should also like to mention the role of agriculture, for, in my view, the compromise amendment by the various parties is very important.
It requires the Member States, when using soil for agricultural purposes, to encourage crops and afforestation methods that could have a beneficial effect on soil organic matter and soil fertility and thus prevent landslides and desertification.
Likewise, agricultural methods that prevent the compaction and erosion of soils should also be supported.
We know that very often agriculture causes problems for soil quality, and I believe that this clarification is absolutely vital.
I do not believe that the 'support for agriculture, no matter what' formula is sufficient to protect soils at regional, national, or even European level.
- (PL) Madam President, a framework directive on soil protection will in my view be an instrument that promotes the production of foodstuffs and adequate supplies of clean water for subsequent generations of EU citizens.
The soil also performs many other important functions: it is a substrate for human activities, along with towns and infrastructure, and also for nature and valuable landscapes.
Protection of the soil is essential for the maintenance of our natural heritage and raw materials.
In view of this situation, a flexible framework directive recognising the principle of subsidiarity will be an instrument that encourages Member States to protect their soils.
A directive couched in such terms is binding for Member States in respect of the results that may be achieved in the area of soil protection, but leaves Member States the choice of the forms and methods used to achieve such protection.
The proposals contained in the directive whereby Member States are to draw up lists of contaminated areas, including on a regional scale, to be published and updated every five years, are worthy of note.
This is important information for the protection of the life and health of EU citizens.
(FR) Madam President, I would also first like to congratulate our rapporteurs and applaud the difficult job Mrs GutiÃ©rrez has accomplished in producing a result to protect our soil.
Unlike other fellow Members, I believe a more restrictive legislative approach would have provided better protection.
I also think it is a pity that our fellow Members whose countries have stricter regulation than that proposed here are still trying to water down this report with amendments that I would urge you very strongly to reject tomorrow.
Our agricultural and industrial activities and transport plans have drastically affected the quality of our soil.
However, this same soil is the foundation of biodiversity and our food.
It filters and stores organic matter and minerals, and also helps us to access water.
It plays a prominent role in the fight against climate change.
Furthermore, faced with growing demand for food and energy production, it is essential that we safeguard and restore the quality of our soil and prevent desertification.
Without legislation at European level, we cannot hope for results.
(NL) Madam President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.
This debate is a further demonstration that the proposed soil policy is very controversial.
Now that there are two proposals - the strategy and the Directive - it seems as though a new branch of environmental policy is being introduced.
I say 'seems', as nothing could be further from the truth.
Sustainable management of soil use already comes to the fore in 33 European directives, such as the Water Framework Directive.
Why, then, are we presenting overlapping legislation, entailing yet more burdens, particularly for Member States that already have a well-functioning soil policy?
I shall be supporting Mr Prodi's Thematic Strategy.
In my opinion, Member States who have yet to develop a soil policy must do so on the basis of the strategy.
The framework directive, on the other hand, is disproportionate and also, in my view, contravenes the principle of subsidiarity.
Unlike air and water, soil does not have a cross-border dimension, and policy is often implemented on a regional or local scale.
This is also the reason that I - that is, Mr Blokland - have joined in signing the amendment rejecting the Commission proposal.
Madam President, we are familiar with the idea that a land grab is the unwarranted appropriation of property belonging to another.
It seems to me that this soil directive amounts to an unwarranted power grab by Brussels, and of course brings with it an inevitable layer of fresh bureaucracy.
Soil, as has been said in this debate, unlike air and water, does not flow from state to state.
It has no cross-border dimension.
Thus policy on soil is and should remain a Member State issue.
IPPC, cross-compliance obligations, the Landfill Directive and the Nitrates Directive all give us more than enough EU involvement.
Hence I have no apology for favouring total rejection of this power-hungry proposal.
But, if, true to form, the EU nonetheless decides to meddle in this national issue, then one initiative it could consider is to introduce a payment to farmers in return for providing carbon sequestration in soil management and farming practices.
(FR) Madam President, my first thought on this proposal for a directive was to reject the text.
I also think that a framework directive was perhaps not an appropriate solution.
Why have another text on the protection of soil when we already have a whole raft of regulations on soil, waste, pesticides and the protection of nature?
Within the framework of better lawmaking, I was thinking that we should not appear to be going through the European Commission mill again.
I was putting myself in the shoes particularly of the mayors of our municipalities, who would find themselves with another text to dissect.
However, the reality is this: human practices have not respected the soil.
We have worn out the soil with intensive production.
In addition to this there is climate change and desertification.
Our urban planning policies have mineralised the soil, degraded it, and our fellow citizens are now surprised when they experience catastrophic flooding because the soil no longer absorbs the rain.
Who has not seen the open wounds in the landscape caused by the quarries that supply us with such valuable materials?
Impoverished, dried out, degraded, polluted and bruised soil - that is what has become of this land, which previous generations spoke about with veneration because the land was everything to them: their work, their food, their life and, for many, their only property.
What was once our mother Earth we now regard with suspicion.
What will be the consequences of this degradation, this pollution, for our environment and health?
Mrs GutiÃ©rrez has done a remarkable job in trying to find an acceptable approach, in trying to bring closer together those who did not want this directive and those who did.
She has listened to Parliament.
She has found balanced positions that respect the need for subsidiarity in the choice of methods, because there is enormous disparity between the Member States.
The final text has evolved a great deal.
It avoids increasing the burden of administrative costs by encouraging us to put right the mistakes of the past, our agricultural, industrial and urban practices that did not respect the soil.
This report, completely remodelled by Mrs GutiÃ©rrez, is satisfactory.
There is such soil diversity in the European Union that the subsidiarity guarantee is essential, while ensuring the protection and sustainable use of the soil.
(HU) It is our fundamental goal to guarantee a healthy environment for our citizens, and there is stringent Union legislation for most elements of our environment.
Soil is the only element of the environment that we have not yet been able to regulate, so there is currently no Union instrument to halt the pollution of soil and the erosion of its quality, even though this causes many tens of millions of euros' worth of damage for all of us.
According to the current legislation, it is only compulsory to act against soil pollution when the pollution enters other elements of the environment: groundwater, fresh water, agricultural products, or when it is too late to act in practice.
I would welcome the adoption of this new Directive by the European Union, and I am pleased that a compromise package has been created that is even more acceptable from the perspective of environmental protection.
It is also important from a Hungarian perspective that, as many of us have proposed, the legislation should also deal with tackling soil acidification.
This is a serious threat to agricultural production, so it must be fought using Union instruments for this reason too.
Recognition of the polluted areas will encourage remediation, so we can prevent the pollution of water tables for drinking water, and naturally the cultivation of polluted plants.
Soil regulation is therefore in the interests of farmers.
I therefore hope that certain MEPs from the right, including, surprisingly, some Hungarian MEPs, will not succeed in their endeavour to prevent the creation of a Directive to protect the interests of Hungarian agriculture and the environment.
In the spirit of the Directive, the rehabilitation of the polluted or soil-degraded areas uncovered will be a task for the Union, for which resources will need to be found in future Community budgets.
Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps.
Firstly, soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably.
How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates?
It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia.
Now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers, many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection.
They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil, because it is their livelihood.
They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation.
The second large credibility gap is provided by the EU's short-sighted open border policy, which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country.
This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available - some three million new homes by 2020, we are told.
Even the green belt is under threat.
Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I support the soil strategy elaborated in the Prodi report, but oppose the Directive on soil.
I do so quite clearly on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Therefore, I have tabled an amendment rejecting it, but also one opting for another instrument, namely open coordination.
The objectives can be achieved in full by this means.
After all, it is abundantly clear that this all centres on stimulation, knowledge sharing and monitoring.
Everything is possible, including financial support from the Union.
The risk of duplication remains: once again, priority areas are designated, and even the sea bed has been drawn back into the debate.
The citizens of my country, the Netherlands, do not understand the reason for unnecessary legislation from above, from European level.
As has been said, there are already more than 30 directives concerning soil quality, either directly or indirectly.
What is the point of central legislation when a decentralised approach is also possible?
Nevertheless, I do appreciate Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines's attempts to steer the rules more in the direction of subsidiarity.
Finally, I have submitted many more proposals, with 40 signatures: amendments aiming to further increase the emphasis on quality and soil protection and to respond to new challenges such as climate change.
No legislation should be adopted at European level, however.
I appeal to my fellow Members to support my amendments in this regard.
(NL) Madam President, my thanks to Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, but I must say that, unfortunately, we do not agree with her.
There are a great many places in Europe with soil pollution or other soil problems such as erosion.
These problems must be solved as quickly as possible.
I assume that everyone agrees with this.
The Commission is proposing to solve soil problems at European level - and, as far as I am concerned, there lies the problem.
After all, soil problems are often local, and only in specific cases do they have a real cross-border impact.
European cooperation is desirable in the case of soil problems with a cross-border impact, and in that instance solidarity and cooperation are important.
In the case of local and national soil problems, however, European policy is completely unnecessary.
Many Member States already have a good national policy for solving and preventing soil problems.
Their policy offers a level of protection that is at least as high as the one now on the table.
The Directive on soil should take these Member States into consideration - they should be exempt from European obligations - and therefore we plan to vote against this Directive.
Madam President, I came to this debate from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where we rejected the proposal for a directive.
I favour the Prodi strategy with some reservations.
All of us want our soils protected, but I think those of us who are concerned about this directive believe that it is not necessary to do it in this way.
Mr van Nistelrooij pointed out a much better way of doing it, through open coordination.
The difficulty that I see in terms of soil protection is that we are not doing enough research on how to protect soils and that a great many researchers and advisers in the agricultural area are involved in form filling - forms that are created here in the European Union and which take them from their jobs of being involved with farmers in best practice in terms of soil protection.
It is very difficult for farmers to come to terms with more bureaucracy.
They are dealing with this every day, with cross compliance.
I believe that soils are being protected through good agricultural practice.
It is a Member State issue.
I had hoped that the debate here tonight would convince me that we need a directive but so far I have not been convinced of that.
I accept the work done by the rapporteur, and certainly she has taken out a great many of the concerns we would have, but it does leave me wondering why we need this at all.
I think that Irish farmers, who are in large measure now worried about the Reform Treaty, will see this as another attempt to stifle them in their everyday activities, unless we can convince them that is not the case.
I repeat the point that my concern is that the research and advisory work is, in fact, almost being destroyed by the levels of bureaucracy that the EU has created.
Yes, we need to deal with soils that are contaminated, but we have directives that already do that; they are in place.
I am not convinced, from today's debate, that we need such a directive.
I will remain open-minded until the end of this debate and see if I am thus convinced, but, so far, I am afraid not.
Yes to the strategy, but no to the directive.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mrs GutiÃ©rrez on having spent a great deal of time and energy compiling a draft text that has actually managed to come for plenary debate and voting despite the resistance that can be experienced in the Parliament.
Today, when the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change and civilisation mean an increasing burden on soil and thereby on the whole living world, this legislation is of particularly great importance.
For my part, the Directive is one of the most important statements on the importance of agricultural activity, and the undying merit of the people who work to maintain, protect and improve the soil.
Without them, we would not only be deprived of food, but the environment around us would also suffer serious damage.
Sustainable agriculture implemented with knowledge is one of the mainstays of environmental protection.
However, one of the most important conditions for this is information.
Information about the condition of the soil that is accessible to the public would be one of the fruits of the new legislation, which would finally protect people and farmers instead of polluters.
In my homeland of Hungary, the picture is typically two-fold: on the one hand, there is land of excellent quality and a high degree of legislative protection but, on the other hand, there is industrial pollution caused by forty years of Communism, and cleaning it up will take at least another forty years and EUR 4 billion.
Right now we are spending Union money on remedying this, but we would like to speed this process up in future, and this legislation would be a great help.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Soil Protection Directive we are completing a process in the theological sense too.
We have already regulated all the elements that created the world: air, water, fire - meaning energy - and their importance is thoroughly and appropriately protected by the Union, so now it is the turn of the fourth element, earth, thus completing the circle.
Thank you very much.
(NL) Mr President, Secretary, I should like to start by expressing my sincere congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, and by thanking her for her enormous efforts to strike a balance between supporters and opponents of this Directive, in what is after all a very difficult dossier.
Personally, I am firmly convinced that a European Directive on soil protection is necessary, for various reasons.
I hope that there is still a chance of my convincing Mrs McGuinness.
Some MEPs reject the framework directive because their country already has far-reaching legislation on soil.
My region - Flanders - has also been conducting a progressive soil policy for some years.
For example, a system of compulsory soil certificates in the case of property transfers - even now inconceivable in many Member States - has been in place for a long time.
I should like to turn the reasoning of these Members around.
This flexible Directive not only provides a framework for those Member States that do not yet have a soil policy but is also clearly capable of preventing the undermining of the competitive position of the countries and regions that are already making an effort.
For this reason, it is very important that all Member States take the measures presented in the report.
There is certainly a cross-border impact in a great many places: for example, erosion in Flanders could generate sludge in the Netherlands and vice versa.
The Directive also provides a coherent framework for existing legislation on soil protection.
I could give more reasons but, because of time constraints, I shall conclude by saying that the report under discussion today fills all the aforementioned needs much better than the original Commission proposal.
I myself have also tabled many amendments and am very pleased with the result.
The proposal provides the Member States with sufficient elbow room, creates no additional administrative burdens or duplication, and also explicitly recognises the role of regional authorities.
I therefore hope for strong support from my fellow Members in tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines.
I think she has done an absolutely fantastic job on a report which is not needed or wanted by most of us and, Commissioner Dimas, in my opinion brings this House and the Commission into total disrepute.
You are bringing out legislation which is totally and utterly unnecessary.
What you should be doing is enforcing the legislation that we have.
The Commission usually fails totally in enforcing legislation which is already there.
I can give you a number of cases, but I do not wish to do it just now.
If I were to look, for example, at your colleague, Mr Kyprianou: we have just had yet another outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom; we have got bluetongue; today it was announced that we have avian flu.
He promised to stop all this.
He was going to do everything to stop it.
I believed him.
I believe the Commission when it says something, and yet what happens is that it does not enforce the legislation that is in place to stop these sorts of things coming in.
I call on this House to totally reject this piece of legislation.
I think Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines has done an absolutely fantastic job and I will support her totally if this House decides not to reject it, but I shall briefly mention something that Mrs Scheele and Mrs Corbey said on erosion.
I totally agree with them.
Erosion is a big problem, but not necessarily in the European Union.
It is a problem where we have deforestation, and that is something that we could do something about.
I thought Mr Allister's points were absolutely correct.
I think the Commission is failing us.
It fails to enforce regulations.
I will leave you with one last thought.
As a farmer, the soil is my life.
I will protect it to the very best of my ability.
Do not put more legislation in place.
Allow me to get on with protecting the soil, which provides the food, which provides the income for the people who live in the rural communities.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commission states - that soil is the crucial basis for the long-term, sustainable production of food, feed and biomass - is true.
It is also true that we cannot be satisfied with the state of the soils in the European Union, but to draw from that the conclusion that we need a directive at European level is to head off in the wrong direction.
Why is that?
We are not taking account of the fact that there are already numerous regulations within the European Union that apply to soil and that we could use effectively.
Examples are the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, and the rules on cross-compliance: with these, we can have a financial influence on the improvement of the situation in individual countries.
These are all existing measures, and if we add the Soil Protection Directive to them it will create regulatory duplication - parallel legislation - that really only creates more bureaucracy.
We say we want to reduce bureaucracy by 25% by 2010, but this will only achieve the very opposite!
It will achieve a 25% increase.
In the Treaty, we undertook to regulate locally the things that could best be regulated at that level, and that is what we must do, and we must accelerate this.
The claim that the deterioration of soil is causing climate change is, however, unacceptable.
Scientists are unanimous that this deterioration is a result of climate change, and not the reason for it.
The rapporteur has certainly put a lot of work into this, but when we see that rules that are implemented by other directives have priority, that is unacceptable: we do not have top-priority directives and then lower-priority directives.
If we really want to achieve something, let us stick to the method of open coordination, transferring expertise from country to country.
That is the right approach and it will surely bring a result.
This Directive, on the other hand, brings only bureaucracy and confusing legislation.
(DE) Mr President, where is the added value?
Where is the justification for European regulations on soil protection?
The Commission's arguments concerning cross-border effects are rather artificial - at least from the ecological point of view.
Nor can I accept the argument that the internal market is distorted by different national soil protection legislation.
If the Commission really meant that, it would not present us with a framework directive, which accords the Member States the greatest possible self-determination in the definition of goals for soil protection.
That would increase the differences in soil protection legislation more than it would even them out.
Does not this approach reveal that the Commission is unsure as to how it should proceed in terms of subsidiarity when it comes to legislation for soil in specific locations?
In such a case, where we all wish for better soil protection, but national legislation differs, should we not first use the instrument of open coordination?
I believe so.
The Framework Directive takes the second step before the first.
We are missing out on the opportunity for countries without legislation to learn from countries with excellent soil-protection practices.
We shall also experience bureaucracy, particularly in those countries that already have tough legislation.
Why should they have to examine their entire country and define risk areas, even though they already have exemplary legislation?
We do not need this bureaucracy, nor do we need the gilt-edged soil-protection system that Europe is now demanding from us.
In closing, a comment on the argument that Parliament itself asked for this Directive years ago.
Yes, that was the case five years and more ago.
However, in the meantime we have had experience of the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive and many more.
As well, unlike the Commissioners, we are held accountable locally.
Therefore we do not hold fast to five-year and ten-year plans when businesses and local authorities on the ground are telling us that it is too much of a good thing.
I acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur to make the Directive less stringent, but bureaucracy is best avoided at source.
We still have the opportunity to do that by rejecting the Directive.
I hope that we give the Council a strong signal that it cannot expect its nations to accept this wave of bureaucracy.
The debate is closed.
The vote on the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon and the vote on the Prodi report on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (DE) In the light of the recent agreement on the Reform Treaty, the European Parliament, and with it the whole EU, must support and strengthen this renewed confirmation of a spirit of closeness to citizens and of the protection of subsidiarity, starting with the current initiatives.
The present proposal on the Soil Protection Framework Directive does not do justice to this intention.
The bureaucracy required in connection with it bears no relation to the actual usefulness of the Directive, and there is no way it can be justified to the citizens of Europe.
Quite the contrary, it runs counter to the decision of the European Council to reduce bureaucracy at EU level by 25% by 2012.
Soil is first and foremost a local resource.
Effective soil protection must, therefore, be carried out at the most suitable levels - at the regional or local level.
Only at these levels can the very wide range of soil characteristics be dealt with comprehensively.
Despite the extensive improvements made by the rapporteur, I reject this proposal, because it infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
Some Member States already have extremely good regulations, which could even be weakened by this Directive.
If necessary, the open-coordination method could provide a solution.
- (PL) Soil degradation is a fact.
One factor causing of this state of affairs is ... the common agricultural policy.
Self-sufficiency in foodstuffs has been achieved at the cost of the intensification of agriculture and degradation of the soil.
An increase in economic efficiency leads to the elimination of small and medium-sized farmers, the vast majority of whom are more environmentally friendly than large profit-oriented agricultural businesses.
This is the final call to slow down the process of abandoning farming and return to a rational and balanced agricultural model that protects the soil.
The current distribution of agricultural subsidies is, however, in conflict with this model.
Subsidies are directed above all to agricultural concerns and large intensive farms - 1.39% of beneficiaries receive almost 30% of subsidies!
The CAP must be amended.
Its main aim should be the production of healthy foods, not increased competitiveness.
Good soil should be a key element in this new policy.
That is why I support all actions that serve to protect the soil and restore its fertility.
Let us not compete with products originating from monocultures and intensive livestock rearing.
Let us say NO to cheap meat crammed with hormones.
Let us not compete with fruit that has little nutritional value, with cheap, low-quality wine or with GM foods, whose consequences we still know little about.
The European agricultural model should genuinely make us stand out in the world and be an example to it.
Amendment of Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (debate)
The next item is the report by Peter Liese, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community - C6-0011/2007 -
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular satisfaction to open today's discussion on the proposal to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, known as the ETS, within the Community.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts to date.
I should also like to thank the other three committees for their participation and their contribution to the discussion.
It has already become widely accepted that climate change is taking place and is being caused by human activity.
The measures we take over the next 10 years will determine whether we manage to bring the situation under control or let climate change reach levels so dangerous that it threatens the wellbeing and stability of our societies.
The EU has the capability, the resources and the will to lead the global effort to combat climate change.
This is the clear message that we will be delivering in a few weeks' time in Bali, where the Future International Action on Climate Change Network is to be discussed.
This opportunity has allowed all three bodies, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to set ambitious and binding targets for reducing emissions.
To achieve these targets, all sectors, including that of international air transport, must take their share of responsibility.
Until now, international air transport has been relatively favourably treated compared with other branches of the transport sector.
In terms of taxation and VAT, international air transport continues to enjoy privileges enjoyed when it was still a small, emerging economic sector after the Second World War.
In negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s, air and sea transport were exempted from targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
These targets affect only internal flights.
Now air transport has grown considerably, and it has become the cornerstone of globalisation, as it brings peoples and economies closer together.
The Commission fully recognises the importance of air transport for international trade and economic development.
On the other hand, the negative impact of air transport on the environment has begun to make itself felt, the dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions being a palpable example of this.
The contribution of air transport to global emissions of greenhouse gases is equivalent to the total emissions of the UK or Canada.
In the EU, CO2 emissions from aircraft are nearly double their 1990 total, and the forecast is for 150% growth by 2012.
We cannot of course allow this situation to continue without taking measures to combat it.
The air transport sector must also contribute to the fight against climate change, otherwise we shall be seeing air transport favoured over other branches of the economy which are already making significant efforts to reduce their emissions.
This is precisely why the Commission proposed in its communication in September 2005an overall approach to combating the impact of air transport on climate.
Our strategy is based on policies already applied by the Community, but it also strengthens and extends them.
Our current policies include research into new, cleaner technologies and further improvement in the air traffic management system in Europe through the Single European Sky and Clean Sky programmes.
Yet these measures alone are not enough; further action is needed, and for this reason, in December 2006, the Commission proposed that air transport should be included in the Community system for emission allowance trading.
This is the proposal we are discussing here today.
The Commission's approach is in two stages.
Firstly, from 2011, all flights within the EU will be included in the system.
In stage two, from 2012, all flights to and from EU airports will be covered.
We are starting with internal flights: this shows our willingness internationally to take the lead in this effort.
At the same time, we are exhorting our international partners to join the common endeavour.
At the last conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in September, we faced strong opposition from many third countries regarding our plans to include all aircraft in the trading system, regardless of nationality.
The reasons vary from country to country, but it became clear that the developing countries in particular believed we should begin at home before also applying the system to flights to and from their countries, and to their airlines.
As a result, we must show greater determination.
One of the main points of the proposal is that it must be applied to all airlines operating on the routes covered by the system, irrespective of their nationality, in order to avoid discrimination.
The proposal is in line with the Chicago Convention and the bilateral aviation agreements.
This position was supported by all 42 European states at the ICAO Conference.
Europe registered a formal reservation on this issue, thus allowing us room for manoeuvre.
The ambitiousness of the Commission's proposal can be gauged by its call to stabilise emissions at the 2004-2006 average.
Given the forecasts of rapid growth in air transport, this will have a considerable environmental effect.
In 2020 we will be saving a total of 183 million tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to twice Austria's current annual greenhouse gas emissions from all sources.
This means a 46% reduction in emissions compared with a situation whereby air transport would not have been included in the Community trading system.
As regards the allocation of emission rights to airlines, we propose a simple approach.
In the period before 2013, a percentage of the air transport emission rights will be made available by auction, in line with the percentage auctioned to other sectors.
The remainder will be distributed free of charge according to a benchmark, rewarding high-performance airlines.
From 2013, the proportion of allowances made available by auction must be in line with the proportion agreed in the general review of the ETS.
Lastly, the same harmonised benchmark methodology will continue to be applied to the distribution of the remainder.
Ladies and gentlemen, combating climate change is now the EU's highest priority.
The proposal under consideration concerns one of the most rapidly increasing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
It therefore symbolises the Union's resoluteness on this issue.
Through specific measures it seeks to control a difficult problem in a branch of the economy where effective policies have not hitherto been successfully developed.
Europe has a duty to play a leading role, but must do so in a way that does not provoke its international partners.
In view of the serious doubts expressed by many of them, we must both show our determination and adopt a sensible position.
The Commission firmly believes that the proposal we are considering tonight corresponds precisely to this need.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, almost everyone has realised that we must do something to prevent dramatic climate change.
Reports by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and by the former chief economist of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern, have made it clear that the cost of doing nothing is very much greater than the cost of doing something.
Sir Nicholas even said that, if climate change continues unchecked, this could have the same negative effects in economic terms as the two World Wars.
This example makes it clear that this is not a trivial matter or some line dreamt up by the Greens, but a matter of tangible economic interests and something that truly affects every individual.
It was, therefore, logical that the summit of EU Heads of State or Government in March decided that the European Union would reduce its emissions by at least 20% by 2020 and, if we reach an international agreement - which we do want to do - by 30%.
It is therefore inconsistent for a major area of the economy not to reduce emissions at all and instead let them continue to increase unchecked.
As the Commissioner said, aviation emissions have doubled since 1990.
It is a good thing, then, that the Commission has made a proposal to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector.
However, this proposal also has flaws, and I am certain that the European Parliament will address these tomorrow with numerous amendments.
I should like to thank all those who have made it possible for us to come to what I believe will be a satisfactory result tomorrow, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who was involved in the Hughes procedure, and all the participants from the other committees that provided an opinion.
Although some positions diverged, I think that we were agreed on many important points, and shall agree tomorrow when it comes to the vote.
We are agreed that we want one single starting date.
Both flights within Europe and intercontinental flights that take off or land in Europe should be included in the system on the same day.
This is essential for reasons of competitive neutrality, and also because two thirds of CO2 emissions come from intercontinental flights rather than flights within Europe.
Naturally, we must also speak with third countries, so the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety also adopted a motion that the Commission should continue to negotiate with third countries.
If we can then agree on common goals and a common approach that achieves just as much as the Commission proposal, then we should also enter into negotiations with third countries.
We are agreed - this is a second point that I should like to highlight - that we wish to auction a much larger proportion of allowances.
This is important for newcomers, but mainly to lessen the 'windfall profits' that are so prominent in the electricity sector.
Electricity prices have risen even though the allowances were distributed at no cost.
This is why a larger proportion must be auctioned off and the revenues given back to citizens in the form of lower taxes and charges on environmentally friendly transport; this is also what the committee decided.
We are agreed that the upper limit for emissions should be below 100%, because this is about reducing and not just stabilising CO2 levels.
In addition, the Committee on the Environment has decided to introduce a multiplier of two, in order to take nitrogen oxide emissions into account.
If the Commission makes a proposal - which is then adopted - as to an alternative way to deal with nitrogen oxides, then this multiplier can be dropped, but for now, we need it.
Furthermore, it is also very important to bring in an efficiency clause, and the Committee on the Environment has also decided on this.
The goals that the airlines set themselves for improving efficiency must be achieved, and the aviation industry must not be able to simply buy its way out.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow there will be some very close voting in some areas.
There are some points on which we do not all agree.
On behalf of my group - not as the rapporteur - I can say that the Committee on the Environment has gone too far at some points.
For example, we shall not support a cap of 75%, and we should still like to obtain relief for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of the report in any case, and I believe that Parliament as a whole will give a clear signal to the Council.
We should not be satisfied with merely formulating general goals to tackle climate change, but should also implement specific legislation.
We shall note with great interest whether the Council puts its words into action or whether it falls short of its own targets or even weakens the Commission proposal.
The European Parliament will not accept that.
(Applause)
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first like to offer my warmest thanks to the Commission for having dared to break the aviation taboo, without waiting for the IATA decisions, and I congratulate the rapporteur for having supported this.
As draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on just one point: the issue of competition.
You mentioned, Commissioner, that this directive removes an error in the regulations that favours other modes of transport over aviation.
That is an excellent point.
It should not be the case that the way it is applied ends up favouring certain companies over others.
Practically every one of us has, at least once this year, flown with an airline that did not exist three years ago.
We cannot therefore guarantee an income to the existing companies.
The greater the share allocated for distribution by auction, the better the competition will be.
Rapporteur for endorsement Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioners, dear colleagues, as rapporteur for the ITRE opinion, I can tell you that the directive has been intensively debated in our committee as well.
We have tried to find a balance, as correct as possible, between the necessary environmental protection actions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the necessary actions to assure the competitiveness of the European air industry and to establish equal treatment for all the airlines in the European Union.
I am glad to find proposals also made by the Committee on Industry in Mr. Liese's report, especially regarding the simultaneous inclusion into the trading system of greenhouse gas emission shares of all arrival and departure flights in the Community and the provision of access on the market for all newly-established airplane operators.
At the same time, I have to say that I regret the solution found for establishing the total quantity of shares to be periodically distributed to airplane operators.
The 2004-2006 reporting period, accompanied by the continuous periodic decrease of the total quantity of share, does not take into consideration the fact that the aviation sector is under full development in the new Member States, thus disadvantaging the airline operators in these countries and, at the same time, it could prevent a competitive development of the European aviation sector, according to the transport requirements brought about by the economic and social development of the European Union.
I appreciate that the variant voted by the ITRE Committee, which proposes 2008-2010 as a reference period, with the possibility to change the total quantity of shares in order to take into consideration the future developments in the sector, either increasing or decreasing, better defines the necessary framework for a correct competition between the airplane operators in the European Union and for the competitiveness of the overall European economy.
I hope the vote to take place this week will be as close as possible to the line adopted by the ITRE Committee.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the committees are unanimously of the opinion that the starting date for European airlines and airlines from other countries that fly into our region must be the same, for we must consider the competitiveness of our airlines.
Nevertheless, at the ICAO Conference we saw that the other countries opposed this.
In this respect, there is no point in having a double deadline.
In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, we believe that the deadline should be 2012.
Commissioner, you quite rightly pointed out that aviation was excluded according under the Kyoto Protocol.
In this respect, 2012 is the correct year, because this allows the best chance of convincing third countries to participate after all.
It provides enough time for them to join our system or to set up an equivalent system.
We cannot accept your leading role and that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which goes even further and wants to see 2010, because this completely overlooks the global dimension of aviation, the nature of the competition between airlines.
We cannot disadvantage our airports, our airlines and employees in this area.
Therefore, the best acceptable time would be 2011, but the date must apply to all airlines.
Furthermore, we must strike a balance.
We want to reduce the effects on the climate of aviation, but we must also keep in mind the competitiveness of our airlines, and consider the airports and passengers - especially those from remote areas - and keep prices affordable for them.
We therefore advocate achieving a reference period soon, and having a sensible percentage for the allocation of allowances - the Committee on Transport was in favour of 110, but just under 100 would also be feasible - and a sensible percentage for the auction.
There is one thing we must not do: we must not make it too expensive for our passengers in Europe from more remote areas to travel by air - so, please, let us have a gentle introduction to emissions trading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Mr Liese has produced an excellent report.
Nevertheless, as PPE-DE Group shadow on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I support my group's amendments, which seek what we think is a better balance between wish and reality.
In my view, the emissions trading scheme is the most cost-efficient, demand-sensitive and objective market-based instrument available for reaching Europe's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 20% by 2020.
The aviation sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is growing fast, and I therefore fully support its inclusion in the emissions trading scheme.
We must have a single start date.
I think 2011 is a reasonable compromise between the different dates we have before us.
And with this, Europe will lead the way strongly for the rest of the world.
The amount of allowances allocated by auctioning should be set at a reasonably high and increasing level, in order to avoid the disadvantages for competition which are associated with grandfathering and benchmarking.
Auctioning is much more economically efficient; it encourages new entrants, innovation, and the reduction of emissions through technological and operational improvements.
The revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances should be reinvested in R&D in the aviation industry.
There is much potential for technological innovation, to reduce the sector's CO2 emissions.
Furthermore, the single European sky, which the Commission mentioned, when fully implemented will reduce CO2 emissions by up to 12%, and this should be put into operation with urgency.
In our amendments we have highlighted the importance of giving special consideration to remote and isolated regions.
Now we can only hope that the Council will respond positively to Parliament's insistent wake-up call.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his fair and constructive cooperation over the last few months.
The inclusion of aviation in emissions trading is the first legislative procedure after the Spring Summit, at which the Heads of State or Government set some ambitious goals.
We in the European Parliament have also put the topic right at the top of our political agenda by setting up the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.
Experts and climate researchers have reminded us in hearings in the Committee on Climate Change that we must reverse the trend in CO2 emissions in the next 8 to 10 years.
After that, emissions must not increase any further; instead, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced so that global warming can be kept to less than two degrees.
The starting date of 1 January 2010 that was voted on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has central significance.
We need to have 2010 as the starting date because there is no time to waste in combating climate change and the 'braking distance' in climate change matters is very long and increases with the passing of time.
As far as the Commission draft is concerned, that is, the distinction between flights within Europe and intercontinental flights, I must say that I am very glad - Mr Jarzembowski mentioned this - that we in Parliament are agreed that we want one single starting date.
As well as the time-related components, the upper limit for the emissions allowances to be issued is very significant.
Here we need to proceed realistically and be ambitious.
Capping emissions from aviation at 80% of the 2004-2006 figure is a good and fair approach.
This capping is necessary so that the 87% increase from aviation between 1990 and 2004 does not undermine the reduction in other industrial sectors.
To ensure that allowances fetch an appropriate price so that the emissions trading scheme can be effective, the proportion of allowances to be auctioned off must be much higher than the Commission has proposed.
Therefore, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament suggests increasing the proportion of emissions allowances to be auctioned to 25%.
As far as revenues from auctioning off the allowances are concerned, the Member States should use these for measures to adjust to climate change and for the fight against climate change, both within and outside the European Union.
Another important matter: all aircraft upwards of a take-off weight of 5.7 tonnes must be included in the emissions trading scheme.
Tomorrow we shall vote on an amendment that provides for only aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of more than 20 tonnes to be included.
Our aim must not be to leave business jets out of the emissions trading scheme while fully including aircraft carrying holidaymakers.
I should like to think that tomorrow we shall be bold in moving towards more climate protection, and I hope that tomorrow we shall set it in motion.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my thanks in the first instance to the two rapporteurs on this topic, Mr Liese and Mr Jarzembowski, who evidently did not always have a smooth ride together on this topic.
Together with investment in new technologies and the creation of further infrastructure, emissions trading can make an important contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions in aviation.
In doing so, emissions trading must allow growth rather than hindering it.
It should provide incentives to renew fleets and create more efficient, more modern aircraft.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is making the case for including all airlines in a single starting date of 2011.
In our view, the emissions from 2004-2006 should serve as a basis.
This rewards those airlines that have updated and modernised their fleet in the past.
My group proposes setting the cap at 90%.
This is ambitious, more ambitious than the Commission's proposal, but not excessive.
A maximum of 30% of the allowances should be auctioned off, in our opinion, to make it easier for new operators to enter the market.
The revenues from the auction should primarily be used by the aviation sector to reduce emissions.
We are also in favour of increasing the take-off weight to 20 tonnes, because we want to keep the bureaucratic hurdles for small operators to a minimum.
I make the case for including aviation in a trading system that is as open and efficient as possible.
Limiting how credits can be used makes no sense ecologically.
Just as every gram of CO2 emitted must be regarded in the same way, the reduction of emissions, too, has the same effect everywhere.
There are good economic reasons for unlimited, flexible access to credits if emissions can be reduced elsewhere less expensively.
Aviation is vitally important to Europe's economic growth.
Globalisation is unthinkable without airlines that are competitive.
In future, people will want to fly more, not less, not only in Europe but also, in particular, to other parts of the world; we have to acknowledge this.
The EU is single-handedly deciding to include aviation in emissions trading and is making both friends and enemies internationally in the process.
If we Europeans want to lead the way in climate politics, we have to ask ourselves not only how far we should go but also how we can take everyone else with us.
This question will come up again in Bali.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to distance ourselves from insular EU solutions in climate policy.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President.
Greenhouse gas emission trading is the correct response for reducing gas emissions in aviation.
However we need to carefully evaluate the terms for introducing quotas in order to avoid distortion of competition for the Member States' aviation companies and EU residents' travel opportunities.
The majority of air carriers in the new EU Member States are lagging far behind the aviation companies in the older Member States, in terms of both the number of passengers carried and greenhouse gas emission volumes per capita.
It is difficult to evaluate the extent of the future growth of air carriers in the new EU Member States, but I am in no doubt that in order to balance the mobility indicators for residents of the Member States, transport volumes in the newer Member States must grow significantly.
It will hamper the equalisation of EU residents' mobility if terms are not laid down in the rules for greenhouse gas emission trading to specify how rapidly growing aviation companies will be able to continue their growth, so that the resources spent on the acquisition of emission quotas do not act as a brake on their development.
Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has supported the proposal to create a reserve for new aircraft operators, and this is the right approach.
However, in order to ensure that aircraft operators with varying initial positions and growth trends, are treated equally, we ought to reserve part of the quotas for aircraft operators with rapidly growing capacity.
Growth that exceeds the average EU annual rate of growth in passenger numbers by a factor of at least two could be taken as an indicator of rapid growth in capacity.
Both of these proposals are vital for fostering competition in the EU air carrier industry.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Liese for his excellent cooperation and congratulate him on his work.
However, I have to say that I appreciated his work a lot more before he had to seek compromises within his political group, which, if adopted, would substantially weaken the position taken by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety just last month.
That matters, because we have to substantially strengthen the Commission's original proposal if we are to have any real chance of seriously reducing the impact of aviation on our climate.
According to the Commission's own figures, all its proposals are currently going to achieve is that, by 2020, instead of aviation emissions growing by 83% under a do-nothing scenario, they would grow instead by 78%.
That reduction is the equivalent of less than one year's growth in air travel.
That is not serious, it is not ambitious, it is not global leadership.
To achieve emission reductions via trading relies crucially on scarcity of permits.
Since aviation emissions have already doubled since 1990, to call for an initial allocation equivalent to average emissions over the period 2004-2006, or even 80-90% of that, is simply too generous.
I therefore urge you to support my Group's amendments for an initial allocation that is 50% of that amount.
We also need 100% auctioning so that there are no windfall profits at the expense of the passenger.
