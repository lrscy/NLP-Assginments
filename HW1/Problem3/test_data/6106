I think, however, that we must go further.
That is why I propose establishing next year an action plan for aid effectiveness which we would apply, as a priority, in sub-Saharan Africa.
This action plan will contain practical tools once, for example, an operational and interactive atlas of EU donors has been created, national âroad mapsâ harmonised, joint programming documents adopted and common procedures drawn up.
Some might consider this initiative to be a departure from the norm.
In fact, it is only a matter of applying what we have all already decided on.
I also think that the European Union should broaden its budgetary support both generally and on a sectoral basis.
That would not only make EU aid more transparent and predictable and give it more continuity, but would also give the EU much more collective influence through the action it takes.
For the first time, the European Union finally possesses a global and integrated framework for its different policies for administering its relations with Africa.
As I have already said on several occasions in this very Chamber, priority will be given to sub-Saharan Africa in applying all the decisions we have taken in terms of increasing the quantity, quality, effectiveness and coherence of aid.
Let us return to the subject of coherence.
Until now, policies on Africa governing trade, security, the environment and what is referred to as development coexisted as best they could.
It has to be said that these policies were not always articulated and were even contradictory sometimes.
For example, European security policy has for a long time coexisted with its development policy, sometimes to no good effect.
Recent experience â and I am thinking in particular of opportunities for peace in Africa â show how security and development are intimately linked and how important it is for European policies in these areas to be tightly coordinated.
Honourable Members, the central objective of the European Union strategy for Africa is to make it easier to achieve the United Nationsâ Millennium Development Goals in Africa.
In my opinion, these need to be our points of departure and of reference.


That is why the Commission proposes a triple strategy: firstly, to reinforce policies in those areas â for example, peace and security and good governance - considered to be those in which preliminary conditions have to be met in order for the development goals to be achieved; secondly, to reinforce the policies â for example, on trade, development of the private sector and the connection between the two - that create the economic environment necessary for achieving these goals; and, finally, to strengthen policies in the areas directly linked to the development goals, such as health, education, employment and the environment.
Together, these measures constitute a joint, global and coherent response by the European Union to the challenge of African development.
These measures are ambitious and are obviously very wide-ranging indeed but, in order fundamentally to change the course of history, we need to do more: we need to clarify our basic approach, the spirit of our relations and, perhaps also sometimes, our mentality.
That is why the communication proposes adapting the principles governing relations between Europe and Africa to a new African and European reality.
In order to do this, three key principles have to be applied: equality, appropriation and dialogue.
We shall have to replace culpability and charity as determining factors in our partnership.
First principle: equality.
The emergence of the African Union and the regional economic communities, on the one hand, and the consolidation of European integration, on the other, have created a more symmetrical and more equal institutional framework.
Europe has more to offer than development aid.
It has a unique experience of integration, dialogue and the construction of supranational political institutions, despite the fact that integration has sometimes been slow and has never been easy.
Second principle: partnership.
The European Union and Africa share the same values and the same objectives.
We believe in a much more multilateral world order, fairer development and the promotion of diversity.
More than ever, our two continents must be strategic allies within the international community.
Third principle: appropriation.
Development policies and strategies cannot be imposed from the outside.
The African Unionâs and NEPADâs vision of good governance, democracy and respect for human rights deserves the European Unionâs support.
This purely African initiative has brought a new dimension to the concept of appropriation as a basis for dialogue and cooperation with each country and region and with the continent as a whole.
The very wording of the strategy for Africa is the prime example of the way in which these three principles should be applied.
I should also like to thank the regional organisations and the African Union for their exhaustive, constructive and judicious contribution to drawing up the document.
Too often, strategies were prepared âin relation toâ or âforâ our African partners, rather than with them.
Honourable Members, in requesting, almost a year ago, the portfolio of European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, I was well aware that Africa would remain central to my action and commitment.
I cannot conceal from you my satisfaction in seeing today that the entire European Commission has committed itself to this same effort.
The joint meeting with the Commission of the African Union has shown just how motivated and committed my colleagues are.
Europe now has an unprecedented opportunity to put a new partnership between the African and European continents in place.
The Commission is presenting you with a plan, a vision and a coherent and integrated set of practical and ambitious proposals.
It is now up to yourselves as Members of the European Parliament and of the Council to assume your responsibilities.
Five years after the Cairo Summit, I think that the moment has come to convert our dialogue into action.
We must work together in order to break the current deadlock and allow the Lisbon Summit to be held.
A Lisbon Summit crowned with success will be a moment of great symbolic value in which we shall confirm the ever closer partnership between our two continents and in which we shall conclude a new and ambitious Euro-African pact.
Â Â  . Commissioner, I am aware of the high level to which you are involved in this topic.
I think we should be pleased with a communication that proposes a long-term strategy to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in Africa.
That is positive, and it is a sound initiative.
What is needed to get sub-Saharan Africa on track is an ambitious plan.
Mr President, I should first of all like to comment on the procedure, which is, in fact, dreadful.
The Commission presented the report today and values Parliamentâs contribution, but if we want to make a contribution in time and present a position, we have already missed the boat for amendments.
That is not an ideal situation.
Another tricky subject is that I have received complaints about the communication with the Africans.
That should actually be impossible, and I am therefore curious as to how the report accommodates the 23 priorities formulated by the African Union itself.
As has already been stated, a new strategy for Africa is urgently needed.
Poverty is at its worst there, and growing.
Much aid has already been given, but too little has been achieved.
Whilst the report clearly pinpoints the problems and suggests helpful solutions, it cannot convince me that, as the Commissioner often tells us, this new strategy enables more to be done more effectively and more quickly, not least because of the expectations of our own European functioning.
As the Commissioner said, coherence and coordination of our own policy are vital if we want to increase effectiveness.
I doubt whether this new strategy really offers the right instruments for this.
Much, however, will also depend on the political will of the Member States and of those responsible within the Commission.
As far as Africa is concerned, the Commission rightly refers to Africaâs versatility and the need for the African states to accept ownership.
The primary responsibility is theirs.
With regard to the strategy, the Commission does not draw sufficient distinction between the so-called stable states and the fragile states.
Ownership is desirable in both cases.
We in the European Union, though, will need to use a different set of instruments in both cases; hence the plea, in my report, for a dual approach.
It is right and proper that the Commissioner should mention the Millennium Development Goals as our starting point and our ultimate goal.
That is why I am surprised at a number of proposals, for example where major infrastructural projects are concerned, exchanges between universities or the Nyerere or Erasmus programme.
Whilst they are fine ideas, I cannot quite follow them where they concern priorities in the fight against poverty.
My time is up.
I am relying on the Commissioner, whom I would also like to thank for his involvement.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the new strategy for Africa proposed by the Commission deserves this Parliamentâs support.
It is true that for the first time we are being asked to tackle the issue of development in Africa on a multitude of interconnected levels, in a long-term plan.
Let us hope that at the European Council in December this innovative approach receives resolute backing from the EUâs governments.
Anyway, we all know that in order to meet the majority of the Millennium Goals, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, focused commitment on development aid and a properly complementary approach to all kinds of intervention are needed.
Not only should the quantity of aid be increased â here I agree with Commissioner Michel â but far greater efficiency also needs to be achieved.
That can only happen within a context of European consensus, which can place every bilateral relation within an overall coherent framework.
Naturally, it is within this context that there are the greatest difficulties, since the old vices of national interest are always liable to prevail over the virtues of a single European strategy.
I believe it is even more important to place aid and development policies, over and above national interests â and I would like to draw the Commissionâs attention to this point â under the principle of ownership, including budget aid: the Africans should be placed in a position to be able to build their own future and to assume full responsibility for it.
One of these conditions, however, is a fairer global trade system, and here we can see a test shaping up for Europe, a test for Parliament and for the Commission: development policy cannot be separated from policy on the world trade system.
I hope that Europe will be able to play its role to the full at the next Hong Kong Conference, particularly with regard to issues that are decisive for the ownership of development policies by the African continent, such as the issue of duties, tariffs and export subsidies.
Finally, I would like to add that a special mission falls to this Parliament, in the face of European public opinion that is often apt to think that the situation in Africa is desperate.
That is not the case and we should make it clear: Africa is a resource for us too.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we are clearly talking about economic and social development here and not about cultural or spiritual development: Africa has no need whatsoever of us for that; it could even teach us a thing or two.
We have therefore set Millennium Development Goals.
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that these goals must not be seen as sacrosanct, because if, by any chance, we do not achieve them, there will be a sense of desperation and failure and we will be back to square one, which will be an extremely harmful outcome.
The formula for development is fairly well-known.
Let us be humble, however, and point out firstly that, while public aid is undoubtedly a lever for development, the effect it has is miniscule in comparison to what private sector funds could do to develop Africa and, secondly, that we must be wary of tackling Africa, complex as it is, with simple ideas.
That being said, it is not a useless exercise to point out some fundamental factors.
Infrastructure is one of these factors.
There is no doubt that we require road, port and airport infrastructure, communication infrastructure and health care infrastructure.
Then comes security, and by that I mean the security of goods and persons, legal certainty, judicial security and banking security.
Finally, a State is required: a State that undertakes its sovereign duties, pays its government officials and stands shoulder to shoulder with a civil society.
We must therefore be the guardians of these fundamental factors.
I am keen to emphasise the quality of your communication, Commissioner, which exploits all of the EUâs resources. What it amounts to is an excellent diagnosis and a very good prescription, which says that the patient must continue with his treatment but that care must be taken that, having been cured, he does not then die.
Money is not enough to prevent this from happening.
It is not enough to mobilise funds.
Africa must help itself.
For our part, we must firstly have confidence in the institutions with which Africa is providing itself.
Secondly, our policies must be coherent and coordinated.
Thirdly, Africa must apply its own prescriptions, and by that I am referring, in particular, to the diagnosis provided by NEPAD.
Finally, my fourth point is that the money is there, so let us stop casting blame.
The shift from 0.31% to 0.5% equates to EURÂ 20Â billion: half of this amount will be devoted to Africa, which is a sum of EURÂ 10Â billion. EURÂ 10Â billion equates to one annual EDF funding allocation â the EDF receives EURÂ 13Â billion for five years.
We will thus be able to provide EURÂ 10Â billion in funding each year for Africa.
With the existing procedures and channels as they stand, it is impossible to invest and to spend these funds.
This is demonstrated by the sum remaining of the EDF.
Therefore, we must review our budgetary instruments for aid.
Furthermore, I believe that we must not view budgetary support as a cure-all, without introducing an extremely strict control and monitoring procedure.
Â Â  . Mr President, if this new EU strategy were really adding value to existing programmes and polices, my group would support it.
Africa urgently needs our strong support, including technology transfer, debt cancellation, resources for development and fair terms of trade delivered in a coherent way.
I hope this strategy will deliver greater coherence and added value.
However, I am not convinced, not least because it does not evaluate the impact of our past policies and does not foresee any additional financial instrument to deliver better policies in the future.
What it offers is more of the same failed policies, because the shocking fact is that the number of people living in poverty in Africa continues to grow.
What we need from the Commission is not a change of documents, but a change of policy, in particular trade policy, which continues to undermine Africaâs development potential.
On economic partnership agreements, ACP countries must have the guarantee of continued non-reciprocal access if they choose it.
At the World Trade Organization, the Commission must ensure that negotiations on non-agricultural market access take into full account the needs of African countries to protect their infant industries.
On commodity prices, we must have action to reverse declining commodity prices.
On services, the Commission must abandon its new benchmarking proposal that would force poorer countries to open their service sectors, in complete contradiction to what the Commission has guaranteed in the past about flexibility on services.
On agriculture, of course, we need a complete end to export dumping, as well as support to African countries, to enable them to protect their agriculture up to the point of self-sufficiency.
The agenda of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation has failed to deliver growth or poverty eradication.
A new strategy must be based on new values: the values of fair trade and cooperation, rather than free trade and more competition.
That is what we need to see from the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I share MrÂ Michelâs sorrow concerning the deaths of the two African Union soldiers in Darfur.
In my view this is another example of how we often concentrate on particular issues that we then abandon.
I must however say that I should also have liked to hear a mention of the movement in the past few days of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa, who encounter fences and barbed wire and often rubber or indeed real bullets, and of those who wander through the desert without food.
In my opinion, the issue of immigration will have to be closely linked to the problems of development.
I regard the work carried out by the Commission, especially MrÂ Michel, as being of paramount importance.
As Mr Zani has already emphasised, I think it is essential to achieve coordination of development policies, not only as far as Africa is concerned but also in general.
That being so, I strongly believe that the Council, Parliament and the Commission must work in unison, since in reality â as MrÂ Zani has noted â it is very often the Member States that have the upper hand.
Given that the European Union is not the only major aid donor in Africa, the presence and the policies of such international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should also be reinforced.
Their decisions have considerable impact on the lives of indigenous peoples and on the Millennium Development Goals.
As we have seen, debt cancellation is essential, though for the debtor countries it has been in reality only a first step.
We must therefore also ensure that, within the framework of this new policy, we strive for a different definition of debt sustainability.
The financial requirements of African countries must also be taken into consideration as an essential element.
As is pointed out in the document in question, it would also be opportune to involve civil society and national parliaments more closely in putting together the country strategy paper.
MrÂ Michel has mentioned peace, security and good government.
The security issue must, however, be understood as pertaining to human security as well, not simply to the tragedies that have followed 11 September.
Above all, I believe that our policies should consider a form of peace and security that, for example, accords with the definitions of official development assistance.
Very often we ourselves are responsible for the conflicts in Africa, above all bearing in mind that we continue to sell arms.
This is therefore another area in which there must be very strict controls.
Other Members have mentioned trade, which is certainly a fundamental instrument but which must not be confined solely to aid for trade: it must be equally fair to both parties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to welcome Commissioner Michel here this afternoon.
I listened with interest to his speech and I support many of the things he said.
The European Union plays a pivotal role in the area of development, providing 55% of world development aid, most of which goes to Africa.
During the United Nations summit in New York in September 2005, the EU strongly affirmed its will to contribute to the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals.
The first of these ambitious eight goals is the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger.
Halving world poverty between now and 2015 is a major challenge that faces us in the years to come.
There can be no question of the EUâs commitment to Africa and to the eradication of poverty.
However, there is a severe lack of consolidated information on what we donors actually do in Africa.
How sure is the European Union of the effectiveness and efficiency of its aid?
I welcome the Commissioner saying that he intends to put in place an action plan on aid efficiency.
The European Union donates more to Africa than any other institution or government in the world.
Yet corruption steals so much of what we give to those who need it most.
Donating vast sums of money is admirable, but it carries with it responsibilities: a responsibility on the part of the donor â ultimately you and I â and a responsibility on the part of the recipients, in this case Africa.
There is an acute need for ownership, responsibility, accountability and leadership to be developed among the ruling governments and countries of Africa.
The European Union needs to take a clinical approach to promoting good governance.
The overriding objective of poverty reduction is based on the complementary aim of promoting good governance and respect for human rights.
We need to reward the African countries that acknowledge the concept of democracy and respect for human rights and we must continue condemning corrupt regimes which are slowly but surely destroying their countries.
Â Â  â Commissioner, as well as listening intently to your speech here, I carefully read the communication that I believe the Commission adopted this morning, and I should like to begin by congratulating you.
You managed to use simple language, and to bring back to the table well-known but dispersed concepts, instruments that are either tried and tested or in the pipeline, and objectives that are clear to everybody, namely the Millennium Development Goals.
You rejected sensationalism and headline-grabbing in favour of a coherent, simple approach, which I must say is a rare commodity in circumstances such as these.
Consequently, Commissioner, aware as I am of the difficulties of the post, I would say to you that your approach to the problem does you credit, and, as far as I am concerned, it has meant that I give you not just the benefit of the doubt, but also my backing.
I trust you will continue to work on the basis of workable, effective and simple solutions, because this is the best way forward for the policy of cooperation between the EU and Africa.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the horrendous incidents of recent weeks, with hundreds of Africans hurling themselves in their droves in an attempt to get from Morocco into Ceuta and Melilla, have shocked public opinion.
This is nothing new; for years we have been witnessing the desperation that forces these men and women to risk their lives in order to enter Europe, or rather in order to escape Africa, despite the fact that Africa is their land.
Throughout this time we have been witnessing the rafts unloading African men and women on our coasts, and many bodies have been washed up there, having been swallowed up by the sea during their dramatic adventure.
We now have the impression that this may not be something that involves hundreds or thousands of people, but that desperation could mobilise millions of people who have nothing to lose and who will stop at nothing in their quest for survival.
The fact that the world is organised in an immensely unjust manner, with increasing inequalities between the industrialised North and the under-developed South, and that that will inevitably have explosive consequences, is no longer something that is just stated by a few of us pioneers in world society: something that was being dealt with by specialists is now on the agenda of the generalists.
But this is not a time for anticipating a crisis: the crisis is blowing up in our faces and has caught us without any clear idea of how to react.
The strategy for Africa proposed by the Commission and the effort proposed by the British Presidency could respond to the need to react in the face of an issue about which the only clear thing is that we are facing a European problem for which that very European dimension is the only solution, the Union dimension, combined with that of the Member States.
The development of Africa is vital for Africa, but also for Europe.
The Commissionâs communication is being presented, and it should be called âThe European strategy for the development of Africaâ.
There is no question that it is late in coming, but better late then never.
What is being proposed to us seems to us to be sufficiently ambitious, but not sufficiently precise, and also long and, above all, complicated to organise; in any event, it is a step in the right direction.
Let us hope that amongst all of us, and in particular here in the European Parliament, we are able to make the process as wide-ranging and specific as I believe it needs to be, supporting the good intentions of the Commission.
It will also be essential to deal with the issue sufficiently quickly so that we can respond to an immense emergency which, furthermore, calls into question the credibility of the European Union and its ability to act in a manner that is consistent with its principles.
Â Â  â Africa still accounts for only 2% of world trade â less than it was 50 years ago.
Are the trade agreements unscrupulous, or does Africa have nothing to trade?
In the past 20 years, poverty in Africa has doubled.
Africa has been unable to take advantage of the trade liberalisation opportunities we boast so much about.
The EU and its Member States give developing countries aid from the budget and the European Development Fund.
European Development Fund aid alone amounts to EUR 13.5 billion.
What is the effectiveness of this aid if it does not reduce but rather increases poverty?
Investing in developing economies to rekindle and develop them is one of the most important ways of fighting poverty.
Where are donor countries investing in if trade is decreasing and poverty increasing?
I call on the European Commission to assess the effectiveness of the aid given to developing countries, and I call on Member States that historically had interests in Africa and other countries to invest in and support those countries by establishing independent economies there, investing in sectors, creating jobs, using their natural and human resources rationally and honestly, and trading fairly.
As well as supporting Africa financially, let us give Africa the opportunity to make its own contribution in building its future and prosperity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Commissioner.
I believe we are all delighted that there is now such a sharp focus â both political and, happily, also economic â on Africa.
Unquestionably, quite extraordinary efforts are needed if Africa is to be lifted out of poverty, and it is therefore appropriate for the EU to prepare an overall strategy on our relations with Africa.
The Commissionâs proposal contains a lot that is good.
Concerns for the environment, good governance, women and equality, peace-making, trade and the strengthening of the private sector have been crucial in taking developments forward, although I could have done with hearing a bit more about them in the Commissionerâs speech.
However, an extremely alarming proposal was also put forward for more centralised planning in connection with EU aid to Africa using, for example, donor atlases, as if we in Europe could sit and make plans about the way in which aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries.
That is directly contrary to the principles of aid effectiveness and sound donor behaviour on which the EU helped decide at the Paris High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in March of this year.
The African countries should be at the centre of aid coordination, proceeding on the basis of their own strategies to combat poverty.
If we scrap everything we have achieved in this area in order to speak with one voice as part of a top-down strategy, what we are in danger of seeing, instead of a competently conducted fight against poverty, is a whole caravan of white elephants invade the African continent.
I should like to ask the Commission what basically is the meaning of the four points in paragraph 3.3 and whether these contradict what we have said so far, namely that it must be the countriesâ own poverty strategies that form the basis for our work.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Africa is an unfortunate continent.
It has been going steadily downhill for the last 30 years.
Unfortunately, I found the Commissionerâs statement rather unhelpful.
We heard a lot about coherence, strategies and progress but very little, if anything, about practical details.
Economic development is sorely needed, but for it to come about international capital must put an end to its agreements with corrupt local authorities.
This is particularly important as international capital tends to be supported by its countries of origin, which is most undesirable.
If real progress is to be achieved in Africa, it is necessary first to develop a local economy that works well for the local population and is based on it.
Secondly, there is education, education and education.
Europe is hardly doing anything in this regard, but could be doing a great deal.
Then there is the matter of combating diseases.
Emergency assistance is needed at once in order to combat diseases effectively and combat hunger.
As previous speakers have already said, the European Union must put an end to agricultural dumping if it genuinely wishes to support the local economy, especially agriculture.
Â Â  Mr President, I liked what I heard in the Commissionerâs speech. One thing in particular was the theme of respect and partnership; respect for the people of Africa and partnership with them.
I would start by saying that if you talk to people from Africa, they say âtoo often you in Europe only talk about drought and famine and all the bad things about Africa, why do you not sometimes celebrate the good things about Africa?â.
I think that is what the Commissioner was doing.
It is what we should do. We should draw out the talents of Africans.
We should build on the resources of Africa.
I very much welcome the Commissionerâs contribution and the communication.
Clearly the Millennium Development Goals are fundamental to this.
I would like to see even more emphasis on health and education; they were certainly highlighted in his speech, although they take a bit of finding.
We went through peace, security, good governance, economic growth, trade and interconnection â whatever that means â before we got there.
I am sure those things are all fundamentally important, but so too are health and education.
As a small example the twinning partnerships are highlighted.
Yes, twinning partnerships are good: we have them recommended for schools and towns and even museums, why not for hospitals too?
Why not for teaching hospitals, why not for health teams and NGOs in the health field?
I would like to see and hear more about the Commissionerâs previous commitments to me on neglected diseases and the reports we have brought through Parliament in the past.
There is so much more to be done on that.
I would like finally to highlight one thing which has come from Africa itself, and that is its first food safety plan.
We all often call for people to help Africa to make its food safe and secure; here they are doing something about it.
However, if I just cite one figure: the failure to meet new food standards that came from the European Union in 2001 resulted in a 64% drop in exports from Africa of cereals, dried fruit and nuts â a loss of USD 670Â million.
That is just one example of why we need to work with Africa to use its talents to help Africans help themselves.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to focus on how I think we, as Europeans, should put our own house in order.
First of all, on trade, it is essential to end the subsidies to farmers in Europe which keep prices low and squeeze African commodities out of our markets, as well as the export subsidies that allow cheap food to be dumped in Africa.
High tariffs, keeping out African goods, need to be cut, but African countries need time before opening up their markets.
They do not have in place those safety nets, which we might have, to protect their workforce.
In addition, we need to urge Member States to sign up to the UN Convention on Corruption.
Member States should be held responsible for corrupt practices by their own staff and agents.
That does not appear in the report and I think it is something that Member States like my own should be urged to sign up to.
Since 9/11 there has been a tightening up on corruption, but it is still not treated with the same seriousness as terrorism or drugs.
It also necessary for Europe to stop encouraging the brain-drain from Africa.
This is not on the report either, but it makes an enormous difference, particularly in health services in Africa.
Finally, I turn to the arms trade, which nobody has mentioned.
The arms and mines which are killing thousands of people and have done so in Africa over generations were mostly made in the Soviet Union.
As we know, however, they are traded, dealt with and circulated around Europe.
They are based in Europe.
We must, as Europeans, do far more to control arms brokering and the transit trade which takes place from our own continent.
These are responsibilities that we must take as Europeans and we must not try to place the onus of responsibility simply on Africans.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrsÂ Kinnock is right.
Africa does not need more weapons.
The strategy shows that more needs to be done.
Development policy will never succeed if it is sabotaged by trade policy.
I also wish to caution against exaggerated confidence that foreign capital and companies will solve Africaâs problems. We must support the development of locally owned industry whose profits stay in Africa.
It is important for them to be given complete freedom to choose the ways in which they wish to develop, free from pressure and the forced opening up of markets.
They must themselves decide what is in their interests.
A coherent strategy involving trade, development cooperation and support for democracy is required in order to give Africa that opportunity.
That also applies to our research policy.
I would ask you to support the demands for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research to be used to increase research into the quite forgotten tropical diseases which kill millions of people each year.
Â Â  Mr President, the only way for Africa to achieve lasting success is for it to be supported by us in carving out a future for itself.
By the same token, even the best aid programmes will be of no use if we do not help people there to help themselves, or if we fail to embed democracy and the rule of law there in such a manner that they are not fragile plants but can put down strong roots; what matters is that we should enable Africans to have a hand in shaping their own destiny and to take responsibility for how they do that.
It is, as I see it, a disgrace that it is the most mobile who attempt to flee Africa, and that we are not making it possible for them, in the places from which they come, to make their mark on society and to advance it.
It will not be possible for them to do any of these things unless we concentrate on âeducation, education, educationâ, particularly, I think, the education of young girls and women.
The longer we send girls to school and the more developed and educated they become, not only will they be better able to bring up their children, but they will also have children at a later age, and that is a significant element in a society moving forward.
We need to concentrate our strengths; a policy in which the left hand does not know what the right is doing must be a thing of the past, and, most of all, we need a policy of optimism, and it is with that in mind that I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his paper, and on the confidence to which it gives voice.
I do know, though, that, even with combined strengths, it will take a long time before Africa is where we would like it to be, and, on the way there, we must try to help Africa to avoid making all the mistakes that we made in the course of our history.
They are welcome to derive some benefit from our experience.
Â Â  â Ceuta and Melilla demonstrate that, regardless of the rhetoric, Europeâs strategy towards Africa is failing.
This is not a problem just for Spain and Morocco, and nor must it be seen purely from the perspective of controlling illegal migration.
This is a problem for the entire Union and undermines our credibility on the issue of human rights.
I welcome the words of Mr Michel, who rightly said that what we need is a coherent strategy for Africa; a strategy that enhances the effectiveness of our development policy and enables us to fulfil the Millennium Goals.
If this strategy is to be achieved, it must be properly catered for in the Unionâs budget, the Commission and the Member States must work more closely together, fair trade must be promoted and, in turn, the common agricultural policy must be reviewed, in light of the devastating impact that it has had on developing countries.
It entails combating corruption, and that is something that must work both ways.
We need a strategy that puts the EU at the forefront of implementing the new concept of the responsibility to protect, which enhances the Unionâs ability to maintain and build peace, in conjunction with the African Union.
An integral part of this strategy is fighting against the impunity of those responsible for crimes against humanity, by making use of the International Criminal Court and other courts.
There are impending test cases such as those of HissÃšne HabrÃ©, Charles Taylor and the perpetrators of Darfur.
We need a Union that provides more practical support for electoral processes, civil society, NGOs, democratic institutions, the empowerment of women and good governance in Africa.
Lastly, we need a European Union that promotes worldwide peace and security, and that stops terrorism in its tracks in Africa.
The underlying causes of terrorism must be addressed, along with, once and for all, arms proliferation in the African continent, that is, arms exports from Europe as well as from elsewhere, which are fuelling the conflicts that are destroying Africa.
Ceuta, Melilla and Lampedusa raise serious questions about security in Africa and our security.
The migrants and refugees who are fleeing are doing so because they are desperate, and they are desperate partly due to Europeâs silence and intransigence, the conflict in Western Sahara being a case in point.
This is the same despair and anger that fans the flames of international terrorism, whose recruits manage to find a way into Europe, however high the continent builds the walls at its borders.
Â Â  I should like, Commissioner, to speak about the issue of energy and energy policies, which do not seem to me to have been dealt with in sufficient depth in your text.
In fact, within the resolution on oil dependency adopted by the European Parliament during its last part-session, the need for a sustainable energy policy was emphasised as part of the EUâs policy of promoting development.
There we have a particularly significant example of coherence that needs to be implemented.
As you are aware, there are signs of a serious oil crisis hitting the European Union and the North in general and, at the same time, we can see that oil resources, which are so plentiful in Africa, have not benefited â to say the least - the development of the local communities.
I would cite the example of Nigeria, which has the largest population and which, although one of the wealthiest African countries in terms of its resources, has not seen the development that it requires.
Thus, the tensions will increase, and we require new legislative and financial instruments and a powerful EU strategy for us to succeed in managing oil in a fair and sustainable way.
I should like to hear your proposals on this matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, as my good friend and former colleague Stefano Manservisi is in my office, I will of course begin by praising this report.
I wish to raise five points.
Firstly, the EU is Africaâs most important supplier of aid, and that is how it should be, for historical reasons.
The fact that we have 26 different development policies, however, tends to hamper efficiency.
We need to combine forces and invest our efforts in one common development policy, which is also something the Commission is in favour of.
Secondly, I would like to say that the âEuro-Africa Pactâ proposed by the Commission in its communication seems like an excellent idea.
It should be based on an equal partnership between the European Union and the African Union.
Thirdly, I want to say that the World Trade Organisationâs Doha Round of talks now in progress needs to achieve results that will improve the Africansâ chances of operating in global markets.
This means putting an end to protectionist customs duties and export restitutions, for example, in agriculture.
Fourthly, I want to say that peace, stability, healthcare and good governance are priority goals for many still unstable African countries.
Finally, I want to say that it is ultimately the Africans themselves who are responsible for development in Africa.
With this in mind, initiatives such as NEPAD â âThe New Partnership for Africa's Developmentâ â are of crucial importance and very worthwhile.
I therefore support the Commission on this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to acknowledge the political courage demonstrated by the Commission, in particular Commissioner Louis Michel, in presenting this strategic plan for Africa, which I hope will not be remembered as a catalogue of good intentions â with which the road to hell is paved â but as a Michel Plan, to some extent in the mould of the Marshall Plan.
That is your challenge.
Furthermore, I believe that this is the appropriate time to do it.
I would like to remind you that the President-in-Office of the Council, Tony Blair, also raised this issue â I regret that he is not here, because I believe that this is a commitment that we must all share â and I would like to stress something that has already been pointed out by the Commissioner: the President of the African Union has also been involved in the presentation of this plan, which demonstrates a desire for parity and partnership.
Furthermore, I would like to make two specific observations.
Firstly, with regard to the biblical drama we are witnessing â mass emigration of people fleeing, in the Sahel in particular, from hunger, from locusts, from wars and from drought â the European States have a minimal presence in the States of the south of the Sahel, including in diplomatic terms.
I therefore believe that we must take urgent action, which the Commission must initiate.
Secondly, Mr President, with a view to the Hong Kong Round negotiations, we must find a way to make the defence of our interests compatible with opening up to Africa in the agricultural field.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the principles that the Commissioner mentioned as underpinning this strategy for Africa was its combination of equality and partnership â the latter defined to mean that both the continent of Europe, the European Union and also our African partners believe in the multilateral order and work to establish it.
Where the last colony in Africa, the Western Sahara, is concerned, I believe that we â by which I mean not only the European Union as an institution, but also the Member States â are not making a good job of it.
I am often asked why the European Union, through association agreements, puts a lot of money into a country that has, for almost exactly thirty years, been occupied by another in contravention of every international law.
Population growth is another issue.
It is clear that no discussion of a development strategy for Africa is possible without consideration of the problem of population growth and the reproductive rights of the people who live there.
There is nothing new about the insight that slower population growth has a positive effect on a countryâs development and helps to reduce poverty.
When considering this strategy for Africa, there are two things to which we must give a great deal of attention: one is the fact that the generation of young people we are dealing with is the most numerous that human history has ever seen, and the other is the spreading pandemic of HIV/Aids.
Â Â  â Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission and Commissioner Louis Michel on a new strategic partnership between the European Union and Africa really does break away from the development policy of the European Union applied in the past.
For the first time, the European Union is going beyond its traditional thinking in humanitarian aid and development cooperation and is formulating â and will, I hope, immediately implement â an integrated strategy on Africa.
Africa will not have a future if it continues to rely on charity from the rich.
It needs a peaceful revolution in order to change productive structures, the economy, trade, agriculture, institutions and education.
No international strategy for Africa will succeed unless it helps to consolidate democratic institutions, fight the established autocracy, strengthen civil society and defend human rights and democratic freedoms.
The European Commission should plan specialised programmes for the media, for non-governmental organisations, for universities and for research institutes in Africa.
The implementation of the objective being set by the European Commission to strengthen regional, economic and commercial integration is of decisive importance in combating poverty and to the economic development of the African continent.
However, this objective cannot implement itself.
At the same time, additional action is needed by the European Union for a fair system of world trade, for improving the functioning of the World Trade Organisation and for bold reform of the generalised system of preferences for the benefit of the poor countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Michel is proposing to us today a strategic partnership between the European Union and Africa.
This is a fresh opportunity for us to respond to the basic needs of the African continent.
A few weeks ago, the Heads of State or Government met in New York.
Back then there were showy declarations and strong pledges of good will, and hope was in the air.
Yet, the results were insignificant.
The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved, and Africa is, once again, the big loser in all of this.
The desperate situation in Africa has recently been illustrated by images on our television screens: images of men prepared to die on the barbed fencing of our continent in order to gain better prospects and a future for themselves and their children, as well as for their country and their continent.
We are all aware that, in order to help Africa overcome poverty, war, hunger and violence, a process and financial resources must be put in place.
We have known what our responsibilities are for a long time.
The European Union has a long tradition of promoting development in the African continent, but the results have generally fallen short of the mark.
You have declared, Commissioner, that your plan would attempt to strike a balance between social objectives and economic development.
I am not one of those people who believe that economic liberalisation automatically leads to social progress and, while we are on that subject, I am concerned about the free trade agreements with the ACP countries.
I believe that our investments need to be focused primarily on education, training, research, health care and public services.
We must â and I believe that this is one of your priorities â make sure that the funds are used and distributed more effectively, that there is better governance and, in fact, that transparent and peaceful democracies are established.
I have faith, Commissioner, in your political will.
I would, however, like you to clarify a few points for us.
How do you intend to deal with the diversity of the African countries?
More specifically, what is the link between this general plan and various partnerships already in existence?
How should we deal with the debt issue, since, in my opinion, this aspect is not sufficiently addressed in the plan?
In short, what practical implementation will take place and what resources will be allocated to this strategy?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by responding to the speeches made by MrsÂ Morgantini and by the last speaker, who both made reference to what is currently taking place at the gates of Europe.
I am like you.
I am one of those people who believe that the real answer to the desperation or futile hopes of human beings is obviously not to close our doors or to act brutally or inhumanely.
The real answer lies in strong development policies, very forceful policies that open up prospects in the countries in which the migratory flows originate.
That is the answer, and the strategy I presented to you provides, in my opinion, an ambitious response to the desire to find a sustainable way of resolving these kinds of tragedy, injustice and unfairness.
It therefore goes without saying that I share your alertness to these matters.
We discussed these matters a short while ago with MrÂ KonarÃ©, between the Commission of the African Union and the Commission of the European Union, and we would be somewhat well advised to bear in mind, as you, yourselves, have, that the problem is not limited to Spain or to Morocco: this is a problem affecting the whole of Africa and the whole of the European Union.
If we do not have the political capacity to resolve this issue at EU level in the context of a real partnership and a real political dialogue with the African continent, then we will never find a solution. We will constantly live through tragedies of this kind and we will continue â justifiably - to attract scorn, because we will have been incapable of carrying out a crucial task.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must say to you that I cannot fall into the trap that might be set for me â albeit unconsciously, or at any rate involuntarily - in Parliament.
I believe that matters must be clear between us with regard to this point: I do not want my plan for Africa to become a kind of Christmas tree to which every MEP, pressure group, NGO or member of civil society comes to hang his or her bauble, at the risk of our losing sight of the main point.
What I truly hope to do, thanks to this plan â and I call on you to help me with this â is to define a course, a framework, without setting any priorities or excluding anything. I also hope that people will not be able to obscure the broad outline by adding all sorts of things which, in themselves, are clearly extremely important, but which could overshadow the main point.
Members have spoken about the effectiveness of the strategy.
You cannot call on the Commissioner to stand firm on issues that are not entirely within his control.
As regards the Commission, you simply have my good will and my commitment.
I also call on you to do something: to help me to succeed in convincing the Member States.
What is, in fact, perhaps unusual about the proposal I am making is that I am trying to outline a framework, a common strategy between the Commission and the Member States to enable the work on promoting development to be divided up more effectively.
Here is my plan: to try to have, and to develop, together a framework, objectives and a strategy and, within that strategy, to try to appeal to groups of Member States that are more specifically interested in such and such a sector or in such and such a region and see to it that we can divide up the work more effectively.
That would also enable us to make savings prior to all the processes, projects and procedures for examining files which, otherwise, it must be said, give rise to a great deal of duplication of effort, coinciding tasks and administrative work.
All the same, I would point out that, today, we have 26 different sets of regulations.
That is what our partners are confronted with.
What I would like this plan to do is to create the momentum and political will needed to reduce all of these sets of regulations, to bring them in line with each other and to simplify them.
We would make great gains in efficiency and, above all, our policy would be more effective.
Consequently, the Member States will have a crucial role to play.
Someone asked me, rather oddly, why I should focus on infrastructure.
We need to know what is desired.
I believe, in fact, that we all agree that the principle of appropriation is essential.
We all agree that the people of Africa must tell us what their priorities are as far as they are concerned.
Well, â and I am addressing the person who questioned me slightly oddly on this issue â the people of Africa have asked us precisely to focus on infrastructure as a priority.
I would also say to you that one does not need to be African to understand the importance of that decision.
Anyone who goes to Africa or who is well acquainted with the heart of Africa can see that, as long as there are no trans-African networks or trans-African communities, there will be no economic restructuring in Africa; we might as well forget about it.
That is therefore the reason why we are focusing on infrastructure.
I would add that this in no way means that we have forgotten about education or health care.
I fully agree with the Members who took the floor on this subject and, if there is, in fact, anyone who is alert to it, it is myself.
I should like to refer you to pageÂ 33 of the document in which it is explained at great length that we will obviously be focusing on education.
Moreover, why should I want us to spend a day together debating the priority to be allocated to budgetary aid when this is possible?
It is precisely to ensure that the countries, the States, can implement sovereign policies in the area, for instance, of education. It is also to ensure that they can fund their teachers and can pay their teachers, which is often not the case at present.
Thus, you can be assured that I am extremely conscious of the priority given to education.
I cannot draw up an exhaustive list of all the priorities, but rest assured that I share them. I wanted to make that point clear.
With regard to natural resources, you will see in the document that we plan to include among the conditions attached to budgetary aid for partner countries the requirement that they allocate the income generated from their natural resources to their national budgets.
You are entirely justified in emphasising this matter.
It is totally unfair that, in a number of potentially wealthy countries possessing natural resources, which are, unfortunately, often misappropriated or sometimes plundered, there is no trace of these resources in their national budgets, when the resources could fund the sovereign policies about which we have spoken.
I should still like to address two aspects, beginning with weapons.
I should like to qualify what I have heard here.
When it is said that Europe might be one of the suppliers of weapons to Africa, I, having full knowledge of the facts, strongly deny that assertion.
I do not dispute the fact that there are countries in the European neighbourhood that are selling off the stocks of a former era.
I acknowledge the fact that there exists an illegal trade, which we are, moreover, trying hard to combat.
Yet, I would remind you that, at European level, there is a code of ethics that the Member States have undertaken to observe.
Thus, in principle, when a country in Africa or elsewhere is in conflict, the Member States of the European Union cannot grant licences for exports to that country.
That is what I wanted to say, and we are going to continue our work along those lines.
My final remark concerns trade.
It is clear that the WTO negotiations must put development at the top of their list of concerns.
I assure you that my colleague, MrÂ Mandelson, does so, and we of course support him.
To give you an example: we are the global leaders in terms of trade-related aid.
I would remind you of the statement made by MrÂ Barroso at the G8Â Summit: we donate EURÂ 1Â billion per year.
I would remind you of another obvious fact: we are the only group of countries in the world that practices the âEverything but Armsâ process.
As regards agricultural policy, there exists an agreement in principle on the Doha Agenda and there has been a reform of the CAP, which is already a great step forward.
Is it enough?
Undoubtedly it is not, but neither must we demonstrate naÃ¯ve optimism.
We must be aware of the fact that the interests of Europe and of certain countries are a factor and that it is this that is preventing us from making faster and more far-reaching progress.
We need to be aware of that.
I do not believe that it is helpful to bury our heads in the sand with regard to what is really taking place in different countries in terms of agricultural policy.
As regards the economic partnership agreements - the EPAs â their goal is development, in particular through aid for regional integration.
For example, promoting South-South trade is one of the priorities of the Africans.
PresidentÂ KonarÃ© fully explained this to us this morning.
Obviously, there will be adjustment costs, and we will help them on this score as well.
All of that is obviously very ideological and I always have great respect for ideological âextremesâ, because I can understand them.
They come from the heart, which commands a great deal of respect on my part and a great deal of understanding.
That being said, is the current system helping the developing countries?
I would draw your attention to the fact that, despite all our preferences and despite all the systems of preference in place, there has been no end to the decline in the contribution of our âpreferentialâ partners to international trade.
We must provide them with the resources really to adapt and to become part of the global economy.
I will conclude by making a final remark, because I believe that it is important: it is not the small ACP countries that will benefit the most from these preferences, but the large exporting countries like Brazil.
This demonstrates that subtle distinctions are useful.
MrÂ President, I have perhaps run over slightly and I apologise for that. However, there were so many good questions that I wanted to attempt to answer as many of them as possible.
Â Â  Rest assured, MrÂ Michel: you have not run over your speaking time. As Commissioner, the time will not be charged to you, anyway.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Once again, we witness the EU throwing stones from its glass house.
A few weeks ago, it was telling Iraq how to draw up a Constitution, despite its own difficulties in that regard.
Today, it unveils its âStrategy for Africaâ, preaching with sheer effrontery about good governance.
The problem with African democracy, the Commission has the nerve to say, is âlimited informationâ and "endemic corruption"; there is a âcrisis of legitimacyâ, with a âgrowing disconnect between the âlegalityâ of the state apparatus and its legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary people.â
Sounds familiar?
Well, here's a real gem from the document: âToo often, elections become a source of conflict, because the losing side does not accept defeat.â
It is just months since we heard the then President of the EU Council, Jean-Claude Juncker, saying that he refused to believe the French and Dutch voted âNoâ to the Constitution.
So I say to the Commission â and to all the politicians in this Parliament who share Mr Juncker's view â Africa does not need any lessons from you, but if you really want to set an example, accept defeat on the Constitution.
Face up to the fact that voters put you on the losing side.
And before you preach any more sermons, start addressing your own bad governance here.
Â Â  â The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Ethiopia.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the coordinated action of the European Union in the management of this crisis.
The UK Presidency, the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, and myself have maintained continuous high-level contacts.
The message from the European Union, which was relayed by the troika at Addis Ababa, was, and is, to call on all of the political parties to keep the electoral process and the political dialogue on track.
I also welcome the progress made since 2Â October in the dialogue between the government and the opposition.
In actual fact, there was a serious risk of derailment, which threatened to lead the country into a scenario from which there was positively no way back.
On that occasion, I wrote to the PrimeÂ Minister to express my concern regarding the climate of tension among the various political forces and the need to keep all of the channels of communication open.
Releasing all of the political prisoners and reopening the offices of the opposition parties, which were closed by the authorities, will be steps in this direction.
I observed with a great deal of interest the opening session of the Ethiopian Federal Parliament and the reelection of the Prime Minister, MrÂ Zenawi, on 10 and 11Â October.
The proper and normal functioning of Parliament is a prerequisite for a multi-party political scene in Ethiopia being established and for democracy in the country taking root.
I met Prime MinisterÂ Zenawi on three occasions prior to this phase.
On each occasion, I firmly reiterated our expectations with regard to how the opposition should be dealt with.
I believe that that is absolutely crucial.
If, within the Ethiopian Parliament, the largest opposition party â the CUD â were to continue to be absent, this could become a factor of instability.
The same would be true if the new majority were not to be introduced for the running of the capital, Addis Ababa.
I am convinced that the European Union must continue to be involved in a constructive, yet firm and demanding, dialogue with all of the parties in order to continue to have a positive bearing and influence on the process under way in Ethiopia.
This is what I intend to see happen in the framework of the political dialogue.
I should like to make one final remark: I am concerned about the renewed tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
The European Union must also exercise vigilance in this respect.
Â Â  MrÂ President, many of us believed that, with the May election, there was a democratic breakthrough in Ethiopia.
How wrong we were!
In the very days following the election, the Meles government showed that it had difficulty accepting that the opposition had had great success.
Laws were made, restricting the oppositionâs ability to act.
The regime is again exercising tight control over the media, there have been repeated arrests of opposition politicians, and peaceful demonstrations have been brutally crushed by the security police, something that led to more than 40 deaths in June.
The events of the last few days unfortunately confirm the picture.
The negotiations between the opposition and the government party broke down a few days ago after the government had refused to discuss what, in my view, was a quite natural desire for democratic reforms.
As a consequence, a number of opposition members chose not to attend parliamentâs forthcoming sitting.
The consequence was a law removing these membersâ immunity.
Those members of the opposition who did attend the sitting were refused the right to participate in the proceedings.
We in this House know that such methods have nothing to do with democracy.
In the resolution we are now debating, we are going through the events following the May election.
Our intention is not, in the first place, to criticise the government and the government party.
Our intention is partly to show the unease, identical to that expressed by Commissioner Michel, that we feel about the developments in Ethiopia and partly to call on both parties to begin negotiations and make use of the opportunity for peaceful and democratic development in Ethiopia, as strongly supported by the May election.
The EU wishes to contribute to positive development in Ethiopia and, in particular, to support the work designed to reduce poverty, but all that can only succeed within the framework of conditions in which the principles of democracy are respected, as well as human freedoms and rights.
This is something that the Meles government needs to work on.
Otherwise, it is in danger of losing its friends, something that, in the end, would have repercussions for the poor population.
Â Â  . Mr President, last time I took the floor I said I was very much concerned.
I still am.
There were indeed very interesting developments since 1Â October 2005 with negotiations being engaged, then brokered with the assistance of donor countries and ambassadors.
However, according to my information, a stalemate still exists despite the fact that the Ethiopian Parliament has already been convened.
The conduct of business, according to my information, is very deficient in terms of democratic standard.
I appreciate the statement by Commissioner Michel and I appreciate the efforts he has been making.
I wish the Council and the British Presidency, in particular, would also give us their views on how things are working and if they think that their approach is effective.
I am particularly concerned and I am aware of the special relationship the British Presidency holds with our allies on the other side of the Atlantic.
The unity of the international community and of the donor communities in this respect is essential.
I would like to hear the Councilâs approach on this.
I will not go further as I am still the head of the European Union election observation mission in Ethiopia.
Naturally, I may make other comments after I deliver my final report.
However, it is only proper that this Parliament shows that it cares and that it continues to closely monitor the situation in Ethiopia.
Â Â  . Mr President, I was part of the European Parliament delegation which observed the polling day on 15Â May.
I spoke for the delegation at the press conference on 17Â May, saying that the elections represented an important step forward in the democratisation process in Ethiopia.
Therefore I feel great personal sadness and shock at the deterioration in the situation since then.
Regarding the election, we must keep faith with the facts observed by the European Union observation mission and the Carter Center, which are that the process leading up to the 15Â May was well run, but that the process after 15Â May had some irregularities.
It is now five months since the election.
The whole point of a democratic election is to put in place a functioning democratic assembly.
This has not happened, and I would beseech sides â the ruling party and the opposition â to continue the dialogue to resolve their differences.
Unless the end result is a functioning Parliament in which politicians of all persuasions are active, then the election process has ultimately failed.
Surely that would be a betrayal of the 90% of Ethiopian electors who cast a vote on 15Â May, often after queuing for many hours.
They had faith in the electoral process.
I hope the leaders they elected will keep to that faith.
Clearly the Government has a responsibility to respect the fundamental principles of the constitution and ensure fundamental freedoms and human rights.
The Ethiopian Government must guarantee that opposition party members are not intimidated or detained without trial.
The Government also needs to reopen access for opposition parties to the media.
In the run-up to 15Â May, parties all had good access, but this is no longer the case.
The fact that opposition leaders who have stated their commitment to working within a constitutional framework cannot easily communicate through the media to their own supporters is particularly dangerous at a time when everybody needs to stay calm.
There are no winners in the current impasse.
If the political process breaks down, then it is not just the opposition parties in Ethiopia who will be the losers.
Ethiopia as a nation will be the loser, because it will go overnight from being a leading light in Africa, a beacon for hope and progress whose President chaired the Commission for Africa, to becoming a failed state.
I do not think Ethiopia deserves to become the latest African basket case.
So I would plead with all parties to persevere with the negotiation process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the human rights situation in Ethiopia is very worrying.
Having observed a splendid and peaceful election â I myself was part of the delegation â in which we were genuinely moved to see the terrific turnout, what has happened since is frightening.
Hundreds have been arrested, the big opposition partiesâ offices have been stripped and locked, the media have been monopolised and it is impossible for the opposition to express itself in public and, by now, at all in parliament.
The governmentâs attitude and actions are dramatically exacerbating the situation.
This constant humiliation of the opposition leaders is of course helping to create an incredibly tense and dangerous situation in Ethiopia.
Other speakers have gone over what has happened.
Once the opposition had accepted the outcome of the election, they were denied the opportunity of working in Parliament.
I think, of course, that it is our task to do our utmost to prevent violence from taking over, but I am not entirely certain that we best achieve political solutions merely by being discreet in our method of working.
I believe it has to be said very loud and clear that this Parliament is critical of the way in which opposition and democracy are being crushed in Ethiopia at present, and I very much hope that, with this debate and with the resolution we are having adopted, we shall get the Commission to state very clearly that negotiations now need seriously to be got under way.
Political solutions are also needed, but all that these more discreet efforts of ours have involved so far is further humiliation and destruction of the opposition.
However, we must, of course, all do what we can to ensure that matters do not get out of hand.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, building a democracy is not a simple matter: the path is full of ups and downs.
I too observed the elections and saw the voters participate in an extremely important democratic process, which has, however, been upset by disturbing events.
I should like to congratulate the Commission for the part it has played on this occasion and offer my thanks not only to the European Union representative in Ethiopia, MrÂ TimÂ Clarke â to whom I send my regards â for the exceptional work he has done, but also to MrsÂ Gomes for the great wisdom she has shown in this situation.
It is all too easy to shout and condemn, but I think that it is much more difficult to try to manage a process like the one in Ethiopia, which is extremely complex.
I applaud the Commission for its role in encouraging dialogue and cooperation and putting pressure on all those involved: on the government and the forces of the majority party but also on the opposition parties, since these too have different ways of proceeding and acting.
Clearly it is always the strongest party, and therefore the Ethiopian Government, that bears the heaviest responsibilities.
It is nevertheless important to continue working towards cooperation and dialogue, so as to try to make the democratic process a reality.
Â Â  Mr President, as a member of the delegation of short-term observers, I should like to thank particularly the long-term observers for the work they have done.
The text as proposed states that the Ethiopians have demonstrated their faith in democracy.
I think they have done more than that; they have made their dignity a matter of record and proved themselves fit for democracy.
It is they above all who deserve our gratitude and the gratitude of the spirit of democracy.
Once, in Ethiopia, at six oâclock in the morning, I counted a queue of 150 people; around noon, I saw 1Â 500 of them in various polling stations.
Like me, MrsÂ Gomes saw elderly people queuing up for hours on end without food or water and then casting their votes with broad grins.
At a time when fewer and fewer of our own electorate were turning out to vote, it was in Ethiopia that I rediscovered democracyâs âsex appealâ if I might be permitted to use that frank and sloppy term.
I saw how beautiful democracy can be!
We also, however, saw how fragile the democratic process can be, with people whispering âplease donât go!â to us as we left the polling stations.
We saw the sort of reputation the European Union has, and the faith people place in it as an entity that not only parades its ideals before it like a banner, but is also prepared to stand up for them, and, speaking personally, let me say that I have before never been so proud to wear the European Unionâs âring of starsâ.
We also had the experience of hearing people who were election observers say that, once the count was over, they were going to disappear for a few days for their own safety.
When we were in Addis Ababa, we often heard it said that the government might not be willing to relinquish office, but also that the opposition might not be willing and able to assume it.
In conditions of such insecurity, the European Union was well advised to be guided by caution.
Subsequent events have shown, though, that the government will probably not be able to remain in office, and that the opposition is better able than we had thought to exercise power.
The caution evident in these resolutions is something that we should progressively abandon.
Â Â  Mr President, the situation in Ethiopia is becoming less stable with every day that passes, and responsibility for that rests primarily with the government.
Whilst the 90% turnout is an expression of the Ethiopian peopleâs confidence in the democratic process, the government was evidently seized with panic as soon as the first results became known.
I endorse the intention of Mrs Gomes, the EUâs principal election observer, to deliver an objective and truthful report, and the usual suspects, not least here in Brussels, who, where Africa is concerned, would prefer to carry on working with the status quo, and whose associates find democratic elections rather disturbing, should be wary of making improper proposals in this House with the aim of relativising the knowledge that has actually been gained.
It is unfortunate that our American friends, too, currently seem to have fallen prey to the same temptation.
I warn against doing likewise, for that will do nothing to establish either democracy or lasting stability, or even to combat international terrorism.
It is important that the government and the opposition should, despite all that has happened since 15 May, put the countryâs interests first and resume dialogue.
Although our diplomats in Addis Ababa, too, are rendering a valuable service in this respect, the creation of confidence is, above all, an obligation upon the government, and so they should re-amend the parliamentâs rules of procedure so that the opposition can at least avail itself of its rights under the constitution; it should restore the immunity of those members who did not attend the opening session, and also that of Addis Ababa city council; I also call on them to release the political prisoners and guarantee the opposition access to the media.

If they are not prepared to create the conditions for democracy, they are showing their true colours as yet another example of what we have seen so often in Africa, namely that elections are regarded as acceptable only if they confirm the existing government.
That, though, is not what they are for.
Ninety per cent of Ethiopians have stated what they expect of democratic elections and the government must accept their judgment upon it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, it is surprising that I should take the floor to speak about the worsening crisis in Ethiopia, but it is a country about which I care a great deal, because it is where one of my compatriots, Karlheinz BÃ¶hm, has people working for the good of others, and he keeps on mobilising aid â aid that is a drop in the ocean.
That makes it, in my view, all the more regrettable that the democratic experiment in Ethiopia is threatening to fail by reason of the governmentâs manifest inability to accept the democratic facts and guarantee the opposition its basic rights.
I call on the Commission to go beyond appeals and fine words and make it clear that aid from it will not be forthcoming until there is progress towards democracy, and will back this up with conditions attached to the aid.
I am also very much in favour of sending an ad hoc committee of this House to Ethiopia and support Mrs Gomesâ project.
The more that the European Union â and every level of it â is visibly present the better, for we are thereby making it a matter of record that we will not allow the crisis in that country to get any worse.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, I shall be very brief because, in fact, I agree to a very large extent with what has been said in this House.
I should also like to congratulate and to thank MrsÂ Gomes for having kept her head during certain moments, which I can understand must have been trying for her.
I thank her for having seen this observation mission through in an entirely positive and proper manner.
I should also like to join with those who thanked MrÂ Clark: it must not have been easy doing his job every day.
My belief, in fact, is that if, within a rather short timeframe, the PrimeÂ Minister does not fulfil a minimum number of our expectations, then it will be extremely difficult to pursue the political dialogue as things currently stand.
That is what I truly believe.
I am among those who have demonstrated a great deal of understanding towards what took place there.
All of these messages have been sent to the PrimeÂ Minister.
I sometimes have the feeling that â and I do not really know why this is the case â he does not thoroughly understand the full extent of the risk to which he is exposing his country.
We have put pressure on him.
I have also spoken at great length with the members of the opposition to urge them to take up their seats in Parliament in order to make the parliamentary institution function.
That being said, it is clear that, in return, the PrimeÂ Minister must now send out a number of signals that are along the same lines as what we are hoping for.
As regards the issue of suspending cooperation, I believe that, at this stage, we cannot consider starting a formal procedure aimed at suspending development cooperation.
Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreements, the dialogue is always open, and I believe that this dialogue is the most appropriate means of keeping the door open and of encouraging the parties to make constructive steps.
That being said, I am monitoring very closely how the political situation is developing, and I will not disguise from you the fact that even I, being very conscious of the dangers of a chaotic situation, am slowly beginning to grow impatient.
We must now put maximum pressure on the PrimeÂ Minister so that he understands that democracy is not born out of unilateralism and that the opposition must be respected, taking into account, moreover, the election result.
With these elections, in fact, we are in a whole different scenario, and if the PrimeÂ Minister wishes to continue to benefit from an show of support from the international community, then he must make sure that he does not abuse it.
That is what I believe.
Therefore, I broadly agree, MrÂ President, with what has been said in this House.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
To end this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions presented pursuant to Rule 103(2)(1).
The vote will take place tomorrow.

Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Bono, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process (2004/2272 (INI)) (A6-0245/2005).
Â Â  Mr President, I have observed that the representatives of the British Presidency of the Council are not present. They were not present in the debate before â there will be some very good reasons why â but could we just ask that the next time education is debated the Presidency â British or otherwise â should be present?
Â Â  .
Mr President, this report calls for greater investment in education in an attempt to achieve the Lisbon objectives. It might even reflect a call by my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who in 1997 launched his general election campaign with the mantra âeducation, education, educationâ.
However, decisions on education must be made by the Member States. It is certainly not within the competence of the EU, despite the wish that it should be.
The lack of realism within this report is emphasised by the appeal for a 15% increase in the number of science graduates in the EU between now and 2010.
This is unachievable because young scientists, once graduated, are emigrating in ever-increasing numbers, mainly to the United States. Even today the Commissionâs own survey says 400Â 000 European science and technology graduates have emigrated to find jobs.
Why is this? The answer is startlingly simple: endless EU regulation and red tape is smothering innovative businesses, leaving them with little choice but to relocate or close down.
In this context the report serves to highlight the fact that, irrespective of the level of investment made by the Member States in education and training, if businesses and industry have relocated due to suffocating regulation, the investment will not be returned.
This report ignores the fact that, at the current rate of progress, the Lisbon objectives will not be reached.
Attempts to prevent this failure, even by further EU misguidance, are doomed to fail.
As I have said before, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question.
You do not have to be a graduate to understand that.
Â Â  Rapporteur Bono stated very correctly that education is one of the most important prerequisites for making Europe the most dynamic economy by 2010.
I am pleased to report that we in Slovakia respect this fact, and I am very pleased that there is a Commissioner from Slovakia in charge of this area.
Levels of education in our country are among the highest in the European Union.
Our students already study two foreign languages as compulsory subjects at secondary level, and most university study programmes are of a five-year duration.
Three-year bachelor programmes are offered in only some fields of study.
Since the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union, many students from Slovakia have taken advantage of the opportunities created by free movement and have pursued part of their education abroad, either within the framework of the Erasmus programme or through postgraduate studies.
However, our students have had to confront a particular problem related to the free movement of persons. Because of the considerably higher cost of living abroad in comparison with Slovakia, most students who temporarily stay abroad must take a job.
To be able to work, they need a work visa, with the exceptions of Ireland and the United Kingdom, since most countries have imposed a transitional period on our country that prevents the free movement of workers. Visas often limit the number of working hours to 20 per week, sometimes even less.
These restrictions frustrate the free movement of students. Tuition fees in universities sometimes amount to more than EUR 1Â 000.
Because of the weaker economies of the new Member States, our students should be allowed to study and work at the same time, and we should therefore try to remove the administrative barriers to granting work or student visas.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the issue we are debating is one of fundamental importance to a great many Members of this House.
If we wish to achieve the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy, or in other words the sustainable growth of a knowledge-based economy, more and better jobs, greater social cohesion and equal opportunities, we cannot afford to neglect one of the key factors in meeting these goals, namely human resources.
Investment in education never goes to waste.
My professional experience has shown me that good professional teachers are the main prerequisite for good teaching.
In order to ensure that such teachers can hold their own in a knowledge-based society, they too must be provided with opportunities to undertake further education, above all in the field of information technology.
Lifelong learning plays a key role in education, which is about much more than just schools.
In order to achieve the Lisbon goals, it is essential that national strategies for lifelong learning and vocational training be drawn up, and that national reforms be placed in a European context.
Adequate sources of funding must be made available in order to ensure that the majority of these demands can be met, and I should therefore like to add my voice to the calls for the EU to guarantee sufficient funding to cover the relevant costs. All EU Member States must continue to have access to the European Social Fund after 2006.
Comparisons of individual education systems have revealed a great many astonishing findings. It would therefore be highly desirable to create further indicators in key areas or in areas that have lacked such indicators to date, such as languages, information and communication technologies, the effectiveness of investment and adult education.
This would allow the performance and progress of individual education systems to be assessed. I should like to thank the rapporteur.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, many countries have made, and are making, considerable progress in the establishment of quality assurance systems and in promoting cooperation in the Union, which represents progress in the development of a European Higher Education Area.

Nevertheless, I would like to insist on the need to take a further step by means of effective cooperation and coordination amongst these bodies, both national and European, since achieving mutual recognition of quality assurance systems and quality assessments is positive for all of the citizens, in that it facilitates the recognition of academic qualifications amongst Member States and the mobility of students and teachers.


Both issues are key to improving our levels of education and the creation of a common European consciousness.

In order to make this possible, however, I believe that it is vitally important to promote the necessary mutual trust amongst all the actors involved.
This also means the involvement of universities, teachers and students.

Only in this way will we be able to successfully face the challenge of the Europe of excellence on the basis of investment in education, training and research, which is necessary if we are to achieve a fully inclusive knowledge-based society within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I am grateful to MrsÂ Novak for the report before us today.
The quality of academic learning is not simply a matter of receiving full mutual recognition for higher education qualifications.
There is a much greater issue involved as well, namely the search for truth.
As stated by the Commission in 2002, the European educational model should serve as an example to the rest of the world where quality is concerned. The decisions taken at Bologna, Prague and Bergen are therefore crucial, and one of their main features is European accreditation.
Accreditation agencies must be transparent and able to resist pressure of any kind.
There is scope for abuse in connection with accreditation. Demographic factors mean that institutions compete strongly against each other for students, because their very existence depends on the latter.
On the other hand, the immediate introduction of overly strict provisions may lead to serious difficulties for certain institutions that have not yet achieved their full potential. In such cases, it is important to give the institutions a chance to remedy their shortcomings.


A great leap forward in academic education has also taken place in my country, Poland.
For example, some 300Â private institutions of higher education have come into being there over the last 15Â years, which is extraordinary.
All aspects of research and teaching must also have a moral dimension.
In the interests of good quality learning, it is essential to nurture the relationships between teacher and pupil and between lecturer and student. We should remember the words of Solomon: âHow much better is it to get wisdom than gold!
And to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!â.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, immigration flows to the European Union, which increased significantly after the 1980s, confirm the need for special educational support measures to be introduced in the schools of the Member States for children whose mother tongue differs from the language of their social environment.
The Member States should therefore support any measure to safeguard linguistic diversity and limit the technical difficulties which prevent the achievement of the objective.
The education systems should ensure that all pupils learn foreign languages because the objective of the European Union is and always has been a real multilingual European society.
In addition, the aim of action by the institutions within this framework is to guarantee equal education rights to children who speak a different language in their family environment.
Any policy which helps wipe out all forms of discrimination is needed.
Multilingualism, therefore, has two dimensions.
On the one hand, it has a functional role as the tool in achieving communication between people of different origins.
On the other hand, it is an important means for shaping a European identity.
Moreover, learning and speaking other languages, in addition to our mother tongue, encourages us to be more open towards others, to their cultural values and to their opinions.
Multilingualism creates new prospects. It is, without doubt, an important factor in promoting social integration and encouraging sociability in the European Union.
In addition, we must not forget that it helps to create a real unified European labour market, offering citizens the possibility to make full use of the right to live, work and study in another Member State.
It should therefore be our objective to shape a society in which the percentage of multilingual citizens, as a factor for unifying society as a whole, increases steadily.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are about to discuss something wonderful â the circus.
I hope we can enjoy it a bit, too; I certainly got a lot of fun out of the time I spent dealing with this issue, gaining many friends in the circus world, and I can only say that grappling with the circus as a subject was worthwhile.
I did not, however, do this because I found it enjoyable, but because I was challenged by the problems that circuses face in the European Union and elsewhere.
One object of this report is that the circus should be recognised, as a matter of course, as part of European culture.
In only very few countries in the European Union is it seen as a cultural asset, and the nation states need to address this problem and recognise it as an important part of culture.
This will make it possible to remedy the problems that circuses still face.
The second aspect I want to address is that of schooling and vocational training.
The Commission should introduce mechanisms for the cooperation of the Member States in order to guarantee and promote an adequate education for the children of travelling communities â and by that I mean not just circus children, but all travelling communities â regardless of the Member State in which they happen to be.
It would be very much to be desired that the Council should prepare a new resolution guaranteeing high-quality school education and vocational training for children, young people and adults in travelling communities and recognising and supporting the vocational training offered by circus schools.
The third problem has to do with what are termed temporary structures.
The Commission could, following consultations with the European circus association, which is based here in Brussels, mandate the European Committee for Standardisation to prepare a comprehensive set of standards relevant to mobile circus facilities.
For example, in the various countries of the European Union, different standards apply as regards such things as safety and the materials from which tents are made.
That is not a joke; it is an unfortunate fact set in stone, and this is where changes need to be made.
Fire safety, the rules on which even differ from one locality to another, is one of those simple things that present every travelling circus with real problems, and we really do need to get a grip on them without putting the safety of the public at risk.
We also have to consider circus workers, mobility, and the employment of third country nationals.
The Commission needs to carry out an analysis of the current visa and work permit issuing systems, and use that as the basis for drawing up a European regulation in this area, which would take into account the difficulties currently involved in getting visas or work permits issued.

The existing requirements for performers with short-term work contracts are difficult to comply with and must also be done away with â I am thinking here of the requirement that there must be evidence of a lack of equally qualified persons within the EU.
Can you explain to me how I am meant to demonstrate that when I want to bring in a star performer from Ukraine or China to perform in a circus in Europe?
I would have to demonstrate that there are no performers in Europe with equivalent qualifications, but that really is nonsensical.
No opera house would put up with that sort of nonsense; La Scala can employ singers from the European Union and from third countries too, but that option is not open to a circus, and that is what makes it important that the circus be recognised as something of cultural value. That will make things easier for the performers.
In drafting the report, we compromised and agreed not to say anything about the keeping of animals, because the keeping of animals by circuses is seen by some countries as a really major issue that they are keen to regulate at the national level.
Nevertheless, we do take the view that animals are a part of the traditional circus and that it must be possible to adopt directives that enable circuses to keep them.
Legislation of this sort exists in Germany and in England, for example; all we have to do is allow ourselves to be guided by it.
It follows that what we have set down in this report is perfectly reasonable. We would ask the Commission not only to take note of it, but also to actually do what we have demanded of it, by getting the Committee for Standardisation on the case and making it clear to the members of the national governments that the circus is a vital cultural asset, and one that we are still keen to pass on to our children and grandchildren.





Â Â  Mr President, it is entirely appropriate that we should be debating the circus in this House, considering that the European Parliament is the biggest travelling circus in the world, although I fear that many of my constituents in the English East Midlands may wonder if we do not have more important issues to address.


I have been approached by members of the public who worry about the use of animals in circuses and the possibility of cruel or harmful treatment. I share their concern.
I urge Member State governments to ensure that circus animals are subject to appropriate regulation and inspection. However, I believe that the idea of banning animals from circuses goes too far.
It is one thing to support animal welfare; it is quite another to ban a much-loved and traditional feature of the circus, which, as Mrs Packâs report rightly says, is a recognised and ancient part of European culture.
There is a close parallel here with the issue of hunting, another target of the animal rights movement.
The same criteria apply: hunting should be, and normally is, conducted with due attention to animal welfare issues.
However, English fox hunting â like the circus â is a vital part of English cultural heritage and especially so in the East Midlands, which I represent.
I would oppose any move to ban animals from circuses and I oppose the unjust and counterproductive ban on fox hunting recently introduced in my own country.
Â Â  .
Mr President, thank you very much for the discussion.
It is interesting how many topics converge on the concept of the circus and European culture, or work together around the same topic.
Naturally, the temptation to confuse professions or arenas is frequent, but a really good, high-quality circus deserves recognition, and that is mainly what this report is about. It is also about a specific responsibility for addressing topics that include not only culture, but also education, mobility and economics, since we are dealing with the entertainment industry.
I would again like to express my appreciation for the work, report and approach of rapporteur Doris Pack, as well as the contributions to the discussion, and I look forward to cooperating in this field on the development of the European cultural agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, over 68 million people in the European Union â that is, 15% of its population â are at risk of poverty. The situation is even worse in countries outside the EU of 25.
It follows that every possible EU instrument â whether the European Neighbourhood or Foreign Policies, development or finance policy â should be used to the utmost if we are to be able to alleviate poverty at home and abroad. National plans of action must include specific measures to alleviate poverty and the Commission must monitor the way in which they are implemented.
It is of the utmost importance that more attention be paid to women both in the European Employment Guidelines and in the Lisbon Strategy. The European Unionâs development policy must do more to address poverty reduction, while, at the same time, international development policy must, as a matter of urgency, be analysed to ascertain to what extent groups at risk are either being helped or further marginalised.
The World Bank, the G-8, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organisation must show their hands and set out the specific effects that their policies have had on women and poverty in the past and what the effect of them is now.
One possible result of poverty outside the EUâs 25 Member States is an increase in illegal immigration, people-smuggling, and criminal activity, with an eventual increase in the trafficking of women.
We will therefore reiterate our long-standing demand that the Member States should, once and for all, legislate for a guaranteed minimum income.

Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my dissatisfaction at the fact that a womenâs debate is not only the last item on the agenda, but is also â once again â being dropped.



I will now turn to the subject of women and poverty. Although we have a report before us, pocket-sized though it may be, it again reads like a tract from the Bible.
As a progressive woman, I am therefore very disappointed with the end product, which is mainly descriptive and not action-based.
What the report does do, however, is to put on the EU agenda the specific circumstances of poverty affecting women, and this is a good thing.
I fully support the section about setting up an active group within the EU in which the participation of groups of the poorest women will be actively promoted and supported.
After all, they are the experts who have a good understanding of the ideas about how the most pressing needs in poverty and women could be alleviated.
Â Â  Poverty is a grave phenomenon, which affects women significantly more.
Women face multiple discrimination â elder women, women belonging to ethnic minorities, disabled women, lone parents â and are potential victims of social exclusion and extreme poverty.
The risk of poverty is linked to unemployment. This risk increases if unemployment remains high.
Integrating disabled people, long-term unemployed, elder people and ethnic minorities into employment is a key challenge.
Economic, employment and social policies are mutually reinforcing.
Economic development should be accompanied by efforts to reduce poverty and to fight exclusion and discrimination.
Helping women getting employed is one of the key elements since employment generates income and promote social participation.
If the Lisbon employment target set for 2010 is to be achieved, factors underlying gender gap in employment, and pay need to be tackled vigorously. Actions which make it easier for women to reconcile career with family should be further pursued.
Exchange of best practices of Member States would be of great use in social protection systems, in eliminating and preventing violence against women.



We should try harder to include social partners at national, regional and local level into policy development and implementation, especially in the area of education, employment and pensions.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday a motion was put forward to bring Commissioner McCreevy before Parliament.
The groups were asked to speak on the motion.
The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped.
I have observed this before.
In this case though, I was designated to speak on this very important issue for the Group and I seek to make that statement now.
The IND/DEM Group agrees with Mr Schulz that Commissioner McCreevy should be called before this House to account for his statements on the European social model.
Mr McCreevy has of course always opposed that model.
He was Minister for Finance as Ireland ascended to wealth, and how did he choose to spend it?
On our chaotic health system?
On our crumbling school buildings?
On a very excluding special needs education system?
On our housing crisis?
Did he get patients off a two-year waiting list for minor operations?
Not our Charlie!
He made sure that his friends in the horse racing business did not have to pay tax on six-figure-a-go stud fees.
I have had seven years to observe Charlieâs distaste for wasting taxpayersâ money on social services.
The other 719Â Members may not yet know how Charlie operates and they deserve a chance to see what they are in for.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0272/2005) by MrÂ Beaupuy, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement [2004/2258(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to thank those in the Commission, Parliament and indeed the Council, with which I had some contact, who helped me draw up this own-initiative report.
I hope that it will be adopted in due course.
What has got into Parliament to make it address urban issues, which are certainly not enshrined in our treaties and which do not usually fall within our competence?
I feel that, in order to gain a proper understanding of the situation as it stands, it is worth taking a quick look back.
Over the past half-century, our institutions have focused a great deal on tackling crucial headline issues such as, initially, coal and steel, the common agricultural policy, the Single Act â one of the cornerstones of our European organisation, enabling people, capital, goods and services to move freely throughout our countries â and then, more recently, the single currency.
While these landmark events were taking place, our European organisation adopted thousands of measures relating to the citizensâ daily lives.
Yet, despite all of this, we have not seen any coherent development regarding the urban and suburban areas where 3Â 700Â 000Â people, 80% of the population, live.
I wish to stress the terms urban and suburban.
That being said, several important decisions have been taken over the past 15 to 20 years.
The first of these decisions â and, no doubt, a significant one too â was taken in 1988, when Article 10 of the European Regional Development Fund specified the need for urban pilot projects.
Two years later, in 1990, two documents were published: a Green Paper on the urban environment and a report on urban areas in crisis.
In 1993, Jacques Delors organised a European symposium on cities.
As regards the URBAN programme, which is the subject under discussion, the first programme appeared in 1994, followed by a second in 2000.
Lastly, the URBACT data exchange programme came into being in 2004.
In other words, the last 15 years has seen a steady trickle of programmes and measures on urban issues being adopted.
I should also point out that, at the same time, in recent years, there have been many conferences, colloquiums and other fora on the subject.
In recent months, though, things have moved ahead altogether more quickly.
On 30Â NovemberÂ 2004 the Dutch Presidency held an informal Council in Rotterdam, which placed the accent on the urban dimension and adopted an outstanding text on the subject.
I should also point out, in conjunction with my fellow members of the URBAN intergroup, that the URBAN-housing intergroup was set up in 2005.
A large number of articles on urban policy have appeared in all the documents relating to the regional funds prepared by the Commission before 2004.
In December, the British Presidency is set to host a meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol.
We can see, therefore, that urban issues have come a long way.
What is the question before us today?
What we see in our urban and suburban areas is a certain amount of waste.
One Member of this House, who is here today, pointed out to us the other day, for example, that, in Leipzig, 30% of refurbished housing remains unoccupied.
Is that not a huge waste?
Have we not seen â thanks mainly to our regional funds, but also to national funds and local budgets â the occasional school built here and there without accommodation being refurbished, or vice versa, accommodation refurbished without infrastructure such as public transport being renovated?
The time has come to put an end to such waste. The time has come for us to adopt a much more coherent policy.
My report, which has been the subject of lengthy debate, is not intended to set fresh objectives.
We already have objectives.
The purpose of this report is to equip us with the resources to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives in our towns and cities.
What are those resources?
I presume you have all read this own-initiative report.
I should like to highlight some crucial points, such as the fact that our three institutions â Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which prepares and implements legislation â need an internal shake-up so as to enhance the effectiveness of their decisions on urban issues.
We are witnessing a power struggle between the Member States, the regions, the cities and indeed the EU, and these authorities must now work together much more coherently in order greatly to improve their own effectiveness once and for all.
We need to develop urban policy that is integrated in both spatial and thematic terms.
I have spoken about this from the perspective of the negative picture I painted earlier.
We cannot implement a measure unless it works in tandem with other measures.
I shall conclude by emphasising good practice.
I often say that the awareness and application of tried and tested good practice is often far more productive than a small allocation of funds.
Urban policy does not fall under Parliamentâs powers.
Let us not be under any illusion; Parliament is not about to release further vast sums of money in the framework of the financial perspective to fund new urban perspectives.
Everything hinges on whether we can improve our organisation and our effectiveness. This is the proposal that I put to you in the various provisions contained in my report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Beaupuy for drawing up an excellent report.
It suggests a number of very concrete steps which can be taken to reinforce work on urban issues within the context of enlargement in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
In particular I appreciate your strong support for strengthening the urban dimension in future cohesion policy.
The motion for a resolution is clear proof of the European Parliamentâs strong commitment and dedication to urban policy.
I also noted with great interest your proposal to amend Annex VI to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development to incorporate the urban dimension.
I am convinced that towns and cities play a central role in achieving greater competitiveness, more growth and more and better jobs in Europe.
That is why we intend to place urban actions at the core of cohesion policy.
I share your view that urban planning should incorporate a wide spectrum of policies and develop integrated spatial and thematic urban policy on a human scale to ensure people-friendly cities.
I agree with you that we must further reinforce urban policy development priorities.
In fact, I have asked my services to prepare a detailed analysis on the contribution of cities to growth and jobs in the regions.
A working paper will complement the Community strategic guidelines.
It will also provide more specific guidance on how cities and regions can cooperate when preparing and implementing cohesion policy programmes.
This document will also bring out more clearly those city-focused priorities which the Commission considers to be indispensable or highly promising in order to implement cohesion programmes successfully.
As you know, a number of thematic priorities â such as the knowledge economy, social cohesion and urban environment â are set out in the draft Community strategic guidelines.
Cities can make an important contribution to these.
It is my aim to discuss this document with Member Statesâ regions and cities.
The debate will be opened at the UK informal Council on Sustainable Communities on 6Â December in Bristol, where we will present our paper.
Afterwards we will start a wide consultation, the results of which will be used to draw up the final version of the Community strategic guidelines.
I look forward to an extensive exchange of views on this working paper on cities with the honourable Members of Parliament.
This paper will also respond to your request to develop and propose models and tools for sustainable urban development.
It will provide recommendations based on current good practice in promoting sustainable local communities through an integrated approach.
Many lessons will be drawn from cities participating in our URBACT networks.
In addition, the thematic strategy for sustainable urban development, being prepared under the framework of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, will be a further step in enhancing dialogue between the Commission and national and local authorities.
This thematic strategy on urban environment is currently scheduled for adoption by the Commission on 21Â December 2005.
Your motion for a resolution also calls on the Commission to move towards a horizontal application of the urban dimension and towards coordination between the departments of the Commission that are directly or indirectly concerned with urban issues.
I can assure you that the services are already working in close collaboration on the urban content of the Community strategy guidelines.
In the light of the results of this work, and after the adoption of the legislative framework for cohesion policy 2007-2013, we will assess the working practices with a view to ensuring efficient cross-service coordination on urban issues.
My intention at this stage will be to establish an interdepartmental task force along the same lines as your Urban Housing Intergroup to ensure a horizontal approach to policy measures which affect cities.
Finally, you asked the Commission to ensure that intervention in towns and cities and urban agglomerations is strengthened.
As you know, our proposal for the future cohesion policy programmes foresees that each Member State will present a list of urban areas that will benefit from specific assistance within the regional programmes.
It also makes provision for sub-delegating the implementation of programme management to the cities themselves.
However, unfortunately, as we all know, the Council has rendered these provisions optional, like a number of other measures in favour of cities, such as the consultation of urban authorities in the framework of partnership.
I count very much on your support to convince the Member States to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations.
The lack of strong commitment from the Member States would undermine our efforts towards strengthening the urban dimension in our policy and it would call into question some of our concrete initiatives, like the Urban Audit programme.
I also wish to tell you that there has been some progress on urban-related issues in the negotiations as well.
The UK Presidency has proposed to turn urban sustainable development into a fully-fledged priority, in addition to those priorities proposed under the convergence and regional competitiveness objectives.
Let me assure you that I have no doubts that we need both cities and regions if we want to achieve greater competitiveness, more growth and better jobs.
I am also confident that the cities will receive the place in our policy which they deserve.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Beaupuy, for addressing such an important issue to the development objectives of the European Union and the daily lives of its citizens, given that the majority of citizens live in urban and suburban areas.
More importantly, if we are to achieve social and regional cohesion within the Union of 25 Member States and in the run-up to further enlargement, we need to study the various factors which affect life in towns and cities and propose coordinated and effective intervention through all our policies.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his thoughts and proposals on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for incorporating our ideas.
As you know, we maintain that the strategy for towns and cities must include a wide spectrum of policies and opportunities as regards transport, the environment, planning, economic activity, migration policy, public health, social integration and safety standards.
Within this network of policies, the gender dimension must be taken into serious account.
This means that women must participate in planning the humane towns that we all want to achieve; in other words, towns and cities that address the common problems of our fellow citizens, but that also address those that arise from the particular circumstances of the two sexes.
Women, as we make clear in our opinion, face particular situations and various needs, in transport for example, in their everyday life.
I therefore believe, Commissioner, that in consultation with local communities, to which you just referred, you will take account of the balanced participation of men and women in consultation fora.
The same gender mainstreaming, in other words the participation of women, must also be a criterion for evaluating our policies.
To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has already â and rightly â said, even though there is no provision in the Treaties for the EU to have any direct power over or responsibility for the conduct of an urban policy, the European Parliament has always argued the case for one at European level.
I would just like to remind the House that it was this Parliament that campaigned for URBAN as a Community initiative and, in due course, made a successful job of implementing it.
For the sake of simplification, the existing URBAN dimension is now to be integrated into the mainstream programmes for the coming planning period for 2007 to 2013.
That can definitely be advantageous provided that the URBAN dimensionâs successful continuity is ensured.
There is no doubt that urban areas are â as the rapporteur has highlighted â economic motors and key elements in regional development created within the EU.
The fact that over 80% of economic activity goes on in towns and cities is as indispensable justification for the principle of partnership as one of the key elements in cohesion policy.
Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other; it is for that reason that they may not, in any one territory, be considered in isolation, even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States.
What is remarkable about the cities of the central and eastern European states is the decline in their population, the phenomenon of emigration brought about by the decline of industry, and this is a process that the Eastern European states will have to master in exactly the same way as did the towns and cities of the former East Germany: as a consequence of the socialist era.
This is where the Urban Dimensionâs city policy, among others, could â indeed, must â have an effect.
That is why the rapporteurâs balanced report deserves to be endorsed and its conclusions need to be followed up.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, urban policy and urban areas are becoming more and more important.
The report was explicitly drafted as a response to enlargement, which had made these problems even more acute.
Let me just remind you that there are in the Central and Eastern European states vast districts full of buildings made of large panels, and with all the problems, both in building and social terms, that are associated with them.
Apart from the Structural Funds, though, there are scarcely any instruments capable of being used to address the problems of urban areas, so, while there are indeed means available to the new Member States whereby they may, with the help of the European Union, monitor and support their urban policies, I would stress that urban development is problematic not only in the new Member States, but also, of course, in the old ones.
I see this as a topic that we will have to revisit in the future if we are, given the need for them, to develop instruments with which the European Union can address certain problems.
We may not â as Mr Beaupuy rightly said â have any powers or responsibilities where urban policy is concerned, but to act as if urban problems were not problems for Europe as a whole would be to ignore the facts of the situation, and so I agree with the rapporteurâs idea that urban policy should be given a broader, horizontal approach, with the Commission being called on to take appropriate action.
I do think, though, that it makes a great deal of sense to proceed with great moderation when it comes to changing this Houseâs Rules of Procedure, and it is for that reason that my Group has tabled an amendment on the subject.
Far from opposing urban policy, we are in fact very strongly in favour of it, but we are opposed to altering the Rules of Procedure.
The idea of amending the Rules of Procedure resurfaces from time to time, but I do believe that this would be the wrong way of going about decisions on urban policy.
Perhaps I might be permitted to touch on another point that may well not have any direct relevance to MrÂ Beaupuyâs report.
Commissioner HÃŒbner explained what the Council is working on at the moment.
I can do no other than urge the Council and the Commission to come to a decision as quickly as possible on the Financial Perspective and thereby give us a framework, which should as soon as possible have the relevant projects attached to it, for if they do not, we will be unable to implement the Cohesion Policy for the period from January 2007 onwards and will be unable to deal with the problems in the new Member Statesâ urban areas.
We need a decision from the Council as soon as possible, and that decision should coincide as far as possible with those taken by Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right from the very start of this parliamentary term some of us have been paying particular attention to the subject of the urban dimension, and none more so than Mr Beaupuy.
He was already doing so before the creation of the European Parliamentâs Urban Housing Intergroup, of which he himself is Chairman and I a member, and which is working very well.
I thank the Commissioner for supporting in so timely a fashion the approach we take to our work, and for encouraging it.
She demonstrated her support yet again just now in her speech to this House.
Parliament, it is clear, is today requested to make an additional commitment â which I think I can guarantee, and I speak for Mr Beaupuy too â to involve itself more fully, with a view to preventing any disastrous backtracking by the Council.
Backtracking would only reduce the role of cities, a role which, in my opinion, is not only an essential part of cohesion policy, but also represents one of its central pillars.
Cities are, in fact, the key players in regional policy.
As well as being centres for the most complex issues, such as social exclusion and pollution, they are centres in which the futures of their entire surrounding areas are moulded, a fact I have also tried to assert in my role as shadow rapporteur on the European Regional Development Fund regulation.
The driving force of a programme which sensibly invests and manages funds earmarked for cities can, and must, give a similar economic and socio-cultural boost to suburbs and surrounding rural areas, especially in the light of the recent enlargement of the European Union.
That is why I believe that today we need to engage even more with this subject, based on the experience that this Parliament has already acquired.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group gives this own-initiative report a warm welcome and is grateful for the good cooperation.
Much of what has been taken up into this report reflects the work of the urban planning Intergroup, of which the rapporteur is the chairman.
Not only towns and regions, but also civil society, face both a major challenge and an excellent opportunity to communicate European policy and its objectives.
In Leipzig, from which I come, programmes such as âUrban IIâ have produced outstanding results, not least by getting the public involved.
Direct participation makes possible a European perspective at the local level.
If we squander this potential, we cannot be surprised when many people in Europe see the decisions taken in Brussels or Strasbourg more as interference in their internal affairs than as forward-looking action.
What is needed today is an all-embracing approach to urban planning, involving jobs no less than issues around suitability for children and senior citizens, the supply of affordable housing or the development of transport connections.
The urban dimension must, though, also become a horizontal task for the Commissionâs Directorates-General, enabling it to be reflected in all policy areas.
Whether with regard to the structural funds or to the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, European policy cannot really be successful unless the cities and regions are involved.
My ears pricked up at a recent survey according to which 75% of the cities and municipalities have no concept of what the Lisbon Strategy is.
Particularly after what the Commissioner reported today, that should provide food for thought for our Member States, who may be willing to implement the partnership principle on a voluntary basis, but are not prepared to be bound by it.
They are probably less inclined to share power.
I therefore look forward with a great deal of eager anticipation to the analysis and the proposals on sustainable urban development that the Commissioner announced this afternoon.
This is the way to really get European cohesion policy to work, and I look forward to continued good cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and, eventually, the Council too.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is on an own initiative report which would, however, gain by being a report with legislative force, so important is, I believe, the urban dimension in the context of enlargement to the European Union.
European towns and cities are still the places of creation and the centre of social and cultural development, as we can see from the attraction they exert over people.
On the other hand, however, they are the places where numerous and varied problems are concentrated, such as environmental pollution, traffic congestion, housing problems, crime and drug addiction and social exclusion, immigration and poverty.
Therefore, with reference to the report by Mr Beaupuy, I should like to comment on five points which I consider important.
As a member of parliament from a country which became a Member State in the last enlargement, I cannot but welcome the effort of the Committee on Regional Development to address this issue.
The first point I should like to emphasise relates to the observation about the great disparities in terms of urban policy between the 25 Member States, particularly as a result of the enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which often have no clear and comprehensive urban policy at national or regional level.
Although I agree with this recital, we must not forget that the same drawback also applies in numerous older Member States, where urban policy is an endangered species and towns and cities are being left at the mercy of some higher power.
The effort, therefore, to address and find a viable solution to the problems which are the scourge of towns and cities must be a joint effort in all 25 Member States of the Union.
The second point on which I should like to comment and which is of major importance to Member States with a rural economy, is that towns and cities or areas form part of regional territory, and hence sustainable urban development must be pursued in harmony with neighbouring rural zones.
As you know, in numerous Member States, large rural zones often become isolated when neighbouring towns are deserted.
We therefore need to step up our efforts to make smaller towns more attractive, so that, for example, villages are not deserted in favour of cities, as this can have negative repercussions on the rural economy of some Member States.
The fact that over 80% of economic activity is exercised in towns and cities makes local authorities pillars of regional development.
Therefore, regional development and urban development have now become interconnected concepts.
Taking as a starting point the principle that urban and rural zones form part of the region and that they are interactive and interdependent zones, our action must centre on upgrading rural areas in order to iron out differences between and balance the two zones.
Similarly, on another point, the rapporteur calls on the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament to propose an amendment to Annex VÎ of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development with a view to incorporating the urban dimension specifically, in addition to regional and cohesion policy, in its objectives and competencies, taking account of the work of the other committees concerned (transport, environment, research, employment and social affairs, internal market, culture and so on) in a horizontal approach.
This message is particularly important not only because it will increase the competencies of the committee in question, but also because it will send a message to the citizens that we are concerned, we are listening, we are paying attention to the problems of their daily life and we are trying to find viable solutions.
To close, I want to say that, instead of admitting the inadequacy of sustainable policies, what we are doing is to suggest that what is to blame is a lack of support for an outdated practice, which is contrary to the Lisbon policy and is not worthy of our efforts.
We need to separate one term from the other and work â I repeat jointly â to make the vision of sustainable urban development a reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Beaupuy is drawing our attention to the urban areas as driving forces in the development of countries and regions.
Given the role of cities as development areas for knowledge and economic activity, it strikes me as useful to contemplate the specific impact cities have on attaining the Lisbon objectives.
I am pleased that the rapporteur has devoted his attention to this issue.
In addition, the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the Commission and the Member States can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities: the Commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities, and Member States by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas.
Although cross-fertilisation is necessary and possible in certain areas, this evaluation appears to be doing justice only to the fundamental powers of both Member States and the Commission.
I can therefore warmly support his calls to the Member States for added consideration to urban policy, and warmly congratulate him on this fine report.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, it is abundantly obvious that our old town centres are dying.
As one of the previous speakers rightly said, town centres are becoming places where drug addicts, criminals and migrants congregate.
The Council of Europe turned its attention to this problem some time ago, but with little success.
There certainly are economic reasons for the death of these old town centres, but the so-called European social model has aggravated the situation further.
Rents in town centres are cheap and controlled, and rents for subsidised premises on the outskirts are also low.
Consequently, people prefer not to live in the centres, because it simply does not pay them to do so.
If this policy remains unchanged so will the state of affairs, and the situation in town centres will steadily worsen.
Even now, one only has to look upwards of an evening in cities such as Brussels, Strasbourg, Venice, Rome and Florence to see the dark windows of uninhabited buildings that have usually been well maintained.
People do not wish to live in them because it does not pay them to do so.
There are also demographic reasons for this state of affairs.
The population of Europe is decreasing and this means people do not wish to live in the old town centres where criminals and drug addicts are concentrated.
If things are not put right and the economic and demographic conditions remain unchanged, nothing will be achieved.
It is worth keeping in mind that all this is the result of the so-called European social model.
Nonetheless, it suffices for someone to venture to make the least comment on the subject of this notorious social model in the House for all hell to be let loose against them.
Members will recall the statements made yesterday by CommissionerÂ McCreevy on the matter.
The Commissioner had Europeâs own interests at heart when he indicated that Europe had to become competitive and efficient, and that it cannot allow itself to be as social as it is and would like to be.
At least, that is what I gleaned from how his statements were reported.
The outcome was that CommissionerÂ McCreevy was summoned to appear before the House.
This is not the way to build Europe and it is not the way to save our beautiful old historic town centres either.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the urban dimension represents manâs way of life today and in the immediate future.
Eighty per cent of the worldâs population will be concentrated in densely urbanised areas of the planet, bringing us close to the posited by the geographer Constantinos Doxiadis in the early 1970s.
Another geographer of international repute, Jean Gottmann, described the spread of another pattern of settlement and urban development â the megalopolis â as exemplified today by the urban sprawls on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in Southern China and Japan.
The phenomenon of massive urban expansion is also underway on the coast of California, in India â between Delhi and Calcutta â as well as in Europe, along the Rhine axis of the Ruhr, which runs from Germany to the Netherlands, and in Italyâs industrial triangle of Milan-Genoa-Turin.
I will stop there or the list of examples will grow too long.
These are huge demographic melting pots of often very different cultures and social groups.
These highly artificial constructs suffer from constant energy and environmental imbalances, as well as worsening problems of communication, water supply, social tension and crime.
Unlike closed natural systems, these artificial ecosystems are configured as open systems.
They should therefore try to sustain themselves by focusing on certain priorities: reduction of waste production and improved recycling of resources; and planning of efficient horizontal dimensions, which depend not only on what a city produces and how it produces it, but also on how a city interacts with other urban centres and surrounding suburban or rural areas.
Mr Beaupuy is surely right to highlight in his report the importance of urban partnership networks, at both interregional and cross-border levels.
The dimensions of the problems encountered are spread over such a broad spatial area that it is only through an integrated approach to investment and administration â we might define it as the great urban basin â that we can hope effectively to tackle them.
We need to find a way of making sure we do not move from the reality of a âmegalopolisâ to the reality of a ânecropolisâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, 80% of the population of Europe lives in towns and cities.
Consequently, it would be absurd for the policy of the Structural Funds to ignore the problems of towns and cities, be they unemployment, crime or quality of life.
This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities, both small and large, and in 1999, I would remind you, the Community URBAN initiative was maintained at the insistence of the European Parliament.
The Beaupuy report underlines this interest and sends the message to the European Commission and the Council that we need to show an increased interest from now on in the problems of towns and cities.
We know that the Structural Fund regulations integrate the Community URBAN initiative into the basic programmes.
This is something the European Parliament welcomes and is supporting in its negotiations with the Council on the new Structural Fund regulations for the period from 2007 to 2013.
At the same time, we shall try in these negotiations to highlight the urban dimension even more, by emphasising the call for it to include a list of towns and cities which will be covered by the Structural Fund programmes for all the Member States for the period from 2007 to 2013, in order to make action by Member States on towns and cities more specific.
Similarly, we are waiting for the guidelines from the European Commission in order to ascertain how the interest of the European Union in towns and cities is being specialised, including through the guidelines, and we are here to support specific proposals by the European Commission, while remaining faithful at all times to the line which the European Parliament took a great many years ago.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I had the pleasure and privilege of working with MrÂ Beaupuy on the report on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement.
We agreed fairly early on that the problems affecting towns and cities in the new Member States are no different from those that have affected â and to a large extent continue to affect â urban centres in countries that became Member States much earlier.
I mention this merely to confirm how similar we in fact are.
I welcome the fact that Parliament is addressing the issue of towns and cities and large agglomerations and I hope that this initiative will meet with a commensurate response from the Commission in the form of practical measures.
As I discovered in discussions with representatives from Czech towns and cities â and I have no reason to doubt that the situation is similar in the other new Member States â the most pressing problems include sizeable investment deficit inherited from previous years, property inherited from the army, transport and regenerating industrial waste ground and pre-fabricated housing estates; I could go on in this vein.
We must not forget that towns and municipalities are important stakeholders in the EUâs cohesion policy.
Between 2000 and 2006 some EURÂ 30Â billion was earmarked for towns and cities, and I firmly believe that that figure will be exceeded in the forthcoming financial perspective 2007 â 2013.
Some people complain of the red tape involved in submitting projects and applications for appropriations from the European funds.
I should like to remind those people that we are talking about the money of European taxpayers, our fellow European citizens, and we must accordingly establish clear rules and exercise a certain degree of caution when dealing with them.
Â Â  Mr President, in the budget there is a whole title devoted to agriculture and rural development which indeed gobbles up half the available EU money, but there is no heading for urban support, despite the fact that, as Mr Beaupuyâs report reminds us, four-fifths of Europeans live in towns and cities.
Some of the worst deprivation, the most severe needs and the biggest environmental challenges are indeed found in our towns and cities.
However, I say to MrÂ Libicki that they are also the source of Europeâs greatest dynamism, prosperity and cultural richness.
We pay the bills.
I can and do argue to my eight million constituents in London â a figure, incidentally, which makes us a city state larger than 11 Member States but without the equivalent representation â that they should pay for sustainable rural development.
However, I cannot and will not persuade them that their hard-earned tax money should assist the purchase of another Mercedes for a cereal baron.
Nor can I honestly explain to them why the interests of the 80% majority are so overlooked in EU policy.
That is why I so welcome Mr Beaupuyâs report and indeed his leadership of the Urban and Housing Intergroup in this Parliament.
I also welcome Commissioner Hubnerâs promise of a study on the contribution of cities to regional development and the UK Presidencyâs apparent intentions to make urban development a specific objective.
It is a pity the Presidency is not represented here today.
My own particular concern is with the impact of justice and security policies on urban areas.
Asylum and immigration, and policies on tackling crime and terrorism, are of crucial concern to cities.
It is here that most migrants arrive.
It is among the ethnic minority communities of cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels that we seek cooperation to counter terrorist threats, but where alienation and poverty are sources of tension which repressive policing will only inflame.
I would be grateful if the rapporteur is able â as he has kindly indicated that he wishes to do â to make some small oral amendments to mention justice, security and liberty policies in his excellent report.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Beaupuy on his report, and say what an honour it was to be part of his team.
To date, there has been a conspicuous lack of cohesive European policy on urban-related issues, although over three quarters of the Unionâs citizens live in urban areas.
Todayâs debate is therefore indicative of genuine realism.
I am delighted a document of this nature has been drafted. I am also pleased to note that it contains references to the European Urban Charter and the New Athens Charter.
Of course, matters relating to cities cannot ever be considered without reference to the surroundings of the cities that constitute urban agglomerations.
It is also important to keep in mind the existence of extensive rural areas.
Throughout history, the development of cities has acted as a catalyst to the development of whole regions and conversely, the deterioration of the former has led to the downfall of the latter.
This is still the case, particularly as regards regional capitals, or in other words local metropolitan centres.
It therefore makes sense to include the urban environment in the strategic objectives for regional development, and consequently to provide for full participation in the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.
There certainly are some challenging specific issues relating to municipal engineering.
They include urban transport, the supply of energy and water, waste water treatment and waste recycling.
Cities have many other roles to play too, however, and I should like to mention education and the promotion of culture in particular.
Cities must also deal with a whole range of social issues.
Nowadays these include serious security matters, unemployment, and the death of city centres mentioned previously by MrÂ Libicki.
In conclusion, I should like to recall what Pope John PaulÂ II once said to representatives of Italian cities, as it links in with the human aspect referred to by the Commissioner.
The Holy Father stated that a city cannot be an end in itself.
Its end should be the service of human beings, to which cities should adjust their structures and governing principles.
He went on to say that public authorities should guard against losing sight of this truth, for fear of becoming like a machine that hums uselessly and is likely to cause injury.
Let us all therefore strive to be useful, be it in the House, in the Commission, in the Council or in any of the cities in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, urban development quite properly does not fall within the direct remit of the European Union, though in nation states it is substantially influenced by regional and other policies from Europe.
Under UrbanÂ II in my constituency in Northern Ireland, we benefited from a very worthwhile programme in North Belfast.
However, with UrbanÂ II coming to an end, a similar need in highly deprived areas in East and South Belfast remains unmet.
These are some of the areas which featured most prominently in recent street disturbances and which show high levels of deprivation and neglect.
They need far-reaching and tangible help.
I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embraces an urban dimension and, within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify, there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems.
Thus, in terms of those deprived areas of Belfast that I have mentioned, I certainly will be looking for a meaningful programme of assistance.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, new challenges have arisen for the European Union as a result of the economic situation in Europe and also of current and future enlargements.
During the last 30Â years the main focus in terms of the implementation of policy objectives has been on economic and social cohesion.
The outcome of the actions undertaken indicates the need to include territorial cohesion amongst these objectives.
In the broader context of the problems arising concerning the relationship between centres and peripheries and between metropolitan areas and small centres of population for example, the issue of urban development is becoming increasingly important.
Pursuant to the Lisbon Strategy, cities are to become centres for innovative activities intended to promote development.
They are therefore set to become the potential engines of development in the European Union.
At the same time, however, it is in those very cities that increasing internal disparities have been noted, together with a worrying increase in social problems and even the social exclusion of certain groups.
Special attention should therefore be paid to cities.
Consequently, I earnestly hope that due regard will be paid to urban-related issues in all Community policies, not just in cohesion policy.
In particular, I believe it is necessary to recognise the need for it to be mandatory to include the urban dimension in the implementation of cohesion policy tasks in the ObjectiveÂ I framework and also in ObjectiveÂ II regions It would also be appropriate to delegate authority for project management to city level when a cityâs own regeneration programmes are being implemented.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, taking it as given that the objective of our efforts is the improvement of the quality of life for all our citizens and balanced development of the societies in which we live, how can the urban dimension not be a priority issue on the political agenda?
Towns and cities play an important role in the social, economic and cultural life of Europe.
