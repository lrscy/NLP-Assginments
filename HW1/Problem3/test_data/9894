But we will withdraw our resolution.
Mr President, unfortunately it is very timely that we should be discussing these issues today in the light of current examples of restructuring.
As has been mentioned earlier, the Anglo-Dutch company Corus - the steel company - is a classic example of a company making decisions based on profit with no regard to the disastrous social costs of its actions.
Corus has just announced total job losses of 6 000 in the UK - nearly 3 000 in my own constituency in Wales.
Despite months of speculation over possible plant closures the company was unwilling to reveal its future plans to the government, let alone to its own workforce, until the formal announcement was made on 1 February.
There was no prior consultation with the workforce, although since announcing the decision the company has been holding what it calls "consultation".
There is speculation that Danone, a profitable company, is to shed 3 000 jobs in Europe.
Again there has been no consultation with the workers and no discussion about alternative ways forward.
That is why it is so important to adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers without delay, together with a review of the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive, which incidentally proved to offer so little protection to the Corus workers in my constituency.
Companies cannot be free to wreak such havoc on people's lives and communities.
There is a positive framework of controls and sanctions which we can use.
We must make sure they are effective.
Mr President, faced with massive mergers and industrial restructuring resulting in thousands of redundancies, many employees, many European citizens, have found Europe to be powerless if not actually colluding with these actions, in line with the law of free competition.
It is high time that we provided means to intervene on behalf of employees.
There is an intolerable contradiction between the Council and the Commission' s declared priority of promoting employment and the massive redundancies that big businesses are making, and who are, at the same time, making fantastic profits.
Michelin, Moulinex, Danone and Alstom are not businesses experiencing difficulties.
They are perfectly competitive, and have a record of making more than adequate profits, but they are laying off thousands of people nonetheless.
The case of Danone is very instructive, making 3 000 people redundant in Europe and 1 700 in France.
In the year 2000, this firm' s European installations made a net profit of EUR 795 million, or 17% more than in 1999.
It is not possible to sit back and simply watch the unfolding spectacle of mergers that make men and women redundant, plunging entire families into chaos.
The European citizenship we so often refer to in this society will continue to be nothing more than just so much hot air as long as employees are not properly informed and consulted on choices which determine their own future and that of their region and their country.
How, furthermore, can we find it acceptable for groups to benefit from grants of public financial aid to promote employment without being obliged to comply with the commitments they have made?
In such instances, the aid funds should be paid back to the community which will have to bear the social costs resulting from the choice of financial profitability over employment.
I do not think that the problem boils down to employability or adaptability or to simply dealing with the social fallout, as the Commissioner suggested.
I therefore endorsed the proposals made in the resolution as well as the amendments that clarify and strengthen certain aspects.
We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe.
I therefore feel that rights should be developed to the point where it is possible to halt scheduled redundancies and ongoing mergers.
Any merger contract must include social clauses.
Penalties must also be introduced for failure to comply with the directives on worker consultation.
At this time when there is a great deal of debate on the subject of European identity and the direction that European integration should be taking, I feel that a text specifying certain employee rights in the face of financial objectives would be the least that could be done so as to give the European Union a degree of credibility.
I shall therefore vote in favour of the resolution which I hope will be enhanced by a number of amendments.
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
Since it is now time for the vote, the debate is now suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Hansenne report (A5-0029/2001)
In order to justify European aid, the rapporteurs emphasise the difficult economic situation in Cambodia and Laos and the performance of the bomb disposal programmes that are essential after many years of conflict in this region, while carefully avoiding pointing out, in both instances, the significant responsibility of the imperialist powers, including France and the United States.
If this were simply European aid, pure and simple, paid as reparation for years of looting and destroying these two countries, without any form of recompense, then it would have our support.
However, this so-called aid is no more than a flimsy screen designed to conceal the goals which are revealed, nonetheless, in the phrase about turning around the downward trend of European Community exports to this region of the world, or, to put it in plain terms, enabling the predators in the shape of major European businesses to conduct, and intensify as far as possible, what is effectively still a policy of plundering this region of the world.
We have therefore abstained from voting on these reports.
Dover report (A5-002/2001)
The United Kingdom had obtained a derogation of the regulations on maximum hours of work and on night work of adolescents.
The Commission, and this report, now propose waiving this derogation.
We might have been able to welcome seeing the United Kingdom apply rules granting young people in work greater protection.
The fact is, however, that the perfect agreement that has been reached between conservatives, Labour Party members, liberals and socialists, on the end of this derogation period is based on the fact that, as the report itself says, "the possibilities for derogation [are] sufficient in order to provide the necessary flexibility" and this will not therefore have "adverse effects on employment opportunities for young people" .
This clearly demonstrates the fact not only that this regulation of the European institutions may be sidestepped, but that, even when it is applied, it does not protect youths from employers' thirst for profits.
We have voted against this report.
Unfortunately, the young workers of Britain are not likely to see a great improvement in their situation as a result of our adopting this resolution.
The directive will not meet the needs of young workers any better just because we have put an end to the scandal of this derogation for the English (as the United Kingdom did not fully comply with the directive limiting the work of children and adolescents).
This debate should, instead, have provided an opportunity to amend the directive to remove all the derogations it contains, which prevent it from being properly effective.
There is no justification for authorising young people of 14 and even 13 years of age to work in any way whatsoever [Article 4(2c)], outside compulsory school attendance [Article 8(1b)] and during school holidays [Article 8(1c)].
Nor is there any justification for the derogations allowing young people of less than 18 years of age to work more than 40 hours per week, over 8 hours per day [Article 8(5)], and do night work [Article 9(2)].
There is no justification for applying any restriction to application of the directive in the case of domestic service in a private household or to work in a family undertaking [Article 2(2)].
There is no point in denouncing child labour in Africa or Asia if we do not protect our own young people against economic exploitation and work that is harmful to health, safety and development and if we do not ensure that they receive training leading to qualifications in a system quite separate from that of the employers.
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Dover which aims to improve working conditions for young people in Britain.
It supports the view that the UK falls into line with a 1994 directive which limits the working hours of young people to eight hours a day or 40 hours a week and bans night work, although it provides for exceptions in special circumstances and for certain kinds of work.
Employment, particularly youth employment, is of course extremely important for both our young people and our economy.
We must not do anything to harm the job prospects of young people in Britain.
Sometimes, however, employers take advantage of our young workers and force them to work unnecessarily long hours.
Long hours and difficult working conditions are extremely dangerous and can be harmful to the health and productivity of our young people.
It is therefore vital that working hours are monitored and that employers are prevented from exploiting youngsters at work.
Exploitation is harmful and irresponsible.
We must act to curb it and ensure that our young people are protected from exploitation and its destructive effects by hard-pressed or greedy employers.
The legislation for reducing the working hours for young people already exists.
We just need to make sure that it is used.
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of these measures.
I find it ironic that the Tories who constantly argue against Brussels bureaucrats interfering and who opposed this legislation, do in fact support this report on social policy.
This illustrates their totally schizophrenic attitude towards Europe.
The Labour Government is at the forefront of providing jobs for our young people and also measures to protect them at work.
I strongly urge the House to show its support for the protection of young people in Britain and to vote in favour of this report.
Savary report (A5-0016/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this report, which seeks to promote railway infrastructure in Europe.
A European rail system is an important goal for Europe.
Before I left to come to Strasbourg, some pensioners urged me to vote for the report tabled by the committee chaired by Mr Hatzidakis, saying: "We want to travel throughout Europe by train and we want to travel in luxury.
We would like there to be sofas, bars, high quality restaurants and televisions on trains.
Europe can and must provide us with this as well.
We are sure that Mr Hatzidakis will make it possible."
Mr President, with the imminent accession of the Central and Eastern European countries to the Union, an efficient rail transport network is becoming more and more crucial to smooth cross-border rail transport, which is why we need to integrate the national networks into a single European network.
Ironing out differences in the specifications used by individual railway undertakings is an important step towards a trans-European network.
Creating transport connections and removing traffic bottlenecks in less favoured or remote regions is another important step.
Developing the infrastructure will also give these regions a chance to participate in and profit from the internal market.
I am very pleased to welcome the report by Gilles Savary on the interoperability of the rail system, since it approves the common position of the Council without amendments.
This common position incorporates 33 of the 46 amendments put forward at first reading.
Like the rapporteur, I think the future of the European transport system necessarily involves revitalising the rail sector.
As we have often had cause to point out, within the European Union, investments in railways are differentiated to a great extent on a national basis.
It goes without saying that these national disparities represent a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in Europe, despite the many advantages offered by this less polluting form of transport.
At the same time, the establishment of the internal market has brought about a considerable increase in the movement of goods and persons around the European Union.
This increase has mainly benefited the road sector, particular as regards freight movement.
There are many reasons for the decline in the railways.
One reason is that rail has been organised on individual national lines.
There is no single market for railway services within the Community.
Moreover, the networks are not always terribly well suited to new patterns in the organisation of economic activities and urbanisation, or indeed to the changes that these have entailed in traffic flows.
Having said that, it is clear that the future of the European transport system necessarily involves revitalising the rail sector and in short order.
I am speaking in favour of this because I believe that rail has a key role to play in solving the mobility problems facing the European Union.
On a daily basis, the citizens of Europe suffer from pollution, congestion and the risk of accidents as a result of an excessive dependence on roads, a dependence that has only been exacerbated in the course of the last thirty years.
The objective of sustainable mobility is thus closely linked to revitalising the railways.
I am pleased, moreover, that the European Parliament has succeeded in getting through some amendments, which seek to have important social standards taken into greater consideration, such as vocational qualifications and conditions of health and safety at work.
The Council also took note of a number of sensitive areas, such as, for instance, the protection of the existing railway system, the need to adopt a system of exemptions or specific cases, such as the situation of some countries that are isolated from the rest of the Community, or the difference in track gauges.
Similarly, the Council has put forward a realistic common position that draws up a gradual schedule for work and takes account of the problems which enlargement will present for the rail sector.
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Savary report.
We shall vote in favour of this report since it is important to promote the interoperability of the trans-European rail system.
The road transport network is currently saturated and in need of an overhaul.
We must also undertake procedures to increase rail transport in order to relieve the pressure on the roads.
Yet, behind the laudable objectives of the rapporteur in terms of revitalising the railway sector, we see the spectre of liberalisation, since another objective of this report is to contribute towards opening up of markets in transport services and equipment assets and towards promoting the competitiveness of the rail sector as a whole.
We must express our grave reservations on this count, since we remain steadfastly opposed to liberalisation.
If the intention is indeed to create a solution that is a real alternative to road transport taking over everything, then there must be harmonisation of the disparate rail transport infrastructures in Europe.
In this respect I am forced to agree with the rapporteur.
Furthermore, I feel that incorporating social standards, vocational qualifications and health and safety and working conditions in the process of creating a trans-European rail system would be the very least we could do.
However, I shall be extremely vigilant in ensuring that harmonisation is carried out on the basis of the best existing social rights and not at the expense of users and employees in this sector.
There is, however, a dangerous failure to address one question: in what context is network interoperability to be achieved?
In the context of public services coordinated throughout Europe, which are guarantors of jobs and safety, or in the context of a market which has been sacrificed to competition and profit?
The three directives in the railway package recently adopted by Parliament and the Council would suggest that Europe sees the future of trans-European rail transport in the second of these.
Van Dam report (A5-0037/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the van Dam report on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers. And why is that?
This time, I took the advice of Mr Fatuzzo the sailor.
I say "sailor", Mr President, because you may not be aware that I nearly made ships my career. I might even have worked on bulk carriers.
Therefore, my potential colleague, Mr Fatuzzo the sailor, the man I am not but could have been, said to me: "I have been sailing for many years on bulk carriers.
I have read the report seeking to prevent ships sinking but, in my opinion, Mr Fatuzzo the MEP, ships sink because they are too old.
Old, unusable ships need to retire.
This would make sailing safer."
I do not know whether to thank the MEP or the sailor.
There are other types of merchant vessel, apart from the oil tankers in the news, which are in a deplorable condition.
The consequences are perhaps not as spectacular as those of wrecked oil tankers, but the human death toll is far worse, when it is known that 146 bulk carriers have sunk in 10 years and that 780 crew members thereby lost their lives.
In voting for this report, we voted in favour of practical measures contributing to stepping up the safety of bulk carriers and their crews.
We must, however, point out the contradiction that exists between the concerns for safety and the concerns relating to what the report terms the risk of "distortions of competition" for European ports and terminals.
Safety is inevitably sacrificed in the attempt to safeguard the profits of shipowners and contractors.
It is a good idea to give the master the option of objecting to loading or unloading operation he considers might endanger the safety of his crew or ship.
However, it would be hypocritical to disregard the fact that the laws of competition and of the market (including the labour market) imposed by the shipowners and contractors are such that the master' s theoretical option of objecting does not carry much weight in the face of the means available to the capitalist forces in maritime transport to impose dangerous, and occasionally lethal, conditions on navigation and on living on board ships.
In 10 years, almost 150 bulk carriers have sunk, causing 800 deaths.
This is the tragic record of a sector which has been abandoned to the laws of competition and the market.
Like the rapporteur, I consider that the physical condition of the ships and the incompetence of the crew are the chief factors behind these wrecks.
So, in the first place, we have to do something about inspecting these ships, their crews and shipboard working and living conditions.
I therefore support any binding measures to improve safety standards, port State inspections and to ensure that loading and unloading terminals and masters are aware of their responsibilities.
For that, however, we have to set aside human and financial resources to actually implement the legislation in the Member States, particularly by increasing the number of inspectors.
Moreover, if we are to tackle the impunity from prosecution and leniency which prevail in maritime transport then we also have to drive home the message that shippers and shipowners are responsible too, if necessary by providing ourselves with the means to enforce judicial and financial penalties.
I shall vote in favour of all the proposals to that end.
Bakopoulos report (A5-0031/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Since it is on safety at sea, I could not fail to vote in favour of Mr Bakopoulos' report too, concerning the establishment of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution by Ships.
This time, Mr President, I communicated via e-mail with one of my former bosses who worked on the ships on which I travelled between New York and the Bahamas when, at 21 years old, before entering political life, I worked as a sailor, as I said before.
This gentleman, who has become a purser - his name is Augusto Fazio - said to me: "Well done. The European Parliament is right to concern itself with the safety of the sea and to prevent it becoming polluted.
But are you also concerning yourselves with the safety of us sailors who work on the ships?"
"Of course," I said. "Be patient.
There will also be reports dealing with your safety as well."
The proposal by Mr Bakopoulos, the rapporteur, to set up a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution by Ships, which would replace the current committees, is another step towards the renationalisation of Community policy on maritime safety, but is also an extra asset for improving monitoring of the implementation of Community and international regulations.
However, the recent disasters involving the Erika and Ievoli Sun vessels have shown that the even best resolutions are worthless unless we provide ourselves with the means to apply them and to have them applied.
That is why the legislation currently under discussion must be imposed on Member States, particularly legislation that governs prevention of pollution, monitoring the criteria regarding the training and formal qualifications of seafarers and working conditions at sea.
In order to do this, we must allocate resources to ensure the quantity and quality of inspections and inspectors, and in terms of making all concerned such as shipowners, charterers, tankers and classification societies responsible in financial terms.
In order to curb the impunity and complacency that pervade this industry, I voted in favour of this report.
Nicholson report (A5-0042/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, my name is Fatuzzo and the Italian for cod is "merluzzo"!
I will now give the interpreters a few moments to translate this profound, important connection into the other languages.
Today is 13 February, Mr President, and tomorrow is the day dedicated to lovers.
How could I fail to appreciate the European Parliament's impeccable timing in, the day before Valentine's Day, concerning itself with cod which make love in the Irish Sea, and producing a directive banning the fishing of cod between tomorrow, 14 February, Valentine's Day, and 30 April, precisely in order to allow them to reproduce?
In my opinion, with regard to respect for fish and cod, the European Parliament has done well.
Here's to Saint Valentine and here's to all lovers!
And here's to the cod as well!
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Industrial restructuring and mergers (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral question (B5-0008/2001) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the Commission, on Community initiatives relating to the social consequences of industrial restructuring and mergers.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has enabled us to take a great step towards the reconstruction of a Europe of the citizens; this is what Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo likes to tell us; this is what we have heard on many occasions from Professor RodrÃ­guez Bereijo, the representative named by the Head of the Spanish Government, Mr JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, for the convention drafting the Charter.
And I believe that this is to the liking of the Europeans.
To build, through this long process, a social Europe seems to me to be a great challenge and a great opportunity, which must be taken advantage of.
But this construction is taking place at a specific moment, in particular economic, social and political circumstances.
The Lisbon Summit decided to liberalise the telecommunications, gas, electricity and transport markets.
We are experiencing a process of general globalisation and a change in the concept of industrial society and the labour market.
We may ask ourselves: and what about the human factor?
Both Nice and the social agenda agreed at that meeting highlight the need to count on the workers in management changes and combine the security and flexibility of economic growth with labour relations and the consequences for the social environment.
And that is why, within the globalising dimension, we cannot ignore the importance of certain companies in certain regions and areas, for example the outlying regions, such as Galicia, where I come from myself, where they are the only or the main source of employment and where the threat of globalisation without guarantees would make families worried and nervous.
Secondly, economic competitiveness and a healthy society must not be contradictory terms but rather harmonious ones.
Thirdly, industrial restructuring, to use the expression in a broad sense, which is perhaps acceptable and inevitable from an economic point of view, cannot ignore the social consequences of that restructuring, which must be prepared for, since the objective of Community economic policies and measures must be to achieve a high level of employment.
Fourthly and lastly, national Community aid, tax incentives etc. should be conditional upon long-term temporary binding commitments in the field of employment and local and regional development.
These four points are only some of the considerations that the Commission and the Council must take into account in the face of the phenomenon of industrial restructuring.
Of course, the participation of the works committees, the representatives of the workers, is expected.
Mr President, globalisation reduces economic distances.
We must commit ourselves to preventing it from increasing social differences.
Mr President, Commissioner, the cases of industrial restructuring which are most traumatic, because they are unforeseeable, are those dictated by aggressive, acquisitions-seeking behaviour in the market.
Much has been said about the lack of technical adaptation and market trends, but the extent of their social consequences is never considered.
Do we know how much they have contributed to the impoverishment of people and regions?
Do we know how those that suffer from them recover from depression and at what cost?
Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the long-term unemployment of people over the age of forty?
Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the fact that the true retirement age in the European Union is between fifty-five and fifty-seven?
The Lisbon resolutions were designed to respond to these points by giving priority to employment, to the viability of social protection, to combating social exclusion and also by preventing changes to the economy.
We do not know how much these approaches are contributing to increasing social security costs and we do not know how many people are becoming more dependent on systems of social protection.
Who is it that ultimately pays for social restructuring?
Is it the market or the taxpayer and the working person?
Prevention and fair, balanced change are impossible. The social partners say so and have even just signed a pre-agreement document in order to implement the directive on European society concerning information and consultation.
Commissioner, we have also heard it said that the market is not governed by the laws of nature and that the political authorities should act by means of legislation, institutional action and social dialogue.
Social insecurity and the increase in crime are becoming part of post-industrial society and affect both traditional sectors and the so-called new economy.
The Portuguese, French, and now Swedish Presidencies have raised expectations by pushing ahead with dossiers that had been hitherto neglected.
The Commission' s programme for 2001, however, gives no hint of these dossiers being brought to a successful conclusion.
Mr President, there is no justification for large companies making part of their workforce redundant on the pretext of mergers or restructuring, when just a small fraction of their profits would be enough to safeguard the jobs that have been lost.
Danone, Michelin, Aventis, Bull, Alstom, Moulinex and similar companies have shown a total disregard for the workers that they have made redundant and for the regions that may be condemned to a slow decline by the closure of a factory, and this shows the harm that these companies inflict on society.
We oppose the political opinions, in this House or elsewhere, that justify these criminal activities.
Such opinions show that they do not in any way seek to act in the interests of society; only in the interests of the industrial and financial groups that dominate the economy and in the interests of the owners and shareholders of these groups.
We also oppose those who pretend to deplore the effects of restructurings on society yet who do nothing to propose the slightest binding measure to prevent them.
Apart from a complete ban on job losses upon large companies which are making a profit, all other action is mere posturing.
We assure those who work for these companies, and who are fighting off these attacks upon them, that they have our solidarity.
They have chosen the only sensible route in this economy dominated by the law of the jungle.
Mr President, in her speech before the House this morning, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel expressed her amazement and alarm at the frequency with which this issue comes up in this House, and wondered why this is.
I too am amazed at how often it crops up.
We are concerned at the tragic implications of industrial restructuring and mergers - of which the workers are all too often only informed at the last minute when all the decisions have been made - for unemployment, working conditions, the very competitiveness of Community businesses and economic cohesion, and we appeal to companies' sense of responsibility and express our sympathy, but then we do not follow the cases up.
Community legislation does not go far enough and, what is more, in many cases it is disregarded or applied too leniently.
I could produce a long list, as many Members have done, of relevant cases which we have discussed in recent years.
One of the objectives set by the Lisbon Council was to achieve a high level of high quality employment.
How can we achieve a Europe which is both competitive and has a high level of high quality employment?
Of course, this can be accomplished by improving coordination and the play of balance between the Union's different policies, but there is no doubt that the Community legislation on the subject needs to be more effective and more stringent.
Therefore, we can wait no longer - and here the Commission must assume its responsibilities - for a revision of the directive on European works councils, mass redundancies and relocation of enterprises, which does not make specific provision for a system of effective penalties for failure to comply.
But what really appals me - and here I refer to the Council in particular - is that it is already two years since Parliament expressed its opinion at the first reading of the only instrument which would allow us to deal effectively with these issues, the information and consultation directive, and in these two years, despite the general agreement that dialogue is the best way to deal with problems, the Council has not yet been able to summon up the courage or the strength to adopt a position on the matter.
Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour.
Mr President, the Financieel Dagblad (Financial Times) published last Friday, 2 February, carried the front-page headline: "Corus gives a fifth of its workers their marching orders" .
A little further on in the financial pages, there was the headline: "Corus experiences sharp upturn" .
The contrast in the pictures - it is a shame I cannot show them to you - was almost more telling: on the front page there was a picture of a sad steelworker from Wales, and in the financial pages a graph of how the profits went up when these redundancies were announced.
This sort of news is commonplace now.
It confronts us with the fundamental question as to what actually motivates businesses these days.
Are they only in it for the money or do they have a broader vision and mission?
In the Netherlands, the Socio-Economic Council published two important opinions recently, one about doing business in a socially responsible manner, with the grand title: "The acquisition of values" , and the other was about corporate governance and industrial relations.
In its opinions, the Council expressly opts for a broad characterisation of a business as a joint venture between various stakeholders, and so it expressly avoids focusing attention on the creation of shareholder value for the shareholders, who seem to be the main reason behind many of the restructuring operations that have recently taken place.
I see no evidence of this broader perspective or these more fundamental discussions in the European debate.
The European Parliament has put this issue on the agenda again today, but this discussion must also filter through into other areas of European policy.
To my mind, it lacks coherence in this respect.
I will cite two examples.
As regards the legislation on partnerships, people argue in completely one-dimensional terms from the perspective of the shareholders.
A case in point was the discussion on the thirteenth directive on takeover bids, when Mr Bolkestein well and truly dismissed Parliament' s amendments.
Another example can be found in competition policy.
Commissioner Monti made it abundantly clear in our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that he only wants to approach mergers from the point of view of the markets and consumers, and has little interest in the bigger picture.
A Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, as announced this morning, is not enough.
I feel the Commission must make it its business to develop a more integrated outlook, and to ensure that this works its way through into the various policy headings.
Newspapers may display a certain amount of schizophrenia, but not politicians and policy makers.
Mr President, as the honourable Members have said, some of the directives were obviously adopted in times of full employment and very slow change.
Certain parts of the legislative framework therefore need amending and changing.
But I think that we should acknowledge the attempt being made in Europe to strike a balance between competitiveness and social cohesion.
Restructuring, mergers and takeovers do indeed often have dramatic consequences.
We recently saw over 5 000 jobs lost in a single month as the result of takeovers.
But if we look at the competitive environment as a whole, if we look at the environment in which European companies operate, then we will realise that there would be very adverse consequences if there were no reorganisation or restructuring, if European companies did not take an active part in the business economy.
And we need to calculate how many jobs are saved every time, because unless they restructure, some sectors risk disappearing altogether in the future.
In this extremely difficult environment, there are four strands to our efforts to combine social cohesion and competitiveness.
The first is forecasting.
This morning we examined how, through the Dublin Institute, we are trying to study, forecast and prepare changes.
The second is the legislative and institutional framework.
As you know, huge changes were made this year to legislation on the European company statute and to the five directives which follow and complete the legislative framework on the European statute, and the directive on information and consultation finally went to the Council after years of discussion between Parliament and the Commission and we achieved a majority within four months.
We reckon that, with the undertakings made by the Swedish Presidency and following the Belgian Presidency, significant changes will be made to the legislative framework.
I should point out here that legislation alone is not enough and that serious efforts have been made to extend controls.
We are also endeavouring, in cooperation with Commissioner Monti, to check that the directives on information for workers are being properly applied during all mergers and takeovers.
In addition, a committee was recently set up within this legislative framework, one of the basic subjects of which is social dialogue and the role of social dialogue in helping to ensure that mergers and restructuring proceed smoothly.
The third strand is specific policy.
The strategy on employment and the availability of money from the Social Fund mean that problems of mass redundancies can be dealt with at national level, by retraining workers, through special structures to support their reintegration into the job market or by helping them start up their own companies.
Finally, the fourth strand is the role of companies, the social responsibility of companies.
This is one of the new basic items on the social agenda; we expect workers to change, to agree to a new, flexible environment, to train, to be prepared to move from one sector to another or one place to another.
But we cannot just ask workers to change their behaviour, which is why companies too have a new role in this area.
We are trying very specifically to define - and the second stage will be to look at this from an institutional point of view - to define the social responsibility of companies, their responsibilities in the wake of restructuring and their responsibilities in the local area, in the society in which they operate, which is why, as we said this morning, a Commission communication will be presented at the end of June.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Copyright and related rights in the Information Society
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/2001) by Mr Boselli, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with regard to the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the Information Society [9512/1/2000 - C5-0520/2000 - 1997/0359(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive regulates the protection of copyright and related rights in the information society.
It is an important directive and its path has by no means been easy.
We have reached the second reading and Parliament is now called upon to express its opinion on the position adopted by the Council which, as you will remember, was forwarded to us 18 months after it had been adopted at first reading.
The reason for this is that a controversial, delicate compromise had to be found between all the interests covered by the directive.
I see this difficult, delicate compromise as a step forward for, apart from anything else, it includes many of the points proposed by Parliament at first reading.
There was room for improvement in some parts of the directive and this is what I have attempted to do.
Although some compromise amendments were adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, opinion is still divided, particularly with regard to the article on copying for technical purposes, or caching, and the article on private copying.
There are many amendments regarding this point which I do not endorse.
The reason why, as far as private copying is concerned, the compromise amendments adopted in committee represented a major new development benefiting the authors lies in the fact that they stipulate that private copying - and I quote - must be "made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly or indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation".
This amendment introduces a new principle into Community legislation, in that it limits the scope of the definition of private copying, to the benefit of the authors, while clearly, at the same time, safeguarding the legitimate interests of the consumer.
This amendment, adopted by the committee, halts the huge increase in exchanges of unauthorised copies between users of sites such as Napster, and it will mean that it is no longer possible to describe the exchange of unauthorised works between Napster users as private copying.
I see this as an improvement on the text of the common position.
With regard to the other element, technical copying, I feel that the balance achieved in the common position is more than sufficient to protect both rightholders and consumers.
Although the intention behind the amendments tabled on this issue - Article 5, point 1 - to provide greater copyright protection is commendable, none of the amendments are acceptable, apart from anything else because they relate to application, not regulation which is the subject of this directive.
Furthermore, these amendments are intended to introduce a system of dual authorisation of works on the Internet, one for hosting and one for caching, which would be a heavy burden for the network management.
Therefore, to sum up, the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market showed that it is possible to reach a broad consensus, to adopt the directive and to improve the common position without running the risk of a long, tedious conciliation procedure; all this after three years of debate, argument and dispute.
In my opinion, this is an opportunity which the European Parliament must take: if, tomorrow, it supports the agreement reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and adopts the amendments which are the result of a broad compromise between a large number of political groups, then we will, at last, be able to adopt the directive.
This will benefit not only the European Union, which has been waiting for legislation on the subject for a long time, but also and most importantly, the rightholders.
Indeed, if the directive is adopted, not only will the exceptions which are still disputed enter into force, but also, most importantly, the rule established by Article 2 which lays down the principle of authorisation of rightholders for the use of works in new digital environments.
For all these reasons, it should I hope, be possible, at last, to adopt the text of this directive tomorrow.
Mr President, before beginning my speech, I must confess that I have a double interest in this issue.
On the one hand, I am an owner of intellectual property, being the author of several books and publications, and, on the other, I am a member of the Internet Foundation, which has various supporters in this Parliament.
Today coincides with an important event from the point of view of intellectual property in the information society, that is the judgment of the San Francisco Appeal Court in the Napster case, which brings us closer to finally resolving the vexed question of the use of the Internet to breach intellectual property rights.
The judgment of the San Francisco Court of Appeal confirms intellectual property rights and establishes certain measures for the protection of intellectual property in the United States.
The challenge facing us is to ensure that Europe also establishes a system which would safeguard intellectual property, otherwise we could find that, by means of installations in Europe, the effective protection measures which are currently being adopted in the United States under the Millennium Law, which has been in force for more than two years, could be violated.
We are lagging behind the United States, and, in this respect, I am in agreement with the rapporteur in the sense that we should bring this directive into play as soon as possible.
Now, in doing so, the Socialist Group is concerned that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.
We have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important.
Firstly, the amendment relating to what is known as private copying.
Private copying, which was a traditional right of any person obtaining an intellectual work or intellectual property, must now, in the information society, be subject to very strict requirements, because of the enormous ease of reproduction.
This amendment proposes that the private copy should be intended for the personal use of the person making it, because otherwise, given the ease of reproduction, we run the risk that many copies can be made for the private use of persons other than the person making the copy.
Secondly, another very important amendment is the one relating to the incidental and transitional nature of reproduction.
If, as a consequence of the processes established by the information society, it is necessary to make a copy of a transitional and incidental nature, this should be intended to be of a genuinely transitional nature.
It would be unacceptable to create large libraries of intellectual property so that, at any given moment, the person who has been using that property can access it at will.
We believe that the accumulation of requirements that they be of a transitional and incidental nature is essential to safeguarding intellectual property.
I hope that in tomorrow's vote the various political groups can come to an agreement in order to offer alternatives which will truly guarantee the protection of intellectual property in the information society, since in a few years time, all intellectual property will probably be of the type that travels around the great communications networks.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to heap praise on Mr Boselli for his handling of this topic.
It was a tough job and he had to walk on eggshells to do it, but I feel he has managed to strike a better balance with the aid of his compromise amendments.
I also think - and perhaps we should really look into this as a Parliament some time - that there has perhaps been more lobbying over this issue than I have ever experienced in my brief career as an MEP.
If you consider that over 300 lobbyists have an interest in this report, then that means half a lobbyist to every MEP, and perhaps a few question marks are in order here too.
It would be a good thing if the common position, together with Mr Boselli' s compromise amendments were to be adopted tomorrow.
The liberals disagree on quite a few points, but as I understand it, we are at least united behind it, and I think that is indeed a positive sign.
In addition, there are a number of issues that Mr Boselli and Mr Medina have already mentioned today.
I have yet to see whether the compromise amendment on private copies goes far enough because I still have not read to the end - and as a lawyer, I dealt with intellectual property in my practice over a long period of time. I have yet to discover whether it is now no longer possible for a student to make copies for all his or her fellow students which they are allowed to use in private.
I have my doubts about this because I think it will allow illegal copying to continue with a vengeance.
So I am in favour of restricting private usage.
I also have my doubts about the technical measures that Member States are at liberty to introduce.
I fear that this will have a distorting effect on the internal market and will lead, in the final analysis, to the Court of Justice having to settle the matter again on the basis of the internal market principles.
Caching, now that is something I still have some difficulty with, the way things are going at the moment.
I believe this only has to do with the e-commerce directive, so I hope the Commissioner will take another look at the issue.
I would like to close with a comment, and I hope - on behalf of the Liberal Group at any rate - that an even-handed and fair balance will be found in this directive for all market participants and all parties concerned, and I feel that the digital copy should be regarded as an opportunity and not a threat.
Mr President, my thanks to all the honourable Members for their constructive cooperation and, above all, to the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Boselli.
Numerous problems, numerous conflicts of interest have still not been resolved.
Harmonising cultural traditions is no easy task.
A compromise does not really satisfy anyone and the European Parliament does not hold a magic wand. There is talk of a balanced common position.
A balance between whom? Between rightholders and the public interest.
First and foremost - and this is my opinion and the opinion of the Greens - the rightholder's status under copyright law must be strengthened.
Copyright law must serve the rightholder.
His position must be strengthened for future contract negotiations.
As a politician for culture, my responsibility is, firstly, to give rightholders a secure basis for their existence and, secondly - and I do not mean secondarily but equally - to guarantee the public free access and, at the same time, ensure that high-quality works are available to the public in all their diversity.
We are opposed to extending the list of exceptions; some of the contentious points can perhaps be resolved between the parties, because we too are keen to find a satisfactory solution which we can all live with.
The Greens, you may have noticed, confined themselves to proposed amendments which relate solely to the rightholder - I refer to Amendments Nos 34 and 36. Perhaps, you will say, they anticipated future contracts.
Allow me now to reply: much is anticipated in the recitals which is of benefit not to the rightholder author but to other interested parties.
And as the Napster case has already been raised, Europe should discuss whether or not it wants a miniature version, a European Napster, and then it should hold a round table discussion between providers, producers, rightholders and consumers.
But I would not want Napster to find its way to Europe, in through the back door simply because copyright law is weak and the wording woolly.
This too is a possibility which we should debate.
We shall also have to hold a discussion at some point in the future - soon, I hope - on performing rights societies and on the possibility of contracts for copyright contract law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after considering this issue of the directive on copyright and harmonisation which primarily involves a list of exceptions, I feel that we have quite simply agreed to maintain a confused situation in order to give ourselves time to give some thought to this matter.
This confusion is due to the fact this directive represents three different interest; i.e. authors and creative artists, consumers, who are also users, and producers and market makers.
Producers and market makers are trying to fit in between the other two and I feel that the directive is also in this uneasy position with its list of exceptions, to which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has just added another, extremely problematic, exception regarding broadcasting.
I believe that we are favouring the opinion of consumers.
However, what are we trying to make them buy?
I put to you the question: just what shall we buy in the near future, if we fail to protect and defend creativity?
That is the question we should ask ourselves.
As it happens, outside my parliamentary career, I have written books and I use public libraries and research centres.
In both cases, we need to have some protection, some security rather than insecurity, in order to be able to produce works.
If I look at this from the consumer' s point of view, I am surprised that Parliament, the defender of Market Europe, defends production in this market in such an ultimately very poor fashion, because, given this list of exceptions, people will refuse to pay for goods which they will want for nothing.
You must admit that it is surprising.
The conditions in which these goods are produced are not being questioned either; yet, to produce goods, we need creative artists and authors.
I have no idea what you will sell or buy when you no longer have any creative artists or authors but, in any case, Market Europe will not fare very well.
That is what will happen to the markets.
Now, if we take a close look at the details of the directive, it becomes apparent that if we say, for example, that archives come into being immediately, or after an hour, this means that everything broadcast on television is archive material.
Anyone with an interest in history is slightly surprised to hear archives being defined in this way.
If archives are just that and if private copying is widespread, what can we do to ensure that culture, and indeed cultural diversity, is not just heritage, museums, not just a list that we will find in places that are the stuff of archives and museums, but that it is a living creative field?
To do that, we must - like it or not - assist artistic creation.
To assist artistic creation, we must support copyright rather than criticise and attack it.
That is what my group will try to defend by its vote tomorrow.
Mr President, the report that has been presented on copyright and the information society, or rather the alleged information society, is a perfect example of the increasing depravity of a Community system whose only motivation is, in fact, to create a market where all products, goods and services are included.
Although the harm caused by this system is obvious, because harmonisation provides less protection than that previously afforded by Member States, despite that fact - I shall not give an example - the Commission and the Council are now proposing to transform all cultural services into saleable commodities, as Mrs Fraisse has just clearly said.
Using as an excuse the concept of the information society, which the financial markets are in the process of levelling out - we have come a long way in the last three years - this directive and the common position, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market suggests we adopt, seek to make all European creativity, i.e. all creative artists, subject to the international trade regulations of the World Trade Organisation, though it is here dubbed the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
It is utterly ironic that the European Union institutions are basically in the process of becoming a subservient lapdog to globalisation without restriction or conscience.
That is why I believe that many of us here in this House will try to stop the acceleration of this process which completely strips the concept of Europe of all content and all meaning.
I hope that we shall reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because they break with the tradition of a Parliament - as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly said - which has, until now, defended diversity in cultural production in Europe and the specific, and indeed exceptional role, of creative artists, writers and artists in European civilisation.
The information society is no more than a snare and we are indulgently allowing it to be used here in an attempt to confiscate the most timeless and most precious thing we can own - intellectual property.
Mr President, all copyright consists in a balancing of two sets of interests, on the one hand the authors' , producers' and production systems' interests and, on the other hand, the consumers' interests.
It might be said that consumers' interests are society' s interest in seeing the dissemination of both knowledge and cultural expression rather than the suppression of these and their subordination to the interests of capital.
Naturally, creators and authors must, and ought to, be assured of a fair economic return, but I have to say that, for me and the People' s Movement I represent, there are two crucial main points.
The first is to ensure the public' s or consumers' interest in being able to use both knowledge and culture.
In Denmark, the country I come from, we have a very well developed tradition of youth and adult education, and this must not be interfered with.
The second point is that the systems of enforcement and sanctions that have been developed and are practised in the different legal cultures in the different countries must not be interfered with either.
We have our own special system in Denmark, and I do not think it should be substantially interfered with.
I can say that I have seldom been exposed to such intensive lobbying as in connection with this proposal, and that is by no means strange.
There are billions of kroner and euros in the system in a sector dominated on the producer side by, above all, the American entertainment industry, but it is not of course this that we must mainly take an interest in.
I might also add that copyright is, of course, among the most complicated aspects of the legal world and that, within the copyright field, the law relating to digital products is practically incomprehensible.
I cannot imagine that more than a few per cent of MEPs at the most have any idea at all of what the problems really relate to.
Against this background, it is an interesting fact, and one worth noting, that the proposal has been so balanced that I shall recommend my group to vote in favour of it.
Mr President, as the first speaker from my group, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur on behalf of all my colleagues who work closely with him.
We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive.
As the rapporteur said earlier, with the compromise amendments - the set of amendments passed by our committee - I am sure that we have the right directive at the right time.
No one pretends that it is perfect.
It is important to emphasise that.
There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions.
There are countries that have levies, for example, on recording media.
We have sustained the objective of this directive because, above all, we want to encourage new creative artists to exploit this new technology.
This is an enabling, liberating directive.
It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards.
Equally, on the balancing side, consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies, to be able to use library facilities, to be able, if they are disadvantaged, if they are blind or disabled, to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded.
We have got that balance right.
The other point, colleagues, is that we are not arrogant enough in the Legal Affairs Committee to suggest to you that this is here for all time.
We have proposed and recommend very strongly to you that in 18 months' time this directive be reviewed.
We must, in a very fast-moving world, take responsibility for our work but be prepared to modify it in accordance with what is going on in an entirely new world.
That is a very important provision.
We have strengthened the review provisions.
We propose a very speedy turnaround, and that shows that the Legal Affairs Committee has taken a very responsible attitude to this directive.
We now want to get it transposed as soon as possible.
Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible?
Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved.
That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor, despite the fact that I have not yet written a book and have not read a great many.
The protection of intellectual property has always been a cause for concern to the European Union and to the European Parliament, because we know that only this protection guarantees that we have culture, that culture flourishes and that economic production takes place.
This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament.
But it is not.
For the first time in our lives, the protection of intellectual property is being undermined. With the consent of the European Parliament.
As we have found out, the European Parliament still has only one objective: no conciliation.
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council, we have been told to get a move on. After 18 months of deliberation in the Council.
And then the Council says "unanimously", although it could have voted by a qualified majority, given the balance we keep hearing about.
And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments.
We might just as well shut up shop and go home.
I have never seen Members put under such pressure by their governments and parties.
But with the Council and the governments on either side, in the Council and in Parliament, what need is there for Parliament?
Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it.
The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights.
I am on the authors' side and I call on Parliament to restore these rights - at least to some degree.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that many people must have been rather anxious when Mr Harbour said he wanted to see a review of the directive within 18 months.
So, is there to be a return to all that lobbying?
Is it not all a bit too soon?
Everything that can be said about the directive has already been said.
It is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now.
I nonetheless want to express my warm thanks to our wonderful rapporteur.
I also want to say that the official line of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at first reading was more balanced than that of the parliamentary majority.
We may therefore also consider that essential parts of the common position need to be changed.
At first reading, we were concerned that the parliamentary majority was jeopardising the Internet' s function and that there was a danger of creating a system which also made it unattractive to have material on the Net in Europe.
The results of the Human Genome Project have been published on the Net in the last few days, partly in the journal, Nature and partly in the journal, Science.
Via Nature, everyone can access the material but, via Science, it can only be accessed by paying SEK 3 million.
That is, of course, a protection of copyright.
But is it the same thing as promoting the spread of science and knowledge?
Where is the right balance to be found?
This is something I believe we should reflect upon when we adopt a position on the directive.
I also want to point out once again that our group' s official position now is to have as few amendments as possible.
The common position is a fragile compromise which must not be disturbed. Otherwise, we might not get the WIPO Treaty signed, which is of course the most important thing.
Mr President, it is a great privilege to take part in this important debate.
I am a bit sad that the tone of the debate has been in part negative and guarded.
We need to remember that new communication media have in fact liberated interaction between people and ideas and between people and people.
Of course, that does give rise to some reasonable concerns about the protection of legitimate copyright interests in this age.
Meeting these concerns must not result in obstructing the ordinary person, the scholar or the scientist from accessing and using materials that are subject to copyright.
The balance between producer interest and consumer interest has been stressed in this debate and is the balance that we have to try and strike.
If we in the Union were to strike the wrong balance, it would seriously inhibit the democratic openness of discussion that the Internet and related media facilitate.
If, for example, unreasonable restraints are placed on libraries, students, scholars and scientists will be the sufferers.
The Inter-Library Loan scheme might become an accidental casualty of change.
The draft directive before us refers critically in Article 5.5 to the well-established restraints on fair practice that are enshrined in the Berne Convention.
Subject to this, Member States will be able to create regulated limits on copyright interests for the benefit of disabled people, private consumers, public libraries and museums and some others.
That is permissive - Member States will not, in any case, be required to do it. It will be a matter for local judgment guided by subsidiarity.
As an author myself, I yield to no one in maintaining the rights of authors and performers - I add "performers" deliberately - to fair recognition and reward, but these values will be misapplied if they are used as a ground for obstructing reasonable limitations on commercial copyright interests and, I stress "the commercial interests", which we need to differentiate from the moral right of the author, which is expressly excluded from this directive.
Like others, I am delighted with Mr Boselli's work and I hope that we will pass this with relatively few changes.
Mr President, serious infringements of and a lack of protection for intellectual property have long been a way of life in Greece, well before the advent of the information society.
With the new technologies available, artists are now looking more than ever to the European Union to deal with this issue at Community level.
Clearly, there are numerous contradictory points, multiple pressures and disputed theories and we ourselves - over and above the lobby - have seen another side of authors, another side of consumers of these works and, in this sense, I think that the work undertaken by Mr Boselli and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the work of a magician.
I think they have seriously improved on the Council's common position, which did too little to protect intellectual property.
It is important that we limit the exceptions and I think that the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market is a careful amendment, although it might have gone further.
We also have to take care with libraries and archives because, if we make various amendments here, we will end up infringing intellectual property rights.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having the wisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job and the tenacity of myself.
In particular, this issue, which is difficult and has been a very arduous task for all of us in the Legal Affairs Committee, has thrown up a number of conflicts, one of which most often mentioned within this House is the conflict between copyright-holders and consumers.
Many people feel that these two differing groups cannot be reconciled.
I believe that within the present text we have the opportunity to reconcile these two parties, and to lay down a number of fundamental principles which could be copied in other parts of the world.
These principles comprise, firstly, remuneration for those who are entitled to remuneration for creative works and for new ideas; secondly, the right of access to those works; thirdly, the rights of libraries and other institutions, educational institutions in particular, to make use of these works for research purposes; and fourthly the introduction of a number of exceptions to the copyright legislation to ensure that people with disabilities will not be unfairly discriminated against and to ensure that educational institutions can continue.
This is no easy task.
Each of us has a right, and indeed a responsibility, to ensure that we can maintain the best possible balance for all within the fundamental principles of consumer rights and protection as well as remuneration for the artists.
Mr President, I would, of course, also like to commend Mr Boselli' s determination to achieve a balance in a text that has been under discussion for nearly three years.
His task was made all the more difficult by the Council' s failure to adopt all Parliament' s amendments at the first reading stage.
As has been mentioned, the aim of the new directive is to adapt current legislation to the new technologies while respecting the international treaties adopted in 1996.
There is a legal void with regard to copyright protection in the digital age.
The Internet is a powerful tool but it must not be an unregulated area.
The cultural and economic stakes are high and, with the Internet expanding at an incredible pace, a legal framework in Europe must be found, as in the United States, where this kind of framework was adopted two years ago.
It is, therefore, an urgent matter, all the more so because this directive is a key factor in the fight against illegal copying, a matter particularly close to my heart, and because pirate copying is the scourge of the information society. It becomes all the more crucial in a digital age because the first copies and any subsequent copies retain a quality close to that of the original.
Consumers are acknowledged as being entitled to make private copies.
It is only natural that the eligible parties are fairly compensated in return, it is only fair.
In order to ensure that we are talking about purely private copies, the law must be written in sufficiently restrictive terms and the wording of the definition must be perfectly unambiguous.
So I am in favour of a restrictive definition of private copying.
In order to protect works of art against illegal copying, eligible parties must be given the opportunity to use technical protection.
That is why hackers, as they are called, must be fought by clamping down on the means they offer to the public to overcome protection systems, thereby encouraging the illegal copying of protected works of art.
This new context is constantly changing and raises many questions and concerns.
The directive must balance the interests of consumers and eligible parties.
It is trying to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but in a necessarily imperfect way.
If we amend this directive, we shall, in two years' time, be able to determine its shortcomings and weaknesses in the light of the incredible developments in the information society.
Mr President, as we say in my country, 'until the baskets are washed, it is still harvest time' . In other words, hope remains for authors and performers that this Parliament will have a change of heart, if not today then tomorrow.
I say this because I believe that a balance can be reached between the democratisation of knowledge that the new technologies and the Internet offer us with one click of the mouse and the continuity of the creative act, which will die out as a result of non-payment and lack of fair compensation for its value.
The virtual contradictions that mask financial interests and demagogic opposition are therefore unacceptable in this real social debate.
Let us not be naive, Mr President.
Creation and performance are economic factors and always have been. Hence the need for copyright and performers' rights.
Unfortunately, the Commission proposal and the Council common position reveal a degree of thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism.
In the name of consumer freedom, the consumption of art is pitted against artistic creation, in the same way that the Council accepts creative freedom as an obstacle to knowledge and to Europe' s citizens becoming enriched by culture.
New media technologies are not the enemies of intellectuals and authors, but we cannot pretend that, in this cyber world we live in, protecting the weakest member, i.e. authors, means defending a monopoly.
Let us not, in the name of consumers' rights, sacrifice authors' rights, and, above all, let us not accept the idea that artistic creation should be suspicious of technology, which is the cardinal sin of the text we are discussing.
Mr President, despite the considerable efforts that have been made and despite a certain amount of progress, which is due to the attitude of our rapporteur, whom I warmly congratulate, we still do not have a text that brings together the three fundamental freedoms of the cultural act: the freedom to create, the freedom to communicate and the freedom to consume.
Unless we achieve this quickly, some of Europe' s fundamental values will disappear for good.
Furthermore, our languages will be of little use if, at the altar of technology, they become merely the remnant of the identity that gives any European uniqueness in the eyes of the world.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Members from the various groups for supplying the 32 signatures which allowed me to submit a number of amendments in Parliament.
I am absolutely convinced that we must endeavour, on a couple of points, to revert back to Parliament' s opinion from the first reading, which we adopted exactly two years ago by a very large majority.
It is mainly to do with tightening up on private copying, establishing clear regulations for the on-line storage of data so that the responsibility of Internet providers is better defined in line with the e-commerce directive, and the possibility of Member States being able to introduce technological protection measures without disrupting the internal market.
Why am I defending this opinion?
First and foremost for reasons of principle.
Is there anything more important than protecting private property?
Is there anything more personal than the product of human talent, the creation of something which rejuvenates.
The European Parliament has always been the guardian of Europe' s cultural heritage and that is how it must stay, also in the digital age.
If we do not put a brake on indiscriminate copying, there will soon be nothing left to copy.
After all, if we fail to provide protection, people will lose the incentive to be creative and produce new works of art.
But there is more to this debate than principles.
Copying will also cost jobs.
According to current estimates, one hundred thousand jobs have been lost in the European Union owing to the copying of CDs.
The State loses out on income too.
Apparently, the State of Belgium alone, which I know very well, misses out on one billion Belgian Francs in VAT as a result of this practice, and the same goes for all government coffers.
We must be in no doubt about what it is we are risking.
I would like to echo Mr Rothley' s sentiments.
So all in all, I think there is good reason to support the amendments which I tabled, together with many of my fellow delegates, for which I would like to thank you in advance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is of great importance to growth and competitiveness in Europe, but the directive does not need to be worded in such a way as to make using the Internet more difficult and more expensive.
If we impose higher costs on e-commerce and increase the cost of connection, Europe will not be the world' s most competitive economy in ten years' time, which was, of course, the goal set in Lisbon.
If we in Parliament are to increase people' s confidence in us as European legislators, European legislation must be coherent.
The e-commerce directive and this directive must be in line with each other.
We must not therefore alter Article 5.1 or recital 33. Copyright must not become a patent right because of the new technology.
Our good will towards copyright holders must not involve our creating regulations which restrict freedom of expression or obstruct the free flow of information.
The ceiling above which an outsider' s server may be closed down must be set very high.
If every bit of data that passes through the server every second is to be monitored, we forfeit what basically has made the Internet successful and has increased productivity in countries with high Internet use, namely the fact that everyone gets to be involved and to share knowledge.
I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 4.
Our copyright legislation must be created around the work and around the artist entitled to remuneration, and not around the technical form.
TV channels must decide for themselves how they make their programmes and the music they want to play available.
A right to copy on-air broadcasts for storage on electronic systems is required because, otherwise, the giant recording companies will be able to control the radio and television companies' music output.
I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32.
Copyright is not absolute. Exceptions are required.
I therefore hope that the Chamber will safeguard the exceptions for libraries and for people with disabilities so that we do not undermine democracy by shutting people off from information.
Finally, we have a WIPO position to defend, and we must vote consistently.
I am hoping for a positive decision, for then we shall be accepting international responsibility.
Mr President, even as we try at second reading to tweak the common position on copyright here and there, we should not lose sight of the fact that, whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote or of the impending conciliation procedure, we have achieved both very little and a great deal.
Very little because the level of harmonisation of copyright in the European Union will not be very high, much lower in fact than in many other less important areas.
National traditions are simply too varied here and the interests of all those involved are too diverse and too contradictory.
But, compared with the current situation, we will have achieved a great deal if the directive as contained in the common position or, even better, with the amendments adopted tomorrow, can be improved and can enter into force quickly.
At least we now have a standard definition for a few core concepts.
The full development of the information society will no longer be impeded by a grossly insecure legal framework and rightholders and their agents will have ways of protecting their interests.
Technical means of protection in particular are developing at a very fast pace.
At the same time, however, we must guarantee wide public access in the interest of cultural diversity.
This obviously includes not criminalising consumers or charging them several times over.
It also includes developing cultural heritage, such as the cultural heritage stored in television archives, and ensuring that libraries are able to fulfil their valuable role in the online world.
Like some of my fellow Members, I feel that the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has compromised the hard-struck balance in favour of the exceptions and I therefore hope that at least some of the proposed amendments tabled by my group will still be accepted.
Mr President, as an author and member of the Portuguese Society of Authors, I have a personal interest in a matter in which the cultural standing of European integration itself is also at stake.
It makes no sense for Europe to herald the fundamental value of its cultural and linguistic pluralism and, at the same time, render it devoid of meaning.
I do not know of a single author in Europe who agrees with the compromise amendments on private copying.
This means something.
I also wish to say that it would be much better if the directive were to give this satisfaction to authors now and were then to be reviewed within eighteen months.
Most of the exceptions to copyright that are provided for open the way for a cancerous type of process, which will give rise to the wild, uncontrolled proliferation of copyright abuses.
The more exceptions are provided for, the further the right to regulate is weakened and the more harm is done to the harmonisation and coordination of national organisations in this field.
It is extremely important that the range of exceptions should be limited.
It is not enough to remove the possibility of using copies for purposes that are directly or indirectly commercial.
Copies are very frequently used for atypical purposes such as exchanges, loans and gifts, and there are many other causes for the uncontrolled proliferation of further copies, which has serious consequences for authors and publishers.
Unless the concept of private use is made to mean only home use or copying with the author' s permission, instead of solving the key problems, the directive will continue to be an incentive to unbridled piracy.
To conclude, I shall quote from one of the messages that I have received from various Portuguese authors, one of whom is the Nobel prize winner, JosÃ© Saramago, who writes: "as artists, we are particularly concerned that large-scale unauthorised copying will make it impossible for all those who make up the creative community to earn a living.
Those who have nothing to do with the creative process will consume the fruit of other people' s labours without making any productive reinvestment, unless private copying effectively retains its status as private copying" .
Mr President, we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive.
This directive, as a piece of intellectual property legislation, must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries, which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports.
They also employ 1.4 million people.
At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users.
This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm.
The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle.
We cannot stop technology, but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy, parasites and mass illegal copying.
Yesterday's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace.
We must not encourage people to infringe copyright.
The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively.
The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools, libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying.
In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that, of course, needs to remain intact.
It is however regrettable that some unnecessary, unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee.
I refer to: Amendment No 11, which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers' and artists' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty; and Amendment No 4 which, in the second part, introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions, in particular concerning piracy, and amendments on levies.
While this is well-intentioned, we cannot support this approach because it could be interpreted, taken in a vague sense, to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place.
The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door.
Finally, as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House, we should use the provisions of the directive, the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join the House in thanking the rapporteur.
It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests.
The lobby has already been mentioned.
It was indeed persistent but, on balance, it was, I think, a fair discussion and for that, too, I am grateful.
A great deal has been said about the need for balance.
I am afraid that the common position has not yet struck the balance needed.
Parts of the directive penalise the internal market, parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation.
The directive penalises the internal market because, at the end of the day, the harmonisation is only cosmetic and the Member States are defending their conventional payment systems tooth and claw, even though they are basically unsuited to the digital world.
We want to prevent that, which is why we suggest in proposed Amendment No 12 that the Member States should at least submit new compensation systems to the Commission and obtain a recommendation.
The directive also penalises consumers because it is quite possible that consumers will have to pay once when they buy a CD or a DVD and then again in the form of a levy.
Then when they come to make a copy, the data is copy-protected and the Member States have not even undertaken to look at copy protection systems and legal copying.
And the common position penalises innovation because it tries desperately to keep the global fee system alive in the digital age, despite the fact that new technology basically makes global fees superfluous, because copy protection allows the rightholder to be paid directly for copies and that is the fairest solution of all.
That is a directive for a citizens' Europe.
It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world.
Mr President, I am delighted to see that both the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur accepted that it was unwise to reopen a large number of issues in this area and that much of what was achieved in the common position reflects a balance on this very complicated problem.
I hope that the House will also limit the number of amendments that are adopted and not interfere too greatly with the common position.
It is a directive which I and the British Conservatives welcome because it is vital that European citizens are given proper protection of their creative rights and creative works in the digital era and this directive will deliver that to them.
This is essential because, not only is there an enormous music industry and film industry, we must not forget the highly successful computer games industry which is generating a huge amount of revenue in the United Kingdom and in a number of other countries across the EU.
But the British Conservatives also firmly uphold the rights of those who take advantage of the public interest exceptions. Groups such as the disabled, including blind people who need access to Braille copies in order to access the Internet, groups such as researchers, universities and libraries: these kinds of rightholder exceptions are vital for promoting research which is so important for our economic health.
A less high profile exception that is important economically is the right of reverse engineering of computer software.
We would entirely reject those amendments which are seeking to inhibit the use of those public interest exceptions.
We therefore accept the need to tighten up the wording of Article 6(4), to clarify its role and to restrict it to truly on-demand interactive services.
Having said that, there is another exception which is more controversial, which is ordinary private copying.
We are all pleased to see the rules have been tightened up to prevent it being abused and used as a loophole for piracy; that is something that we would also support.
I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11.
If this amendment is passed, I fear that the broadcasters will have an advantage.
They are getting something for nothing.
I think this skews the common position a little and, unless someone can convince me otherwise, I would have grave reservations about Amendment No 11.
We have a sensible and balanced position and I fear Amendment No 11 may tilt that balance in the wrong direction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common position, as amended by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is an attempt to strike a fair balance between the interests of artists, authors and rightholders and the interests of consumers.
The common position therefore regulates when third parties can copy copyright protected works such as texts, graphics, music or films.
Member States are also required to protect copy protection under the law.
It is important, from the consumer's point of view, that private copies will be allowed in future.
There are - and this has been addressed several times today - differing views as to what constitutes a private copy.
In my view, the definition should include the family environment.
That means that the proposed wording accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has my full support.
Finally, it is also important from the consumer's point of view that new remuneration schemes, i.e. levies on equipment or media, can only be introduced if they help to achieve equal levies throughout Europe.
Unilateral national action, such as the so-called PC levy, which keeps cropping up in discussions in the Member States, would only make equipment even more expensive.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also tabled proposals here and I call on Parliament to support them tomorrow.
Finally, the directive also regulates when broadcasting organisations are entitled to use their archive productions for on-demand services and when they must first sign a contract with all the rightholders involved in the TV production giving them the right to do so.
The rights, the archives of broadcasting organisations are of immeasurable cultural and historical value.
We must therefore do everything we can to make these archives accessible, including for online use.
I therefore urge the House to support Article 11 and I agree here with my fellow Member, Mrs Villiers.
I think that there is every reason to offer a separate regulation for public radio.
I would firstly like to apologise for having arrived late for this debate: I was in another meeting and that is why I am speaking last, despite the fact that I have had the honour of taking responsibility for this issue on behalf of the European People's Party.
Mr President, my first words are words of thanks, and I can also add my thanks as Chair of the committee, for the work carried out by the rapporteur.
I say this sincerely.
I believe that it would be hard to find a more complex issue, on which pressure has been unleashed from all the interest groups, which have legitimately fought to have their positions adopted by the various political groups.
There are few issues on which we have received so many, if not tonnes then at least metres of faxes and e-mails as we have on this one.
The rapporteur has been masterly in his navigation of these turbulent waters; he has always remembered that a rapporteur is rapporteur for a committee, not for any group or any position: he is rapporteur for a committee and he is duty-bound to reflect the majority position of that committee.
I am pleased to say that the amendments put forward by the rapporteur were supported by a huge majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, please allow me now to make some comments which are going to reiterate what has already been said, because at this point in the debate everything has really been said already.
This is a much-criticised directive, and it is worthy of criticism; but this is a case, as is so often the case in European integration, in which what is best and what is feasible are not the same thing.
As has already been said, we are starting from a situation in which there is complete divergence between the laws of the various Member States, where in reality the concept of copyright, the whole gamut of obligations and rights which this concept is represented by in our different laws, is not even similar.
It is not simply that are not the same, but that they are not even similar.
To try to harmonise them is an heroic quest.
This directive is a first step, but Parliament accepted this gamble on first reading and therefore it has to be consistent and continue in this vein on second reading.
At first reading we could have adopted disruptive positions; that was not Parliament's approach, and we accepted a directive full of exceptions.
At the moment, the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs, added to certain other notable amendments which deserve to be supported, improve this directive on certain substantial points, such as private copying.
I refer to what has already been said.
And in summary they improve the directive by making it a first step in a system of harmonisation which will have to be carried out over time, a first step which furthermore will enable us to fulfil our international commitments, since until this directive sees the light of day, the two WIPO Treaties will not be able to enter into force.
That is also an important responsibility at a time when we talk so much about globalisation.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this important subject.
I should like to begin by saying that the discussion on this subject has taken a long time, as Mr Boselli indicated a little while ago - I think he said three years.
That indicates the importance, as well as the controversial nature, of this proposal.
After long discussions, in which this Parliament played a very constructive role, we are meeting today to consider what I hope will be a balanced compromise.
We now need to agree as rapidly as possible on a set of rules on copyright and related rights in the information society at European level, in order to increase the competitiveness of the Community and to implement our obligations at international level.
This directive will be a cornerstone in the establishment of a harmonised legal framework on copyright, in a digital environment in particular.
As such, it belongs to those measures for which the Lisbon Summit at the end of last year set us a clear deadline.
The Community needs such a framework if it is not to lag behind its major trading partners and, as was remarked this afternoon, we are already lagging behind the United States.
Furthermore, without such a framework in place, rightholders and users cannot respond to the challenges posed by technology in the market place.
The adoption and implementation of this directive is also a precondition for the European Union to ratify rapidly the two WIPO treaties which were adopted in 1996.
Here we carry an important responsibility as the coming into force of the WIPO treaties depends largely on this directive and therefore on us.
The formal decision to ratify the treaties was adopted by the Council on 16 March 2000.
Parliament has already endorsed that decision, but without this directive neither we nor the Member States could move towards ratification of those treaties.
Throughout the legislative process, Parliament has played a significant role.
The important changes to this directive introduced after the first reading clearly reflect the influence of this Parliament.
We welcome the constructive approach of the rapporteur, Mr Boselli, and of the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio - whom it is a particular pleasure to see again today - and also the members of the committee which Mrs Palacio chairs.
They have shown a keen sense of appreciation of the issues at stake in this directive, reducing the number of amendments to 15.
Most of those amendments were, in fact, compromise amendments, also on crucial issues.
The Commission appreciates the efforts made by the rapporteur on private copying and by the Committee on Legal Affairs when it voted not to amend the technical copies exception.
The Commission is in a position to accept all of the compromise amendments.
We have, however, concerns about some of the other amendments which have been voted.
I shall now say something about each of those amendments, although very briefly.
Firstly, Amendment No 2. It deals with remuneration schemes and the products to which they apply, even though such schemes are outside the scope of the directive.
This directive requires fair compensation for certain of the exceptions, one of which is private copying.
The system of fair compensation envisages flexibility for Member States, rightholders and users to establish the basis on which those exceptions apply.
Amendment No 4 does not respect the principle of proportionality because it seeks to lay down conditions for the granting of injunctions.
But the issue of sanctions is already adequately dealt with in the directive.
Amendment No 11, about which I shall be speaking in reply to some remarks made a little while ago, adds a further exception for broadcasters, framed in terms which were rejected by Parliament itself at first reading.
The exception proposed goes too far and risks putting the Community in breach of its international obligations under the WIPO treaties, for which this directive is meant to be the instrument of ratification.
Amendment No 12 as currently drafted risks undermining the Commission's own powers to take measures when Member States take action that affects the functioning of the internal market.
For this reason the Commission cannot see its way to accepting it.
Amendment No 13 adds nothing to the text of Article 6(4) which already provides for fair compensation for private copying.
In the light of the above, we support the compromise amendments by the rapporteur and the Legal Affairs Committee but not Amendments Nos 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13.
Moreover, a series of further amendments, namely Amendments Nos 16 to 45, have also been tabled in Parliament.
The majority of those amendments have been rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee.
Three amendments, however, namely Amendments Nos 26, 27 and 28, are new.
In all cases, however, the issues raised by those amendments have been thoroughly considered, not just in the course of this second reading, but throughout the history of this directive - considered by my services but also by Member States.
None of those further amendments are acceptable to the Commission.
I should now like to address some of the questions and comments made this afternoon more specifically.
First of all, there are the questions and remarks made by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Manders and Mr Echerer on private copying and on the use of the words "for private use".
The question is should or should not the Commission support Amendment No 5 and if so, why?
In reply to that question, I should like to say that the Commission is of the view that Amendment No 5 provides greater security for rightholders while at the same time allowing legitimate private copying in a manner which is enforceable both by Member States and by rightholders and it clarifies what is commercial by including ends that are both direct and indirect.
There are several safeguards built into this directive which qualify the extent to which private copying may take place and thereby act as a deterrent to piracy.
That is particularly the case in relation to the protection of technological measures.
The Commission is of the opinion that the reference to "private use" is too narrow a formulation and would give rise to difficulties in enforcement especially in the private domain.
Then there is the question and a comment made by Mr Manders on Article 5 and in particular on the words "transient" and "incidental".
On that point, Article 5(1) has been at the centre of attention in all institutions.
There have been many amendments tabled both in the Legal Affairs Committee and again here in Parliament which propose changing the text of the common position.
The Legal Affairs Committee very wisely rejected all those amendments when it voted on 6 February 2001 and the Commission accepted the text of the common position which states that the acts of copying, in order to be exempted, must be transient or incidental and that they should form an essential part of a technological process.
The Commission prefers "or" to "and" in this context because making the conditions cumulative by adding "and" may make the whole exception too narrow and less operational.
In addition, including "essential" seems to make sense, as it would be difficult to justify why the exception should privilege acts of reproduction which are not an "essential" part of a technological process.
The current text of Article 5(1) together with the interpretative guidance provided in recital 33 ensures - in the Commission's opinion - a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightholders and the legitimate interests of other parties involved such as telecom operators, users, consumers and other parties.
Together with Article 8 on remedies and sanctions, Article 5(1) will help to provide for effective copyright protection against piracy whilst at the same time promoting the smooth operation of networks.
In particular, it gives service and access providers the necessary legal certainty for their activities on the networks.
Responding to comments made by Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and a number of others on Amendment No 11, may I say the following.
There is already an exception for broadcasters based on an amendment adopted by this Parliament at first reading.
It introduced a new exception for broadcasters relating to so-called ephemeral reproductions.
To introduce a further exception would not only disturb the balance of rights achieved, but could also lead to a violation of Member States' international obligations.
In relation to Amendment No 11, a similar amendment was proposed at first reading.
The Commission could not accept that amendment as it disturbed the balance between the parties concerned and might have caused considerable damage to authors, performing artists or other holders of the rights concerned.
The Commission is in agreement with Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and almost all speakers in rejecting this amendment.
I wish to thank Mrs Palacio for her support throughout the history of this proposal.
If it had not been for her leadership and guidance in the Legal Affairs Committee, it would not have been possible to steer our way through both the first reading and now the second reading, and the Commission is duly grateful to her.
The Commission would also like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament in general for the excellent work performed.
The common position represents the views of an entire cross-section of diverging interests: the creative and artistic communities, the academic, educational and scientific communities and also consumer groups and bodies representing socially disadvantaged users.
Nonetheless, in spite of the complexity of the groups whose interests have to be taken into account, the directive ensures a sufficiently high degree of copyright harmonisation and it should be possible to reach a final agreement today.
We have gone very far in meeting the concerns of everyone so, as Mr Boselli put it earlier this afternoon, I hope that this proposal will be approved tomorrow and that it will be adopted with as little change as possible.
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
The next item is the report (A5-0032/2001) by Mr Bowe, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Directive 90/220/EEC [C5-0685/2000 - 1998/0072(COD)].
Mr President, we are now close to the end of what has been a three-year process of reforming the legislation for the control and genetically modified use of organisms as products within the European Union.
We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval.
The text before us meets many of Parliament's demands at first and second reading.
We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed.
We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases.
We have schemes for monitoring traceability that will ensure continuous assessment of all releases throughout the ten-year life of this time-limitation for consents.
We have achieved the phasing out of all harmful, antibiotic-resistant marker genes.
We have a clear timetable.
We have a clear and transparent process and a clear timetable for the approvals which ensure the mandatory consultation of the public which guarantees public registers of locations of GMOs grown and used.
Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability, traceability and labelling.
Parliament can only be satisfied on those issues, however, when we see the additional legislation and flanking measures which I understand are now in preparation within the Commission.
In short, we have in front of us today for our approval the toughest GMO legislation in the world, so tough, in fact, that some natural foods in common use today would not pass through this procedure.
Should we approve this legislation tomorrow it would mean the beginning of the end of the present informal 'moratorium' on GMO commercial approvals.
Certain Members of the Council have, however, already made it clear that they will scrutinise individual applications for approval and may not allow commercialisation until legislation on traceability and labelling is in place.
I welcome this.
This is a final safeguard to the recommencement of an approval process which has been long awaited but it can be no reason for opposing the final approval of the new 90/220 legislation we have in front of us now.
This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come.
I therefore commend this important legislation to the House.
It is essential to ensure the safe and proper use of GMO products within the European Union.
It is essential to ensure the building of public confidence in these products, it is essential to ensure that this new technology, which promises so much, will in the end deliver what we are seeking from it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we often begin our speeches in the European Parliament by thanking the rapporteur.
I wish to do so again today, and it is meant as more than just lip service.
Mr Bowe has done a magnificent job and brought a very complicated procedure to a close.
I should also like to thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and the Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Ingo Friedrich.
Both put a great deal of effort into finding an agreement; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of everyone else involved in the conciliation procedure.
We have brokered a good compromise.
The new regulation gives Europe a high standard of health, consumer and environmental protection.
The disputed antibiotic-resistant marker genes will be banned in Europe in the future.
Potential environmental dangers must be closely monitored.
Labelling of GMOs has been improved, although we expect further action by the Commission on this.
We have not passed a regulation preventing the application of green biotechnology and the PPE-DE Group welcomes that. The PPE-DE Group is in favour of green biotechnology, provided that care is taken to ensure that rules to protect the environment and human health are respected.
Yesterday scientists and researchers from all over the world announced that they had completely decoded the human genome.
The euphoria which this announcement triggered throughout the world contrasts strangely with the emphatic rejection triggered by the release of genetically-modified plants, especially in Europe.
I think that neither euphoria at the human genome project nor total rejection of genetically-modified plants is called for.
In both areas there are huge opportunities, but there also risks which must be contained by suitable legislation.
The application of genetics to medicine is by no means risk-free; there have already been deaths during research into gene therapy in the USA because the rules were not applied properly.
The so-called reproductive cloning of human beings is no longer a chimera and is being seriously pursued by a number of scientists, as we have again seen over the last few days.
The artificial distinction between clones of human embryos for stem cell research and so-called reproductive clones will become blurred in the long term and I believe that the first cloned baby will probably be born before the promised relief for patients with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.
Just as red genetic engineering is by no means all opportunity, green genetic engineering is by no means all risk.
There is a realistic chance that genetically-modified plants will allow us to make huge progress with renewable primary products.
Specifically modified plants will perhaps soon allow cheaper and safer drugs to be manufactured.
We should therefore make use of the opportunities in both areas and limit the dangers with suitable legislation.
Developments in the release of genetically-modified plants from research into the human genome - for which we have practically no rules in Europe - will result, once the preliminary report is accepted, in a suitable set of rules for all the Member States in the European Union, which is why we should adopt this motion.
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the Bowe report.
Mr President, after three long years, we are, at last, nearing the end of the process of revising Directive 90/220/EEC.
Anyone who has watched the progress made, step by step, towards this goal, as I have, cannot fail to agree that we are providing the European Union with legislation on genetically modified organisms which, in addition to improving upon the previous legislation, also places us at the forefront on an international level.
Just one example is the procedures for granting authorisations, particularly in terms of transparency and accessibility to the public, which is an essential condition for the necessary research trials to be able to proceed in a favourable climate.
Further examples are the assessment and monitoring of the cumulative effects on the environment, and the phasing out of antibiotic-resistant marker genes.
The lion's share of the praise for this progress must certainly go to our rapporteur, Mr David Bowe, who has succeeded in combining decisiveness with flexibility.
It is certainly the fault of the Commission, rather than Mr Bowe, if we are still labouring under the burden of being unable, at present, to adopt flanking legislation on the tracing and labelling of GMOs and GMO derivatives placed on the market and thereby present the consumer with a complete framework of certainties.
The undertaking, confirmed yesterday in a letter from the Commission to the Members of the parliamentary delegation, is important in political terms but does not entirely make up for the delays in preparing a clear, well-defined proposal.
For these reasons, I am convinced that we should endorse the conclusions of the conciliation procedure, but with one explicit reservation: the moratorium on commercial approvals must remain in place until the gap has been filled.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new directive is a huge improvement over the old one, on that we are all agreed.
The public register was a fundamental and central cause for concern to us Greens.
Monitoring is included, as is the testing of long-term effects. We expressly welcome all this.
However, we shall abstain - and with good cause - because the main points of the directive have not been clarified.
There is unholy confusion in the area of genetic engineering at European level and no steps have been taken to label derivatives and GMOs and guarantee their traceability.
We have not clarified the question of exports of GMOs to non Member States.
I think that we have a moral responsibility to apply the same standards to third countries here as we do to ourselves and, more importantly, we have not clarified liability as a central factor.
The EU Commission is to make proposals here, it is true, but we do not know what they are.
I rather feel that we are buying a pig in a poke.
The BSE crisis should be a lesson and a reminder to us.
It is just not on, expecting the taxpayer to stump up for the damage and passing the risks onto society, while the genetic engineering companies only get the profits.
Which is why I do not expect any more GMO consents to be granted until legislation has been passed on liability.
So far, all we have is a declaration of intent; we do not have corporate liability and it is just not on, insisting that anyone who wants to register a car must produce an insurance certificate, while someone producing dangerous organisms, some of the long-term consequences, risks and dangers of which are still unknown factors, need not.
There is therefore no reason for Member States such as Germany and France to lift their de facto moratoria.
I think we have a huge crisis of confidence in consumer protection and unless derivatives are labelled, in other words, unless there is transparency and liability and responsibility can be taken ...
(The president cut the speaker off)
Mr President, we in the Group of the European United Left wish to retain the moratorium on releasing genetically modified crops for commercial cultivation.
This position is not changed by the clear improvements due to Directive 90/220 and which we are now discussing.
In the conciliation, it was, in particular, we in the Group of the European United Left, together with the Greens, who fought for the improvements which have now in fact been made, for example the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant markers, greater transparency and better risk assessments.
We have also achieved at least a half victory when it comes to public registers of GMOs, but it is still very unclear whether the Member States really see themselves as being obliged to report publicly on all GMOs cultivated for commercial purposes.
Clarification from the Council of Ministers and the Commission is needed on this matter.
It is not advisable to adopt laws on matters about which, right from the beginning, there are different interpretations.
We have still not seen the new rules promised to us by the Commission and required for labelling, traceability and accountability.
Until we know what they look like and until they have been fully implemented, we cannot contemplate lifting the moratorium.
Nor do we believe that, when the moratorium is lifted, it should be possible for any Member State to be forced to cultivate genetically modified crops.
We consider the strategy devised by the Commission whereby new crops are to be approved before these rules are fully in place to be objectionable and contrary to the precautionary principle.
It is also significant that there is a desire here to pre-empt the reading in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers.
There is now no demand for genetically modified food in the European Union.
More and more parts of the world are abandoning GM crops.
There are major differences of opinion between researchers about the risks involved in GM crops. This applies both to the risk of contaminating other species and to possible effects on human health.
To insist, in this situation, upon the cultivation of more GM crops for commercial purposes would be foolhardy and lead to a very great deal of opposition.
Recent scandals and problems involving food policy ought to have taught us to proceed carefully.
The interests of consumers and the precautionary principle must be allowed to take precedence over the commercial interests of a few large companies.
We want to retain the moratorium on commercial cultivation.
There is a risk that the revision of this directive may be taken by the Commission as a pretext for approving new GM crops for cultivation.
That is not something to which we can be a party.
In spite of the fact that, in the conciliation, our group has had an important role to play in making these rules as tough as possible, we cannot vote in favour of the final result.
Mr President, I compliment Mr Bowe on his work in this area.
Commissioner Byrne's White Paper on food safety sets the ground rules and parameters within which the practical application of genetic research impacts on public health and the environment, and I have no doubt the vigilance of Parliament is a further safeguard.
While I have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture, equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from BSE.
The vigilance we are rightly demonstrating on the release of genetically modified organisms on the environment and food safety must be intensified with regard to research in the sensitive and ethical area of gene technology and its impact and implications for mankind.
There is a silent abhorrence of some of this research by citizens who expect us to reflect their concerns in this Parliament.
As I said on a previous occasion we should not play God with research.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, on behalf of the radical Members of the Bonino List, I would like to express my full support for the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs.
It has taken three years - too many - from when Commissioner Santer, urged by Emma Bonino and Ritt Bjerregaard, the then Commissioners for Consumer Policy and the Environment, presented the proposal to amend the old Directive 90/220/EEC, a proposal which has resulted in the text we are debating today and upon which we are going to vote tomorrow.
We are going to vote in favour of the motion, for we feel that this proposal for a directive guarantees a rigorous legal framework for GMO authorisation, protecting consumers, economic operators and research scientists.
The proposal includes the major elements of innovation, environmental risk assessment and risk monitoring.
The new legislation also contains the precautionary principle, the rigid, ideological application of which, all too often proposed to us, would have the opposite effect to that desired, of paralysing not only research and innovation in the agri-foods sector but even commonly accepted aspects of our way of life, as the Italian Minister for Health, Umberto Veronesi, who is first and foremost a scientist, has pointed out in the last few days.
Improvements have been made in the areas of labelling and traceability, and a public information mechanism has been provided for.
On a more general note, it is my opinion that this directive represents a step forward in renouncing a prohibitionist approach to scientific progress.
Mr President, as well as the economic aspects, the new directive also expressly highlights the safety dimension, and rightly so.
As I have already pointed out on numerous occasions in earlier debates, we must pay particular attention to the ethical aspects of this sensitive issue.
Genetic modification of organisms constitutes interference with the characteristic properties of these organisms.
Given my belief that all these organisms were created by God, I recommend that we proceed with great caution.
We need to reflect on the ethical implications of the new developments in this sector.
Consideration of the ethical issues surrounding human genetics demonstrates that biotechnology can have far-reaching consequences.
Clear boundaries are essential in this respect.
I am delighted that the lion' s share of the amendments were included in the Council and Parliament joint text in the end.
It is to be welcomed that the environmental aspects now fall within the scope of the directive.
It is also important that the antibiotic-resistant markers are to be eliminated in the fullness of time.
The Council should approve the Cartagena Protocol without delay.
It is important for exports to third countries to be carried out in a proper manner.
The argument that the development of genetically modified organisms will help to solve the world food problem should actually be put into practice.
The stories about the so-called terminator gene, which is said to prevent children from growing, are very disturbing.
It is my hope that abuses and incorrect practices can be prevented through effective observance of the protocol.
Mr President, all in all, the joint text has my backing.
Mr President, after years of work on this report, we have now arrived at what I hope is a final position in Parliament.
We largely have Mr Bowe to thank for this.
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job.
In this connection, I want to congratulate him on the report.
Let us just remember that genetic engineering provides humanity with new, unguessed at opportunities.
Just as always in the past, however, new knowledge also entails new risks and increased responsibility.
It is important that we be aware of the risks and accept our responsibility. This applies both to environmental issues and to ethical considerations.
At the same time, it is important to make it clear that, when it comes to improving people' s health and guaranteeing sustainable production of more food for a growing world population, we must not reject any form of science.
Instead, we must make use of science. I would therefore simply urge that we make our decision in accordance with the proposal before us today.
Mr President, we refuse to endorse the draft directive which lays down the procedure for authorising genetically modified organisms, for fundamental reasons that I will set out in my explanation of vote, as well as for a very straightforward strategic reason.
It is because we are told that the implementation of this authorisation procedure, despite the fact that it is flawed, must be approved and we are also led to understand that the moratorium on authorisations, which was adopted by the Member State governments in June 1999, will be lifted pending the further information needed.
In these circumstances, we believe that it would be much wiser for Parliament to wait for the actual implementation of all the additional guarantees that the Commission is promising for tomorrow, such as a future text on the liability and requirement for insurance by those who release GMOs - I stress this point - or even a future improvement of the provisions on labelling and traceability.
On the other hand, if we approve the authorisation procedure today, there is a considerable risk that we will have been duped, if, tomorrow, we find that the moratorium is lifted on the sly - something that the Commission would love to see.
The debate is suspended.
The debate will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.
Reform of the beef and veal market
The next item is the statement from the Commission on the proposals for the reform of the beef and veal market.
I give the floor to Commissioner Fischler.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the seven point plan to reform the beef and veal market which the Commission recently adopted.
What exactly is this plan?
We all know that the beef and veal market is in serious crisis; consumption in the European Union has plummeted; prices in Germany, for example, have fallen by 39.2% for steer and by 41.8% for cows.
These historic lows have already triggered the intervention safety net in Germany and the Netherlands.
In addition, our exports have, unfortunately, collapsed.
Fast action is called for.
Storing meat is clearly not enough per se.
It would result in an unmanageable beef mountain, quite apart from the fatal consequences for taxpayers, consumers and farmers.
We therefore also need fast reform.
The Commission's seven point plan is a sort of emergency package to prevent excess production over the next few years by taking another step towards extensive production, towards sustainability and towards organic farming.
However, this plan does not revolutionise the system completely for the simple reason that we first need to give our incipient reforms a chance.
Only a small part of the Agenda 2000 reform has really been implemented.
We have only just made the first step towards an overall 20% reduction in intervention prices, with a further 7.1% to follow this year and again next year.
The countermove - increasing direct payments and tripling the extensification premium - has still not entered into force by a long shot.
In short, implementing Agenda 2000 fully in the year 2002 will by itself contribute towards extensive cattle-raising and less production-orientated subsidies.
Today we are discussing the emergency package as a result of BSE and this neither anticipates nor replaces the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.
I repeat, in 2002, i.e. next year, agricultural policy as a whole will be up for review, as demanded in Berlin.
The Commission will spend 2001 analysing individual sectors in detail, so that it can then present a comprehensive, well thought out concept for the future.
We need to take our time here if we are to avoid falling prey to hurried, political posturing.
The seven point plan will not take food out of the mouths of European farmers.
It is our only chance of mitigating farmers' loss of earnings, at least in the medium term.
The Commission cannot, unfortunately, afford to make up the loss of income in full.
Unsold beef, the lack of consumer confidence and escalating costs are a highly explosive mixture which could decimate beef-farming and agricultural policy.
Our seven point plan should allow us to remove the detonator from this ticking time-bomb.
But our plan should also ensure that beef and veal are safer than ever for consumers and that consumer confidence is restored in beef and veal.
Allow me now to outline these seven points briefly.
First, we propose to reduce the permissible stocking density for the special premium for steers and suckler cows from 2 to 1.8 livestock units.
Secondly, we want the Member States to respect the so-called 90-head limit without exception, i.e. a holding will only be paid the special beef premium for a maximum of 90 animals.
These two measures should increase the incentive for extensive farming.
Thirdly, in order to make organic farming more attractive, we propose to allow organic farmers to cultivate fodder such as clover on set-aside areas.
Fourthly, the Commission wants to set the number of rights for the special steer premium individually for each holding.
This measure will also act as an incentive to reduce intensive production.
Fifthly, our package also makes provision for a higher percentage - at least 20%, but no more than 40% - of animals which qualify for premiums, i.e. suckler cows, to be heifers.
This should also limit beef and veal production, which depends to a considerable degree on the number of suckler cows.
Sixthly and finally, we want to set the present ceiling for intervention outside the safety net of 350 000 tonnes for 2001 and 2002, in order to prevent prices from falling even further and the safety net from having to be used in other countries or over a longer period of time.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I say that the measures which the Commission is proposing here today will not take full hold for a year or two.
We have no alternative.
Beef and veal production is not akin to a light-bulb factory and the agricultural Commissioner is not a foreman who can turn off the production line and watch everything grind to a halt.
In the short term, we must consider what we are going to do with the huge quantities of unsold beef.
With all due respect for the ethical aspects, with all due sympathy for those who say that it is a tragedy to destroy the cattle, we must not delude ourselves.
Hundreds of thousands of cattle have been squashed into stalls in Europe for months because farmers cannot find anyone to buy their old livestock.
The safety net has already been deployed in two Member States.
This week alone we shall probably put up to 30 000 tonnes of meat into storage.
And yet none of this is enough.
That brings me to the last point of the package of measures.
As soon as compulsory BSE tests for animals over 30 months old have been introduced in all the Member States, we want to replace the programme of safe removal with a new special buy-up programme which allows the Member States to decide if they prefer to store beef at their own expense or if they want to remove this meat from the market straight away, in which case we and the Member States will compensate farmers jointly for the value of the animal in a ratio of 30% from the Member State and 70% from the EU.
This measure is no more than a provisional emergency measure and should not last beyond the end of this year.
In the medium term, there is only one way forward and that is: act today in order to limit beef production tomorrow, promote less intensive production methods and encourage organic farming.
I therefore ask you to return your opinion on today's proposal as quickly as possible.
Thank you for your attention.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.
Mr President, Commissioner, it all sounds very hunky-dory, but a lot of it is cosmetic.
Why not go in for a proper reform and do away with endless quota regulations, ceilings, minimum and maximum livestock densities, slaughter premiums and fattening bonuses?
Why not just pay the farmers and say: you decide, do you want to slaughter the calves now, irrespective of how fat or thin they are, or do you want to get out of production completely?
Would that not be a more reasonable course of action?
And then I ask you: are you going to operate the guillotine - will you make it a rule that holdings with more than 90 animals will not get any subsidies?
Mr President, I would at least like to compliment the Commissioner on providing such a clear commentary.
I would mainly like to respond in my capacity as rapporteur for Budget 2001.
My first question is as follows: what will the additional cost of these measures be in animal premiums, over a period of four to five years?
According to provisional calculations, it will cost EUR 157 million this year and as much as EUR 1.75 billion over the years to come, and we are talking in terms of animal premiums.
My second question is does BSE have anything to do with the size of the farm?
I was under the impression that it did not, yet you have set a 90-animal limit per farm nonetheless.
That seems to me to be in conflict with an effective programme for fighting BSE.
Nor have I heard anything about a maximum premium per hectare, for the number of animals per hectare. Could you comment on that too?
You are going to dispense with the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention, which is in itself a good decision.
But could you comment on what the financial implications for the European Union are expected to be over the coming year?
Mr President, my warmest congratulations to you, Commissioner Fischler.
These measures are a step in the right direction.
They remain within the system, without changing the need to review the system for the next reform and take even more audacious action.
But this package sends out the right signal.
I have just one objection: why not divide up the bull premiums over a transitional period?
Half could be used to slaughter calves, i.e. for recovery, so it would not be Herod's premium, and the other half could be channelled into grasslands, to get into extensification, to get out of mass meat production and to achieve middle-of-the-road production.
I also note that the figure of 90 animals applies to every holding; holdings with more animals do not fall outside the rule, as the newspapers wrongly reported.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I promise to be much briefer.
In reply to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's questions - and this also applies to the others - we should be clear about one thing: what we are proposing here today is not a new agricultural reform.
As I, in fact, said.
Nor are we in a position to engage in agricultural reform at the moment.
I think it would be wrong if we were to look now at the reform of the beef and veal sector in isolation.
When we talk of agricultural reform - and we shall do so in good time, I can assure you, you will be hearing from us - then we must include, for example, the question of silage corn, the question of milk quotas, the question of what to do about dairy cattle versus beef cattle.
And there really is too little time for that, especially if you want to prepare something carefully.
What we have tabled here today is nothing more - but also nothing less - than a clear concept to get us out of the current crisis.
Now to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's question as to whether we should change over from quotas to direct payments. There are no quotas for individual cattle fatteners under the current system.
First we need to introduce quotas for individual cattle fatteners; what you meant, I think, is that we should deregulate the whole thing and get into rural development.
But this is precisely the sort of question which can only be resolved in the context of a general debate on agricultural reform.
I personally - and I say so quite openly - am against the guillotine.
I am against any instrument of murder and hence I am also against the guillotine.
Which is why I favour seeing this 90-head limit as a franchise, by which I mean that everyone gets a subsidy up to 90 animals.
Mr Maat felt that was a contradiction because it makes no difference if it is a small or a large holding when it comes to BSE.
I think you are quite right.
But the 90-head limit is not a measure to fight BSE, it is a measure to create incentives for more extensive beef production in the future.
We have already looked into what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said about early marketing premiums.
The thing is, we had this sort of premium in 1996 and in later years.
We have calculated that this premium alone cost EUR 200 000 million.
Unfortunately, the end result is somewhat questionable, because 40% of calves are slaughtered with a low weight in any case.
That means we would pay nearly half the veal farmers a premium with absolutely no end result.
Which is why we have shunned this measure, especially in view of our limited resources.
Mr President, Commissioner, now that the Greens are finally in clover, does it not make sense to choose the much easier path through the whole complicated premium structure by going for a climate-related grassland premium and forgetting the rest?
Secondly, Commissioner, I should like to point out that one point needs greater clarification because otherwise, I think, the internal market will fall apart.
If, as it would appear, the costs of disposing of bonemeal and material from slaughtered animals are not clarified uniformly in the Member States, and are partly taken up by government levies and partly passed on to farmers through prices, how do you intend to resolve this problem?
Otherwise we shall not be able to keep the internal market together.
Commissioner Fischler, I agree with you when you talk about extensification, but I do not endorse the measures that you are proposing because, ultimately, they will not facilitate extensification.
If you are in favour of this approach, why do you not do the following: end subsidies for production and then pay in proportion to the least amount of animals per hectare?
Then you will actually be bringing about the extensification of the sector because, otherwise, by maintaining aid for production, you are implementing a contradictory policy: on the one hand you are encouraging production and on the other, you are paying for it.
This system defies belief!
The second question I wish to ask you is this: given that this sector is undergoing a profound crisis and that there is an EAGGF-Guarantee, half of which is, in practice, spent on just one type of production, I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler whether it is not time to require...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, I have three brief questions.
My first question is that you admittedly spoke about measures on organic farming, but what do you intend to do about all the certified and approved products, which are also subjected to very strict criteria?
My second question relates to calves. What are you doing or what do you intend to do about rearing calves with their mother, because, currently, milk given to calves that are 'battery farmed' also presents problems that you have not considered.
Lastly, my third question is what are you going to do to avoid measures likely to penalise only small farmers without affecting large farmers?
Mr President, first on the question of grasslands, grassland premiums or, first and foremost, general permission to use set-aside areas.
I think that we need to tread somewhat carefully here.
We must not forget that organic farms by definition produce much less and that the organic farming system automatically has a built-in brake on production so to speak.
If we generally abandon the brake on production in the cereals sector, then we no longer meet the requirements for a bluebox measure.
Which is why I think we need to tread carefully.
As far as introducing a general grassland premium in lieu of a beef premium is concerned, we discussed this in connection with Agenda 2000.
I have no objection in principle here, but there is a feasibility problem, because you must admit one thing: a meadow in Schleswig-Holstein cannot be treated in the same way as a hectare of meadow in northern Finland or a meadow in southern Portugal.
There are huge differences in yield, quality and requirements.
But Europe does not have a system for evaluating these differences, which is why we need to consider this question at greater length.
But, as I said, I have no objection in principle, just a feasibility problem.
As far as the question of disposal costs is concerned, the fact is that very different systems are currently being applied here.
In some Member States it is done through tax measures, in other Member States the costs are simply absorbed by the national budget and in others still the farmers, or at least the agricultural sector, is left to pick up the tab.
Since these are national measures, national assistance rules apply.
And we are doing that, we have accepted that.
However, not all Member States have sent in their replies as requested, not by a long chalk.
But, hopefully, we should be in a position by the next Council to formulate a more accurate overview.
However, and I must stress this, a certain self-discrimination by the Member States within the framework of government aid cannot be prohibited under Community law.
That is also a fact of life.
But I agree with you, that it should not be allowed to go too far as, otherwise, we really shall create two types of farmholding or two types of farmer in Europe.
In reply to the question on certified products: the certification of products is set out in the provisions which we introduced on 1 September last year.
It was agreed, with Parliament's consent, that this would be done in two stages.
The first stage is in force and the second will follow on 1 January next year.
However, this second stage must already be complied with for any meat which enters storage.
Because if we do not insist on this now, we will not be able to remove this meat from storage after 1 January 2002 because it will no longer meet labelling requirements.
Then there is also national certification.
This national certification, which is carried out by CHA in Germany or SOPEXA in France, is subject to a notification requirement. In other words, these certifications must be notified.
Then there is also private certification.
These private certifications are governed solely by the principle of truth. This means that the truth must be told about what is written on the outside of a product.
With products involving government aid, certain rules must be respected.
We are currently reforming this system, because we quite clearly take the view that the fact that a product comes from a particular region is no automatic guarantee of quality and that quality has to be defined.
Only if the quality is right and only if it is checked can we talk of a proper quality label.
But we have difficulties here - I freely admit - with combinations of quality and origin, when it is suggested that the quality automatically goes up if a specific product comes from a specific region.
As far as calves' milk is concerned - and I assume that you are basically referring to milk replacer here - the relevant adaptations are being prepared.
However, they come within the remit of my colleague Commissioner Byrne.
As far as the implementation of the White Paper on food security is concerned, suitable proposals will also be forthcoming here.
Mr President, I have three short questions to ask Mr Fischler.
One of the questions I am often asked is if one case of BSE breaks out in a herd of dairy cows, why does the entire herd have to be slaughtered?
The systems vary from country to country in Europe.
What is the Commission' s view on this?
Is it necessary or not, or is it just a precautionary measure?
The way in which the tests are funded varies from country to country.
Is that good for the unity of the market and if not, is the Commission planning to do something about it?
Thirdly, we still import large quantities of beef from outside Europe.
How does the Commission ensure that these cattle have not been fed animal meal, and are the controls adequate?
Mr President, Commissioner, in one of your proposals you referred to the possibility of cultivating clover on fallow land, but you will understand that in the countries of the South this is not always possible and is sometimes very difficult.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you could adapt this good proposal to the countries of the South, so that it would be attractive to them and would allow the viability, for example, of cultivating pulses in these conditions.
My second question, Commissioner, is how do you explain the difference between slaughter premiums which currently exist?
