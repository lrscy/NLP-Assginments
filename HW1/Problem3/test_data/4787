We have had suicide bombers in our city, people ready to blow themselves up, to destroy in terrorist attacks.
It is legitimate for the police to consider how they can deal with that problem.
I wish we did not have the problem, that we did not have suicide bombers at all.
I wish I could snap my fingers and they would disappear.
I cannot â they are here.
In these circumstances, it is right for our police and security services to give proper thought to how we deal with a threat from that quarter, subject to scrutiny and debate and subject to operating in a legal framework.
But that is what this Parliament should be about: asking what the correct procedures are in these areas.
That is why I say yes, we work within a legal framework.
But I also say to my friend Mr Watson that human rights are indivisible, that is true, but we also have to recognise that there are individuals and organisations seeking to destroy these human rights and we have to defend ourselves against them against those people who want to destroy those very human rights for everybody.
That is an obligation we have in addressing them.
My final point is in response to the criticisms that I did not sufficiently address the question of social and political action on Islam. I accept those criticisms.
They were well made. Mr Lambrinides, Mr Wiersma, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo and Mrs Roure â with her points about justice â are all correct.
We need to have a policy to address these questions and to take them forward.
We need to understand Islam; we need educational, social, and political action on that.
As Mrs Roure said, we need to focus on a foundation of justice; we need to say that this nihilism is a perversion of Islam rather than Islam itself.
As Mr Mayor Oreja said, we need to understand the role of organisations in these areas.
I do not have time to address the issues about Iraq that were raised by Mr Wurtz and Mr Fava.
All I will say is that the 9/11 attacks took place well before the Iraq situation and terrorist atrocities have been committed over a period of time that has to be taken into account.
I hope and believe that during this Presidency we will take the decisive step to get all the institutions of the European Union â Parliament, the Council and the Commission â to raise the quality of our work on serious and organised crime and terrorism, and I commit myself to work in that direction.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank you for the quality of the debate that we have had, which shows how the Council, Parliament and the Commission are strengthening their resolve to work together.
Some of you have stated â MrÂ Schulz did so very forcefully, as did MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo â that we often have long, protracted debates about the same subjects.
That is very often the case in certain institutional areas.
You are right, MrÂ Schulz: we did indeed include measures in the Constitutional Treaty that would have enabled us to make progress; for the time being, however, such progress will not be possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, in reflecting on the future of Europe and in addressing security as a priority area for European action, we shall have to place greater emphasis on the fact that, if we are serious about wanting to reduce national rivalries, we must create a more solid and more cohesive institutional common ground in Europe.
That common ground does not exist at present; meanwhile, terrorism and cross-border organised crime are unfortunately changing and developing much faster than our European institutions.
That is a problem that we have to face when our citizens call for a response â the EU policy response that many of you have emphasised.
How should we act now?
I shall just take up a few of the suggestions that I have heard, starting with MrÂ Brokâs: fewer new laws, fewer new legislative initiatives and more implementation of the existing rules.
That is a principle of which I have become aware during my first seven months â not a long time â working in the Commission: many Member States are seriously behind schedule in implementing the rules that already exist; there still remain institutional rivalries, which are being worn down through the joint work of the institutional players.
That is why I have proposed a mechanism within the plan of action for permanently monitoring the implementation of existing rules, so as to evaluate whether and to what extent we are progressing â and you have endorsed that.
Furthermore, I myself and the Commission services will, of course, undertake to provide the Member States that request it with the technical assistance they need to implement the existing rules on terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall ensure that I refer back to you periodically â I shall do so every six months â regarding implementation methods, and whether the existing rules have been duly implemented and by whom, but to do that I shall need your firm political, not legislative, support.
Lastly, a final thought about Europeâs political strategy.
MrÂ Poettering and then Mr Mayor Oreja, amongst others, spoke of a primarily political response.
I agree wholeheartedly and say: let us involve civil society more â the religious and civil communities that throughout Europe represent this great reality that is our reality â and let us work with them to eliminate the deep roots of terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists.
Something that I have already mentioned to you and will mention again in this Parliament is that we intend to call openly for involvement and commitment from Islamic communities that feel that they are communities living at the same time within a European context.
We shall also ask them to make a gesture of responsibility: in this open dialogue we should like to hear the prayers in mosques sometimes â more and more often â include a clear, strong condemnation of any act that seeks to destroy human life.
That is the dialogue and the partnership of values on which our political action must be based.
As the Commission, we shall also make a contribution to the international strategy of Europeâs security measures.
We shall issue a communication to Parliament and the Council to examine with you the best way of involving international players in this thoroughly universal challenge that affects everybody.
We shall also call for support â I have heard some speeches to this effect â and some positive assistance from the vast world of the volunteer sector and NGOs to help us in detecting movements of funds and the transparency of financial transfers.
I can say that I personally shall meet representatives of non-governmental organisations and, until there has been a thorough debate, we in Brussels do not intend to issue a unilateral executive document.
We shall hold back and ask for their help; the transparency of financial transfers is indeed one of our preventative weapons for fighting terrorism.
One final thought: I have heard many of you â I remember Mr Lambrinidis in particular â mention the need for the people and civil communities not to feel excluded from this great, concerted, political endeavour to defeat terrorism.
If the citizens feel distanced from this great challenge that we have in common, then we â the Commission, Parliament and the Council â will have lost effective contact with the source of our democratic legitimacy, that is to say the citizens.
That is a factor, ladies and gentlemen, that perhaps lies at the root of the mistrust and distance that led so many people in France and the Netherlands to say âNoâ, because they felt excluded and distanced.
In the fight against terrorism we need to keep them close.
Â Â  Mr President, I ask that you take note of the fact that I made, when speaking on behalf of my group, a comment on which MrÂ Voggenhuber seized in his speech and interpreted to mean that I would like to see the security forces respond to the use of violence by terrorists and criminals with the same sort of violence or a similar overall way of dealing with such persons.
The only possible explanation for why Mr Voggenhuber placed this construction on my words is that he was not giving me his full attention.
Let me therefore say that the substance of what I said was that those, whether terrorists or criminals, who disregard human rights and attack society have to reckon with the full rigour of the security forces, but I did add â and will take this opportunity to repeat â that it is also a measure of democracyâs strength that it guarantees fundamental civil liberties to all, even to people such as these.
That is our groupâs position, and no other interpretation is tenable.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  â In the aftermath of the brutal attacks on London, which we vehemently condemn â just as we unequivocally condemn all forms of terrorism, including state terrorism â a new offensive is underway at EU level, using the London attacks as its pretext, to justify the latest appalling violations of the citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees.
At the same time, the fact that policies such as the aggression and military occupation in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan in themselves fan the flames of terrorism has been deliberately swept under the carpet.
Among the measures on the table is, once again, the proposal to check telephone and e-mail records and retain them in a European database, which, as far as we know, would be carried out without any checks and balances in place.
Such a measure would be disproportionate and it is highly doubtful that it would work.
All of the evidence points to the fact that, despite what is being trumpeted, this security offensive has been a failure in relation to its stated aims, the worst aspect of which is that it has undermined the citizensâ rights and freedoms.
In the name of this security offensive, Jean Charles Menezes, a Brazilian citizen, was brutally and appallingly murdered on his way to work by the British police force, putting into practice its policy of shoot first and ask questions later.
Â Â  Mr President, I have read Mondayâs Minutes and note, to my regret, that they do not include my name, even though â as the lady Members sitting next to me can confirm â I was, as usual, present punctually for the beginning of the sitting.
I ask that the Minutes be amended accordingly.
Â Â  Mr President, when will Parliament's Bureau and its Presidency get a grip on the shambolic procedures that we use when it comes to voting?
We were told that we would vote at 12Â noon.
It has now gone 12.30 p.m.
How can we expect people outside to take us seriously if we cannot organise ourselves properly in here?
The Presidency must do something.
Â Â  As you know, Sir Robert, I have every sympathy with your position.
I will certainly convey that to the Conference of Presidents, but the list of speakers is put forward by the groups.
We endorsed the agenda on Monday, but I take your point and we will try to improve in future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the same time that I am addressing you, the Tunisian League for Human Rights is being surrounded by the army.
I call on you to take note of this and to take immediate measures.
I am well aware that this is not an urgent matter today, but emergencies exist that cannot wait until Thursday afternoon.
Â Â  That point is noted.
There will be a meeting of the Maghreb delegation this afternoon at 3Â p.m.
Â Â  Mr President, I have the impression that we did not vote for Amendment 15.
Â Â  It fell because Amendments 23 and 31 were adopted.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . The report before us and the proposal for a resolution contained therein offer us an opportunity to pay tribute to the speed and the spirit of solidarity and responsibility with which the EU acted in response to the tsunami disaster last December.
Naturally, the only possible vote in this instance is a positive one.
Â Â  . Portugal is well aware of the value and importance of mobilising this fund when the disasters that strike us reach a scale that requires the solidarity of the Union and our other partners.
In view of the necessary technical evaluations, and given that Slovakia has introduced a request to cover the damage resulting from the storm of 19 and 20Â NovemberÂ 2004, we therefore have a duty to support the mobilisation of the Fund in question.
Â Â  . I welcome the immediate response from the EU to the Tsunami disaster.
The goodwill generated by this however, could be lost if projects on the ground are not sustained.
The Commission must maintain a careful focus on helping the victims of the Tsunami by not only spending money, but spending it effectively.
Â Â  . This proposal for a revision of the financial perspective 2000-2006 stems from the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) adopted by the September 2003 European Council, which provided for a reduction in direct payments (subheading 1a), known as âmodulationâ, for the purposes of financing rural development policy (subheading 1b).
This proposal raises certain fundamental questions regarding the CAP and agriculture spending.
We do not deny the need to grant structural aid to the rural world and to increase that aid.
In the debate on the reform of the CAP and the new financial perspective 2007-2013, we tabled practical proposals aimed at increasing appropriations for rural development, with specific regard to compensation payments and organic farming.
This must not be done, however, at the expense of the market pillar of the CAP, or as part of a philosophy of replacing this pillar with rural development, as put forward by the British Presidency.
Transferring funds from the market pillar to rural development is a way of introducing cofinancing by the back door, which amounts to the renationalisation of CAP costs.
This proposal also undermines the principles of modulation and capping, which should help to redistribute aid more fairly among countries, production sectors and farmers; in other words, cutting aid to the major holdings ...
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Garriga-Polledo report.
Parliament made an undertaking to urgently respond to the rehabilitation and reconstruction needs in the wake of the devastating tsunami of 26Â DecemberÂ 2004.
We must therefore provide ourselves with the resources needed to meet those challenges, whilst safeguarding ongoing development programmes and of course without jeopardising our other priorities.
In this regard, I welcome the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the financial year 2005, totalling EURÂ 15Â million for the purpose of financing reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in countries affected by the tsunami, as it is an appropriate measure that is worthy of my support.
Â Â  IÂ would like to thank the rapporteurs and all my colleagues who have voted to provide Slovakia with 5.6 million euro from the European Solidarity Fund to replant the forests destroyed by the gales in the High Tatras in November.
This is the culmination of the initiative of those Slovaks who set out to organise an exhibition on the Tatras in Strasbourg.
The European Parliamentâs gesture is aÂ display of solidarity with all those who know and love our alpine regions and who did not wait passively for the aid that Slovakia will be provided almost 10 months after this natural disaster.
Last summer, enthusiasts from 17 European countries re-planted the green belt on the sides of mountains, remedying the damage done to the woodlands estimated at 195 million euro.
Every day an average of 95 volunteers worked on the Water Forest Project organised by the Äœudia aÂ voda (People and Water) NGO.
This interesting project, carried out under the auspices of aÂ Government committee and of other institutions, could become aÂ pilot project for other countries as well.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on this report regarding the surplus in 2004.
Conservatives believe that the EU budget must deliver value for money for the EU taxpayer.
We therefore feel that, in this instance, we are not prepared to criticise the Commission for this underspend.
Â Â  . This report addresses the surplus resulting from the execution of the budget for 2004.
The under-spend of payment appropriations is one of the principal components in the final balance of the 2004 budget.
Compared with previous years, the implementation of Structural Fund programmes has improved considerably.
Yet the challenges now facing the EU cannot justify this underspend.
This is particularly true of pre-accession aid, which we feel could raise serious problems in the near future.
It is therefore of crucial importance that the Commission improve its implementation in 2005, so that results show a significant reduction in the Unionâs surplus.
To conclude, I voted in favour of the Garriga Polledo report, as I had no objections to any of his pertinent observations.
Â Â  Experience has shown that the EU is unsuccessful at providing effective disaster aid.
Each Member State should instead set up, for example, a solidarity fund designed to help countries hit by various natural disasters.
Coordination should be adapted to the specific circumstances that attend each individual disaster and take account of the priorities of the countries affected.
The June List therefore chooses to vote against the reports in spite of their being, in terms of their objectives, justified and worth taking seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to say something about the Åry Report, starting by saying that I utterly fail to comprehend how a monstrous piece of legislation such as this can spend twelve years being tinkered with in the Commission, the end result being the insight that a piece of legislation on optical radiation is, as it relates to the rays of the sun, perhaps not exactly what the European man and woman in the street expect of Europe.
We, in Europe, should pay less attention to things like sunlight, which many people â who also know how to protect themselves against it in their leisure time â regard as perfectly normal, and concern ourselves instead with the things that people really do expect Europe to do something about.
By that I mean, not solar radiation, but the problems of the world such as the war in Iraq and the increasing problem of terrorism â quite different issues, indeed, and I can do no other than ask not only the Members of this House, but also the Commission, to learn from what has happened, which this vote has prevented from doing too much damage, and to concentrate their attention in future on matters that are of relevance to Europe and cause the members of the public to feel that we concern ourselves with the things that concern them.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to make a statement in relation to Mr Åryâs report, which I voted against, since I find it almost ridiculous that we want to regulate every detail of the publicâs lives from the European level downwards.
I see the treatment of Europeâs citizens as children in every area of their lives as a profoundly Socialist approach.
I would rather that, instead of adopting a directive, we had mounted an information campaign, pointing out to the public the hazards presented by artificial and natural radiation.
People must continue to take responsibility for whether or not they expose themselves to natural radiation.
I regard it as positively cynical to waste this Houseâs valuable time on a debate on a sunshine directive, while leaving unnumbered thousands of people, many of them children, to die of hunger and thirst under the African sun.
It is to that that we need to find answers.
Â Â  . Though very supportive of relevant and appropriate health and safety provisions pertaining to employees, I cannot endorse the inclusion of natural sources of optical radiation within this Directive.
Employers already have a duty to assess the risk to health and safety and to introduce appropriate control measures as specified in the Framework Directive (89/391/EEC).
Thus exposure to the sun is a known risk, for example to the agriculture and building industries, and is already sufficiently catered for.
The inclusion of natural sun radiation in the new Directive will disproportionately affect small agricultural and construction businesses and add unnecessary administrative costs, particularly in the Northern regions of Europe.
The wildly varying climates in the various EU Member States are enough to make it clear that European legislation on natural optical radiation is not appropriate.
Whilst provisions specific to exposure to artificial radiation are appropriate, the inclusion of natural sunlight radiation caused me to vote against this Directive as excessive and burdensome in its ambit and impact.
The foolishness of this proposal suggests that the people of Europe are more in need of protection from Brussels than from the sun!
Â Â  . I am appalled by the position on solar radiation adopted by the majority of MEPs â that is, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the liberals.
The proposals that they rejected were aimed at obliging employers to assess the risks to health and safety of exposure to natural sources of optical radiation, and to draw up and implement an action plan comprising technical and organisational measures intended to reduce to a minimum the health and safety risks of workers who work in the open air, without prejudice to the Member Statesâ obligation to lay down specific criteria for carrying out risk assessments taking account of the nature of the activity and the exposure in question.
That majority did not only block the adoption of the proposals that we tabled but also rejected the common position accepted by the Council on this issue, which took a similar line to ours, insofar as it proposed better protection for workers exposed to strong solar radiation, in light of the WHOâs warnings regarding the increase in cases of skin cancer.
Â Â  . I am a firm supporter of social Europe and of the protection of employees from hazards at work.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, however.
The European Union and Parliament in particular have a natural tendency towards over-regulation.
That is the case with the directive providing for protection not only against artificial radiation, but also against natural radiation.
Since the dawn of time, humankind has been able to adapt to the natural climate.
The desert Bedouins dress differently to people from the North.
Why should we want to churn out regulations governing workersâ exposure to sunlight from Sicily to the Arctic Circle?
Would it not be sufficient to apply what is today pompously referred to as the precautionary principle, namely basic caution, instead of legislating left, right and centre?
Â Â  The report is about protection in work places against exposure to optical radiation.
We support a minimum level of health and safety protection in work places, but we basically believe that this can be provided by the Member States themselves.
We support, however, the amendments involving reduced bureaucracy for companies.
Â Â  . The right-wingersâ rejection of the directive to protect workers from optical radiation testifies to a high degree of cheap opportunism on their part and represents a stab in the back for those affected by it.
Serious consideration of the dramatic increase in the incidence of skin cancers among workers â over 90Â 000 cases according to German trade associations and a figure that has increased tenfold since the 1970s â cannot but result in action!
To radiation, national borders present no obstacles.
That is why I vote for European regulation to protect workers and against the Christian Democrat motion for the rejection of the Common Position.
I cast my vote in favour of a European solution that lays down the maximum level of protection for workers who are exposed to optical radiation.
Dramatic changes in climate make it necessary that more attention be given even to natural radiation.
The rapid rise in the incidence of skin cancer in Australia should be a warning to us in Europe.
Â Â  . I voted for the various amendments which deleted natural sources of optical radiation from the scope of this Directive.
The misguided attempt to include sunlight was a gift to the ultra sceptics, who enjoyed putting about such stories as "Brussels seeks ban on sunlight".
Of course our constituents should be aware of the health risks of over-exposure to the sun, but EU-wide regulation from Brussels is not the best solution, nor is burdening employers with yet another obligation.
The responsibility for informing our peoples about the effects of sun on their skin should rest firmly with the member states and devolved governments.
There is after all a marked difference in the climate between Scotland and Greece for example and therefore health advice would be best tailored to suit local circumstances.
Â Â  . I have recently received a large number of letters from professionals in the hotel, catering and construction industries who have informed us of their legitimate concerns regarding a common position of the Council on the exposure of workers to optical radiation.
When examined more closely, this recommendation is, in fact, mind-boggling, leading one to wonder just how seriously the wording can be taken.
The need to improve and better manage the safety of workers exposed - in industry, for instance - to artificial optical radiation is understandable, but why was it necessary also to take an interest in so-called ânaturalâ optical radiation?
Why is there this desire excessively to regulate the working conditions of people exposed to the âŠsun to varying degrees?
Besides attracting ridicule, these proposals which, if implemented, would produce inconclusive results, clearly look set to increase restrictions, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Against the backdrop of international insecurity that is turning our countries upside down and of an economic and social crisis and crisis of identity, this kind of unbelievable proposal demonstrates once again the degree to which these pro-Europeans who want to control everything are out of touch with reality.
That is why I opposed this new gimmick which, with its administrative overkill and the financial stranglehold it exerts, is in danger of placing a dark cloud over many of our businesses.
Â Â  . A lot of hot air has been generated over this directive on the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents.
Owing to the splitting of the proposal, the common position is concerned only with the specific minimum requirements for the protection of workers from risks to their health and safety arising or likely to arise from exposure to optical radiation.
This has led some to try and caricature this as the protection from sunlight directive.
In my view despite attempts to ridicule the proposal it does strike a good balance between protectionism and over-regulation.
Â Â  . As Labour spokesperson on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted for this piece of legislation today because I believe it will protect workers across Europe in a key health and safety area currently not covered fully in national legislation of Member States and will be protection for workers in my constituency of London.
Some MEPs have tried to remove the issue of natural 'sunlight' from the Report.
As a Labour MEP, I backed the UK Government and the Council line to back the common position as we believe it is a good balance between protectionism and over regulation.
Â Â  . The growing demands to improve working conditions and to protect workersâ health and safety are a positive sign of economic development.
A balance must be struck, however, so as to avoid making unreasonable demands by over-legislating.
As regards the issue before us, it is important to make a subtle distinction between employersâ responsibilities and the precautions that all workers must take in both professional and private life.
Balance and moderation must therefore be found and, broadly speaking, I feel that the rapporteur has succeeded in that aim.
Â Â  . On behalf of the British Conservative Delegation of the EPP-ED Group, I would confirm that we voted against those amendment references to the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe because following the referenda outcomes in France and the Netherlands they no longer have the relevance they may have had when drafted.
We support the overall direction of the Report and accordingly have voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  We have today voted against MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnezâ report because we believe that it contravenes Swedish legislation on freedom of the press and of expression and its clear rules governing media independence.
The report contains proposals as to how minors might best be protected from harmful and unsuitable content on the Internet.
We have nothing against such protection, but see it as a very important issue.
However, the report also recommends that the Member States introduce a right of reply in connection with all the audiovisual and information services on the Net, as well as introduce rules on media ownership.
For these reasons, we have chosen to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  Ensuring that minors do not have access to broadcasts or services for adults in the field of audiovisual services is obviously a very important issue.
We believe, however, that to prepare legislative measures at EU level in order to protect minorsâ physical, mental and moral development in relation to these services would be the wrong route to go down.
Web hosting will always exist around the world, outside the EU.
As has been observed, a lot depends on sound parental control, and parents now have the opportunity to install filters on their computers.
The draft report has positive features, but it goes absurdly far in proposing, for example, that a domain name, such as .KID, be set up at secondary level.
We believe that it is up to the democratic institutions in each Member State to solve these alarming problems.
The EU should offer a framework for common standards within this area, to which the Member States can subscribe, rather as happens with the Schengen Agreement.
We have definitely voted against all the amendments referring to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
That treaty has been rejected.
Â Â  . This report, which starts off with the best of intentions, quickly becomes an unbelievable mishmash.
The explanatory statement began well, however, and the report was obviously concerned with envisaging greater protection for minors not only against the scourges of pornography, paedophilia and violent images and content, but also â and this has been forgotten â against the incitement to use drugs or to behave dangerously, as well as recruitment and enrolment in fanatical and terrorist operations.
The subject area was rather vast and our policies, I am afraid, rather too weak for the purposes of looking more seriously into these extremely alarming facts and attempting to deal with them in order to protect our children.
Instead of doing that, the report strays from the point, spreads itself too thinly and jumbles together anything and everything. Pornography is certainly in there, but so too is the fight against discrimination, as are teacher training and, finally, the right of reply, though it is not really clear of what possible benefit this might be to minors.
The reportâs technique, which is commonplace in this House, is to evade the political issue, notwithstanding the host of good intentions.
Once again, it makes this text obscure, abstruse, ideological and, therefore, completely ineffective.
Â Â  . I wish to express my full support for this recommendation, which is aimed at ensuring an effective level of protection of minors and human dignity in all audiovisual and information services.
Young people spend more and more time on the Internet, where millions of pages with pornographic content can be found.
Accordingly, both providers and users have a responsibility to ensure that this new technology can be used with confidence.
The protection of minors entails politicians, businesspeople, teachers and parents working together.
Education syllabuses must include Internet education programmes aimed at children, but also for adults and parents, and information campaigns must be set up to alert the general public to the dangers posed by Internet use.
I particularly welcome the creation of a domain name (.KID), which would provide a secure Internet area regularly monitored by an independent authority.
Lastly, service providers should start to provide easy-to-use parental software and offer subscriptions to access services intended specifically for children with automatic filtering at source.
This would make it possible to restore a degree of confidence in the use of the Internet.
Â Â  . It is vital that the protection of young people from harmful content on the internet as in broadcasting keeps up with technological developments.
This report makes it clear that self-regulation is good but insufficient protection for children against harmful content.
The report calls for a variety of measures to improve protection including automatic filter systems for Internet access for children and for the Commission to organise an information campaign for all citizens on safer use of the Internet and a Europe-wide toll free helpline with information on filters.
This issue is extremely complex but I hope in the light of the adoption of this report the institutions can cooperate to find continuing effective ways to protect our young people.
Â Â  . The content that can nowadays be found on the Internet presents huge challenges in terms of the protection of minors and human dignity, and clear responses to those challenges are required.
This report proposes a range of measures relating to education and the training of teachers and trainers, codes of conduct and information on illegal or suspicious activities on the network.
It also proposes measures that the European authorities could take to improve the gathering and exchange of information.
The industry and the authorities at national and European level should consider steps that they can take to enhance the protection of minors.
There is no doubt in my mind that we must all play a proactive role in finding ways of increasing the much-needed protection of minors, the protection of human dignity and the fight against crime and illegal activity.
Â Â  .â The very title of the Commission recommendation reveals the real intention of its authors, which is to leave the profitability of the entertainment and Internet industry well alone.
Secondary measures are being formulated which are directed at governments, the industry and parents and teachers and which do nothing to change the present wretched situation.
The only proposal which would have been of substantial value would have been an express ban on the production and broadcasting of radio and television and electronic material with disgraceful content which insults human dignity.
As far as minors are concerned, industry is typically left unaccountable while additional incentives are proposed for the use, for example, of special filters for violent, racist and pornographic images.
The burden of responsibility falls solely on parents to take lessons in how to use the Internet so that they can help their children.
The amendments by the Committee on Culture and Education do not differ substantially in any way from the foregoing.
Consequently, once again human dignity and the harmonious physical, mental and moral development of minors is getting into the Procrustean bed of the European audiovisual industry and the Lisbon Strategy, in other words of the savage exploitative system of the profitability of big business.
It is for these reasons that the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the relevant texts.
Â Â  . I welcome the Commission proposal which aims to improve the health of European children by facilitating research, development and authorisation of medicines for use in children.
I am delighted that such an important opportunity has arisen for children to enjoy the same access to innovative new medicines as adults already enjoy.
I recognise and agree with the need for rewards and incentives to industry which will encourage the development of paediatric medicinal products.
I have closely reviewed the discussions and debates on how best to achieve this and I can support the Commissionâs proposal regarding the SPC extension, in tandem with the review mechanism proposed in the Regulation.
I agree with the principles of transparency and public accessibility which are at the heart of the proposal to amend Article 40 to include a provision for public access to paediatric clinical trial information.
However concerns raised by industry regarding the possibility that public expectations may be raised prematurely with regard to some products and commercial sensitivity of information are also valid.
Â Â  This report contravenes a very important principle of EU cooperation, namely the country of origin principle.
It proposes that an EU paediatric authority be set up to assess, approve and monitor paediatric medicines and encourage their production.
There are, however, no good reasons for centralising this activity in a new EU authority.
The report is also based on the notion that the pharmaceutical industry does not think it profitable to develop special paediatric medicines.
That is not very convincing.
If there is demand, there is also supply.
If there is anything that companies in a market economy are good at, it is identifying niches and manufacturing products for them.
If it is true that there is a great need for special paediatric medicines, the solution should be sought on the demand side through the authorities in the individual countries.
The whole report is permeated by efforts to extend the EUâs influence and develop new bureaucracies.
For these reasons, we have voted against the report.
Â Â  . The intention of this proposed regulation is laudable.
It makes sense to improve the treatment of children by increasing the research, development and approval of medicines which are suited to the metabolism of the child.
I regret that amendments tabled by my Group were not adopted.
These would have made it a requirement of the approval mechanism to consider whether significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments had been achieved.
Â Â  . I warmly welcome this proposal.
A decade or more after the USA, the EU is at last set to adopt legislation requiring the testing of pharmaceutical products for children as part of their approval process.
These new rules should ensure that more drugs are developed for children and that they are administered in safe and effective dosages.
In return for pharmaceutical companies carrying out mandatory clinical trials for drugs intended for use in children they will be given financial compensation.
The financial compensation proposed by the Commission involves granting companies an extra six months Supplementary Protection Certificate, that is, a form of extended patent.
This must be monitored to ensure that it does not lead to excessive profits.
Â Â  . Labour MEPs support the principle of awarding incentives to pharmaceutical companies in order to stimulate the necessary research and development.
We therefore support the concept of extending the SPC, but question the Commission proposal for an automatic six-month extension.
We feel a variable length SPC extension would have been better and fairer, because the amount of incentive would better have reflected the costs of research.
Of the options on the table, we therefore supported the three- plus three-month extension.
We did not, however, support the option of a fixed four- or five- month SPC extension, because this risks being unfair to smaller companies.
Â Â  . Our desire to improve childrenâs health has been the driving force behind the Unionâs policy on support for research and development into new medicinal products for paediatric use.
This report contains a number of measures to ensure that all research and development regarding these medicinal products, and the final authorisation for their paediatric use, be reviewed by independent authorities that are specialised in this field.
Furthermore, the report proposes coherent measures on administrative deadlines, whilst safeguarding quality levels and ensuring that exchanges of information in the field can take place.
This is a field of research that is capable of bringing us great joy in terms of fighting disease.
We must therefore take care to ensure that all measures that we take reflect the need for quality and rigour in pursuit of these goals.
I therefore voted in favour of the GrossetÃªte report.
Â Â  . These new rules are long overdue.
Fifty per cent of medicines used to treat children in Europe have not been tested and are not authorised.
Every parent wants to have the peace of mind of knowing that a medicine used on their son or daughter is safe.
These new rules would go some way towards guaranteeing this safety, which at present is not clearly established.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted for the report by Mrs GrossetÃªte with much conviction, and would, moreover, like to congratulate her on the work she has done.
In her report, she has managed to strike the right balance.
I am therefore very much in favour of extending the patent protection of paediatric medicines by a fixed six-month term.
The alternatives available (such as two plus four, three plus three) are unviable practically speaking, involve much red tape and threaten to neutralise the positive stimulus that this legislation gives to scientific research.
Â Â  . I know from direct personal experience that the burden placed upon businesses, especially SMEs, by the obligation to administer VAT is very significant, and therefore I support moves such as this to simplify the process.
I also strongly believe that there should remain with Member States a reasonable degree of flexibility, such as in setting turnover thresholds and applying reduced or zero rates of VAT.
Â Â  . I welcome the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as regards the introduction of administrative cooperation arrangements in the context of the one-stop scheme and the refund procedure for VAT.
The aim of simplifying VAT is an admirable one.
I support the various amendments striving to establish better cooperation between taxable persons and tax administrations, also those that help to improve cooperation between Member Statesâ tax authorities.
The Rapporteur suggests to introduce a minimum limit of EUR 50.000 for exemption from VAT.
The suggestion concerns only first 3 years of the activity of a newly established SME.
This new lower bound of exemption contributes to SME's brisker economic performance, generating more employment across the EU, further realising the Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  . One of the basic rules that has long been taught by economists is that the cost of levying a tax should be lower than the money accrued.
That goes without saying.
There is another rule, however, which is that the payment of taxes should be as simple as possible, so that the cost of the tax is not pushed up by a âbureaucratic taxâ, which is both short-sighted and, more to the point, inefficient.
In this context, I welcome the initiatives aimed at simplifying the processes of charging, paying and refunding VAT.
Â Â  . The EPLP does not accept or agree that the thresholds for calculation of VAT are best dealt with at EU level.
It is up to Member States to promote the most appropriate calculations, especially for their micro-companies.
This allows Member States to fulfil their promises the Lisbon agenda, in making appropriate allowances for such businesses, and to set an entrepreneurially sensitive approach.
Â Â  The next item is the statement of the Council and of the Commission on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a great and genuine honour for me to be here in the European Parliament today on behalf of the Council.
I personally welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation in the Middle East.
We are witnessing a new chapter of that regionâs history, which brings with it both opportunities and considerable challenges.
I would like to begin by welcoming the historic progress made by Israelâs withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank.
The European Union commends the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority for their commitment to overcoming the difficult challenges they both face.
We are pleased that the disengagement process has so far gone well, with the avoidance of significant violence.
The Israeli Government, with the assistance of the Palestinian Authority, carried out the disengagement plan effectively and quickly.
The security forces evacuated the settlers sensitively but with resolve and determination.
In short, they managed a difficult task well.
We applaud the close coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and encourage them to continue on this path.
We are keen to see that disengagement is a success across the board.
To this end, we welcome, and urge the continuation of, the restraint shown by the majority of Israelis and, indeed, of Palestinians.
The success of the disengagement process so far encourages both parties to continue their cooperation on the remaining steps of the process, not least in their close work with the Quartetâs Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn.
He has presented plans for action to support Palestinian economic and institutional development in the context of disengagement and beyond, identifying key areas where progress would be needed.
These include transport links, border crossings, customs issues between Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, the link between Gaza and the West Bank, and air and sea ports.
The international community has pledged its full support.
Freeing-up of movement within the West Bank is essential to Palestinian economic revival.
Improved access for people and goods, while maintaining security for Israelis, will also be crucial to creating a sense of hope for the Palestinians.
Taking full advantage of the opportunity of disengagement and promoting continued reform of Palestinian institutions â as set out at the London meeting on March 1 â will be our two main priorities during our Presidency.
In this context, the European Union will work closely, of course, with Mr Wolfensohn in order to help realise plans to make Gaza economically viable after the Israeli withdrawal.
It is also important that we look beyond disengagement to advance the political process and to take advantage of the opportunity it represents.
After disengagement, both sides will need to focus on making progress against their roadmap and Sharm El-Sheikh commitments.
In Iraq, we have also witnessed another important step forward following the publication of Iraqâs constitution as recently as 28 August 2005.
We congratulate the Iraqi people on reaching this important milestone in the political process.
Drafting the constitution has, of course, been difficult.
All of Iraqâs communities have worked together to draft this constitution and there have been compromises on all sides.
But they have now produced a constitution that we hope will be a key building-block towards a democratic Iraq.
In particular, the principles of democracy and basic human rights are, with Islam, the founding tenets of the new Iraq.
No law can be passed that contradicts those tenets.
All Iraqis are held equal before the law, regardless of gender or, indeed, of religion.
Freedom of belief is protected in the constitution.
All extremist groups are prohibited.
The new Iraq pledges to respect its neighbours and its international obligations.
The oil of Iraq is owned by all the Iraqi people and is to be exploited so as to maximise the benefit to the Iraqi people.
The European Union will continue to encourage all Iraqis to play a part in the next stage of the political process by voting on the draft constitution in the October referendum.
Broad public support for the constitution will help ensure a stable future for Iraq.
The Iraqis have succeeded in drafting this constitution despite the actions of terrorists who are trying to destroy the countryâs desire for that peaceful future.
The Council recognises the many challenges still ahead for Iraq, particularly in terms of the security of its people.
The European Union is working to build up the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and the judiciary through its integrated Rule of Law and Police Training Mission.
On Iran, however, we are deeply concerned by that countryâs unilateral resumption of activity at the uranium conversion facility in Esfahan on 8 August.
This is in clear breach of successive IAEA Board resolutions and, indeed, the Paris Agreement Iran entered into just last November.
The IAEA Board resolution, which was adopted by consensus on 11 August, is a clear and united signal from the international community of its wish that Iran return to suspending all conversion activities without delay.
We also regret that Iran has chosen to reject, without serious consideration, the European sideâs detailed proposals presented on 5 August.
These are the most far-reaching proposals for relations between Iran and Europe since the Revolution.
They would lead to a new relationship based on cooperation.
I would like to reiterate that the European side is not asking Iran to give up its civil nuclear programme.
The European proposal specifically offered support for that programme, but there is no civilian operational need for Iran to develop fuel cycle capabilities.
Putting its fuel cycle activities on hold would not affect Iranâs ability to develop a civil power and research programme; yet allowing them to continue would bring Iran closer to the ability to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon.
We remain committed to a diplomatic solution.
We hope Iran will reverse its decision and re-suspend uranium conversion activity.
The key to resolving this issue is for Iran to take the confidence-building steps requested of it by successive IAEA Board resolutions and restore the suspension.
As part of our wider engagement with the region, Novemberâs Euro-Med 10th Anniversary Summit in Barcelona will be a critical opportunity to help the European Unionâs Mediterranean partners to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
The Barcelona Process needs to modernise and move towards a more results-orientated process, with much more focus on reform.
In other words, it needs to address the concerns of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean.
The 1995 Declaration was a landmark and much of it remains valid today. But it still requires much in the way of implementation.
This includes the need to address obstacles to progress on governance, human rights, market openness and foreign investment.
We want to see medium-term targets adopted at that Summit outlining the kind of region we all want to see in five years.
We cannot achieve these aims without peace in the region.
Without peace, we will not achieve the zone of stability and prosperity that is our shared objective.
But lack of peace should not also become an extra barrier to progress elsewhere.
We would do well to heed the demands of the people across the region for more transparent government, for economic reform and for social and cultural awareness.
We believe that there is a new determination in the region to address the challenges facing its people.
We are determined to work hard to ensure that the Barcelona Process plays a full role in addressing the challenges facing citizens across the Euro-Med region.
The Summit would be a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate that our partnership is relevant to our peoples and can deliver results on the issues that matter to them.
Our partnership can help achieve a step change in regional development and indeed modernisation, through action on good governance, economic reform and education.
Delivering results in these key areas, against specific targets and commitments, will help drive forward regional progress.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, it is my pleasure to be able to address you today on the Middle East peace process at a time when there is a renewed feeling of momentum and hope.
After five years of the second Intifada, the past six months of calm have witnessed a downturn in violence and terrorist acts and the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and removal of settlers from certain parts of the northern West bank has passed off smoothly.
The professionalism of both sides is to be commended.
But real challenges lie ahead.
By this I mean firstly putting in place the conditions necessary so that the Israeli withdrawal creates an opportunity for ordinary Palestinians to improve their daily lives. Secondly, the implementation of the roadmap in full, and thirdly, the creation of a viable Palestinian state at peace with its neighbour, Israel.
The Commission recognises that for the recent disengagement to be considered a success it must bring tangible and immediate improvement to the lives of ordinary Palestinians.
The Commission has therefore launched a EURÂ 60Â million package as an immediate response to the withdrawal.
This consists of a EURÂ 40Â million infrastructure facility geared to labour-intensive, fast-disbursing projects to restore essential services in the West Bank and Gaza; EURÂ 12Â million assistance to institution-building to help the Palestinians assume governance responsibilities following disengagement, and a package of EURÂ 8Â million focusing on social services, as well as East Jerusalem.
The Commission is also working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify common projects in the infrastructure sector.
I would like to mention here the fact that we have already in place the European neighbourhood policy and that we have already agreed common action plans with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan and that the Commission is absolutely convinced that in the context of the European neighbourhood policy Europe can play an important and helpful role in overcoming the problems of the region.
This assistance will not, however, achieve its desired results unless Israel and the Palestinian Authority tackle such important issues as movement of people and goods between Gaza and the West Bank and the outside world, the greenhouses, operation of the border terminals, the dismantling and removal of settlers' homes and movement of people within the West Bank.
It is for this reason that the Commission is providing financial, political and human resources support to the Quartet Special Envoy James Wolfensohn, whose contribution to the disengagement has been remarkable.
The Special Envoy has succeeded in fostering dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and Israel on each of these issues.
However, only one â the greenhouses â has been settled in full.
The Commission is helping in this.
We are, for example, ready to fund a new presence at border crossings as a confidence-building measure, if the parties so request.
The Commission is also keenly aware of the need to maintain the Israel-Palestinian Authority customs union so as to avoid possible trade disruption and to do what it can to promote interregional trade and investment.
The second challenge for the peace process is implementation of the roadmap.
The disengagement has clearly been traumatic for Israel, but it has not caused the much-feared rift in Israeli society.
On the Palestinian side, President Abbas was able to keep the Palestinian factions in check.
It is now for the international community to help move both sides forward in parallel, helping the Palestinian Authority to make progress on tackling incitement and the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and pressing Israel to bring to a halt the creation of new 'facts on the ground', which threaten to undermine future final status negotiations.
Settlement activity in and around Jerusalem and the route of the separation barrier are the two most pressing issues.
The third challenge is how to promote the creation of a viable Palestinian State, for which the implementation of the roadmap is a necessary condition.
There is already renewed impetus for Palestinian reform, institution- building, stemming from the intention of the Palestinian Authority to establish a medium-term plan for economic development and from the G8 political commitment to raise up to EURÂ 3Â billion each year for the next three years in order to fund this plan.
In the coming weeks, the Commission will be putting forward proposals for a comprehensive and coherent medium-term strategy for the European Union's relations with a future Palestinian State, including better coordination of EU positions and financial assistance.
We need to see how best we can promote the political and economic viability of a future Palestinian State through targeted assistance in support of reform and institution-building.
It is clear that efforts must be geared towards the promotion of human rights and democratic principles, the rule of law, improved security and increased effectiveness of public administration.
Â Â  . Mr President, it has to be said that the evacuation of the settlements in the Gaza Strip is long-awaited good news, within a context in which the only news we have been hearing has been of hate, death, endless suffering and desolation.
It now falls to the Palestinians â and I would like to mention their leader, Mahmoud Abbas to follow the democratic path marked out, to control the extremist movements and to consolidate their institutions.
For its part, Israel should also cease building new settlements and together, by means of dialogue, they should seek to establish, as Commissioner Verheugen has just said, two viable States which are secure and have recognised borders based on the United Nationsâ resolutions.
Of course, other problems remain to be solved, and these are clearly laid out in the road map.
I refer to the problem of East Jerusalem, that of the refugees and that of the conflict between Israel and Syria.
In addition, all this comes within a political context in which we have seen the resignation of Mr Netanyahu as a member of the government in order to contest Prime Minister Sharonâs leadership of Likud, and also in which there are going to be Palestinian elections.
A European Union mission of observers led by our fellow Member MrsÂ VÃ©ronique De Keyser will monitor the latter, and I would like to wish it all the best.
I therefore welcome the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the effect that the European Union must play a fundamental role, in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace in the region.
The European Union is the main donor to Palestine.
The Union is a partner of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and also of Syria in the future Association Agreement, so it is clear that it must play a fundamental role in the political and economic reforms in the region.
Consequently, I welcome the initiatives presented by the European Commission as a first step regarding the package of EUR 60 million to rebuild the infrastructures of the region and consolidate the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have pointed out in your speeches, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was an important move in the right direction.
We should have preferred it, however, if it had happened within the framework set out in the roadmap and with the Quartet playing a different role.
In any case, it has shown that it is possible to make progress without violence on the road to peace and compliance with international law.
We are not ignoring the tensions that have arisen within part of Israeli society and particularly in the political sphere in that country, especially in relation to the prospects that are now opening up and the further steps that have to be taken.
An important factor in this situation is the commitment of the international community and the European Union to pursue the only feasible prospect: that of continuing the peace process until the Palestinian peopleâs right to have a sovereign state is realised, with peace and security for both peoples.
The message that we wish to put across in this debate is very clear and is primarily a political message.
The more nationalistic sectors of Israeli society, currently represented by Minister Netanyahu, must not think that they will find any space or understanding unless they comply with international law.
Continuing the settlements policy will mean condemning Israel to international isolation and encouraging the most extremist sectors in the Palestinian community.
At the same time, the proponents of terrorism must avoid claiming the Gaza withdrawal as a victory, since it was the outcome of the renewed prestige of the Palestinian leadership on the world stage.
It is important, therefore, as you have said, that the Palestinians continue the process that started with the presidential elections.
In that respect, we welcome the fact that the date has been set for political elections and we are in favour of pushing ahead with the reforms announced by President Abu Mazen when he was elected, relentlessly continuing the work of opposing terrorism and violence.
For its part, however, the international community must still bear in mind that political terrorism of Islamic origin, which is also of such great concern to people in our own countries, will be dealt a decisive blow if we are able to defuse the main source of hatred and tension, which is the Middle East conflict.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ever since I was little, the Middle East has dominated news broadcasts.
Unfortunately, the news has mostly been about misery, violence, war, oppression and ultra-conservative rulers.
Nowhere in the world is the lack of freedom as concentrated as, specifically, in the Middle East.
Half a billion people live under dictatorships there, with the Israeli democracy as the only exception.
That is naturally a problem for the people who live there.
They are entitled, just as we are, to democracy and human rights.
It is also a global problem.
If people can see no future, then frustration, fanaticism and fundamentalism thrive.
Certainly, there are signs that the situation is changing.
An example of this is todayâs presidential election in Egypt.
It is a step forward, even if Mubarak will, of course, be the victor.
There is, in any case, more than one candidate.
The development in Lebanon, whereby the Syrian occupying power was thrown out, is also very positive.
The decision to allow women in Kuwait to vote next year is also an important step forward.
As has already been mentioned in this Chamber, the evacuation of Gaza which, in spite of everything, went so smoothly, is an incredibly important step for the continued peace process and the establishment of two states.
The forthcoming Palestinian election will be an important test of how far the reforms within the Palestinian government have gone and of how the process can progress.
Iraq has a government, a draft constitution and powerful forces wanting democracy and stability, but the situation is of course incredibly painful, what with the daily violence that people are forced to live with.
There are, however, an incredibly large number of problems remaining in the Middle East.
The Presidency mentioned Iran and the mullahs there who, with their nuclear weapons programme, have now been mocking, and trifling with, the world community for several months.
This is an issue that the UN must tackle.
We cannot continue to engage in âpretend negotiationsâ with Iran in this way.
Its oppression of its own people continues unabated, which is completely unacceptable.
The oppression of people in the region cannot be tolerated.
The EU, together with the United States, international organisations, foundations and the opposition in these and other countries should therefore take a combined initiative and devise an international peace and democracy plan for the whole of the Middle East.
It is precisely on democracy that the resources of the Barcelona process should be much more focused.
Nothing would be better for peace, stability and the fight against terrorism throughout the world than if democracy were to triumph in the Middle East.
We have a big responsibility in this area.
Â Â  . Mr President, we see Israelâs departure from Gaza as very positive, and it must represent the beginning of a new process leading to peace in the Middle East.
The European Union should guarantee that every possible effort is made to improve the quality of life of Palestinians in Gaza.
The Union ought also to guarantee access to the economy and the opening of the port and the airport as soon as possible. In addition it should press for the development of other aspects of economic activity, such as connection and communication between Gaza and the West Bank.
Nevertheless, in contrast to the hope represented by Gaza, we fear that the current Israeli policy in Jerusalem may slam shut the so-called window of opportunity just at the most sensitive and volatile point of the conflict.
We are absolutely delighted that the majority of Israelis and their government appear to have abandoned the idea of a âGreater Israelâ, but we regret that that project may possibly be replaced with that of a âGreater Jerusalemâ spreading relentlessly over Palestinian territory.
So far, 164 km2 of the West Bank have been appropriated, to the north, the east and the south of the city of Jerusalem.
This unilateral appropriation does not serve Israelâs interests, because it jeopardises any stable peace and security agreement, and is creating a worrying situation on the ground, from the point of view of demography and town-planning.
The construction work would effectively amputate East Jerusalem from the West Bank and destroy the territorial continuity that is essential to any future remotely viable or credible Palestinian State.
That is a recipe for disaster.
The policy would leave the Palestinian cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and East Jerusalem practically cut off from each other.
The E1 Project, which plans homes for 15Â 000 people, hotels and industrial areas to the east of Jerusalem is of particular concern, and I hope the Council and the Commission will take due note of this.
In reality, the project would complete the process of separating the north of the West Bank from the south.
The European Union must aim to ensure that Jerusalem becomes a city populated by two peoples, two nations, and also the capital of two viable States living in peace.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we have all borne witness recently to historic events in the Middle East of particular political importance.
The implementation of Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement plan was a development which we cannot but welcome, because it unquestionably constitutes a positive development and an important step towards the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problem.
However, we must at the same time note that the implementation of this plan, which â I repeat â we welcome, cannot under any circumstances be the final solution to the problem.
I consider that it is no coincidence that, while the implementation of the plan has turned the Gaza Strip into a free zone, the number of settlers on the West Bank has increased dramatically recently.
Following the private meeting during the official visit between President Borrel and Prime Minister Arial Sharon last June, it would appear clear that the disengagement plan does not form part of a political process with the objective of an end to the occupation, the return of refugees and the foundation of an independent Palestinian state and I greatly fear that the of the occupation continue to exist.
Israel still maintains control of the borders with Egypt in the Gaza Strip as far as the movement of goods is concerned and continues to maintain the right of strategic intervention in that it continues, at the same time, to control the coast, the airspace and the borders of the Gaza Strip.
We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union in general, should continue to monitor developments in the area with close attention and, at the same time, to exert pressure on all sides to engage in substantial talks which will result before the end of 2005 in significant progress and, very soon, in a final solution to the problem, a solution which cannot but be the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and, of course, the demolition of the wall and an end to the occupation, so that the two nations can build a peaceful future which will contribute to peace and progress throughout the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, âA political party cannot bear arms; this exists in no democracyâ.
Those are the wise words of Mr Solana, the EUâs High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, but do not square up with the truth in the Gaza Strip, on the West Bank and in Lebanon, for indeed, both Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic terror movement, and Hezbollah, its Lebanese strategic ally, serve a dual purpose at the moment.
They are fully committed to day-to-day political life and perfect their military formations in the process.
With this dual strategy, Hamas and Hezbollah not only bring the internal Palestinian and Lebanese political relations to a head, they also deliberately head for an armed confrontation with Israel.
We will end up with either the Intifada or else persistent armed chaos in the Palestinian regions and the threatening prospect of a new Lebanese civil war â a sad outcome, indeed, of Israelâs unilateral withdrawal from Gaza.
This is a true spectre for the Middle East, certainly if we take Hamasâ present media campaign seriously, for its war cry is: no pointless negotiations with the Zionist enemy, but continuation of the Jihad to liberate the whole of Palestine.
Given this critical situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I am very keen to find out the Councilâs position in respect of Hamas and Hezbollah.
Are these Islamic terror organisations â or why not just call them warring factions â quasi-normal political negotiating partners for the European Union?
I would much rather find out what concrete steps the Council wishes to take to dismantle the so-called military branches of Hamas and Hezbollah.
The Council should give me this information on the basis of the UN resolution No 1559 with regard to Hezbollah and our own European list of terrorist organisations with regard to Hamas.
This is the perfect opportunity for the European Union, the Council and Commission to fulfil its ambition of being a peace-maker in the Middle East.
Â Â  Mr President, the Middle East continues to be without equal as a crisis hotspot after the USA presented Iraq as its model example of how to democratise and liberalise the Islamic world, and as a way of, so to speak, solving all problems with a single stroke.
It was an experiment intended to stabilise the region, secure access to oil and facilitate disarmament and demilitarisation, but it failed, and the war against terrorism, having driven a wedge between the European allies, is seen by the Arab world as a strategic campaign to secure oil supplies.
Fanatics were able to depict the American occupation as a war on the Islamic world.
Bush has not only left a country in ruins but has also created a breeding ground for more terrorist training camps.
The American intervention was nothing more than a badly-prepared occupation, embarked on as a sort of solo act; they underestimated both the potential for resistance and the costs involved â the latter of which they now want their partners, such as us Europeans, to cover after the event.
For the problem of Israel and the Palestinians, too, no real solution is yet in sight.
Although the evacuation of the Gaza Strip and the seeking of a two-state solution appear to have injected some impetus into the peace process, which has dragged on for decades, its success will largely be dependent on the economic success of the new structure, and that is where Europe will, no doubt, have to help out.
Most disturbing of all is the nuclear weapons race in this region, for which the problematic existence of Israelâs nuclear arsenal is always cited as a pretext.
The consequence of this is that Arabs have become convinced that the USA, in any case of doubt, will always take Israelâs side, and nuclear weaponry has become more attractive as a prestige project.
Where weapons of mass destruction are concerned, an inherent momentum has developed, scarcely capable of being held in check and spurring neighbouring states to acquire weapons of this type, so that the Middle East remains a region with the potential to threaten the world as a whole.
Europe may well, at present, be outside the range of rockets from the Middle East, but our also becoming a target is only a matter of time.
This means that the EU must redouble its efforts in the Middle East, but Turkish accession will do nothing to stabilise the region, one reason for this being that Islamists do not, whatever some Europeans might hope, accept Turkey as a mediator and channel for communication.
Â Â  Mr President, today is a happy day for Egypt because, for the first time in a generation, the Egyptian people have an opportunity to vote for a president and have a choice in that vote.
I and some colleagues here in the Chamber who sought the release of one of the presidential candidates, DrÂ Ayman Noor, on 12Â March will be particularly interested in the outcome, since it was our intention to visit him in prison, where he had been put by the Egyptian authorities, having declared his opposition to President Mubarak.
It was in Cairo that the United States Secretary of State made an important statement on 22Â June at the American University, where she declared that, in the Middle East, democracy was better than stability, overturning â as she put it â 60Â years of American policy.
There has been a degree of cynicism about this change of approach, but nevertheless it represents some sort of step forward in the relations between the United States and the Middle East.
I believe that the European Union should try and reflect this shift in policy; not that democracy is better than stability, but that democracy and human rights are better than âbusiness as usualâ.
One of the things that singles out the European Unionâs approach to the Middle East is this conjunction of democracy and human rights.
Obviously, I regret that the Commission is rather less than ambitious in its programmes of democratisation, and we hope to see that improve in the coming months.
In addition, the European Parliament has a role to play, through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, in particular.
I believe that the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean is going to be of increasing importance.
The next elections in Egypt will be the parliamentary elections and I hope that this House will agree that we should send a mission to Egypt for those elections, whether or not we are invited.
Â Â  MrÂ President, should we or should we not see the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip as an indication that there will be peace in the Middle East?
I choose to believe this is the case even though I know that a glass half-full can be considered a glass half-empty.
I therefore welcome this withdrawal from Gaza as symbolic of the fact that no settlement is a permanent fixture and that they can all be dismantled in the future.
I also choose to believe that the wall, which the Israeli Authority has always declared temporary, will one day fall.
I choose to believe that no extremist group will harm this fragile hope of peace with a terrorist attack and, above all, that no authority will take advantage of an isolated criminal act to carry out collective reprisals and ruin any hope of peace.
The withdrawal from Gaza has been difficult.
The Israeli Government has carried it out with courage and determination and the Palestinian Authority with a great deal of maturity.
Yet the glass is sadly also half-empty.
Continued colonisation in the West Bank runs counter to the idea of long-lasting peace, in the same manner as the encirclement of East Jerusalem and the way in which Israel is gaining ground there.
The potential isolation of Gaza, which is over-populated and cut off from any possible economic development, makes it a real ticking time bomb.
That is why I emphasise the need for Europe, while paying tribute to those who have secured this successful disengagement, not to be blind to these worrying signs and to continue to exert pressure so that Gaza has air and sea ports and access to the West Bank and to Egypt, thus preventing it from closing on its inhabitants like a trap, so that international law and humanitarian law are respected and regularly evaluated in this region and so that the road map is relaunched.
Europe has always condemned terrorism and violence and has instead favoured political negotiation and international law.
Even if progress is slow, it is not a pointless exercise to tirelessly repeat what are our commitments in the Middle East.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrÂ Alexander for his presence here this afternoon, together with MrÂ Verheugen, whom I left in plenary last night at 11.47 p.m. and who has covered a lot of ground this part-session in Strasbourg.
To turn to more serious matters now, in January, the EU High Representative, MrÂ Solana, spoke to us about a window of opportunities, and better still, an avenue of hope, following a series of developments in the region which included, of course, the election of MahmoudÂ Abbas as President and his courageous remarks about the demilitarisation of the Intifada.
What followed did not prove him wrong, as it has just led, as we know, to the disengagement from the Gaza Strip.
Whatever may be our opinion on this withdrawal, however we may be divided and there is division on this issue we cannot but congratulate the Israeli authorities on the way in which they have carried out this operation; this is a human tragedy for the families concerned, a heartbreaking experience for the soldiers and a crucial test for Israeli society as a whole, which some people are underestimating in a slightly underhand manner.
An absence of violence, of victims and of civil war, too, is a success story for which the Palestinian Authority can also take credit.
MrÂ Abbas has spared no effort to facilitate the operations and, above all, to prevent any terrorist attack during the entire period of disengagement.
At this point, you will ask me: what must be done?
It is a question of turning this military success into a political success, of harnessing this positive energy in order to return to the road map, since the withdrawal from Gaza can only be the start of a process.
The major challenges awaiting ArielÂ Sharon as well as MahmoudÂ Abbas are on a huge scale: an end to the settlements, more substantial withdrawals, particularly on the part of the Israelis, and, of course, for the Palestinian leader the disarmament of the terrorist organisations.
Following the destruction of a building in Gaza on Monday and the assassination of his security advisor only this morning, AbuÂ Mazen has just demanded scarcely a few hours ago a plan for disarming Hamas in Gaza.
We must provide him with the means to continue; we are all aware that the battle has begun between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas for control of Gaza and that the EURÂ 60Â million that has just been released â and which the Commissioner has spoken about â will be a vital strategic support for the Palestinian leader.
We thank the Commission, we rely on it and we will be particularly vigilant, I wish to say, in ensuring that stringent checks are carried out to reassure European taxpayers about how this significant sum of money is to be appropriated.
âThere is a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time for war and a time for peaceâ, those are not my words, they are in the Ecclesiastes; I was talking about hope just now, not naÃ¯ve optimism.
Yet, we are today experiencing a very special moment in time â , to quote MrÂ Solana â and we would like to see the parties concerned seize it with our help so as to progress along that road to peace.
Â Â  â The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the question on which peace in the Middle East hinges.
The Quartet is scheduled to meet on 20Â September in order to relaunch the road map.
How should this be approached?
To my mind, the answer is clear: it should be approached resolutely.
The unilateral pull-out from Gaza has justifiably raised expectations.
There has been a lull on the part of the armed Palestinian groups and legislative elections are set to take place on 25Â January.
This is a positive scenario, but one based on a particular set of circumstances, and the opportunity could go to waste.
Europeâs position must therefore be a firm one.
Some 8Â 000 settlers have left Gaza as a result of a decision by Israel â a most welcome development.
Yet this event must not conceal the other side of the coin; between June 2004 and 2005, 12Â 800 new settlers moved to the West Bank and the President of Parliament in Jerusalem wants to set up another Jewish settlement in the ancient heart of the Arab city.
This is not the way to go about making peace!
The settlers have left Gaza.
This is terrific news, but the Gaza that has been handed over to the Palestinians urgently requires an airport and the Israeli authorities have an unacceptable veto over this project.
Gaza has a border with Egypt at Rafa.
Palestinians and Egyptians could run this border, but Israel insists on maintaining a presence in the area, as though it were another of its checkpoints.
This must not be allowed to happen, because Gaza must not be a poisoned chalice, a prison that the guards have handed over to the inmates, in which they are not allowed to move around and in which their already fragile economy is rendered unworkable.
The exit from Gaza is not the end of the story.
This is the message that should guide the fresh initiatives by the Quartet.
Peace is possible provided we do not waste this opportunity.
Â Â  â Mr President, allow me to start by quoting from the Iranian media: 'Thanks to negotiations with Europe we gained another year in which the Natanz project reached a stage where a small number of centrifuges could operate.
The UCF in Isfahan is complete and UF4 and UF6 gases are produced.
We converted 36 tonnes of yellow cake into gas.
Iran began talks with the WTO. Iran was recognised as one of the countries with a nuclear fuel cycle.
We managed to make far greater progress than North Korea'.
That was said on Iranian Channel 2 on 4Â August by MrÂ Hussein Mussavian, the head of the Iranian nuclear delegation.
There is no military option; there is no regime change option.
Economic sanctions will only create a much larger disaster than the one in Iraq.
What can we do after Russia's expected refusal of referral to the UNSC?
We can only try to strip Iran of international recognition, immediately block its WTO entry, impose tough diplomatic sanctions, exclude it from international sporting, cultural and social events and the Olympic Games.
Those are the only tools we have.
As the head of Parliament's Israeli delegation, I wholeheartedly congratulate both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments.
I also welcome the EU statement on this engagement.
We promise to monitor daily the use of the EURÂ 60Â million hopefully spent before the Palestinian elections.
We all support the conditional Syrian association agreement as the last wedge to keep the door open.
Egypt is the cradle of Middle Eastern politics.
Clear, tough and immediate pressure for democratic conditions for democratic candidates in democratic elections will be more use than any Iraq-style military intervention.
Nevertheless, legitimisation of the current process in Iraq is a must if civil war is to be prevented.
Twelve months from now, the Middle East will be a different region.
The threats to our security are enormous.
We have to stop immediately making a distinction between external relations and our internal security, between cutting out the roots of extremism and counter-terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, as we witness the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, completed in one-third of the time planned, with no casualties and with no wave of terror as predicted by some, I reflect on what the critics said when that disengagement was first announced.
Then they protested.
Today, with all the qualifications, they celebrated.
Despite all the difficulties, hope succeeded over cynicism.
In the wake of these developments, it is the role of the European Union and international community to keep open this moment of hope.
I welcome the continuing Commission commitment, repeated this afternoon by our colleague Mr Verheugen, to economic reconstruction in the Palestinian territories.
Gaza represents one of the most scarred and desolate corners of the world.
The World Bank says that nearly half of the Palestinians there live below the poverty line.
Freedom from fear must be matched by the freedom to eat and to work.
That is why I welcome the President-in-Office's commitment this afternoon to work with Israel and the other parties on free movement, to facilitate the movement of 20Â 000 Gaza residents who work in Israel and to lift the blockages of borders of land, sea and air. Gaza cannot be economically viable otherwise.
As a member of Parliament's Electoral Observer Commission, I agree with colleagues that we have a crucial role to play to ensure that the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London conference on security, democratic reform and good governance are realised.
However, the critics will continue to remind us that more new settlements have been built this year on the West Bank than were evacuated in the last month, that 8Â 000 settlers are left but more than 240Â 000 still remain.
The differences on the 1967 borders and on the status of Jerusalem are as deeply entrenched today as is that much-disputed security wall.
We cannot avoid these uncomfortable truths.
The only hope remains the roadmap, endorsed by the Quartet, by this European Union.
It is our responsibility to keep that hope and opportunity alive.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the success of the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and from the four isolated settlements in the northern West Bank and welcome Mr Sharon's public assurances that these moves form the first stages of the United States-led roadmap to a two-state solution.
The withdrawal has also been welcomed by the Muslim world as a first phase of a process.
The significance of this development was displayed last week by the first public talks between the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Pakistan.
The European Council, under the Presidency of the United Kingdom, must maximise its special relationship with the US to make joint efforts to add to the existing ties with other Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, to name but a few.
Such political progress will have tremendous significance, not just as regards relations between these two states, but as a stepping stone towards a normalisation of relations between Israel and the whole of the Muslim and Arab world.
Indeed, it will help in our very own action plan to face head-on the issue of terrorism within our own borders.
However, worrying messages continue to come out of Israel.
As recently as July, for example, the Knesset approved Amendment 5 to the Civil Wrongs Law.
The amendment prohibits Palestinians from suing for damages for injuries sustained as a result of illegal Israeli gunfire; this is in clear violation of basic human rights.
This week, there is a rare opportunity to begin rectifying these injustices.
All this exacerbates Israel's persistent defiance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July, which heavily criticised the illegal separation wall in Eastern Jerusalem.
Incidentally, mention of the wall was noticeable by its absence from the UK Presidency's .
May I remind the Council that the ICJ's opinion articulates obligations incumbent on the whole of the international community to see that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.
Peace cannot be achieved without justice and it is justice for the individual â the men, women and children living this conflict on a daily basis â which is the key to lasting peace.
It is these individuals' right to self-determination which must be secured.
The EU, as Israel's principal trading partner, is in a unique position to utilise the human rights clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement and bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government to comply, specifically with the ICJ opinion, and more generally to ensure that disengagement is followed by credible political process where outstanding claims for justice under international humanitarian law are resolved.
In conclusion, if the European Council, under the leadership of the UK Presidency, is to play a significant and constructive role in the peace process, it must ensure that concerns of economic and political expediency are not permitted to override the fundamental rights of a people that has suffered enough.
Â Â  Mr President, it is now becoming clear to both sides that the use of force will not achieve victory: the Israelis cannot achieve their desired security, the Palestinians cannot achieve their independent state.
The only process ahead is the political process.
Political process and armed struggle cannot coexist: it is either one or the other.
Both sides are now arriving at this conclusion, as demonstrated from the Palestinian side, with the democratic election of President Abbas, the mandate that he has received to negotiate peace and the fact that even Hamas is now slowly entering the democratic process; and from the Israeli side, with the Gaza disengagement, despite formidable opposition and the traumatic experience of the Israelis.
Now is the time to consolidate these positive developments.
The Council and the Commission â either through the Quartet or on their own â must discourage, firstly, those Palestinians who may consider that the Gaza disengagement is a result of their Intifada; secondly, those in Israel who may consider that this licenses them to proceed with further settlements or the continuation of the wall and, finally, encourage both sides, so that they avoid actions that strengthen the hands of those on the other side who oppose the peace process.
Elections will be held in the months ahead in either Palestine or Israel, which is likely to create a sort of vacuum.
Good management of this vacuum is required so that the momentum for peace is kept alive.
Â Â  Mr President, the withdrawal from Gaza was without doubt an historic course of action and will remain of historic significance.
It will have no lasting effect, though, if we do not endeavour â together with the Palestinians and with Israeli support â to make Gaza a viable region, and if we fail, at the same time, to persuade the Israelis that more needs to be done in the West Bank as well.
There will not be as many withdrawals as we in this House â and, above all, the Palestinians â would probably like to see, but, as Mr Kasoulides said, this process must continue if it is not to collapse and deny us many of the positive outcomes for which we hope.
Secondly, I would like to join Mr McMillan-Scott and others in highlighting the importance of our investing in the whole region, especially in the development of democracy and civil society.
One aspect of the war on terrorism, about which we have had a debate today with Mr Clarke is the need for development in the surrounding region, in particular in the Islamic and Arab world, and for that the right political and financial measures will be needed.
That is something of which I would like to remind the Presidency: financial resources will, of course, be needed if we are to invest in Gaza and in the region as a whole.
Making promises and committing oneself to this is one thing, but thought also has to be given to this when planning budgets.
Finally, I will turn to Iran.
We are deeply concerned about the way things are going in Iran, but they are a consequence of our toleration of the development of nuclear weapons not only by such countries as Pakistan and India, but also by Israel, and also of our inability to limit their general proliferation.
Although action on our part is necessary, it has to be taken in consultation with all interested parties if it is to be effective.
It is because unilateral sanctions will not be effective that this matter must be handed over to the United Nations in order for a common solution to be found.
I hope that the British Presidency of the Council will go down that road with perceptiveness and clarity of vision.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is not the small Israeli democracy that is the major threat to peace in the Middle East, but the big dictatorships.
We now see a development that offers hope, consisting of withdrawals from Gaza, together with small signs of democracy in the Arab world.
This means that the demands for a European Middle East policy must become much clearer.
Iran is a country with the express political objective of obliterating one of the UNâs Member States, namely Israel.
Iran is breaching the Non-Proliferation Agreement by developing mid-range missiles with a view to reaching targets in those countries we are now talking about.
It expresses the same anti-Semitism expressed by too many regimes and groups in that part of the world.
It cannot be acceptable to support terrorism, as Iran does.
If the European Union wishes to be a power in the peace process, it must now support the active forces of democracy and peace.
The EU must take action against those who do not accept international agreements and who consciously choose the path of violence.
We must create both support and a structure for democratic development throughout the Middle East.
There would be no better basis for peaceful and stable development in this part of the world than a breakthrough for democracy.
We see the many different signs of democratic development.
The EU must, then, vigorously support those who keep the flame of democracy and freedom alight.
We must also ensure that the support we give the Palestinian Authority and other countries is combined with clear demands for democratic development.
We have an opportunity to play a role in the interests of peace but, in that case, we must also show that we can strengthen democracy.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the departure of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and from the four settlements on the West Bank represents a fresh chance for peace in the Middle East and for the conclusion of an agreement between Israel and Palestine.
It also represents a fresh chance to achieve security for the state of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state.
Ariel Sharonâs government should be given due recognition for its decision, as should the majority of the Israeli people for the backing they have lent to the evacuation of the Jewish settlements.
I should like to take this opportunity to make particular mention of the Israeli peopleâs support for this process.
Even though the Israelis are descendants of refugees, they backed the evacuation of 9Â 000Â settlers from Gaza.
This is proof of their desire for genuine peace with the Palestinian nation, and of the democratic nature of the Israeli state in the Middle East.
The reaction of the majority of Israelis is also proof that the country is a worthy partner for the European Union in the construction of an international order based on respect for human rights and democracy.
The fact that Israeli public opinion is in favour of the evacuation, and clearly opposed to anti-Arab attacks, can be taken as evidence that the modern world is not condemned to a clash of civilisations or to the victory of fundamentalist philosophies.
The European Union should continue to support the steps taken by James Wolfensohn, the envoy of the Madrid Quartet, to coordinate EU funds with those donated by other sponsors, and to ensure that these funds are used as efficiently as possible.
According to Javier Solana, the European Union could act as the third party in the field of border control and customs checks.
The Gaza Strip must not descend into terror and anarchy, or turn into a new terrorist bridgehead.
Europe must do everything in its power to ensure that the evacuation of the Jewish settlements in Gaza results in negotiations.
The latter should at the very least tackle such problems as the continued withdrawal of Israeli troops, the demarcation of the border and the status of Jerusalem, and they should make it possible to implement the two-state solution.
Â Â  Mr President, the Middle East, as ever, remains of great concern. But there are also some grounds for optimism, as we witness the first multi-candidate presidential election in Egypt today.
The ongoing terrorist campaign in Iraq, of course, still poses a serious threat to stability in the region.
Iraq is about to have its first democratic constitution, which, although lacking support from the Sunni community, as least has on board the Shias and the Kurds, has avoided an Islamic theocracy, and kept women involved in the process.
October may see a rejection of the constitution by the Sunnis, but they will then have to get involved in the resulting parliamentary elections and the next constitutional draft, or face a fragmentation of Iraq, in which they will eventually lose out.
Syria must play a more responsible role in apprehending terrorists crossing from its territory into Iraq.
Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs.
Having ended its nine-month freeze on uranium enrichment, it is now on a collision path with the United States and the EU, a case likely to end in the United Nations Security Council, where I hope Russia and China will also support tough, non-proliferation measures or sanctions, if need be.
Israel is to be commended for its peaceful withdrawal from Gaza, which must now rapidly fall under the control of the Palestinian Authority, although the assassination of Moussa Arafat augurs badly.
It is understandable that border controls with Egypt will require Israeli and international monitoring for security reasons for some time to come.
Let us now hope that all the parties can come together to get the roadmap for peace back on the road.
The Palestinian parliamentary elections in January will, of course, be telling.
Lebanon, following Syria's withdrawal, seems to be settling after its elections and arrests have now been made in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, apparently confirming the suspicion of the involvement of the pro-Syrian security forces.
We all wish the United Nations investigator, Mr Detlev Mehlis, every success in bringing those guilty to justice.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to take my turn to thank Minister Douglas Alexander and Commissioner Verheugen for their speeches.
However, I should like to ask them to read the interviews by the Israeli Prime Minister Arial Sharon in the Jerusalem Post, the and the on 22Â April 2004, in which the real objectives of the unilateral disengagement of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip are presented.
Mr Sharon speaks in these interviews about addressing the risk of demographic change in Israel and about addressing the security problems of the Israeli occupying forces.
Mr Sharon points out that we have merely rid ourselves of problematic settlements while, on the other hand, both the illegal settlements and the construction of the illegal security wall are continuing, in violation of the resolutions of the International Court at The Hague.
From this point of view, I believe that the declaration by the British Presidency on 25 August is excessively optimistic, as is the declaration by Mr Solana.
I fear that these declarations do not reflect the harsh reality.
I believe that the departure of the settlers, in order to be a positive step and a window of opportunity, must be integrated into the framework of the implementation of the roadmap, without any new terms or conditions from the Israeli side.
Mr Alexander referred to serious problems in the Gaza Strip.
I would highlight the need to open the airport, to open the port, to reverse the social and economic isolation of Gaza.
The people there are wretched.
There is a high rate of unemployment and poverty.
We, as the European Union, bear a huge responsibility and I believe that we also need to exert pressure within the framework of the Quartet in the direction of the United States for an international peace conference with the participation of Sharon and Abbas.
Â Â  . Mr President, you have just told one of the honourable Members of this House that you are terribly sorry, but it is time to stop.
I fear that you may soon be terribly sorry because it is time for me to start the wind-up to this debate.
Firstly, it has been an important and timely debate for Parliament this afternoon.
I am genuinely grateful for the insights that have been garnered in our debate that reflect the experience and expertise of Members of this House.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra began by echoing the points made by Commissioner Verheugen, recognising the hopeful signs that have emerged over recent months within the region.
I can assure him that the Presidency is very aware of the key role that the European Union can play as part of the Quartet in advancing the peace process.
Let me, however, at this stage reiterate a point that was made by the Commissioner in his introductory remarks in paying tribute not to a European, but to an American, James Wolfensohn, who has already made a tremendous contribution to the work of the Quartet and indeed to the successful withdrawal from Gaza that we have seen in recent days.
Mrs Napoletano, in stating her abhorrence of terrorism, echoed sentiments that I am sure are felt by all of us in this House.
That is why we recognise the importance of building on the momentum that has been established in the region in recent months and why I believe that there is a shared determination between the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to take forward that momentum in the weeks and months ahead.
Ms MalmstrÃ¶m recognised the importance of human rights in Iran.
Let me assure her that we are aware that serious violations of human rights continue to occur within that country.
The Council is especially concerned about the number of executions of juvenile offenders in recent weeks.
The European Council is clear that our relations with Iran can only move forward if Iran takes action to address our political concerns in areas such as human rights, which she highlighted in her speech.
Mr Hammerstein Mintz talked of Gaza representing 'a light of hope'.
Let us all hope that that is what it proves to be.
Our challenge now, as I have always made clear, is to continue to advance the peace process.
Disengagement offers the prospect of Israel withdrawing settlements from Gaza and part of the West Bank for the first time in history.
This is a real opportunity for progress.
However, on the specific point made by the honourable Member about Jerusalem, the European Union has continually made its view clear on settlement activity, not just in the West Bank, but also in East Jerusalem.
We have made clear to the Government of Israel that all settlement activity should be frozen.
Mr Adamou described withdrawal as a significant step, but recognised the equally significant challenges ahead.
I would simply reiterate that the long-term objective for the European Commission is assistance to support the creation, as was suggested, of an independent democratic Palestinian state.
That continues to be one of our key objectives.
Mr Belder quoted the High Representative, Javier Solana, when he spoke of his concerns regarding the activities of Hamas and Hezbollah.
I can assure you that the European Union keeps the status of Hamas and Hezbollah under constant review and the European Union stands firm in its policy of not dealing with terrorists.
Hamas is subject to a European Union asset freeze and European Union officials will not meet members of the Hamas leadership until it recognises Israel's right to exist.
Mr MÃ¶lzer spoke on various points with which I find myself frankly not in agreement, both as regards some of the issues that he focused on and his characterisation of some of the other issues.
Where we were able to find common ground was on the possibility of the European Union making the advancement of the Middle East peace process one of its objectives in an area where we can make a positive contribution.
At least on that there was agreement between us.
Mr McMillan-Scott spoke of both the Egyptian elections â as did Mr Tannock â and also of the words of the Secretary of State of the United States, Condoleezza Rice, at a recent speech at the American University in Cairo.
I noted with interest the points he made regarding democracy and human rights, later echoed by MrÂ HÃ¶kmark.
Mrs De Keyser raised the issue of the Israeli barrier.
The best response I can offer on behalf of the Presidency is to quote directly to her the clear view of the June European Council on this matter: 'The European Council, while recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens from attacks, remains concerned by the continuing construction of the separation barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is contrary to the provisions of international law.'
Mrs Ries spoke of the need to turn the military withdrawal we have seen in recent days into a political success, expressing sentiments reiterated by Mr Portas.
Of course, that is true.
I agree that after disengagement, it will be important to ensure that momentum is maintained and that both Israel and the Palestinians focus on implementation of the roadmap.
It will also be important for the Palestinian Authority to ensure that law and order is maintained in Gaza.
Conditions on access and on trade must allow economic growth and stability for the Gaza economy, a point made by a number of honourable Members, but equally allow for Israel to have security from militant or terrorist attacks, which is its right.
Mrs HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡ raised the issue of Iran and in particular the issue of diplomatic sanctions being applied.
It is important to remind this House that the IAEA board meets on 19 September.
The European Union has said that it will support calls for Iran to be reported to the United Nations Security Council at that meeting, but we are discussing the next step with our international partners.
It is therefore important to await the discussions that will take place first at the IAEA board meeting on 19 September and I would not wish to anticipate those discussions at this time.
One of my colleagues from the United Kingdom, MrÂ Howitt, brought his experience as an electoral observer to his contribution to our debate this afternoon.
He spoke powerfully, I would argue, about what he described, somewhat tactfully, as the uncomfortable truths that endure, even after the recent withdrawal.
He is right to acknowledge the scale of the challenge faced by the region, as well as the scale of the achievement that has been accomplished.
He recognised, rightly again, the contribution that we have to make and the responsibility that we bear as a member of the Quartet to make further progress and to sustain hope and banish cynicism, which has been too common in the past.
Mr Karim raised the issue of the barrier, and I would simply reiterate the point I made in relation to the stated position of the European Council as recently as June.
I would remind the honourable Member that Article 2 of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement states that: 'Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.'
I can assure the honourable Member that where we have concerns about Israeli actions on human rights, we will raise â and have raised â those concerns with the Israeli Government.
The European Union also uses the opportunity to raise issues of concern, including human rights, at the EU-Israel Association Council.
We will consider in due course what issues to raise in advance of the EU-Israel Association Council scheduled to be held at the end of our Presidency at the end of this year.
I listened carefully to Mr Kasoulides and I assure him that we will share the objective of maintaining the momentum for peace in the months ahead.
Mr Swoboda spoke of the need for a coordinated approach to address the issue of proliferation.
Although I speak today on behalf of the Presidency rather than the British Government, I would simply point out at this stage, as a serving minister in the British Foreign Office, that to date the E3 process has been a powerful affirmation of that approach, whereby a coordinated approach has been secured across Europe, which has strengthened our hand in the important and difficult discussions that have had to take place directly with Iran in recent months.
Mr Pinior paid tribute to Israel's step in withdrawing from Gaza and I once again echo that sentiment on behalf of the Presidency.
As well as discussing the issue of Egypt â of which I have already spoken â Mr Tannock raised the issue of the Constitution for Iraq.
This is an achievement.
Indeed, in the official briefing I received in preparation for today's debate, it was suggested that I should tell this august body that constitutions are never the easiest things to write.
I need hardly make that point to the European Parliament in light of recent events.
But, to be entirely serious, it is important to recognise how challenging the achievement of a constitution has been in Iraq, against a backdrop of nearly 30 years of tyranny and in the face of ongoing terrorist attacks on innocent people designed specifically to prevent them reaching agreement.
In a country as diverse as Iraq, surely that is all the more so the case.
It is important, therefore, that we remember those points, but also that this is an Iraqi Constitution, written by democratically elected Iraqi politicians on behalf of their people.
It works to balance that country's distinctive traditions â which, frankly, are very different from our own within Europe â with its desire for democracy.
It is a huge step forward for Iraq and one that should be welcomed.
On behalf of the Presidency, let me thank all those honourable Members who have participated today, pay tribute to the contribution of the Commission earlier in the debate and express my gratitude for the points raised in what I believe will continue to be an important subject and focus of our work in the remaining months of our Presidency.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â In this debate on the Middle East situation, we must not overlook the fact that the territory returned to the Palestinian people belongs to them by right and that they have long been fighting for it.
We must also try to clarify the real reasons that led Sharon to dismantle the Gaza settlements, when we know that he was chiefly responsible for devising and implementing the policy of the expansion and consolidation of the Israeli occupation, including the settlements and the wall that seeks to annex further territories on the West Bank.
The first thing to note is that the policy of settling the Gaza Strip was a failure, given the small size of the territory and the massive population density â around 1.3Â million people lived in an area measuring just 362Â km2.
This means that the 8Â 000 Israeli settlers living there (0.6% of the population) occupied 20% of the territory, thereby creating unsustainable demographic tension and pressure, leading to devastating consequences.
Secondly, Sharon did this, yet continues to maintain the isolation of Gaza, which will remain surrounded â by land, sea and air â by the Israeli army.
This will keep it as an enclave within Israel and land links with the West Bank will remain subject to Israeli control.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0235/2005) by MrÂ QueirÃ³, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on new prospects and new challenges for sustainable European tourism [2004/2229(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, during times of economic difficulty we all have a responsibility to seek solutions, and to find ways of promoting progress and development.
This is the background to our report on the future of sustainable tourism in Europe.
When we talk about tourism in the EU, we are talking about one of our largest and most competitive industries, one that generates the highest number of jobs and that has the biggest growth potential, even in the context of a Europe suffering from economic slowdown.
The bottom line, however, is that this is an activity that needs to ensure its sustainability in such a way that it does not destroy, among other things, its environmental resources, its landscape resources and its regional planning.
We must seek to address one of the biggest difficulties facing the tourist industry in terms of economic efficiency: how can we combat the effects of seasonal variations on jobs and on the quality of services provided?
Our report puts forward guidelines and proposals for solving these problems.
This is a broad overview of an economic sector with massive potential, from which we must try to derive maximum benefit, by promoting synergies, developing cooperation and enjoying the benefits of shared experience.
At the same time, it should be understood that tourism is first and foremost a sector in which private initiative prevails and in which, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, policies come mainly from the Member Statesâ authorities.
This does not affect the Commissionâs role of improving the consistency of its tourism-related measures with the Community policies that feed into it, such as transport, jobs, the environment and the internal market.
From the point of view of the Lisbon Strategy, tourism is increasingly linked to new technology.
It has turned the Internet into much more than merely an outlet for the sale of holidays â rather, it has become a key tool for use in the tourism sector.
In this context, we must decide how the Community institutions can support the measures taken by the Member States and the industry aimed at developing tourism.
The way to do this, to my mind, is to take practical steps that can help to improve these measures at European level and can enable us to be proactive in promoting the old continentâs tourist destinations.
The most symbolic proposal on the table is, without question, that of creating outstanding European tourist destinations, along the lines of the European Capital of Culture concept.
Also worthy of note is the proposal to set up a Community classification of tourist services, on a voluntary basis and with the industryâs cooperation, to be used in particular for the classification of hotel and restaurant facilities.
The purpose of this scheme is to guarantee a more transparent service, and to protect consumers.
Furthermore, we have proposed a registered designation of origin for non-food craft products.
We also support the creation and development of the European Tourism Portal to which all national portals will be linked; after all, we must not overlook the enormous benefits that this tool could bring in terms of publicising European destinations.
In order to meet the need to increase employment, training and skills in the field of tourism, our proposal is to set up a network of specialised training in tourism.
In the area of security, we have proposed that a contact group be set up with a view to coordinating information on how to manage crises, such as health crises and acts of terrorism, so as to ensure a rapid response in the event of European tourists needing protection and to support tourist operators affected by such events.
With regard to improving tourist facilities, we have put forward a range of initiatives to improve access for people with reduced mobility and to ensure that those working in tourist services receive special training for this purpose.
We have stressed the need to implement new tourist activities and infrastructure to cater for the growing demand among the elderly, who, in the coming decades, will account for over 30% of the population of developed countries.
In terms of business competitiveness, we have highlighted the need to maintain the competitive position of operators established in the EU in relation to third country operators for tax purposes, an issue that, I was pleased to note, was resolved this morning with the vote on the Becsey report.
Provision has also been made for applying reduced VAT rates for certain services, along the lines of those in place for other services.
We also endorse the proposal to create a âEuropean Unionâ tourism mark, characterised by the tremendous social and cultural diversity, high quality services and sustainable tourist projects in the EU, to be promoted via a suitable publicity campaign aimed at potential visitors from third countries.
Lastly, in the area of transport, we have advocated the importance of investing in quality, by boosting the capacity and improving the accessibility of the various means of transport, by using integrated ticket offices to simplify ticketing systems and by establishing suitable links with air transport, which is the main form of tourist transport.
Mr President, I should finally like to address the question of Community funding.
Given that tourism is an essential sector for regional and local development, it should be placed at the forefront of the Structural Funds.
This break in the talks on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 could and should present us with an opportunity to reintroduce the issue via the creation of a separate budget heading.
All of this should be done in order to ensure that European regulations are flexible and in line with what is required.
The work of operators will be made easier and they will be able to continue to offer high quality, sustainable services at an accessible price.
In a Europe in which private initiative is at the forefront of growth and development, our role as public decision-makers is to support it and to ensure that it is an integral part of a journey that will hopefully be laden with success.
To conclude, Mr President, I should like to thank all of those people who contributed towards this report with their amendments and their votes in committee, including, of course, Members of the Committee on Regional Development, Culture and Education.
I hope that the debate that is about to get underway will match the quality of their contributions and the efforts that all of them put in.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to warmly thank Mr QueirÃ³, MrÂ Costa and many others in this Chamber.
It is very important that the European Parliament should keep revisiting this issue if it is not to be overshadowed by others in Europe, and that that state of affairs must prevail no longer.
When I speculate as to which sectors of the European economy might, in the years to come, make an outstanding contribution to growth and the creation of jobs, tourism is the first that springs to mind.
It is evident to all of us that this is an enormous market, with potential for growth, and that Europe needs to be able to maintain its leading position in it, but there are plenty of problems to contend with.
We face increasing competition, and foreign tourism is influenced by more and more factors, ranging from the environment to transport problems, not forgetting issues of home security.
What is called for, then, is an integrated policy of reviewing all the responsibilities and competences that we have in terms of how we can use the options available to us in such a way as to create the ideal conditions for tourism to flourish in Europe.
As I have said on several occasions, this is a topic to which I attach an extraordinarily high degree of importance.
Even though tourism is a field in which the Commissionâs powers are not great, I do believe that there is much that we can do as part of the European Unionâs growth and employment policy â that is to say, as part of the Lisbon Strategy â to support Europeâs tourist areas in their efforts.
I would also like to point out that the character of tourism will change considerably over the coming decades, particularly in view of population changes in Europe.
It will have to take far greater account of senior citizensâ mobility needs, pay a great deal more attention to public safety issues and be far more aware of the need to protect our cultural and natural heritage than it has been in the past.
Tourism, in Europe, is not one sector among many; it has become a factor of peopleâs quality of life, and we have to take that seriously.
The Commission is very definitely willing to cooperate with your House in every conceivable way in order to bring about the right sort of change in European tourism.
I would like, then, to conclude by saying something that may appear rather surprising.
Europe is the worldâs leading tourist region; it is the most attractive tourist destination not only for its own tourists, but also for those from other parts of the world.
That is capital with which we can work, and the Commission is ready and willing to do so.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate MrÂ QueirÃ³ on the excellent work he has done.
I am pleased to observe that his report contains the greater part of the recommendations I had addressed to him as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
I do not wish to go back over the difficulties encountered by the tourism sector in Europe and the challenges it has to face, since that has been thoroughly debated in committee, and MrÂ QueirÃ³ presents an altogether clear overview of this issue.
Furthermore, I believe that we have all understood the role that tourism can play in terms of growth, job creation and sustainable development.
I would like to look to the future by emphasising three points, which I do not believe can be ignored.
First, it seems crucial to me that the Commission and the Council should revive the work on the proposal for a directive concerning reduced rates of VAT by also enabling all the Member States to opt for a reduced rate of VAT for costs pertaining to the hotel and catering industries.
The wide variety of situations within the European Union itself is leading to unfair competition, and that is no longer acceptable.
Secondly, I believe that it is altogether desirable to encourage the development of new types of sustainable tourism such as agritourism, rambling, bicycle touring, horse riding and so on and to remove the obstacles encountered by certain sections of the community that wish to travel but that experience difficulties in doing so owing to the absence of infrastructures and amenities. MrÂ QueirÃ³ and MrÂ Verheugen have spoken about this.
I am referring in particular to elderly people and people with disabilities.
Finally, my third point is that particular attention must be paid to regions suffering from natural and structural disadvantages: I am referring to the outermost regions and the island regions.
With regard to these regions, we must implement an across-the-board policy, designed to encourage and promote these destinations, the greater part of whose economic activity consists of tourism, and thus encourage the development of an essential transport network servicing these isolated regions.
The Commission could also provide for greater coherence between actions carried out to promote tourism and other related Community policies.
I would like to conclude by pointing out that tourism still has no legal basis whatsoever in Community legislation, which is a state of affairs that I deplore.
Let us hope that the progress contained in the draft Constitution will be resumed very soon indeed.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Parliamentâs motion for a resolution on new prospects and new challenges for sustainable European tourism aroused a great deal of interest among the members of the Committee on Culture and Education.
This was reflected in the opinion the Committee submitted to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which highlighted a number of issues in particular.
These included the need to focus on the various aspects of sustainable tourism, including economic, cultural, nature-related and social aspects, and the need to acknowledge the importance of seasonal tourism.
The opinion stressed that the development of tourism should go hand in hand with the protection of national, regional and local culture and with the protection of the natural environment, parks, landscapes, urban structures and architectural sites and buildings.
It underlined the importance of tourism for economic development, job creation and the maintenance of individual physical and mental health, as well as stressing the need for the proper management of tourist resources.
It supported the development of agrotourism, particularly in the new Member States, and the education of younger generations in the fields of nature, culture, science and active leisure.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the majority of these proposals and incorporated them into the final version of the motion for a resolution.
The end result is a fascinating document that gives due consideration to timeless values such as culture, nature and manâs natural environment, while prioritising organisational and economic issues.
At the same time, however, the motion for a resolution either makes no reference or fails to give due weight to issues such as special-interest tourism, the protection of historic towns and architectural sites and buildings and the International Cultural Tourism Charter.
It will be necessary to devote more attention to such issues during future work on the sustainable development of tourism.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start with the warmest of thanks to MrÂ QueirÃ³ for his report, and for his enthusiasm and commitment to foreign tourism, to which it testifies.
Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly pointed out that the rapporteur was right to describe tourism as something that can create jobs, for which it has enormous potential, but I would ask him to admit that tourism is a field that the Commission has neglected up to now.
It is for that reason that I hope that he has read the reportâs demands and will later tell us which of them he endorses.
Let me list five things that are called for: the first is an international advertising campaign to attract more tourists from third states to Europe, one that would have to form part of a support package for tourism and be mounted in consultation with the tourist industry.
The EUâs embassies overseas can help with this.
Secondly, in order for consumers to be better protected and informed, there is a need for the classification of hotel and restaurant standards to be standardised across the EU.
Thirdly, I believe there to be a need for the uniform application of VAT at the reduced rate to restaurant services in all the Member States; this is not something that should be done in different ways in different places.
Fourthly, national holidays need to be synchronised in order to avoid traffic jams on motorways and overloading of holiday destinations.
There needs â and this is my fifth point â to be better coordination of emergency plans between state and private organisations at both the national and European levels, to give tourist protection in the event of natural disasters and against health risks.
Those are just five points that I have picked out of MrÂ QueirÃ³âs wide-ranging report.
Fine words butter no parsnips, as they say; it is no use saying that we will promote tourism and that the Commission is right behind the idea if nothing ends up happening, so, Commissioner, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us something about all the initiatives by the Commission that you intend to support.
It is you who have the powers, the Commission that can work within the framework of the industrial policy, it is you who can work within the framework of regional policy, and there are many powers and responsibilities that you can combine for the benefit of tourism, so, Commissioner, I ask you to do something about it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the rapporteur very much for the excellent cooperation that has been established and the good work that has been done.
Commissioner, my request is the same as the one that MrÂ Jarzembowski addressed to you just now.
This own-initiative report has brought to the attention of Parliament and the European institutions the importance of a sector of the economy that is extremely significant, as you yourself have acknowledged, in terms of employment and production of the gross domestic product.
It is also now in a position to grow in the wake of enlargement, and it can provide further jobs.
Questions need to be answered, however, about implementation methods, the legislation to be used, funding, and the commitment of all the European institutions.
The report states, and I agree with it, that, in addition to what the private sector and the Member States must do, Community intervention must involve promoting integrated and hence sustainable socioeconomic and environmental policies.
That is the key point, Commissioner, which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to highlight.
Europe must also promote innovation through novel measures.
In fact, tourism, which has until now been funded indirectly and in various ways by the European Union, has all too often remained merely a way of consuming land.
Faced with worldwide competition from other holiday destinations at prices that are now competitive, it is no longer enough to use sporadic European funding to alleviate the adverse effects of inept policies and land consumption.
It is not enough to protect the environment: we have to make a quantum leap and promote a different model of sustainable use that aims at quality.
Creating a suitable environment for businesses, which falls within Europeâs remit, as also defined in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, is a goal that should be pursued by encouraging the tourist industry to evolve towards making integral use of the country, as a driving force for local development.
Tourism also requires the strengthening of the internal market, the gradual establishment of equality of treatment among operators, a Community-wide classification of facilities, and harmonised roles and professional profiles.
We should aim at creating a âdestination Europeâ that provides added value, promotes the richness of our cultural diversity and helps us to develop a European brand.
The European portal may be the first â and necessary â measure.
It is both right and important to finance pilot projects that can become models of good practice, but that requires the identification of a relevant budget line as well as a stronger, more explicit political will.
Mobility and passenger safety are a necessary condition if our goals of growth, cohesion and convergence are to be met through the tourist industry as well.
That is why we Socialists have tabled a few amendments that make this need more explicit, and I hope this House will adopt them.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of telling you my life story, but as an example of what we are debating here today, I will tell you that during the last decade, that is to say, during the nineties, I administered a metropolitan city of one million inhabitants which was experiencing a great depression and undergoing industrial restructuring.
As Mayor and President of the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bilbao, I placed a lot of faith in the theories of a respected professor of marketing, Philip Kotler.
He is the author of several publications, of which my favourite is entitled .
In it, Kotler says that a country, region or city that wants to offer its citizens opportunities for progress and well-being must pursue three equally important great objectives, namely to sell the goods it produces to the outside, to attract investments and to attract tourism.
Tourism is understood to mean not just leisure tourism, but also business, educational, scientific, sporting, and cultural tourism, for example.
Today, my city has famously increased its income as a result of the considerable increase in tourism resulting from its urban transformation.
Bilbao has become a centre for services, trade, business and culture within its industrial hinterland.
There is no need to remind you of the important contribution of tourism, which provides 4% of the European Unionâs GDP, nor of the seven million direct jobs generated by more than two million companies, the vast majority of which are small or medium-sized businesses.
I would therefore like to say to you that I openly reiterate my support for the proposal to create an adequate budget line within the Unionâs budget to support the tourism sector, as well as the other requests or amendments introduced into the original text by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I have in mind the reduced rate of VAT for restaurants, improving the professional training of workers, the introduction of a European classification of tourist services and strengthening the rights of tourists and their protection as consumers.
But there is one aspect included in the wonderful report by Mr Luis QueirÃ³ that I would like to stress.
I am referring to transport as a necessary support to guarantee the mobility and the journeys of the millions of citizens who make up the base of tourism.
In particular I would like to draw attention to the trans-European road transport networks.
Every summer or holiday period these become jammed with kilometres of tail-backs of thousands of lorries and cars that have to stop repeatedly because of the excessive number of motorway toll points along a particular route.
We frequently experience one example of this inefficiency at the Viriatu pass between Spain and France, where there are five toll stations within a stretch of 50 kilometres.
Â Â  . Mr President, scarcely any other sector of the economy is as complex as tourism.
I now want to concentrate on just one aspect of it, namely sustainability â to which the title of this report refers â and particularly to the dependence of successful and long-term foreign tourism on sustainable transport.
No other sector of the economy is as dependent on the environment as tourism.
Beautiful landscapes, well-kept villages, clean air, peace and quiet, good and healthy food, among other things, are the tourist industryâs real capital.
Tourism and transport are closely connected, but, in many tourist areas, the means of transport are so inappropriate that we are slowly but surely wrecking the foundation of a sustainable economy.
For example, the perversity of the way in which mass tourism has developed is apparent in many places from the gridlock that occurs on Saturdays in high season as tourists all arrive and depart at the same time.
This report endorses the idea of further development of air travel, which is the worst form of transport from the point of view of energy consumption and damage to the climate.
The second worst is the use of private motor vehicles.
Railways, once much-loved, which played a substantial part in the first flourishing of tourism in the Alps some 100 years ago, are now generally forgotten, neglected and put at a disadvantage.
If you are a tourist and want to go on holiday using public transport, it is an unfortunate fact that you will often find that, in many of the regions you want to visit, it is quite impossible to be properly mobile without a motor car.
The main causes of this are the inadequacy of the public local transport on offer and the failure of many railway operators to make sufficient information and booking facilities available.
If we really do want to promote sustainable tourism the length and breadth of Europe, we should give far greater prominence to these ecological considerations.
Â Â  . â Mr President, an effort is being made to use an insipid wish-list about the development of tourism and environmental protection in order to bring tourism more into line with the anti-working class Lisbon Strategy.
In a bid to increase profitability, the concentration of capital is being promoted through capitalist restructurings, public private partnerships, the selling off of the nation's wealth to tourist business groups and the exploitation by private capital of cultural and architectural heritage everywhere.
Worse conditions are also being created for the workers in the tourism sector, which already has more than its share of problems due to seasonality and the unaccountability which prevails with the introduction of even more flexible forms of work.
Nor could a policy which directly concerns the workers be devoid of an effort to make use of it to shape a European conscience predicated on the anti-communism which tourism is also expected to embody.
The anti-working class policy of the European Union and of the governments in the Member States deprives workers and the workingâclass from taking holidays.
This social need urgently needs to be satisfied and the workers will fight to achieve this.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr QueirÃ³, on compiling this comprehensive and detailed report, which I welcome.
I believe that the development of European tourism is inextricably linked to the development of transport and infrastructure across the EU.
As many of my colleagues have mentioned, tourism is a very important industry.
Affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure.
Air travel in particular has become cheaper and more convenient for everyone.
However, small regional airports are finding it more difficult to compete with larger international airports and as a result there has been an imbalance in the regional development of tourism.
This needs to be addressed.
This imbalance is very clear in my own country, Ireland, and I would like to dwell on that for a minute, if I may.
As an island, we are very dependent on air travel for both tourism and business and, as one of the most open economies in Europe, we have, over the past decade, reaped the benefits of liberalisation of EU regulations regarding air services.
The low-cost model of air travel has been a huge success.
More and more flights and lower air fares have improved Ireland's attractiveness as a holiday destination and Irish tourism is performing very well.
In 2005 we saw a 4% growth rate in overseas visitor numbers.
However, this increase in visitor numbers is masking an underlying trend, a striking regional imbalance.
Figures show that visitor growth is concentrated mainly on the east coast of Ireland around the capital, Dublin.
The north-west, the west and the Shannon regions are displaying the weakest growth.
These regions have very major tourist potential, but they suffer because of lack of comparable access.
The west, and north-west in particular, have long been at a distinct disadvantage, due to the limited number of flights and destinations available from the regional airports.
Aer Lingus, the national carrier, does not serve any European destination except the UK from regional airports.
Not only does this cause problems for commuters and tourists in reaching the west and north-west, it also makes it very difficult to access those regions.
I would like any policy on tourism to try and address this question, because balanced regional development has been a priority in EU policy and I have always believed that this should also be linked to tourism policy.
In that regard, I welcome the recent decision by Commissioner Barrot to introduce new guidelines laying down conditions under which start-up aid can be granted to airlines in regional airports.
Â Â  Mr President, the touristic landscape has undergone massive change over recent years, and Europe has been no exception.
Competitors have bargains to offer, traditional holiday periods and habits are changing, and, not least, new trends are becoming evident.
It follows that our own countries, far from being able to rest upon the laurels they won in the past, must go down roads that are new and innovative for Europe.
Tourism is still, in many places, highly dependent on the general climate and day-to-day weather conditions.
Although many sectors will therefore have suffered from the present continual rain, it may well be that the wellness sector, spas, and urban tourism have benefited from the bad weather.
If Europe is to remain attractive as a holiday destination, there is a need for both high-quality products such as the wellness sector can generally offer, and also more alternatives for the periods of bad weather that are occurring more frequently.
Developing such new schemes as conservation holidays in areas of outstanding natural beauty, all-in deals for cyclists or cultural tourists would certainly be worthwhile.
What matters overall, though, where tourism is concerned, is that it should make good use of Europeâs natural landscapes and their cultural identity while at the same time protecting them.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President, I would like to speak about the cruise liners sector, for which reference was made in the opinion of Margie Sudre on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development.
Mr President, I shall not dwell on the importance of this sector for ports, maritime regions and islands in Europe, I think that the importance of this sector for tourism, employment and for the generation of economic activity is clear enough.
However it seems that this sector is not being recognised enough in the laws that we are enacting.
Indeed, instead of giving it due incentives sometimes we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe.
Let me explain â for example in the sector of taxation such as VAT and Excise, the rules which we have, are difficult to apply to the cruise liners industry and are creating serious difficulties.
I am referring both to the existing regulations as well as for the Commissionâs new proposals regarding changes in the VAT regime.
For example, if you are on a cruise and you are served from the ship restaurant, you pay VAT according to the country from where you left â this means that passengers pay different VAT rates on a cruise, according to the country from which they boarded the ship, and the company which manages the ship has to administer different tax rates according to where the passengers have boarded the ship.
This is just one example, however, it is ironic that there is actually an incentive to avoid these problems.
If the ship makes use of a port of a country which is not a member of the European Union, then the entire voyage becomes automatically duty free, without taxes and without the administrative burden to collect taxes.
Therefore, instead of having incentives making it attractive for the cruise liners industry to stay in European ports, as we should have, we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe.
I have no doubt that this is not the policy of the European Union and this was not the intention of the legislator, however we must admit that these anomalies exist and we must remove them.
Thus my appeal to Commissioner Verheugen is, to address these anomalies, to give more attention to the cruise liner industry and to entice it to keep investing and growing in the countries of the European Union.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his magnificent work, his generosity and his willingness to incorporate everybodyâs opinions.
He also deserves to be commended on his enthusiasm for dealing with an issue such as European tourism, which although it is one of the Unionâs most dynamic and expanding economic sectors, always seems to be the poor relation of European policies.
It is forever crying out for a solid legal basis upon which to strengthen and give a European identity to this sector.
Tourism may appear buoyant today, but as it is growing in the shadow of globalisation, it will be eroded as a result of that very same growth and expansion, unless we take care to provide it with a framework establishing conditions of sustainability and guarantees of security, quality and diversity, as well as a high level of professionalism and the necessary stability of professionals and workers.
Commissioner, we therefore need these framework conditions as soon as possible.
We need an overall policy that helps to make the wealth and special characteristics of the European historical and tourist heritage more visible.
Such a policy must offer an excellent base both for strengthening European identity and cohesion, and for publicising our potential, our European model, outside the Union.
To this end, we have proposed creating a âEuropean Unionâ tourism mark or destination, to be characterised by the enormous diversity, high social quality and sustainability of the tourism it offers.
Furthermore, we believe that it is important to support the growing medical and thermal tourism sector.
It has significant needs and benefits, but requires sufficient provision and a suitable framework.
We also think measures are required to strengthen the personal security of tourists, and protect both European tourists outside of the Union from risks such as prison or kidnapping, and tourists facing risks within the Union.
This could be achieved by means of obligatory assistance insurance, which is called for.
In addition, we are in favour of measures to promote itinerant tourism with caravans and camper vans, as a good example of more sustainable and less over-crowded tourism; and we are in favour of implementing actions to provide access for people with reduced mobility to tourist establishments and services.
Facilities of this nature should be publicised sufficiently, because they often are not.
Finally, I would like once again to urge the European Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen in particular, to explore and study existing and new formulae for dealing with the local and regional imbalances resulting from seasonal concentration in the countries of the south, such as mine.
In that case, approaches or measures such as the moratorium or even ecotaxes, which are normal in the north of Europe, in your own country, on the beaches of the Baltic, could also be applied in the south.
Â Â  Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur Mr QueirÃ³ on an excellent piece of work.
Tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in the European Union.
In Ireland alone, tourism revenue in 2004 amounted to EURÂ 5Â billion and it accounted for 3.9Â % of GNP.
From my own perspective, I am particularly interested in the promotion of sustainable tourism, for a number of reasons.
First of all, tourism is an indigenous industry â it does not rely on inward investment â and it is not a mobile industry in the sense that there is no off-shoring or outsourcing of jobs.
Furthermore, it is a labour-intensive industry and, as such, provides employment for a wide range of people.
Therefore, it is fully deserving of support from the Commission and a budget line should be set up to promote the tourism sector.
Tourism has the capacity to provide employment and generate economic activity in its own region and for its own region.
This is of particular importance in rural areas, where numbers are declining in the traditional activities of agriculture and fishing.
I welcome the comments of the rapporteur emphasising the need to develop farm holidays.
With regard to rural tourism, there is a need to link projects together for the purposes of marketing and promotion in order to create a critical mass, and it is essential to decentralise tourism functions to the regions.
The question of access by air, road and rail to the more rural areas is also vital, as the trend is for shorter holidays.
That means that tourists will not spend two days of a four- or five-day break travelling to and from their destination.
This is of particular importance in my region in the north west of Ireland.
The short tourist season is a real concern, with the need to spread the demand outside the high season and promote tourism products for different tastes, different interests, different seasons and different age groups.
I welcome the proposal to introduce a Community-wide classification of hotel facilities and the promotion at EU level of voluntary standards concerning measures to improve safety aspects in hotels and tourist services in general.
Finally, having met a group of disabled people from Ireland yesterday and today on their Freedom Drive in Strasbourg, I was pleased to note that the rapporteur has invited the Commission to put forward an initiative to make tourism and leisure establishments accessible to people with reduced mobility.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr QueirÃ³ for including the âIron Curtain Trailâ in his report.
The Iron Curtain divided Europe for decades, and the trail will remind future generations of how this continent was divided and of how that division was brought to an end.
The project already involves twelve EU Member States.
The German Parliament has already voted unanimously in favour of preserving the border that ran along 1Â 400 km through Germany and of opening it up to environmentally-friendly tourism.
This stretch of green runs from the Arctic in the north to the Black Sea in the south, numbers Mikhail Gorbachev among its patrons, and is a suitable means of promoting a European sense of identity.
I rejoice at the widespread support for it in this House and hope that the Member States will now waste no time in joining with the Commission to complete it.
It will be, in the truest sense of the word, an experience of European history, politics and culture.
Â Â  â In line with the subsidiarity principle, the responsibility for tourism lies with the Member States.
That is how it should continue to be.
Tourism should develop on a sustainable basis.
It should contribute to balanced regional planning without damaging the environment, promote and derive greater benefit from cultural diversity and historical heritage, and encourage regional and local authorities, stakeholders and populations to become involved.
If we are to meet the pressing need to combat the growing problem of precarious work and exploitation affecting workers in the sector, work must be appreciated, decent wages must be paid, the security and stability of working arrangements must be guaranteed and vocational training must be provided.
We object to certain aspects of the report before us, and feel that other areas have not been given due prominence.
We therefore tabled amendments aimed at reaffirming tourismâs role in economic and social cohesion, its connection with the reality on the ground, the need to guarantee high-quality jobs and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.
We feel that the absence of a specific legal basis in the Treaties has not stopped specific measures and programmes geared towards promoting tourism at Community level in the past.
Hence our proposal to create a Community programme for the sector, to complement the measures put in place by the Member States.
Tourism is an important sector with huge potential which can offer added value to a country and fully develop its production capacities.
Â Â  Since IÂ have long dealt with the issues of tourism, IÂ appreciate MrÂ QueirÃ³âs initiative.
The proposal aptly illustrates the multi-faceted nature of tourism and the need to coordinate it at European level.
The development of this sector of the economy stimulates not only the catering, hotel and transport services, but in the long run also innovation, culture, art and agriculture.
This knock-on effect will undoubtedly boost the stagnating economic growth, speed up the progression of national economies towards becoming service economies, and reduce high levels of unemployment that afflict many European countries.
The development of special types of tourism such as rural, spa or congress tourism would make it possible to overcome certain negative aspects of the industry, especially its seasonal nature.
Well-known tourist destinations are often situated on the borderline between two or three Member States, and supporting tourism at theÂ European level would thus also encourage the development of border regions that are often marginalized.
IÂ am of the view that it is not necessary to develop a new financial facility to this end, but simply to coordinate the existing ones.
An additional task for the EU would be to improve the publicity for the areas that are visited less frequently.
Besides the economic and social aspects, the cultural aspect is not negligible, either.
Getting to know Europeâs cultural heritage will increase the awareness of history and help build aÂ common European identity.
It clearly follows from this report that tourism has aÂ huge potential.
For this reason, Europe should respond as quickly as possible and utilise this potential for its own benefit.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague and friend MrÂ Leichtfried has unexpectedly had to go back to Austria, I will take this opportunity of airing a number of his ideas in this Chamber.
It is heartening that this excellent report shows the European Union concerning itself with the issue of tourism and stressing its enormous importance in terms of growth and employment.
Europe is the most important tourist destination in the world.
The tourist sector in Europe can take the credit for creating over 7 million jobs and is among the sectors offering the greatest potential for the creation of new jobs in the future.
The tourist industry is one sector of the economy in which services are generally rendered directly by workers themselves, and this makes it less entrepreneurial in character.
It is for precisely this reason that it is necessary to focus more on the promotion of training for workers in this sector, while also paying attention to the conditions under which services are provided.
It is now the case that there are regions in Europe where workers are recruited from far away because local people no longer feel themselves able to provide these services under the conditions offered to them.
Here, too, there is a task for the European Union.
As Mr Leichtfried himself has repeatedly said, it is encouraging that the issue of coordination in matters of holiday arrangements and of European monitoring of it has been taken up in this report.
National and regional holidays need to be properly coordinated by the European Union.
We know what that would mean in terms of the strain placed on our infrastructure and in terms of the services that could be offered.
The rapporteur did very well to incorporate this idea, which merits our wholehearted support.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the thorough and thoughtful approach that Parliament has at last developed on the major topic of tourism.
The structure of the QueirÃ³ report is excellent â I therefore congratulate the rapporteur â and I agree with the need to stand up to international competition by concentrating on efficient, quality services and better promotion of Europeâs tourist destinations.
I personally believe it is essential to strengthen our commitment in the area of training tourism professionals, in order to offer genuine career prospects to operators in the sector, reduce the adverse effects of the instability of the seasonal workforce and guarantee services in tune with the new demands of consumers.
In that respect, I have tabled some amendments, which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has accepted, in which I propose the creation of a tailor-made training network for tourism skills within Community programmes that are already in operation, such as Erasmus, for instance.
In addition, I suggest we take further measures, seeking to gradually harmonise tax rates on tourism operatorsâ profit margins; I also believe that targeted training for operators who receive and take care of elderly tourists and tourists with disabilities is necessary and should be mandatory, so as to guarantee equal rights for those user groups, who are increasingly inclined to take holidays.
Lastly, I consider it indispensable to standardise the assessment criteria to be used in classifying hotel facilities and in harmonising professional profiles in tourism.
I believe that today Parliament is marking an important turning point, in that the approach and the attention devoted to the major topic that is tourism will no longer be episodic, but constant and commensurate.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be no exception in this debate in offering my own congratulations to our rapporteur and indeed the shadow rapporteurs.
They have all worked very hard to produce this excellent piece of work.
I rise briefly to offer you some Scottish experience, particularly in relation to paragraph 36 on the need for eco-labelling in sustainable tourism.
In Scotland we have been operating such a scheme for some years now.
The Green Tourism Business Scheme is operated on behalf of Visit Scotland by a commercial â though not-for-profit â company.
It promotes sustainability, provides practical advice to businesses and provides a level playing field, a certification to ensure consistent quality among its 500 member businesses, all of which are good-quality tourist attractions.
I believe it is a model that would work very well when rolled out to other countries across Europe.
I believe it has much to commend it.
A tourist industry focused on sustainability will focus automatically on quality, which is ultimately what the consumer in this modern age demands.
In Scotland we have had some success in this, although we also have some lessons to learn from it.
This report provides a framework for the sharing of best practice and it has our full support.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation to MrÂ QueirÃ³ for the excellent work he has done.
Tourism is a fundamental activity for my country, Italy, and especially so for my city, Rome.
That is why his report is of particular interest to me.
Tourism is an essential resource for creating strong growth in employment at a time of serious economic downturn.
Europe has a natural vocation to be a tourist destination, not only because we are the richest continent in history, art and culture, but also because of our approach to tourism, which favours quality and respect for the environment and countryside: travel as a form of cultural enrichment.
