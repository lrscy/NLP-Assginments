I would also thank the Councilâs negotiator, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, and the rapporteur, MrÂ Garriga Polledo, who I think have made fantastic contributions to the budget procedure.
Last but not least, I would thank my colleagues, the coordinators, for their constructive cooperation on the budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this yearâs mobilisation of the flexibility instrument is closely connected with the success of the Budget consultations and the agreement that we concluded â as we indeed needed to â between the institutions.
Let me say, Mr President-in-Office, in retrospect, how good it is that at that time, in 1999, Parliament secured this flexibility instrument following laborious negotiations, for it has been very much to the benefit of the Councilâs priorities when implementing past yearsâ Budgets.
Let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument, the annual upper limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EURÂ 200 million, is intended to deal with unforeseen eventualities, and also that heading 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that, as a rule, this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two successive financial years.
Before this flexibility instrument is made use of, there does of course have to be a motion to that effect, and there has to be examination of whether new unforeseen measures are to be funded within a heading or, where this is impossible, by shifts between one heading and another, which is to be followed by discussion of whether the flexibility instrument is to be applied.
We go through this procedure almost every year, and what we have actually learned from the experience is that the interpretation put on this flexibility has sometimes placed it under some considerable strain.
I would draw attention to this yearâs result, which is that we have EURÂ 185 million at our disposal, EURÂ 45 million for the Peace II programme, EURÂ 40 million for the agencies â which are obviously among the Councilâs really important priorities and are always threatening to displace important programmes in heading III, which yield added value for Europe â and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq.
It is with specific reference to this that I want to point out that, in the current 2004 Budget, out of a total of EURÂ 90 million for Iraq, EURÂ 74 million have â as I recall â already been funded in 2004 with the aid of the flexibility instrument.
That manifestly borders on the indefensible.
As a rule, that should not be done.
For that reason, I believe we would be very well advised, in the debate on the new Financial Perspective and the flexibility it calls for, to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibility instrument over the past years.
Let me take this opportunity to say that we are talking here, overall, in terms of payments from the 2005 Budget of EURÂ 106.3 billion and EURÂ 200 million allowed for flexibility.
What is interesting about this year is that, for the first time, not only does heading IV âÂ foreign policy â benefit from the use of the flexibility instrument, but also headings II and III necessarily benefit from what we have negotiated.
The ultimate result of this, and what might be called an additional result, is that the Agreement has also made it possible â in a sort of legal/budgetary emergency operation â to incorporate EURÂ 120 million worth of funding for Northern Cyprus under heading VII and to add EURÂ 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy, bringing it up to EURÂ 62.5 million.
Mr President, please allow me to make a final comment: our experience and the virtually annual debate on the use of the flexibility instrument must surely make it clear to both the Council and to Parliament, as they debate the new Financial Perspective, that the longer we set the Financial Perspectives for â be it 2007 to 2013 or whatever â and the longer the period for which the amounts are laid down, the more likely it is that we will need more flexibility to deal with the unexpected in coming years and will have to demand this of the Council in the negotiations on the Financial Perspectives.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased that our two institutions reached a global agreement on the budget of the Union for next year during the conciliation meeting on 25 November.
Following your deliberations today, allow me to make a few remarks in this context.
As you know, the Council had not initially foreseen the use of the flexibility instrument.
In our global compromise the Council had to accept its use for a substantial amount â EUR 185 million â and this was not greeted with enthusiasm by all Member States.
Because of budgetary discipline, the Council is of the opinion that choices have to be made, just as, at national level, one cannot simply add up all priorities and expect the bill to be paid.
Having said that, in preparation for the conciliation meeting, the Council listened carefully to Parliament's arguments.
Parliament made it clear from the start that it would not be able to finance its traditional priorities and its new priorities in Headings 3 and 4, Internal and External Policies, under the existing ceilings.
With the agreements on the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 3, Parliament is in the position to restore the funding for the agencies.
At the same time Parliament has secured sufficient funding for its priorities.
As regards the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 4, I can agree with the draftsman of the opinion of Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs that the outcome can be seen as quite positive for Parliament.
I also want to mention the peace process in Northern Ireland.
I am pleased that we were able to agree on the financing of the Peace II programme for 2005-06.
We are making a valuable contribution to a long-term solution.
Finally, the Parliament's delegation made it possible to reach agreement by moderating the demands on payment appropriations.
We have a balanced result, which the Commission says is workable.
I look forward to the signing ceremony on Thursday.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am very pleased to speak to you today, the first encounter for the new Commission in this very important exercise, starting on 22 November, which directly concerns the negotiations on the 2005 budget: a very important issue for Parliament and for Europe.
After fairly tough negotiations on 25 November, when both branches of the budgetary authority showed skill and flexibility, we reached a final agreement on a tight budget for 2005.
Parliament's solidarity and determination allowed it to achieve all the important goals it had set itself.
The Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski; the budget rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo; Mrs Jensen, the rapporteur on the flexibility instrument; Mr BÃ¶ge, and other members of the Committee on Budgets who participated very closely in all-day and all-night negotiations deserve thanks from all of us for the hard-won results.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr NicolaÃ¯, also deserves our praise for having encouraged Member States to accept the agreement: not an easy task.
In the final agreement there will, of course, be some risk that not all compulsory expenditure is covered in what was decided in the package.
According to updated estimates from the Committee on Agriculture, for example, some expenditure was ignored by the Council: extra calls for payments for the structural funds or actions during the year could be necessary.
But I am satisfied that we agreed a joint declaration on payment appropriations for structural actions that can allow a rapid single-reading decision on a possible amending budget for extra payments if the Commission identifies the need in mid-2005.
I call on both budgetary authorities to react quickly if there appears to be a need to propose this.
The same will also apply to compulsory expenditure on agriculture.
We also want to emphasise that, as mentioned before, for the first time the flexibility instrument is being used above the ceilings in three headings and we agreed to use the total amount of EUR 185 million for this instrument.
I am not going to emphasise the details of the overall package, which has been very well described, or the main agreements we reached.
I would like to draw attention to what is important for us and is always important for Parliament, namely improving delivery.
Each year Parliament seeks to use the budget process to support the Commission's efforts to improve delivery, which we are happy to accept.
The Commission's letter on implementability has the same intent.
We have fulfilled the request made at first reading and you consequently released many of the reserves.
I thank you for that.
Parliament is concerned about the way non-state actors and international organisations are using European Union funds.
The Commission will produce a report by April 2005 examining these issues.
You have maintained a reserve for the financing of 50 new posts from the several hundred requested.
I hope to introduce a transfer request in January to lift the reserve on these posts, since I believe the conditions have been fulfilled.
You ask for the rules to be changed on the financial regulation.
I undertake that the Commission will bring forward proposals to modify the financial regulation by spring 2005, and the Commission has already introduced proposals to modify the implementing rules.
The Council is ready to give its opinion.
We await Parliament's views.
I will look again at your request for support for events and pilot actions.
Not all of them are feasible, but the new political situation may provide new openings and I will communicate my thoughts on that to you in January.
The Commission thanks you once again for your fair and firm negotiations and for your willingness to seek a compromise.
I congratulate you all on the great success that you have achieved.
I take this opportunity to wish you the compliments of the season and look forward to the final vote on Thursday.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner and would like to take this opportunity to wish her all the best in her work as part of the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a real European area of freedom, security and justice quite clearly constitutes one of the fundamental political priorities of the European Union and a major preoccupation for all European citizens.
This is why I wish first of all to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, and in particular our general rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for supporting and putting to the vote in this House most of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Of these, several are aimed specifically at strengthening the European Unionâs capacity to combat terrorism.
This involves, , an increase in Eurojustâs operating appropriations and the inclusion of a pilot project in the budget intended to enhance coordination, throughout the EU, of the resources and activities for preventing and combating terrorist threats.
We have also proposed measures to strengthen the ways in which all Europeans show solidarity with the victims of terrorist acts.
Of the other priorities, I should like once again to highlight two of them, which are in our view of particular significance.
We propose, Commissioner, to hold in reserve the bulk of the appropriations requested on passengersâ rights.
We are aware of the disagreement between Parliament and the Commission as regards the level of protection for the personal data that the airlines have to provide to the American customs authorities.
If we vote for the proposed amendment, the appropriations will remain frozen for as long as the Commission fails to propose an active rather than passive system for the transmission of data, as it has undertaken to do several times and as Parliament has asked it to do.
Secondly, and I particularly address these remarks to the President-in-Office of the Council, we propose to hold in reserve all of the appropriations earmarked for the External Borders Agency.
In order to be operational and effective, Mr President, this Agency needs headquarters â permanent headquarters.
We ask the Council to establish such headquarters urgently and preferably before the end of this year.
Mr President, you have already settled many problems and I think you are capable of settling this one before leaving office.
Thank you in advance.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking our three rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, in which I also include the Chairman of our Committee and, of course, the staff of the Committeeâs secretariat, who have provided us Members with the information we needed to stand our ground against a shrewd Council.
Our negotiations, Mr President-in-Office, have of course left an aftertaste, and about that I would like to speak in very plain terms.
It goes without saying that the European Union needs to save money.
We have to draw up a tight budget, and we have to be responsible in our handling of the money that the public have paid in tax, but the question forming itself in my mind is whether it is one of the tasks of the annual Budget procedure to put forward ever more recondite proposals for a Budget when you know already that there will be a supplementary Budget next year?
Such is not a credible approach.
In none of the 25 Member States â let me make this abundantly clear â would the national parliament tolerate such a way of going about things.
Secondly, I ask you to try to rein in your fellow ministers in the foreign affairs departments and in all the other specialisms.
I am anticipating the negotiations to which Mr BÃ¶ge has referred when I say that there is no pleasure in laying down upper limits by way of the Financial Perspective when it is apparent to everyone involved that the figures are notional and will never â it is to be hoped â be reached.
There I would ask you to be more honest.
Almost EURÂ 5 billion separates us from the upper limit of Agenda 2000 â in the wrong direction!
So please let us, when considering agricultural policy, talk about how much money we really need, rather than â as the Commissioner has just said that she will need a supplementary and amending Budget â laying down the amounts via the Budget procedure.
Let us not promise ourselves anything where the ten new countries are concerned, and then, if we want the 1.0% Budget that we obsess about, we will be able to save.
That is not only what I ask for, but also the lesson that I have learned from these negotiations.
Although we have achieved much together, all these negotiations now need to be addressed with a bit more seriousness.
Â Â  . Commissioner, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is now my turn to thank all those involved in the budget on which we shall be voting in two daysâ time: MrsÂ Jensen, Mr Garriga, Mr BÃ¶ge and also all those who have been working with us.
Once again, I wish to express how baffled I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially, for this second reading, at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November.
It is true that we have reached an agreement and achieved results, but did it really need twelve hours to arrive at what should have been achievable by means of real methods of dialogue rather than a set of people who did real damage to the content of the budget?
We have now reached payment appropriations of 1.05% of GDP, which is above the milestone of 1%.
In return, however, we have obtained an unhoped-for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on HeadingÂ 2.
We actually feel that obtaining this result was extremely important, albeit highly unsatisfactory in the long run.
At a time when we are negotiating the next financial perspectives, we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European policies and the Councilâs reticence during these negotiations leads me to believe that, if we speak of a ceiling in the negotiations, Parliament should also provide for the concept of a floor beneath which a European budget makes no sense.
Setting payment appropriations in stone while moving away from commitment appropriations is a usual strategy of the Council, but this is a strange course of action at a time when everyone â whether in the private sector or the public sector â is being asked to ensure transparency, reliability and truth when reading the budget figures.
This cannot continue and the Union must be as strict with itself as it is with others.
This situation enabled us to release the investments that we wanted in the very short term and my colleagues will speak to you about this.
We also hope â and I am addressing the Commission at this point â that we shall see very good budget implementation this year, especially in the field of information and communication with the citizens.
Like you, Commissioner, I hope that this year we shall make progress on the problem of setting up and implementing pilot projects, so that we are better able to meet our societyâs expectations.
Finally, I am going to take a few minutes to say that one budget heading perplexed us.
I turn this time towards my colleagues to say that, when we agreed to vote for the package on special events, we were entirely in agreement that the concept of European secularism should be fully implemented.
You gave us your word that World Youth Day in Cologne is to be characterised by respect for other cultures and philosophies and that European money is to be used in an entirely secular way; you know, as I do, that we shall be watching carefully.
The adoption of the other institutionsâ budgets, which took place without any problems, leads me simply to say that we must review our expenditure here because, by imposing severe restrictions on our expenditure, we have ended up imposing limitations on ourselves and denied ourselves resources for working and exercising our power and our privileges with respect to the other institutions.
In conclusion, I should like simply to say that this budget will certainly be implemented without any great problem inÂ 2005, but that it is a transitional budget, which does not provide any real means of ensuring continuity and this is what is worrying us greatly.
Nonetheless, I think that Mr Pittella will be able to take up the gauntlet even though this method cannot last and might hinder us in the future from achieving budgets to match our political projects.
Â Â  . Mr President, the EU budget for 2005 is now at second reading in Parliament.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Salvador Garriga Polledo and Anne Jensen, for their excellent work.
I wish, likewise, to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, MrÂ Lewandowski, for his sterling leadership of the committee and Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ and MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, representing the Council, for their constructive cooperation.
The EU budget for 2005 may well meet next yearâs needs, but there are question marks over it.
There was much wrangling over payment appropriations, which looked as if they were going to be too small.
Outstanding commitments at present are about to reach the EUR 100 billion mark, of which approximately EUR 70 billion represents the Structural Funds.
The poor levels of implementation of the budget in recent years have now created a backlog.
Right to the end, the Council wanted to limit payment appropriations.
It took much effort to bring payments up to the level of EUR 106.3 billion, which is still EUR 7.9 billion below the financial perspective.
That, however, is EUR 500 billion, or more than 1% of the EUâs GDP.
This budget ceiling proposed by six Member States thus haunted the conciliation meeting.
Even the Council, however, doubted the adequacy of the financing by adopting the joint resolution which proposed that any supplementary budget relating to the Structural Funds should, if possible, be adopted at one reading.
The statement runs contrary to good budgetary policy as the budget has to include all known expenditure for the financial year.
It should be mentioned that at the same conciliation meeting it was agreed to increase the payment appropriations in the Structural Funds this year by EUR 3.7 billion, because funds have run out.
Of this, EUR 2 billion was new money.
In the budget debate, the issue of the rapid rise in the number of Agencies in the European Union was raised.
Next year there will be 23 of them, of which five will be new.
EUR 40 million from the flexibility instrument had to be spent to meet their administrative costs, or else there would have been no financing available.
In recent times, a lot of Agencies have been set up as a result of trade between Member States.
In 2000 there were still only seven Agencies.
We should therefore take prompt action to discover whether the Agencies are the most effective way to develop the EUâs administration.
It might be that this way we are establishing units that are hard to monitor and which are partially responsible for creating nothing more than a double layer of bureaucracy.
Another question is presented by the various associations and organisations that are granted appropriations directly out of the budget.
These earmarked sums are actually against the financial regulation.
We believe the system to be based on favouritism, which muddies the grounds for financial support, making them unclear.
Parliament should remain a legislative body and leave implementation tasks to the Commission, which would be the best way of monitoring impartiality.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, Mr NicolaÃ¯, ladies and gentlemen, we may, today, be discussing the agreement with the Council about the 2005 Budget, but we are, of course, already looking to see how things will progress with the 2006 Budget and what is to be expected in the coming years in relation to the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
So I will tell you in plain language that my political evaluation of the result we have achieved for 2005 makes me both laugh and cry.
What I see as positive is the flexibility instrument.
I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr BÃ¶ge, who made it very clear that we have succeeded in making these funds available now â not only for internal policy and the agencies, but also for foreign policy, above all for supporting the elections in Iraq.
That is a success, and it was one that we in this House saw as urgently necessary if we were to be equal to all the tasks set us.
I see it as indispensable that we were able to uphold as part of the Lisbon strategy our priority of upgrading information policy, enabling us better to reach the citizens and voters in Europe.
We Greens also see it as important progress that the LIFE programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have been prevented from falling by the wayside.
I would, however, like to say with equal clarity that what I see in a negative light is the shape taken by the payments for 2005.
We do, admittedly, conclude that this round of negotiations did not offer more room for manoeuvre; that is why we will vote in favour of this Budget.
I am right behind Mr Ferber in his criticisms of the Council and in his statement describing the 1% criterion as misguided fetishism on the part of the Council.
I want to make that very plain to you, as I was very pleased to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr Ferber and I are of one mind.
The fact is that I do believe â and here I am addressing you, Mr NicolaÃ¯ â that you stated, not only in the course of our negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but also in this House today, that this House, in exactly the same way as the national governments, must be willing to decide on priorities.
That is indeed so.
My fellow MEPs have also already said that we all have a great interest in budgetary discipline and a serious approach to the Budget.
In the same way, though, you cannot evade our question, for if we have to set priorities, the same must also be said of the national governments.
Your belief that you have to make unilateral cuts in which European policy loses out I regard as the wrong approach.
Politics risks being renationalised, and, for an enlarged Europe â for, for the first time, we are dealing with a Budget for 25 Member States â with new tasks and new challenges, that would be a mistake.
If you want to fashion a truly European policy, you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that.
I do not at present see that in the position of the net contributing countries and in the obsession with 1%.
That I regard as a mistake in political terms.
If we want to join together in further developing our wonderful continent, if we want to do more for economic renewal, for spending on education, youth and new talents, then jointly, and together with you, the Council and the net contributor countries â and this is where I am critical of the red/green government in Germany â we must get moving in order to achieve more for Europeâs benefit.
Let me express, by way of conclusion, my gratitude to all the staff and members of the Committee on Budgets.
I hope that we will continue to work together with such powerful effect over the years to come in order to achieve much for Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group has submitted a motion to reject the 2005 budget and I should like to explain the reasons for this initiative.
My group has never argued in favour of a rash increase in the Unionâs budget.
We are committed to the rigorous management of public funds and, above all, we do not consider the budget to be the only instrument available to the Union to realise its ambitions.
In this respect, we wish to highlight, for example, the need for a fundamental reorientation of the missions and operation of the European Central Bank.
It remains true, however, that the Unionâs budget reflects a political will. The stated objectives must be matched by sufficient financial resources, otherwise the EUâs very credibility is at risk.
Following the increasing pressure being exerted to reduce public expenditure at all cost in accordance with the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact, we have already had, in 2004, the lowest budget relative to gross national revenue since 1987.
Year after year, Parliament has criticised this restrictive tendency, along with the laborious budgetary gymnastics that accompany it; such as the increasing numbers of transfers and amending budgets; the reduction in essential appropriations, such as those intended for developing countries, to be able to finance new demands, for example the contribution to financing for the reconstruction of countries severely affected by war, such asÂ the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq; and the misuse of the flexibility instrument .
Every year, Parliament criticises this trend and we have again just heard Mr Ferber, Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs TrÃŒpel echo this dissatisfaction.
I propose quite simply that this should be reflected, this year, not only in words, but also in clear and visible action.
In fact, for the 2005 budget, the compromise reached by the consultations held on 25 November, namely EURÂ 106.3 billion âÂ in other words, not 1.05%, Mrs Guy-Quint, but 1.005% of gross national revenueÂ â is less than the Commissionâs preliminary draft, 109 billion, which was itself less than the Parliamentâs request in first reading, 111 billion, a request in turn less than the commitments made by the Council, the Commission and Parliament as part of the financial perspectives jointly set in 2000, which set the budget at 114 billion.
To indicate that we finally wish to put an end to this systematically restrictive and short-sighted policy on the part of the Council is the first reason for submitting our motion to reject the 2005 budget.
The second reason for our decision is that next year will be the first full year of the Union of 25.
The success of this enlargement assumes, in our view, that we provide a budget sufficient to take on the unavoidable costs of interdependence associated with this great project, whilst ensuring that this does not involve abandoning regions or populations in difficulty in the old Member States.
I should add that the new efforts, the need for which is accepted by everyone, to support employment, education, training, research and the environment require commensurate funding, unless it is considered that such new efforts are to be limited to just a few profitable niches and a privileged elite.
Successful enlargement without bringing the populations of the new and old Member States into competition with one another â that is the second reason why we tabled our motion to reject a poor draft budget.
Finally, 2005 will be the decisive year in the attempt to reach agreement between the 25 on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.
As has already been stated several times, a heavy millstone is currently weighing these negotiations down: the need of the six countries which are net contributors to the Unionâs budget to have this limited in the future to 1% or 0.9% of gross national revenue.
The Commission has drawn attention, quite rightly, to the fact that this would actually mean a swingeing cut of more than EURÂ 9Â billion in the 2007 budget in relation to the preceding financial year.
Where would such drastic reductions fall?
On the great works announced with grand pomp and ceremony?
On the Structural Funds?
A little bit everywhere?
Are we going to be ready for action when faced with such irresponsible perspectives?
If we were to accept without a fight a 2005 budget set at 1% of gross national revenue, would we not be, in some ways, falling in line with the mindset of the Letter of the Six?
The third reason why we tabled our motion to reject the 2005 budget was to adopt a combative stance in Parliament before it is too late, on the eve of the decisive negotiations on the financial perspectives for the years to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, in EU countries about one fortieth of tax revenue is spent by EU institutions.
In Britain, we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the EU has brought us.
However, we are beginning to recognise, as kindly confirmed by ex-Commissioner Kinnock, that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and cooperate with EU countries and that our prosperity might well be higher if we were not in the EU.
They also tell us that the EU budget is small in comparison with national budgets.
However, national budgets pay for some useful things, such as defence, education, health care and pensions.
The EU budget pays for subsidies to agriculture â subsidies that agriculture would function better without.
It pays for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered worthwhile.
It pays for poorly targeted overseas development aid.
It pays for auditors to find out that 93% of reported spending was unsafe or riddled with errors.
It pays for this Parliament.
Let us stop arguing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda.
Let us look at the broader picture.
As the last speaker has just said, several countries with their own budget problems want a limit of one per cent of GNI.
The Commission rightly points out that it must be much larger if the expectations of the new accession countries are to be fulfilled.
How much larger â two per cent, four per cent?
If the EU were genuinely concentrating on the ideals it keeps proclaiming â peace, prosperity, strong economies â it would be acting very differently.
It would not be looking at these various projects: it would be opening its markets properly, internally and externally; it would cease killing off our businesses with thousands of ill-judged prescriptive rules, and its budget could be a small fraction of one per cent of GDP.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, work on the Unionâs 2005 budget is almost at an end.
The Commission proposed a budget amounting to EURÂ 109Â billion, the Council proposed a figure of EURÂ 105Â billion and Parliament proposed EURÂ 111Â billion.
The final figure is EURÂ 106Â billion.
The rapporteurs must of course be thanked for their work, but the question arises as to whether this amounts to success and an appropriate compromise.
In fact that is not the most crucial issue at stake.
What is much more important is that the outcome is below expectations.
I can see other Members of this House share my view.
The policy of cuts won the day, despite enlargement of the Union to take in ten new Member States.
Wishful thinking prevailed, namely that it is possible to have a larger Union for less money.
The agreed level of expenditure may impact on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, and this is even more worrying.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Groupâs attitude to the 2005 budget is that it is something that cannot currently be opposed, but we see no reason for rejoicing.
This is also an opportunity for broader reflection.
George Kennan observed in the past that Soviet expansion came about because of an inability to solve internal problems.
I trust the same will not be true of the European Union.
Unfortunately, there are some worrying similarities regarding two issues, the first of which is economic policy.
To date, the Union has pursued a policy of cohesion and economic solidarity, helping the less-developed countries so as to promote the development of the Member States as a whole.
At present, the concept of cohesion and economic solidarity is being written out of Union agreements.
Weakening cohesion policy or doing away with it altogether may lead to differences becoming even more entrenched in the future.
This is especially likely if the Lisbon strategy comes to mean giving up on economic policy, that is, achieving the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost, to the benefit of social policy in the more developed countries.
I refer to protecting jobs in those countries burdened with excessively high social costs.
The second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own identity.
Events concerning MrÂ Buttiglione and the failure to integrate Islamic communities in Western Europe, as referred to recently in , are both relevant examplesas is the question of the text of the preambleto the Constitution.
At the same time, we are continuing to debate enlargement to include Turkey, without taking any account of the fundamental issues dividing the Union from Turkey.
The former include social, economic, political and cultural problems.
The response to the conflict between the theory of universal standards and particular ones has been to do away with standards of all kinds.
Those determined to go to any lengths to achieve a federal Europe without borders, lacking ideological identity and cohesion policy, are acting to the detriment of the Union.
They are working slowly but more surely against it than those who currently wish to harm the Union with extremist language.
There can only be one conclusion, namely that in future, the Union must come up with a broader ideological identity and make more resources available, so as to implement cohesion and solidarity policy effectively.
Â Â  (SK) Thank you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to pick up on my colleague Mr Roszkowskiâs words and present aÂ few facts and figures.
For the year 2005 the Commission has come up with aÂ draft level of payments of EUR 109 billion, in its first reading the Council has come up with EUR 105 billion, and Parliament has calculated payments at EUR 111 billion.
This creates an impression of competent activity.
In the second round the Council has come to us with aÂ draft level of payments again at EUR 105.3 billion while Parliament proposes EUR 106.3 billion, which is about 5 billion less than in the first round.
It is totally obvious who is taking the lead in this game of budgetary ping-pong, but it is also clear that the budgetary procedures are still not precisely defined.
If the proposed level of payments is passed by Parliament it will represent an increase of 6.5% compared to 2004.
In comparison with the projected level of inflation in the Eurozone, this is aÂ modest rise, but when set alongside the need to finance the political goals and priorities of the European Union there seem to be fewer reasons for optimism.
As long as the quality criterion for the budgetary process of the European Union is the bringing together of the levels of contributions and payments, it is rather aÂ reason for pessimism.
AÂ couple of days ago, the European Parliament approved the annual report of the Court of Auditors for the financial year 2003.
In the parliamentary discussion about this report there was agreement about one of the key conclusions, namely that the draw-down level of credit payments or the implementation of the payments was rather low and for aÂ long period has hovered between 80 and 90%.
In this respect the draft budget for the year 2005 does not bring any turnaround as it suggests an implementation level for payments of 90%.
As far as the structural funds are concerned, the levers for implementing budgetary resources in the form of the payments are in the hands of the governments of the EU Member States. It is therefore an important role of Parliament to use its political instruments and to gain the support of the media in exerting appropriate pressure on the governments and the Council in order to make fuller and more effective use of the disposable resources to finance the common policies of the European Union.
If this does not happen, the parliamentary budgetary procedure will continue to be more aÂ test of the loyality of Members of the European Parliament to the governments of their home countries rather than aÂ test of the effectiveness and competitiveness of the budgetary process and the use of European Union resources.
Thank you.
Â Â  We will now hear the other speakers on todayâs list, with Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra to speak first.
I would like to apologise to him for a small error in the order of speaking, which we managed to put right with his help and that of Mr Lewandowski.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that, in fact, Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure establish that, following the rapporteurs of the committee responsible for the main report, it is normally the draftsmen of the opinions of the relevant committees who take the floor.
Having said that, Mr President, I would like to thank you for your courtesy and congratulate the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, on the excellent work he has done and also on the way he has handled the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
With regard to heading 4, we have faced the problems that traditionally arise in that chapter, this year with the EUR 200 million for Iraq, as the President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out.
We have been able to find a satisfactory solution, but in any event, we believe that the solution proposed by the Commission would have been better because that would have saved us cuts in heading 4 in the sum of EUR 15 million.
I believe that Mr BÃ¶geâs comments are absolutely right, that is to say, we cannot take on new commitments every year at the expense of the European Unionâs traditional external action priorities.
We must rationalise the use of the flexibility instrument, which is governed by certain rules which must be respected for the sake of the credibility of our European Union project; in terms of the review of the coming financial perspectives, surely we will be able to reach an agreement on the solution to this issue.
Mr President, I would also like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, Mr Wijkman, for his excellent cooperation and his willingness at all times to find solutions which are compatible with the priorities of his committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Commissioner luck in her duties and ask her to facilitate our work by not taking on commitments which have no budgetary support, because I believe that, by taking that approach, we will be able to cooperate more effectively in relation to the objective that inspires us all.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, difficult negotiations have concluded with a creditable result.
For this we should thank the rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen, all the political groups and the new Commissioner, who has given us valuable help and whose good wishes I gladly reciprocate.
The agreement can be seen as satisfactory to Parliament because it brings with it many positive outcomes.
It has been a difficult passage, but we have got through it, and have obtained funding for reconstruction in Iraq, the maintenance of traditional geographical policies, funds for SMEs, information and research as well as resources for the agencies.
Also entered in the budget are resources for the structural funds and pilot projects, some of which are very interesting, such as Erasmus for apprentices and the pilot projects on conflict prevention and on small arms reduction.
We cannot, however, pronounce ourselves satisfied with the way in which the chapter on payment appropriations was concluded.
I am well aware that this is not the fault of either Parliament or the Commission, which in fact helped us and pressed as hard as it could.
However, the stone-cold inflexibility with which the Council stuck by the 1% is worthy of a better cause and does not augur well either for negotiations on the Financial Perspective or for the next budget, for which I hope that it will be possible to achieve more ambitious and gratifying goals, as MrsÂ Guy-Quint also said.
We have gone a little beyond the 1% mark.
It was right to give this signal, as Parliament will not accept a Financial Perspective which forces the Union to forsake its own tasks and duties, which are enshrined in the treaties.
Peculiar ideas are circulating and sometimes a kind of psychological bullying is also used towards the new Member States to make them maintain the so-called rigorous line.
Ladies and gentlemen, rigour consists in transparent, effective and efficient administration, but it does not mean refusing to act with the leadership expected by European citizens.
Article 158 of the Treaty affirms that economic and social cohesion policy is one of Europeâs main tasks.
Anyone thinking of pared-down budgets, of reducing and concentrating the structural funds on certain areas only, of renationalising the cohesion policy and depriving the Lisbon strategy of the requisite resources should be aware right now that they will be met with the firm opposition of this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, as the representative of my political group, I have been following the budget debate in the Committee on Budgets since the spring.
I am sure that both rapporteurs have done their very best, but, despite that, my group is proposing the budget be rejected for the reasons of policy that our Chairman, Francis Wurtz, mentioned at the start of the sitting.
The problem from Parliamentâs point of view is budgetary discipline, which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent.
Stringent budgetary discipline is supplemented by an interinstitutional agreement, which was smuggled through the European Parliament in May, 1999.
The previous Parliament was unable, as is the current one, to have an influence on the ceilings for appropriations determined in the interinstitutional agreement.
The only way to create more flexibility would have been to terminate the interinstitutional agreement that came about in such strange circumstances, but Parliament has not been prepared to do that, in spite of the fact that the inflexibility of the budget has been common knowledge.
This lack of flexibility is in the Councilâs interests, but not Parliamentâs.
I would, however, like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteurs and coordinators, for their excellent levels of cooperation, even though my group has decided to propose that the budget be rejected.
Â Â  Mr President, in my speech I would like to touch upon the issue of the budget allocated for the requirements of the common foreign and security policy.
A couple of decades ago there were already predictions that the twenty-first century would be a time of increased risks and threats.
Against this background the European Unionâs wish to promote stability not only in Europe, but also to achieve greater influence more generally in world security processes is very important.
This is confirmed by the European Unionâs declared wish and growing ability to be able to participate in conflict prevention and crisis management activities â and of course the challenges are not decreasing.
It is anticipated that in the near future the number of civil crisis management operations will double.
Specialists are discussing possible operations in Iraq, Sudan and the Congo.
Maintaining a stable situation in the European Unionâs neighbouring countries is no less important.
It is worth mentioning Georgia and the operations in the countries of the Balkan region.
Let us not forget that threats of terrorism inside the European Union are a real possibility.
Measures to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction are still important.
Europeâs institutional capacities in the sphere of crisis management need to be developed.
Therefore, it is very clear that the trend of the activities of the European Unionâs common foreign and security policy is inevitably upwards.
Seeing the amount of resources allocated for these measures in the budget for 2005, however, gives cause for concern about the discrepancy between Europeâs political ambitions and the financial resources available to fulfil these ambitions.
The insufficiency of resources needed to successfully achieve Europeâs security strategy is often discussed amongst specialists in the institution within the relevant fields.
Certainly, one should welcome the fact that at second reading the European Parliament has allotted 10 million more for needs than at first reading.
However, even then it is not possible to understand the tactical reasons which led Parliamentâs Budgetary Control Committee to allocate EUR 10 million less at first reading for the needs of coordinating these important goals.
Unfortunately, in order to prevent this erroneous approach by the European Parliament, it was necessary to put the conciliation procedure into effect.
Â Â  Mr President, listen in on this debate, and you hear the cry of âmoreâ, âmoreâ, âmoreâ on every side.
I, too, am in favour of âmoreâ, but of more efficiency and transparency, whether we are talking about the Lisbon strategy or security policy.
After all, we would have the money if we were, once and for all, to tackle the huge sacred cows that lurk in the Parliamentary budget and, of course, particularly in this enormous Budget, which runs to hundreds of billions of euros.
Let me just make two points about it.
Transparency would also mean making it plain how the political parties are now to be funded, a question to which first reading provided no unambiguous answer.
Transparency would also mean another vote on the secretarial allowance, which is now again to be surreptitiously increased.
Unfortunately, though, there is not going to be one.
So you cannot be surprised at the perception that the Budget is about haggling, and that you, Commissioner, are described as someone who had conceded a billion euros an hour.
No proper budget can be drawn up in this fashion; what is needed is explanation and change.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have learnt something very useful in the Committee on Budgets and something which has made life much easier for me, namely that it is best to begin by thanking the relevant individuals, in order to have ample time to do so.
I should therefore like to thank MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo, the rapporteur, and also MrsÂ Jensen.
It is worth remembering that the coordinators and Vice-Chairmen are responsible for the climate of cooperation characterising work on the budget in the European Parliament. This contrasts with similar work in national parliaments.
Thanks are therefore due to MrÂ Ferber, MrsÂ Guy-Quint, MrsÂ TrÃŒpel, MrÂ SeppÃ€nen, MrÂ Roszkowski and to MrÂ Walter, MrÂ BÃ¶ge and MrÂ Mulder, the Vice-Chairmen.
I trust the same climate of cooperation will prevail on Thursday, when we dot the iâs on the 2005Â Budget.
The final version of this budget resulted from very difficult negotiations with the Council.
We appreciate the wish to cooperate and reach a compromise displayed by the Dutch Presidency, and in particular by MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, and also by Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, who acted as moderator during the tense hours of the meeting.
It is certainly true that Parliament defended its priorities.
It resorted to the flexibility instrument, especially in the areas of internal policy and foreign policy that are very important to us.
Nonetheless, those who spoke in the House today emphasised that the situation will get worse.
If we project ourselves into the future, into the next multi-annual Financial Perspective, things look bleaker.
I am sure that slimming down the Structural Funds, together with a tripartite declaration to anticipate an amendment to the budget, cannot be described as sound financial programming.
As regards the budget procedure, 2005 was a year of new beginnings.
Consequently, the quality of administration was particularly important.
I should therefore like to conclude by thanking MrsÂ Fialho, MrÂ DeÂ Feo and the whole team.
They are genuine civil servants of the kind still sorely lacking in post-Communist Europe.
They augur well for the success of future work on the budget.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, investment conditions in the countries of the European Union are favourable at the present time.
We have low interest rates, there are no inflationary pressures, and we have sufficient reserves.
If we compare the economy of the European Union with the economy of the United States, however, we have to say that investors achieve aÂ greater profit and aÂ quicker return on their investment in the United States with the same level of investment.
The European Union must therefore orientate itself towards structural reforms at all levels and in all its institutions.
It is not appropriate to measure the effectiveness of the financial resources invested in particular areas and industries only on the basis of their scale.
In the absence of feedback enabling us to evaluate quantitative indicators, we must integrate and advance the measurement of quality and the measurement of added value.
This also goes for science and research, as Herr Wurtz has said today.
The Member States must be engaged in this process.
Each one of them should draft their own Lisbon Strategy, their own financial perspectives and base their revenues and costs on them.
We all know that the main battleground for the Lisbon targets is the implementation of reforms at aÂ national level.
IÂ mention all of this because when we talk about the annual budgets, financial perspectives and the Lisbon Strategy, we always talk about collective pots.
We have finally reached aÂ compromise in our discussions on the budget for 2005.
IÂ believe that we can approve the budget collectively.
IÂ would like to thank all the members of the Budgetary Committee for their constructive approach.
We all know that the 2005 budget is aÂ transitional budget.
The drafting of new financial perspectives lies ahead of us.
With the help of these we will have aÂ chance of making aÂ better start on the Lisbon Strategy, which would then take on aÂ different quality.
Â Â  I should like first of all to thank our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, even though he cannot be here, since it is clearly a mammoth task to examine the budget.
Last year, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, the budget passed through the symbolic barrier of EURÂ 100Â billion.
This year, there is a feeling that the novelty has worn off.
We have reached the end of two great budgetary cycles and the end, perhaps, of two political worlds.
First of all, clearly, we have reached the end of the Prodi cycle, of the planning for 2000-2006 and already, with a temporary Commission, we have been and are still working on the 2007-2013 cycle.
At the same time, however, we have also reached the end of the cycle of European budgetary modesty.
The European budget, in fact, even at EURÂ 106Â billion, is less than Spainâs (EURÂ 117Â billion for Spain).
Everyone realises that, with the arrival of Turkey, it is not just EURÂ 277Â million which will have to be added, at pre-accession stage, but EURÂ 33Â billion every year.
Ten years from now, consequently, the European budget will have doubled and the question of European taxation will have to be addressed.
We shall no longer be talking about 1% or 1.24% of gross national revenue.
We shall then have reached the end of two political worlds.
First of all, the world of Parliament-Council relations, since, inÂ 2009, the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will have disappeared and the anti-farming majority in this Parliament will rule against the agricultural world and the rural world.
This will at the same time be the end of a second world, which is already happening now, since, in the 2005 budget, the agricultural appropriations have been cut by a billion euro and, subsequently, these appropriations are to be plundered in order to finance other things on the pretext of rural development.
However, the disappearance from villages of post offices, railway stations, public revenue offices and public services clearly shows where we are heading.
This is why I would have liked us, with the assistance of our rapporteur and the assistance of our colleagues, to be able, in the 2006 budget, to create a European public holiday in honour of rural mayors in order to pay homage to the work of the 90Â 000Â rural mayors of the villages of Europe.
Otherwise, our 2005 budgetÂ already belongs to the cosy little world of a Europe with worldwide ambitions and a provincial budget.
Â Â  Mr Martinez, I did not realise myself that we were looking at all these things together in this budget discussion.
Perhaps Mr Dombrovskis will say something different.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group stands for transparency and maximum appropriate use of EU budget resources.
The PPE-DE Group expresses regret that the majority of the European Parliament has rejected our groupâs proposal concerning the reduction of the European Parliamentâs expenditure below the traditional 20% of total administrative expenditure.
It has to be acknowledged that this year we channelled approximately EUR 150 million of unspent funds towards advance payments for next yearâs expenditure.
This clearly shows how well-founded the PPE-DE Groupâs proposal was.
In relation to other institutions, even before the first reading the European Parliament had evaluated the additional budget requests of the EU institutions and it supported at first reading those requests, which were acknowledged to be justified.
One should recall that the majority of requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions are related to the enlargement of the EU, as well as with the new EU financial and staff regulations.
Therefore, at second reading we principly renewed the requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions that the European Parliament had endorsed, but which the European Council of Ministers had rejected.
In order to ensure greater EU budget transparency and appropriate use of budget resources, the European Parliament has come up with two new initiatives.
Firstly, we invite the Commission, when it submits its annual draft EU budget proposal, to submit information at the same time, on official posts that are vacant or have been reorganised during the year.
This will allow the European Parliament to better assess the justification for requesting new official posts.
Secondly, in order to ensure more appropriate use of EU budget resources as regards the need for extra rooms, chiefly in connection with the enlargement of the EU, we invite all the EU institutions to work together and to allow their rooms to be used for the requirements of other institutions.
This will make it possible to guarantee the rooms necessary for various meetings and other events without unnecessary additional expenditure on building or renting rooms.
Finally, a few words on regional policy.
The European Parliament welcomes the improvements in 2004 for the acquisition of structural funds and does not understand stance in reducing expenditure appropriations for 2005.
The European Parliament considers it necessary to pay the commitments set out in the Financial Perspective in due time, and not to defer payments to the last year of the Financial Perspective.
Â Â  Mr President, these people have got a nerve and I am amazed they have the temerity to turn up here.
They have not had their accounts signed off for the last ten years and they want more money to waste, to neglect, to give in fraud and corruption.
Had they been running a small company in my country, they would not only have been prosecuted, they would probably have been jailed!
Why should I vote for this?
Tell me!
Why should any of my constituents? Why should any of my countrymen?
In my country, there are 2.6 million pensioners living in poverty on means-tested benefits; there are 3.6 million children below the poverty level; there are 3.9 million childless adults living in poverty; and we are a rich country!
We are the fourth-largest economy in the world.
Why are so many of my constituents living in poverty?
Because you lot get the money!
Because 19 billion pounds of it goes to the inefficient common agricultural policy to support inefficient French, Italian and Greek farmers.
Why should my constituents suffer for their fraud, their corruption, and their inefficiency?
They should not.
Just taking back our money from the common agricultural policy would increase pensions by 30 pounds a week.
Were my constituents asked to give the money to France, Italy and Greece?
No!
Were they consulted?
No!
Were they given a vote?
No!
And would they have voted for it had they been?
No, they would not; and neither will I.
You can put your gavel down now, Mr President, because I have finished on time.
Â Â  Absolutely, I also regret it because we should have liked you to continue.
In fact, I do not know what you were talking about, whether it was really about the European Union, but there is no doubt that the budget was the subject.
Â Â  Mr President, it may be that the best thing one can do for democracy is to remain objective about things with which one disagrees, and that is what I shall try to do, as the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not in agreement with every aspect of the proposals.
There were two that it highlighted: the first had to do with the trans-European networks, where, in a desire to send a signal about enlargement, the commitment appropriations were increased.
I see that as a positive sign for, after all, the expenditure must be commensurate with the projects.
The second point of disagreement concerned agencies, where the situation is, as we see it, far more difficult, for, whether in relation to safety, or to transport by road, air, sea or rail, there are many areas in which a political agreement has been reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
When, though, it comes to allocating the necessary funding, this does not â astonishingly enough â always apply.
For that reason, where these agencies are concerned, the question arises in our minds as to whether personnel costs really belong there, because they eat into the operational appropriations, or whether the personnel appropriations ought to go somewhere else.
I do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now.
The other point I would make deals with very important areas.
Of course we are glad that, in the area of measures to combat marine pollution, which was envisaged and proposed by the Council to be a zero entry, a token entry, there are now some funds available after all, so that we can at least explain to the outside world that we now have not only the political will, but also the means, to intervene in that area.
It will be for the future to show whether the EURÂ 17 million will be enough, after we proposed far in excess of EURÂ 20 million.
The same applies in the case of rail and air transport.
There is evidence from these agencies that they cannot do the job properly with the funds allocated to them, and so the warning from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that we cannot wait for the next disaster before adjusting the resources in line with the facts of the situation.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to refer to two aspects of this debate.
The first is the references to agencies and to bioterrorism, and I link those two because part of the bioterrorism work is done through the new Centre for Disease Control which has now been established in Sweden.
One of the complaints of this paper is that these have not been adequately funded, so that there is uncertainty about how they are to operate.
Our citizens believe that Europe is very often engaged in spending money on activities that are less than necessary.
There are some activities which they believe are fundamentally necessary.
Their safety is at the heart of that and it is in our interests and our responsibility to ensure that they are properly funded.
Therefore, I hope that in future the Commission and my colleagues in this House will ensure that agencies dealing with issues such as food safety, medicines control and evaluation and disease control and prevention are properly dealt with.
The second aspect relates to the work which lies ahead on vaccines and support for developing countries.
We know how important they are â I myself have produced a report on the health threats to the countries of the developing world.
We know that vaccination campaigns have been effective, but much more that can be done.
In the last four years some 35 million children have been vaccinated â for example against hepatitis B â but millions of children are at risk and dying because adequate funds are not available.
I very much welcome what is being done to put money into the vaccine funds, and I hope we can continue in that direction, because that, again, makes a difference of which we can be proud.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, for the excellent cooperation.
Even though I am only moderately pleased with the end result, I do think he has done what he can in order to put the position of Parliament, but even more so the position of the European countryside, in perspective.
I feel the same way about the Dutch Presidency, and this brings me directly to my major disappointment about this Budget.
With this agreement, we are ultimately nearly one billion under the correct estimate and the Commission proposal about what is needed.
I know that the Dutch Presidency has played a positive role in itself in order to prevent this in part, but I am disappointed greatly with the rest of the Council, where the last Commission proposal was eventually not followed.
Which surprises me if I consider the position of Europeâs countryside, if I consider the major agricultural reform that has now started and which will result in sometimes drastic drops in income, but it also surprises me if I consider the enormous programme for rural development that we need to introduce as yet in the ten new Member States.
Given these circumstances, economising to that extent is unacceptable, certainly if we realise that agricultural spending will be around 0.4% of the GNP next year.
That is exceptionally little if we see that European agriculture and horticulture meet the worldâs strictest standards in terms of the environment, animal welfare, landscape protection, food security and food safety.
Anyone who wants a cheap ride could get a nasty surprise.
We cannot go on like this.
I hope that this will not lead to further cuts in the agricultural budget, but that we will continue to fight for competitive agriculture, even in Europe.
In that respect, I should like to say two things to the UK Independence Party Members and Non-attached Members in response to their expressions of blame directed towards European agricultural policy.
I can tell them that the United Kingdom receives a disproportionately large share from the agricultural budget.
My own country represents 7% of production and only receives 2% of the money.
In the United Kingdom, the exact reverse is true.
Without this Parliament, the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom would not have reached a satisfactory conclusion.
If these gentlemen can do nothing but make disparaging remarks, they have failed to get the message, including in the British countryside, and they are leaving the British countryside firmly out in the cold.
In any event, Parliament, and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are keeping an eye on the British countryside.
Â Â  The citizens of Europe are the judges of our actions.
I believe that this budget compromise allows us to confidently look them in the eye, as it provides us with the means to reach our goals.
But will the resources described in budget 2005 be sufficient for the long term?
We understand that a state budget deficit makes governments try to minimise expenditure.
However, if expenditure falls below a certain level, it becomes pointless: if goals remain dreams, then every euro spent will just be thrown down the drain.
The current budget is not like this yet, but we should put a lot more effort into certain areas in order for our enterprises to be competitive on a worldwide scale and in order to help cohesion countries to catch up with other states sooner.
We must pay attention to the fact that this compromise, which I support, expends a lot less money than what was planned at the 1990 budgetary cycle.
The question arises now at the time of planning a new cycle: what is the point in setting goals for the distant future, or giving numbers for several years ahead, if we do not fulfil them?
We, who lived under Soviet domination, lived and experienced what it meant to construct five-year plans from gratuitous numbers.
I would like to see the Union avoiding these pitfalls, I have faith it will, and I support next yearâs budget.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to apologise yet again for not being at the conciliation meeting, which was a very lengthy and hard-fought affair.
I pay tribute to the new Commissioner, and particularly the minister, who was in charge.
I heard reports that the Council of Ministers was at one in its stance on what the level of spending should be.
As someone from the United Kingdom â although not of the same political party as the government â I very much welcome its statement, together with that of five other countries, that there should be no level of spending above one per cent of GNI or GDP.
I am delighted that the outcome of this conciliation was exactly that.
As regards the agencies, more thought needs to be given to the question of their income in the future.
I welcome the move away from in-house activity, away from the Commission and into arms-length agencies; but these have mushroomed, which is a sign of their success.
We now need to look at how much more income they can achieve from outside sources instead of just being given grant-in-aid or subsidies from this Parliament.
I speak here as someone who was chief executive of the National Building Agency in the United Kingdom.
We had to turn around very quickly from being 85 per cent supported by grants or subsidies to being wholly self-supporting.
It can be done. However, I am not saying the change needs to be that vicious.
Finally, with regard to structural funding, the very sensible agreement that was reached, namely, to reduce the spend in 2005 but to have an arrangement in readiness agreed by all parties that a supplementary and amending budget could be brought in at any time, means both that we have control over what is happening in 2005 and that reasons have to be shown why we need real spend in 2006.
Â Â  Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion for the report of the Committee on Agriculture, I regret the arbitrary cuts decided on by the Council of Ministers in spending on common agricultural policy subsidies for 2005.
This is a cut of no more and no less than EUR 1 billion, compared to the European Commissionâs preliminary draft budget, an unprecedented decision, taken, furthermore, within the key context of the debate on the European Unionâs future financial perspectives.
I condemn the flippancy with which the Council of Ministers has adopted this decision because it jeopardises the funding of agricultural subsidies for next year, which are the consequence of a formal commitment by the Member States to the European Union's farmers.
The Council's decision leaves the management of common agricultural policy subsidies in a precarious situation, and this will oblige the Commission to apply spending discipline which could lead it to commit more than one injustice.
There has been mention of the possibility of later on introducing the amending budget to patch up the holes in the 2005 agriculture budget, although so far we do not know where those necessary resources are going to come from.
It is clear that the countries in favour of reducing the contributions to the Community budget have won the first battle, because the Council of Ministers has unanimously supported this cut.
This unanimity also included my country.
Nobody has dared to question this decision, which, furthermore, takes no account of the opinion of this House.
At first reading the European Parliament re-established the European Commission's preliminary draft budget, an initiative which has been completely ignored by the Council of Ministers, the only body with decision-making powers with regard to obligatory spending.
The cut in agricultural spending for 2005 is simply a forerunner of what could happen from 2007, when the European Commission will have to present a report to assess whether or not it is necessary to introduce cuts in the unit sums of the direct aid received by European farmers.
Unfortunately, the European Parliamentâs voice has not been taken into account on this occasion.
I would, therefore, like to call on this House to try to prevent this situation from recurring next year.
Â Â  MrÂ President, just like MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, I am somewhat confused about the speaking arrangements.
I am speaking in this House as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development on the Budget and should in fairness have been allowed to speak at the beginning.
I wish to congratulate MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo on his very skilful work, for his considerable sensitivity to views from the various committees and, in general, for his efficient handling of our deliberations.
As current representative of the Committee on Development, I am delighted with the result.
By making full use of the flexibility mechanism, we have been able to avoid significantly cutting back on long-term development programmes in order to make room for Iraq.
I genuinely agree with MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra that we must find a long-term solution to the problem that, in general, arises every year in connection with major disasters and crises.
We must protect our long-term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the millennium objectives.
When it comes to the specific focus in heading 4, I am very pleased to have gained a hearing for the demand that the budget be more clearly oriented towards poverty alleviation.
This is happening through the increase of EURÂ 30Â million in the appropriation to efforts within Asia, where the vast majority of the worldâs poor live.
It is also happening through the increase in efforts in the area of health.
More resources are being earmarked for the work on reducing the spread of HIV, malaria and TB.
As MrÂ Bowis emphasised just now, a new programme to the tune of EURÂ 10Â million is also being set up to combat other poverty-related diseases, with a special emphasis on vaccinations for young children.
Far greater resources are needed in the area of health, especially in Africa.
The contributions we are now deciding upon mean that we are continuing single-mindedly to work with a view to increasing support for the health sector within the sphere of aid, and that is an entirely proper road to go down.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me start by thanking Members of Parliament for their interesting remarks.
My first remark is in response to what Mrs TrÃŒpel and Mr Wurtz said.
It is absolutely clear that I am speaking here not on behalf of the net contributors, the 'one per cent group', or the government of the Netherlands, but on behalf of the Council.
The Council was unanimously in favour of budgetary discipline.
It was also unanimously in favour of only a slight increase in payment appropriations, taking into account the needs of an enlarged Union.
This brings me to concerns expressed by Mr Ferber, Mr Wurtz and Mr Maat about the level of payment appropriations not being enough for all the needs in 2005.
The Council's second reading is based on the principle of budgetary discipline.
The Council was united in believing that the level of payment appropriations was of prime importance.
This is why the Council showed an example by reducing compulsory expenditure in the field of agriculture.
In our global agreement, the payment appropriations are EURÂ 1 billion higher than the Council's estimate of what is necessary to fulfil the obligations in 2005.
According to the Commission, which has to implement the budget, the agreed maximum amount is sufficient.
Equally important is the fact that the Council will take up its responsibility if it turns out that payment appropriations are insufficient.
The Council has proved that this is not a hollow phrase: it provided additional payments for structural measures this year, as you know.
We have committed ourselves to doing this in just one reading for any additional funding needed, as Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ mentioned.
It was interesting to hear Mr Ferber's question on the results in conciliation with regard to the additional funds for 2005.
He forgot to mention the EURÂ 10Â billion that we got back unspent in 2003.
In conclusion, I agree with Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ that they were tough negotiations.
I would like to thank her, the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets for their constructive role in the negotiations.
The result is what counts, and it is a good compromise.
I very much agree with Mr Garriga Polledo, who said it is not a win-lose situation, it is a win-win situation: there is room for both budgetary discipline and political priorities.
At the end of the day it is a win-win situation for European citizens.
Â Â  â I do not think that the Commission wishes to intervene again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  âThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union, on the preparation of the next financial framework.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Prodi Commission left us with two communications: one on the general framework for the 2007-2015 budget and another on the legal bases for the policies which must be funded.
The Council of Ministers has already begun working on an committee, as its representative, Mr NicolaÃ¯, has told us, and we in the European Parliament have created a temporary committee, which it is my honour to chair, which has already produced a series of documents and within which our rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, is doing very considerable work on making Parliament's position coherent.
We are all, therefore, aware of the importance of this task, which must serve to establish the political priorities and define the budgetary resources available to the Union during 2007-2013.
Everybody knows â though I must remind you of it â that without the agreement of Parliament there will be no financial perspectives.
Without the agreement of Parliament it will not be possible to reach an interinstitutional agreement which does not appear in the Treaty.
Parliament wishes to reach an agreement within the time limit laid down in the timetable, but it wants a good agreement, and in order to achieve one, certain issues must be clarified straightaway.
Firstly, we need to know whether the current Commission officially accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission.
It is true that you, Commissioner, have already told us in the meeting of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means, that the Commission headed by Mr Barroso directly accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission.
Shortly afterwards, however, leaks and comments have appeared in the media suggesting that the Commission intends, or at least accepts, not going as far as the proposals produced by the Prodi Commission.
This is the time for you, Commissioner, here in Parliament, in the absence of the President of the Commission, formally to tell us, in your opinion, the level of resources Europe needs in order to fulfil its ambitions.
It would also be good if you could explain to us which income structures you believe are most appropriate in order for the Union to be able to confront its current and future needs.
Secondly, it would also be a good thing for us to explore what would happen in the event that certain Member States prevent an agreement from being reached within the relevant time limit.
Would the Commission then be prepared to provide for the transitional provisions necessary to ensure the continuity of multi-annual programmes in the absence of a framework agreement on the financial perspectives?
As you know, Parliament has already expressed its preference with regard to the duration of these financial perspectives.
We believe that five years is preferable since it is more in line with the duration of the terms in office of Parliament and of the Commission.
Commissioner, Mr President, by creating a Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means and appointing its own President as chairman of that committee, which is not normal, this Parliament wished to give a clear demonstration of its interest and political commitment to a process which is so sensitive and essential to the future of Europe.
We know that we are facing some very important challenges.
How to fund the enlargement we have just carried out.
How to confront the enlargements which are on the horizon and which will undoubtedly take place within the framework of the future financial perspectives.
How to ensure that Europeâs increasing role in the world is backed up with sufficient economic resources.
How to realise the policies which will make Europe what we always call, when speaking of Lisbon, the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world.
All of this must be included in the budget, because what is not in the budget does not exist, as Finance Ministers say.
The expression may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but we know that, in order for certain things to exist, they must first appear in the budgets.
Commissioner, Mr President, the Barroso Commission has been confirmed by means of a very broad vote of confidence from this House.
This is the time for you to demonstrate that you are not simply mediators between Parliament and the Council, but that you are able to show strong political leadership.
The financial perspectives offer a great opportunity to demonstrate this.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we set to work on the basis of the Communication and the proposals from the Commission.
In order to be able to press on with our work, we do of course need answers to the questions that this Houseâs President has just addressed.
In fact, Commissioner, there are plenty of discussions and rumours afoot, and perhaps todayâs debate will help clarify matters.
For example, you told a meeting of the Temporary Committee that the agriculture policy was a relic of the nineteenth century.
If that is the case, why is there no proposal from the Commission to change it?
Or does it not after all contribute something to the Lisbon strategy and to sustainability, in view of the current state of play where decisions on agricultural reform are concerned?
Commissioner Verheugen has said that, in order to make a success of Lisbon, we need more responsibility and greater commitment from the Member States, but we see it as also involving the question of added value for Europe, of whether Lisbon is meant to implement the Budget more vigorously, particularly in connection with the programmes that bring Europe added value, in research and the multiannual education programmes.
Then, we hear reports of internal discussions even at this early stage about the possibility of moving away from the 1.14%, and then someone puts forward the idea that 1.06%, or 1.07%, would be a workable compromise, so let me, as rapporteur, make it perfectly clear that nobody in the other institutions should imagine that Parliament is prepared to negotiate below the margins set as a network by Article 272 of the Treaty.
Let me add that this is without taking account of the European Development Fund, which adds another 0.03% and has, for the first time, been included in the figure of 1.14% in the Commission proposal and hence also in the Budget.
Commissioner, you described a crisis situation featuring all the things that can happen if agreement fails to be achieved.
We want agreement, and that is why, yet again today, we insist on a monthly trilogue capable of ensuring that difficult chapters are not left to be dealt with at the end of the procedure, but rather that issues of flexibility, duration of the Financial Perspective and many points of substance can be discussed in good time and considered jointly as part of a permanent dialogue between the institutions.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am supposed to say that officially I am responding on behalf of the Commission to four questions from Parliament, but I received a lot more. I will try to answer them as well as giving the 'official' response.
I must say at the outset that in the Commission there are no internal discussions on ceilings other than the official proposal that was presented to you and to the Council.
Despite media rumours, this is not a subject for discussion in the Commission.
Now the 'official' response to the first question: does the new Commission endorse the structure of the new financial perspective?
Yes, the enlarged European Union faces new challenges and needs to meet new expectations.
We need to update the structure of our financial perspectives to better reflect these new priorities.
This entails a new classification of expenditure to give a new profile for the Union's finances.
This more limited number of expenditure headings reflects the Union's main priorities, making them more visible to European citizens and rationalising expenditure accordingly.
This Commission endorses the same priorities, i.e. transforming the European Union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy, pursuing greater cohesion in the context of the enlargement of the European Union, preserving and managing the European Union's natural resources â including agriculture, fisheries and the environment â and developing the area of freedom, security and justice and the role of the Union as a global partner.
The proposals before us reflect the needs of the Union, firstly because these priorities identify and represent a common consensus about where Europe must intensify its actions.
Secondly, the proposed structure also offers a real step towards simplification and rationalisation, which was welcomed by Parliament in its resolution of 22 April.
Finally, the proposals have already allowed both the Council and Parliament to have substantial discussions and prepare the ground for an agreement next year.
The second question: does the new Commission endorse the duration of the financial programmes which will commit the next Commission and the next European Parliament?
Let me assure you that the Commission is fully aware of Parliament's position â which was also expressed in the resolution of 22 April â in which it calls for a financial framework to be established for a period of only five years.
However, we looked into this question and concluded that for the next programming period, seven years would be the best solution because the ceiling for market-related expenditure and direct payments â in agriculture, for example â has already been fixed by the European Council until 2013.
A seven-year timetable also maximises the benefits of long-term planning, in particular in cohesion policies.
The third question: does the new Commission endorse all the proposals in what is known as the 'Prodi package', or does it consider that it should be readjusted and, if so, on which issues?
As I said earlier, we endorse all the proposals.
The Commission stands by the package proposed earlier this year.
We do not call it by that name: it is the Commission's proposal and we endorse that proposal, namely the proposed financial framework, complemented by a series of legislative and non-legislative proposals adopted between February and September 2004.
They have been submitted to the Council and to various committees of this Parliament.
The Commission foresees the adoption of the remaining necessary proposals early next year.
The political project which underpins the financial perspectives is based on a number of well-established priorities on which a consensus already exists between the European institutions on the number of commitments already made, for example on agriculture, enlargement, Lisbon, etc. Building on this, the Commission is now also preparing its five-year strategic objectives, which will be presented to Parliament by the end of January 2005.
The Commission believes that the proposals constitute a good basis for an agreement for the next financial perspective.
To reach such an agreement the Commission will be taking an active part in the discussions and negotiations that will take place with the European Parliament and the Council.
In this context, the Commission will take fully into account the key points of the discussion and will strive to reach a political agreement by the end of June 2005.
The fourth question: is the Commission ready to take account of other institutions' priorities?
The answer is yes.
The Commission will of course take careful account of Parliament's position in relation to the initiatives already proposed and in view of those that will arrive in 2005.
The package is already based on a very broad consensus about where actions are required, in the light of European Parliament resolutions, European Council conclusions and, indeed, discussions within the Commission.
The forthcoming discussions on the Commission's strategic objectives are directly linked to this, and the Commission attaches considerable importance to the establishment of common priorities.
The Constitution will mean a codified multiannual financial framework, and I would like a common vision for the next programming period to be our first step on this path.
I would like to make two brief points in finalising the official answer to the question tabled.
First, I wish to remind you of what President Barroso has said in this House: the European Union needs to match its political ambition with its financial resources.
Increased spending has been proposed because, with enlargement and with a demand for action in new areas, it was inevitable.
We cannot have a larger European Union with less money.
Secondly, I underline the Commission's strong commitment to the need to respect the target of a political agreement by June 2005 and the adoption of legislative proposals by the end of that year.
The Irish and Netherlands presidencies have achieved considerable progress during their respective terms in the Council.
We all need to sustain the momentum and actively support the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency to achieve political agreement by the end of its term.
The Commission wishes the presidency well in the task of achieving the goals which will be useful for all European citizens.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for the first response you have just given us.
In so doing, you have confirmed what you said to our Temporary Committee and the Committee on Budgets.
In short, I have to say that your response does not altogether satisfy us since it amounts to saying that the new Commission is adopting the previous Commissionâs proposals without examining them in detail, and that it believes that the ball is now in Parliamentâs and the European Councilâs courts.
We are in fact looking to the Commission to show not the passive attitude of a mediator but the leadership of a political executive strong in the confidence massively expressed by Parliament scarcely a month ago, to quote President Borrell.
It is all the more necessary and urgent that the new Commission should adopt a strong position now that initial soundings of all concerned in the Council have revealed that, for the first time, some Member States are proposing to cut the relative amount of the present budget, as MrÂ BÃ¶ge said.
Thus, the Commissioner for industry is saying publicly that there are currently 27 priorities for the Lisbon strategy and that they should be combined into one.
Will that not be reflected in the budget?
You say there has been no debate in the Commission over the proposed amount for the ceiling of own resources.
When will that debate take place?
In what areas would financial sacrifices be inescapable for the Commission if this resources ceiling were not obtained?
Can the proposals made by MrÂ Prodi reasonably be financed on the basis of the present system of European Union financing, or does the Commission believe that negotiations should cover income as well as expenditure?
Finally, what provisional measures should be taken, and when, if, as seems highly likely, the Council fails to reach a consensus before the process of ratifying the Constitution is completed?
As you have reminded us, President Barroso says we cannot have more Europe for less money.
How much money does the policy proposed by President Barroso require?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking today in my capacity as my groupâs coordinator in the Committee on Regional Development, which has the second largest individual budget to deal with, as the budget for cohesion and structural policy, with a 35% share, is second only in size to the budget for agriculture.
Alongside the tasks we have to perform in dealing with the Financial Perspective, the specialist committees and most especially the Committee on Regional Development have the task of preparing the relevant Regulations for each Fund for the new financial period of 2007 to 2013.
I see the anchoring of this cohesion and structural policy, including in our Constitution, on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions, as creating very modern political approaches to the implementation of a European policy for the publicâs benefit.
What we in the Committee on Regional Development need for our work is a reliable statement and foundation, and both I and my group believe that only the Prodi proposal can fulfil that role.
I will permit myself the aside that I get the impression that regional policy appears to be used by everyone as a sort of piggy bank.
The Council does it by attempting to get a percentage accepted while a majority of its members want to make cuts because agriculture has already ground to a halt.
Having seen the way you, Commissioner, deal with the Committee on Budgets and the temporary committee on the political challenges and Budget resources for the enlarged EU between 2007 and 2013, I can say that the Commission does too, calling ever more frequently for a Financial Perspective.
I get the impression that the second half of that sentence is missing: âwhether that Perspective be good or badâ.
That is something we cannot afford.
The attempt is made ever more frequently to use structural policy measures to fund other things; the example I would give is the way in which the funding of Natura 2000 is being removed from the environmental sector and moved to structural policy.
Let me also say, though, that regional policy was necessary in the old EU of 15 Member States, and it is necessary in the new one, with its 25.
We need efficiency, but we cannot afford it to happen that drastic cuts in this area punish a large part of the population for something that we all wanted and that the European Union always has made tangible and accessible to millions of citizens.
Commissioner, you said that the newspapers report only failures.
In Germany, we have a saying to the effect that there is no smoke without fire.
That is why debates about 1.05% or 1.06% are not helpful.
Let me remind you that the European Union has always worked well when the Commission has strengthened Parliament and vice versa.
We can negotiate well together, whether the Council is on the same side or our opponent.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were very pleased to see that the Prodi Commission attached such great importance to the Lisbon objectives when it presented its draft financial estimates.
We also note that improved competitiveness and increased growth in Europe are among the things that are genuinely high on the Barroso Commissionâs agenda and have been so right from the start.
That is something we have also seen following the clear observations made by MrÂ Barroso today here in plenary.
I therefore think it only natural to ask the Commission whether it will face the implications of its sharp focus on the Lisbon objectives and amend the Prodi Commissionâs proposal.
Is there anywhere it will allocate more resources to improve competitiveness and to create increased growth and more jobs?
Are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework?
Is there to be more focus upon growth-oriented policy areas?
Are there things to be dispensed with?
What we have here is a large complex of legislation and proposals.
I appreciate that what exists at present forms the point of departure, but it might however be interesting to hear whether there is anything to which more weight is to be given and whether there are any negative priorities.
If there are to be priorities, where are the cutbacks to be made first?
When we in Parliament debate the financial estimates, we do not focus upon an expenditure ceiling, as some countries in the Council do.
We do not wish to become tied up in the Councilâs blinkered discussions of 1% or whatever.
I am pleased that, in this House today, you have said that percentages are not being discussed in the Commission either â at any rate, not at the moment.
We must not talk about quantity, but quality.
Parliament must therefore call upon the Commission to preserve a stoical calm and first of all discuss the content of EU policy.
We can discuss budget ceilings subsequently.
We now have a unique opportunity to consider what we want, as well as what we want the future EU to look like between 2007 and 2013, and that is an opportunity we must not waste.
As far as my own group is concerned, it is important to have the focus on research, to strengthen the common research programmes and perhaps even to consider creating a fund for basic research that can strengthen research in future technologies such as nanotechnology, allowing the EU also to be a key player.
We must consider obtaining increased benchmarking of our universities in Europe in terms of a fair comparison of who does what best on a cross-border basis, and we must create healthy competition.
We must look at our training programmes and see whether they take account of needs in the new Member States where, for example, many students cannot afford to travel and learn new things.
Again, it may be asked: âHave we obtained the correct focus in what we now have?â
This, clearly, is the debate in which we in Parliament shall engage and on which we shall work.
That being said, the big battle will clearly centre upon regional policy.
It is regional policy that is the difficult area.
When you attended the hearings here in Parliament, you were courageous enough to express the view that some of the new countries were probably able to absorb more than 4% of gross domestic product.
I shall be interested to hear whether you still hold that view, MrsÂ Grybauskaite, once you are Commissioner.
In this area too, we shall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to create quality rather than just look to quantity.
What we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is therefore crucial, and we appreciate, of course, that this is quite a difficult subject, including for the Council.
I hope that we can obtain a constructive dialogue and a monthly trialogue, for it is important for us to go on discussing these matters.
It is quite a package that we have here.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regards the Commission proposals as a sound basis for negotiations between Parliament and the Council.
I understand that you now want to refer to it as the Barroso package instead of the Prodi package.
That is fine with me.
After all, I am concerned with content.
I very much welcome 1.14% of the GDP for investments in the Lisbon strategy, for money for an economic incentive in the poorer regions and for reinforcing the EUâs role in the world.
My group is also critical of your plans, though.
After all, the future generations, our children, appear to be getting a rough deal.
Investments in renewable, sustainable energy sources are inadequate, which is detrimental to the environment and is also feeding dependency on all kinds of dubious regimes in countries where oil flows in abundance.
There is no separate fund for Natura 2000, there are insufficient resources for improving the reception of refugees in the region and the increase in funds for culture and exchange programmes for young people is too small.
We would like to promote Europe a little less and ensure that people experience Europe a little more.
So, it is 1.14% âplusâ, as far as my group is concerned. That is, indeed, quite different from what many Member States say.
Some of those Member States still apply the 1% mantra.
Meanwhile, they have sneakily become more radical, because I noticed that they are meanwhile applying 1% in the commitment appropriations instead of in the payments, which have traditionally always been somewhat lower.
That would mean that up to 2013, we would have a budget that is lower than we have at present, while the European Union has enlarged.
All the while, we are busy making lists of ambitions.
The Member States do not all follow the same view.
The cuts in agriculture and the structural funds are, in fact, very controversial.
A child will therefore realise that those will mainly remain intact in the major negotiations.
Where will the cuts be made?
In the funds for research, development, human rights, the environment, external policy and culture. Precisely those areas that are close to peopleâs hearts and that are given a visible added value if they are implemented at European level.
A budget that is borne out of euroscepticism will only feed that euroscepticism even more.
In that way, we will retain a Europe that is mainly focused on the market and the currency, and that is heading absolutely the wrong way.
I agree with Mr Lamassoure, who states that we need more active leadership from the Commission.
If we really want â and that is what we uphold, after all â that Europe is a Europe that is united in diversity, we will need to actively invest in this.
I would also like to call on the Commission to use us, because they do not know our position yet.
We may be arguing in favour of 1.5%, because we are far more ambitious than the Member States.
With 1.14%, the Commission will therefore be treading a middle path.
I therefore hope that you will gain the strategic insight to dispel all the smoke that is continuously being created and which we think may be indicative of a small fire â you may have dropped 1.07% somewhere in secret after all.
We urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe.
Show your leadership.
Prove it in the negotiations, for that is the only way of creating a Europe that is not the old Europe of the market and of the currency, but a Europe that takes people and the environment to heart.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the Unionâs Financial Perspective ought to be a debate on the future of Europe.
The decade 2004-2013 will be characterised by the accession of 12 new countries.
The Union needs to decide whether it is going to promote the unification of Europe and equality of opportunity, or whether it is to create divisions and heighten inequalities.
Research establishmentscivic society, entrepreneurs and others ought to contribute to the debate on the future of Europe, not just politicians.
Unfortunately, the Union is not in favour of a public debate of this kind.
Instead, the future of Europe is being decided in remote offices.
Bureaucrats and politicians are taking the decisions on tasks and resources, and they also decide how to allocate funds and on the amounts involved.
In the meantime, Parliament is busy debating minor issues together with the possibility of broadening its competences.
Even if Parliamentâs competences were to be increased, there will be no time to prepare our own draft budget tackling two major issues, namely how to speed up the pace of economic development and how to reduce the differences between richer and poorer regions of Europe.
A new budget is required, however, as the Commissionâs draft runs counter to the notion of solidarity and is not conducive to speeding up the development of Europe.
This is true both of the proposals and the sums referred to therein.
The best example I could mention is the fact that the countries of the old Fifteen, which are all rich, are to receive in excess of EURÂ 194Â billion from the Cohesion Fund, whilst the ten new Member States and Romania and Bulgaria are only due to receive EURÂ 180Â billion.
It is also worth remembering that a significant proportion of the second sum will end up in the richer countries, in the form of order and of payments to advisers and experts.
In our view, the European Parliament ought to come up with its own draft budget.
This should either be undertaken in opposition to the Commission and the Council, or in cooperation with them.
This budget would be based on three principles.
The first of these is that the greater the Union, the greater the budget.
The second is that the greater the differences in development, the more funding should go to less-developed regions and Member States.
The third principle is that tax and investment concessions are required, as are other appropriate measures for the benefit of less-developed regions and countries.
Â Â  Mr President, if you perhaps try to explain what this is all about to a young female citizen of the European Union and to a middle-aged male one, do you not inevitably end up making comparisons with the Soviet Union and telling them that we are dealing with a seven-year plan rather than a five-year one?
Is it not the case that the decision-making machinery is very much comparable to that which then operated in Moscow, with the difference that lobbyists are now involved?
And if you turn it around and tell them that you understand the European publicâs need for money, and then consider the priorities and say: right, I really do want to double the education budget; I do want to double the research budget â how, then, my dear Commissioner, do you make that transparent?
How do you set it out?
If you do not manage to make it clear what we need all this money for, public support will certainly be denied to you, and Europe will slide even closer to the brink of disaster.
Â Â  The President of the European Commission made certain comments last week â and a colleague has pointed this out today â to the effect that more Europe cannot be created with less money.
Today, Commissioner, you have confirmed that the current Commission is maintaining the proposal of the previous Commission.
I would add â to those people who are constantly claiming to be Europeanists â that less money means the renationalisation of the cohesion policy, which is equivalent to less Europe.
Nevertheless, the Commission will probably soon propose amendments depending on how the negotiations develop. And I am sure that the Commissionâs proposals will be based on the principle of balance.
I would, therefore, like to ask the European Commission to review the aspects of its proposal which could lead to unfair results because of their lack of balance, Commissioner. Because I believe that to a certain extent that is what is happening at this point in the negotiations.
In order to provide material for this debate â either endorsing it or rejecting it â I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the information available to it on the impact on the fifteen Member States of the costs of enlargement â which, of course, is absolutely essential â because the intention to pay for the convergence requirements of our new partners at the expense of solidarity with the countries and regions of the existing States would be profoundly anti-European and harmful to our shared future.
I shall end by expressing my support for the European Commission, provided that it maintains the Cohesion Policy as a fundamental pillar of European integration.
Â Â  Mr President, the Prodi multiannual financial package is now referred to as the Barroso multiannual financial package, as long as it is based on 1.14%, although to me, 1%, 1.14%, 1.24% ... is not of the essence.
The real debate is about the question whether we are prepared to actually pay for the political priorities included in the new European Constitution.
It is a case of putting your money where your mouth is, therefore.
It is precisely in that area that our citizens have seen European leadership fail too often.
I have six observations to make.
The first is that Europe must be a social Europe, but in most countries, private and public investments in education and research are trailing behind.
The cuts are harsh at 3%, but there is not enough room for extra investments in research and education.
The golden rule is not an option in the Stability Pact.
Secondly, we are not prepared to make the real switch from agricultural subsidy to rural and environmental policy for the sake of internal social cohesion and our priority, which is knowledge.
This would create actual room for knowledge innovation in the countryside and in the urban areas, with priority being given to the ten new acceding countries.
In Europe, we say in the Constitution that we want Europe to have a central role in the world.
At present, one in five people across the globe have no access to education or health care.
We talk about millennium objectives and about 2015, but what we see are, in fact, levels of spending by the EU Member States and by the EU itself that are far below par in this respect, despite resolutions by this House.
We want the Commissionâs new plans and the Commission communication about development policy to be given priority in January, with broad backing from Parliament, for these millennium objectives in Heading 4: 35% for the millennium objectives and 20% for basic education and basic health care.
Mr Borrell was right in saying that if it is not in the budget, then it does not exist.
That, then, is why we want it.
The fourth is that bad European leadership is at its most prominent in external policy, with major decisions, but no funding.
We want a Middle East policy overnight, and we get the funding from the budget to fight poverty in Africa.
We want a new neighbourhood policy.
All well and good, but the money is once again taken from the budget to fight poverty in Asia and Central America.
Each objective deserves its own budget.
We should not have to shift funding around.
The fifth is that we want national fraud and accountant certification bureaus in order to guarantee swift and fraud-proof implementation and subsequent approval in each country.
We are still far too vulnerable on that score.
Sixthly and finally, the public wants to see that each country makes a fair contribution to the combined European budget according to its own capacity.
If that is 1% or 1.15%, so be it; as long as it is done according to the capacity and the means of each country.
Equal shares.
That applies to the Netherlands as well as to other countries.
Only then will we receive the support of our European citizens for a truly serious policy.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Unionâs new financial framework is probably the biggest issue that Parliament has to resolve this term.
It is not just the volume of EU funding that is at issue, but what future action is to consist of in general.
The first serious disagreement among the Member States concerns the extent of financing.
The Commissionâs proposal is based on the payment appropriations, which on average would amount to 1.14% of GDP.
The proposal by six countries for a ceiling on expenditure of 1% is a stringent one.
It does not even reflect the extent of next yearâs budget, although the transition phase for the new Member States is only just starting.
A call has now been made for joint liability.
Will it end when it is a matter of money?
Another problem is the call for a rebate on contributions by the largest net contributors, known as the âgeneralised correction mechanismâ.
That does not seem fair, as these same Member States also benefit most from the single market.
The Commissionâs proposal puts great emphasis on improving employment and competitiveness.
In my opinion, that is absolutely the right focus.
There have already been enough resolutions.
Industry and enterprise cannot succeed if there is no serious research and development work.
On the other hand, research is so expensive that no Member State on its own can compete, for example, with the United States of America or Japan.
For that reason, European cooperation is needed.
We already have examples of this in the fields of space technology and particle research.
The creation of new research programmes must be based on the premise that they will focus on projects that call for Europe-wide cooperation.
They must not be allowed to become bureaucratic Structural Funds programmes, the like of which we have now.
There must also be more substantial production of training courses in connection with programmes of research.
It is very important that we should agree on the future financial framework next year.
Then we would avoid the sort of mess we saw at the start of the Agenda 2000 programme, which was delayed, resulting in serious delays in the drafting of several programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, in my one minute of speaking time I shall focus on regional policy and specifically the risk that there may not be a regional policy for some states after the conclusion of the negotiations on the financial perspectives.
Commissioner, I welcome your commitment to the original Commission proposals, although we have heard from other sources that the Commission â somewhere â is preparing for alternative outcomes.
I would ask you to consider publishing what analysis you have carried out of alternative outcomes of the financial perspectives.
That would be particularly helpful to the debate within our own nation-states.
My own country, the UK â as opposed to my own nation, Scotland â is putting forward a position that is as unconstructive as it is unclear.
An objective analysis of what the UK position would mean in terms of numbers and political ramifications would be a hugely helpful contribution to the debate.
The UK contribution to the debate thus far, with its position on the UK rebate, the statistical effect, the nationalisation of structural funds and the limiting of the EU budget to one per cent of GNI is nothing less than a cumulative act of vandalism.
An objective analysis of this contribution from the Commission would be a very helpful debating tool for us in the United Kingdom.
Â Â  Madam President, the long-term financial perspective is an important document.
It will place a restriction on the annual budgets right up until 2013.
This will be crucial to choices of areas and to how great a commitment the EU can assume during the next seven to eight years.
In recent days, the Commission has presented its view of the long-term budget.
The new Commission has taken over the old Commissionâs proposal, or what is known as the Prodi package. This means a significant rise in expenditure.
In the case of some countries, it is a question of a 50% real increase.
That is something I find unacceptable.
My view is that the new Commission should have listened more closely to the views of the six largest net contributors.
They demanded that the financial perspective should include an expenditure ceiling of 1% of gross national income.
There should be a ceiling not only for payments, but also for commitments.
It is not acceptable, as the Commission proposes, to allow the commitments to proliferate to 1.27% of gross national income.
That is the upper limit that the Members have undertaken to pay.
After 2013, there will be no way of expanding over and above general economic growth unless all the countries agree to give up their right of veto.
That is not something I believe they will do.
The Commission therefore proposes that the EU introduce some form of EU tax.
We are definitely and strongly opposed to the EUâs being given its own right of taxation.
Without monitoring by the individual Member States, there is no limit upon the EUâs ambition to grow into a federal superstate.
Each Member State should allow its parliament to vote on the EUâs financial perspective before the Council of Ministers takes its decision so that the decision is not taken secretly but openly and clearly, with people aware of the financial commitments they will assume.
So that the national parliaments might be provided with a sound basis for their decisions, the Commission should prepare a draft alternative perspective contained within the 1% expenditure ceiling we have proposed.
There is otherwise a palpable risk of the Commissionâs ultimately being forced into ill thought-out cutbacks in expenditure and commitments, instead of having properly considered prioritising that makes it possible to keep the promises made to the new countries.
Â Â  The debate will now be suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time, with questions to the Commission (B6-136/2004).
Â Â  . The recent case of contamination demonstrated that the European Community already has the necessary integrated legislation to manage such situations in a suitable manner.
That is why the question of additional measures is not being raised, at least not for the moment, the question being the need to apply existing measures correctly.
Programmes for monitoring dioxins and PCBs in food and feedingstuffs are applied throughout the European Union.
Î€hese programmes have allowed the Dutch authorities to identify the contamination and take suitable measures to exterminate its source.
There are monitoring and identification systems for identifying the undertakings and livestock units which may have been contaminated.
In order to prevent the introduction of possibly contaminated food and feedingstuffs into the food chain, the necessary containment measures have been taken for these installations.
The early warning system for food and feedingstuffs operated with particular efficiency as regards the exchange of information between the competent authorities.
The adoption by the European Union of upper limits for dioxins played a primary role in the management of this case of contamination.
It is indeed a legal tool for taking decisions which safeguard the protection of public health.
However, we must admit that it is not possible to totally exclude the possibility of contamination of the food chain.
The risk will always remain, which is why we have adopted the measures needed for us to identify and combat such risks.
It is, however, of immense importance to the protection of public health that contamination be identified in the early stages through monitoring and for us to have rules which prevent and avert further contamination of the food chain.
Current Community legislation already includes such provisions.
Nonetheless, the case of contamination which we are discussing today demonstrates the need to evaluate the safety not only of the ingredients of food and feedingstuffs, but also of the products which are used directly or indirectly in the preparation of food and feedingstuffs.
Food safety legislation stipulates that food and feedingstuff manufacturers are responsible for product safety.
The Commission will continue to emphasise this obligation to manufacturers and to monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent national agencies in order to safeguard compliance with current requirements.
Finally, as far as landfills are concerned, Community legislation has been adopted in order to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way which does not jeopardise human health or the environment.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, the necessary tools for managing risks and safeguarding public health are, on the one hand, the adoption of maximum limits for dioxins in feedingstuff substances, feedingstuffs and food at strict but feasible levels which will become stricter as time goes by and, on the other hand, the apportionment of responsibility at all stages of the food chain at which dioxins are identified.
However, the weak link in the chain for the success of this endeavour are the control mechanisms, especially in the feedingstuffs sector, where the link with public health is not directly perceived by citizens and awareness at production level is lower than with food.
This has also been proven by the fact that the root cause of recent major food problems has been dioxins in feedingstuffs.
What action do you intend to take to strengthen and fortify the existing model of feedingstuff control mechanisms so that controls at both European level and at the level of Member States are more efficient?
Â Â  . I should like to add that, as far as upper limits on dioxins are concerned, they have already been set and there are strict standards.
At the same time, emphasis has been placed throughout the food chain not only on the final product of feedingstuffs, but also on the production mechanism and, for this reason, the instruments used for production will also be controlled.
I should also like to inform the honourable Member that we shall soon be adopting a regulation on feedingstuff hygiene with the objective of laying down strict rules and the critical steps in the production process at which all hygiene rules will need to be adopted and I think that this will address the honourable Member's concerns.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Emissions Trading Directive does not contain any provisions relating to administrative charges.
The application and level of such charges are therefore matters for the national governments.
We know that Member States have adopted different approaches to charging for the issue of permits under Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control.
The authorities responsible for issuing permits incur costs, and each Member State is able to decide how it wants to finance those costs.
The Commission does not therefore have any estimates of the total level of administrative charges imposed on CO2 emitters.
I would also like to say that I am standing in for Mr Dimas, who sends his apologies because he is attending the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. As you know, it is a very important conference and he has asked me to stand in for him.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Would you not agree, though, that differing administrative charges considerably distort the internal market, and that this leads to varying competition conditions in individual Member States?
Would you also agree that, in certain Member States, the administrative charges are significantly higher than the administrative expenditure actually incurred, and that it may be necessary for the Commission to make improvements here to safeguard the internal market?
Â Â  . These charges may vary between Member States and be absent in some cases.
But this is no different from other taxes and charges that vary between Member States and have implications for companies.
In the end, it is a political decision for each Member State to take as to whether it wants to finance administrative cuts like this through the general budget, or via direct charges.
Since the question of charges for issuing greenhouse gas emission permits is not within the Commission's competence, the Commission has no overview of how much each Member State currently charges for issuing greenhouse gas emission permits under the Emissions Trading Directive.
The review of the Emissions Trading Directive will start early in 2005.
It will be a major stakeholder survey and will cover a broad range of issues, including the effect of the scheme on the extra-Community competitiveness of European companies.
Â Â  Commissioner, emission trading certificates are a very important aspect of the European Union's meeting its Kyoto objectives.
It seems to me very unsatisfactory that you are not able to inform the Member of the current state of play as regards each individual Member State.
Will the Commission, in moving towards a review in 2005, survey the 25 Member States to establish what is the existing practice and ensure that a level playing field is created post-2005?
Â Â  . As I said, the review of the emissions trading directive will start at the beginning of 2005.
It will be a major stakeholder survey and will cover a broad range of issues.
I can forward your question to my colleagues and perhaps ask them to carry out a study so that we can compare the situation in each country.
It seems reasonable to me to have this information but I repeat that taxation and charges are not the competence of our Commission.
It is up to each Member State to decide the level of charges and taxation, as is the case for other products.
Â Â  . The Commission is well aware of the problem of piracy, particularly in its most recent and exacerbated form via the Internet.
I fully share the honourable Member's view that this phenomenon is very damaging to the cultural industries and I am determined to do the utmost to get piracy levels as low as possible.
The Commission established a high-level group on digital rights management systems in March 2004, as part of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.
The high-level group's final report, presented on 8 July, reflects a consensus on basic principles and recommendations for future actions in three areas, one of which is the migration to legitimate services.
Encouraging consumers to use legitimate online services is fundamental to the creation of a thriving e-content market.
The digital rights management systems will play an essential part, enabling new business models and preventing unauthorised use.
Recommendations included actively promoting awareness among consumers of legitimate alternative offerings and the need to create consumer confidence.
Regarding the situation outside the EU borders, also addressed by the honourable Member, on 10 November 2004 the Commission adopted a strategy for the enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries.
This strategy sets the guidelines for the coming years towards a reduction of the level of intellectual property rights violations taking place beyond the EU borders.
Over and above technical cooperation and assistance, enforcement, regulatory implementation and bilateral and multilateral monitoring, the Commission will foster awareness-raising of users and consumers in third countries and support the creation of public-private partnerships for enforcement.
There are a number of programmes that also cover intellectual property rights and include awareness and education: for example, ECAP, which is an intellectual property programme for the ASEAN countries; the Cotonou Agreement for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and the CARDS programme for the countries of the Balkans.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that answer.
The point is that all those measures are perfectly valid and, as you explained, deal with all the different aspects of protecting intellectual property.
The specific problem I tried to raise is whether the Commission will focus particularly on the area where Member States have fewer instruments to deal with this, showing what is behind the protection of intellectual property and raising awareness among citizens.
This is probably one of the few cases where criminal codes are violated by citizens without them knowing that they are doing so, and even thinking that it is something positive to do.
So what do you intend to do to show, through general campaigns or whatever, that this is a very important matter and that the future of the audiovisual industry in Europe is at stake?
Â Â  . The Commission will continue monitoring what is going on in individual Member States.
Various Member States such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany have already put in place large-scale education and awareness programmes.
The Commission does not have more resources than Member States.
It is a matter primarily for Member States to ensure that the point you have validly raised is more widely known, along with the problems that arise from unlicensed and illegal copying.
I am informed that the black market value of illegal CDs and DVDs is three times that of cannabis, and the profit margins are eight-fold.
Therefore it is a much more profitable activity, with lower risks of being caught and lower penalties.
It is thus in the interests of the Member States to ensure that awareness measures are in place in an effort to stop this activity.
Â Â  . First of all I would like to say that the question of the seat of the European Parliament is covered by Protocol No 8 on the establishment of the seats of the institutions, specific organisations and services of the European Communities such as Europol, and is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The question of the location of the institutions has had a very high priority and concerns a high level of decision-making, relating not only to the location of our institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg, but also to Luxembourg.
This concerns a very high-level political decision.
For the Commission the total cost of missions of officials to Strasbourg amounted to EUR 1.7 million in 2003.
This includes all the costs of missions, including those of Commission officials and members of Commissioners' offices.
So this is not a large amount of money.
A slightly higher amount is forecast for the future.
You asked about all the costs for the Union.
We do not have a very precise overview of all costs, but we know that for the European Parliament the costs are much higher.
According to the March 2004 report by Mr van Hulten, MEP, the total cost of having part-sessions in both Brussels and Strasbourg amounts to about EUR 200 million annually.
Mr van Hulten favoured Brussels as the single seat of Parliament and he was supported by Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control.
The Commission is not in a position to judge the functioning of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I appreciate the difficulties with the figures because there are so many of us who have to be moved between these two seats.
It is not only a cost in terms of money but also a cost to the environment, which I think is incredibly important.
I find it extremely difficult to defend these journeys to people in Europe and Sweden when they ask questions about this issue.
We are concerned here with a lot of money, which we could spend on many other important issues within the EU.
I think this issue is important, and we should raise it as often as possible until we are able to have a single seat for our work, hopefully in Brussels.
Â Â  . That is your opinion.
As I said, the location of the European institutions was decided in 1957 and it has continued to be a very high level of political decision-making.
The Commission is ready to discuss all these issues.
It is very difficult to estimate the costs to the environment, but the amount of money in our budget for 2003 was EUR 1.7 million.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, do you agree with me that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament, that it is only by way of a concession in order to reduce bureaucracy in its cooperation with the other European institutions that it migrates to Brussels, and that its principal seat is here in Strasbourg?
Do you also agree with me that the figure of EURÂ 200 million that you have given for annual expenditure refers not to the extra costs, but to the total costs of running this House?
Â Â  . The location of European institutions cannot be considered only from the viewpoint of the costs involved.
This is a very important political matter.
In his report, Mr van Hulten put these costs at about EUR 200 million, most of which were incurred as a result of travel between Brussels and Strasbourg and vice versa.
I do not have more precise figures, but the overall costs of Parliament, as can been seen in the budget, are higher.
Â Â  Yes, Madam President, Commissioner, this question has obviously come up repeatedly since we have been in this magnificent Chamber, and I believe we would all like to have a single place of work, that is true.
We all want to cut costs, we all want to cut waste, we all want to cut pollution, but I think the question today is the location of the seat of the European Parliament.
Today it is in Strasbourg, and I think France and the citizens of Strasbourg are happy to welcome it and are doing all they can to make us feel at home.
For my part, I would like to know whether a study has been carried out to find out whether there really is a difference, because any journey to Brussels or Strasbourg represents a cost, which is the same for everyone.
Whether Members travel to Strasbourg or to Brussels, I do not therefore believe it is really worth making a fuss about this seat every time.
It is really a political question for our political authorities.
Â Â  . This is a political question and I have no comments on it.
This was decided in 1957.
I can assure you that the Commission has no intention of proposing any changes on this complicated matter.
Â Â  . I am very happy to reply to this question, because immediately after I was designated as the Commissioner responsible for several areas, including OLAF, I was approached and asked how to go ahead with various projects and proposals on the future of OLAF, including possible management decisions.
Several different options were proposed.
One was to fill this post through an open competition.
I promised that I would express my opinion after the formalities were over.
The formalities were completed on 22 November and immediately after the new Commission started we made the decision to advertise this post and fill it through an open competition.
Today we received the final opinion of the legal services about some nuances concerning the announcement.
A few days ago I received the first version of the job description, so the post will be advertised very soon. There will then be an open competition.
Â Â  I would like to know how the new time schedule looks now, and what time has been allocated to Parliament to hear the candidates.
Â Â  . The Commission realises clearly that this is a specific post and that Parliament and Council must be consulted on the appointment of the Director.
The deadline is 1 March, which is when the term expires.
If we publish it now, the competition procedure will be quite short.
I hope that at the beginning of next year we will have enough time to consult with the relevant parliamentary committee and the Council about proposed candidates.
We will try to select candidates as soon as possible and then start the consultation with Parliament.
The Commission has no intention of reducing Parliament's role in this very sensitive matter.
Â Â  In the absence of the Member who put it, Question 37 lapses.
Â Â  . The honourable Member's question covered two areas: firstly cultural diversity, pluralism and independence and secondly achieving a knowledge-based economy.
Cultural diversity is enshrined in Community law, mainly in the Amsterdam Protocol.
The second aspect is an innovation-encouraging and technology-welcoming strategy.
Both these objectives have a vital role to play in the future EU.
Community law does not exclude the possibility of defining new media services as a public service.
However, new technologies must be embraced by all actors â both public and private â for a successful information society for all.
This means that appropriate public service obligations may be needed and imposed in the environment of these new technologies.
The Commission communication of 2001 on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting confirms that the Member States are responsible for the financing and definition of public service broadcasting.
In that communication the Commission does not exclude the possibility that certain on-line activities could be performed as a public service.
Thus Member States may take appropriate actions to achieve the objectives mentioned.
However, I should like to remind you that other media players â both existing operators and new entrants â have a role to play in contributing to pluralism, cultural diversity, innovation, competitiveness and consumer choice.
Â Â  Madam President, thank you very much for your answer.
My question is based on the fact that there are many who would limit the opportunities for public service to operate.
Limiting public service by banning the use of certain technology is just one way of doing this.
There are also those who see the new TV directive, as well as the proposed services directive, as a way of limiting public service.
How is the Commission to ensure that these directives in particular do not encroach upon the right of the Member States themselves to define what public service is and what conditions shall apply to the public service companies?
Â Â  . Madam President, there is a hierarchy of directives, and the directive concerned with television is the Television without Frontiers Directive.
The Treaty is also important, and the Amsterdam Protocol is very clear on the matter.
That is why, in order to emphasise legal certainty, the Commission published its communication on state aid to public television in 2001, and why it expressly included the option for Member States of affording the Internet, among other things, the same treatment as public television, provided the Internet is part of the public sector and subject to the same obligations.
Â Â  . Madam President, I must also say in this connection that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, and that it has always done what is necessary to ensure compliance with the competition rules, in particular the provisions concerning State aid in the field of broadcasting.
Still on this question, I would like to add that the 2001 communication on State aid to public service broadcasting clarifies the way in which the relevant rules must be applied.
It explains clearly, should there still be any need to do so, that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defining its remit, and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be.
The Commission looks only at whether the definition of the remit and the financing correspond to the reality on the ground.
The important thing in the eyes of the Commission is therefore that the remit be defined as clearly and precisely as possible, and that if a public service goes beyond its public remit it should keep separate accounts for commercial activities such as the sale of advertising space, for example.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Mrs Reding.
Thank you for clarifying so precisely what we already know to be laid down in Community legislation.
The purpose of my question, Commissioner, was to try to go a little further.
In all the countries of the European Union, we often note that, in accordance with that interpretation of our rules, which you have clarified so well, there is often â shall we say â perverse behaviour that transgresses free competition.
Do you believe that we could seek to produce a new formulation, a new text, which is able to bring together the public service criteria in a clearer manner?
Â Â  . The honourable Member is well aware that the Commission cannot go beyond the existing texts.
However, as talks are currently being held with the industry about a possible revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive, this is the time to put another definition on the table, if need be.
I am therefore waiting to see what the public and private sectors have to say on the matter.
I would also like to say to the honourable Member that if the private sector files a complaint for unfair competition, the Commission takes up that complaint, examines whether the public sector is right or wrong and grants or rejects the requests made.
One might mention a number of interesting authorisations which are cases in point; for example, State aid to and to was allowed, as was aid to and other programmes of the same kind, because they were compatible with the rules.
Others were amended or rejected.
We still have cases that are being examined, and you can be sure, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, that the Commission tries to apply the rules every time, and to ensure that there can be free competition between a public sector and a private sector which must not be stifled.
Â Â  . The honourable Member raised the issue of the provision of subtitling and audio description last year in Parliament's resolution on television without frontiers.
It is certain that digital broadcasting offers improved subtitling and audio description when compared with the analogue system.
There are already standards for these services.
I see the switchover to digital television as an opportunity for enhanced services of this type. It is not a threat.
As I told Parliament at my hearing in September, I believe that the development of new technologies must be to the benefit of citizens and of their welfare.
That is why my services will shortly publish a call for tenders, launching a study on accessibility to digital television.
This study will focus on developing policy models in order to help Member States implement assistive services.
I would also like to say that there is no requirement in European law for broadcasters in Member States to provide subtitling and audio descriptions.
Provision of assistive service is handled under the subsidiarity principle, but there are of course some areas coordinated at Community level by the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
Within the framework of this directive, I have called on the contact committee to provide information on the measures taken by the Member States in order to enhance the opportunities for access of visually- and hearing-impaired people to television programmes.
We are now in the process of collecting and analysing the Member States' replies.
Our aim is to promote best practice among regulators and industry groups and we will work with Member States to promote availability of assistive services and to foster an economically viable market for equipment that addresses accessibility needs.
Â Â  The Commissioner will not be surprised that with a new Commission we raise these issues once again.
In fact, she would probably be surprised if we did not.
I accept what she says in relation to the Television without Frontiers Directive, but I would ask her to keep a very close eye on this issue.
Subsidiarity is a fine thing, but she will know that the European Union has been funding conferences on subtitling for some 20 years and more, and that the actual increase in its incidence among broadcasters is very limited indeed.
Will she, for example, ensure that a benchmarking process takes place so that we see a gradual increase year by year?
Can she today comment on when she will bring forward the results of the analysis that she has undertaken in relation to the contact group and in what form she will do so; and can she give hope to blind and deaf people throughout Europe that better television services will prevail?
Â Â  . I would like to assure the honourable Member that I remember his letter of 25 November 2003 on the subject very well.
Now that I am responsible not only for the Television without Frontiers Directive but also for the new media in general, I will certainly put even more weight on this question than I did before.
The answer to the honourable Member's question is that the study on the policy models will start at the beginning of 2005 and will finish roughly one year later, between the beginning and middle of 2006.
As for the Contact Committee, its work is continuing and the results will be published on the web in early 2005.
Â Â  The Commissioner will be aware that I have been raising with her the question of the broadcasting of the English Premiership on television.
The Commissioner has replied that broadband Internet may be a possibility for broadcasting this without restriction.
If broadband Internet is to be used as a new way of providing more widespread communication, could I ask the Commissioner if she would also consider introducing provisions in the new proposals she is putting forward to ensure that broadband Internet broadcasting arrangements also include some suitable subtitling for the kind of people mentioned in the question?
Â Â  . Madam President, the Commission is obviously required to be neutral in matters of technology.
What is true for one technology must be true for another, and we must show persons who have difficulties in participating fully in the information society the same respect regardless of the technology.
In substance, therefore, it does not change anything, but in form, of course, it does, and where we are encouraging broadband technology, persons with sight or hearing problems must obviously be assisted.
Incidentally, we are seeing, for example, that third-generation telephones really do allow us to meet these personsâ needs; they enable the hard of hearing to use the telephone by transmitting an image of the lips.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to say to MrÂ Ebner that the Television without Frontiers Directive lays down the principle that television advertising and teleshopping must be kept separate from other parts of the programme by optical and acoustic means.
The Directive also states that surreptitious advertising and teleshopping are prohibited.
As I have already said in answer to previous questions, the Directive is being reviewed, and the public consultation held in 2003 allowed the various parties concerned to express their views.
Some operators are in fact in favour of making the rule on advertising more flexible to take account of changing technology by allowing split screens, for example, or the marketing of equipment that would enable viewers to avoid advertising messages.
However, in 2003 there was a consensus that advertising should be clearly identified so as to avoid misleading the public.
That consultation did not identify any development in Europe of product placement advertising practices that would violate the terms of the Directive.
That is why this point was clarified in the Commissionâs 2003 interpretative communication on certain aspects of the provisions on televised advertising.
I am of course prepared to go over all these matters again in connection with a possible revision of the Directive, which I intend to present in 2005.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam President.
I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that she will give priority to consumer protection in this case if there is to be a change of opinion in 2005.
The fact is that existing practice has not been particularly satisfactory, with approaches having been taken that do not protect the consumer, and something must be done about that.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall, then, try to set an equally good example and to keep it brief.
Consumer protection is of course high up on the agenda and we will take due account of it; the Commission is prepared, in revising this Directive, to cooperate closely not only with the MEPs who concern themselves with consumer protection, but also with consumer protection organisations.
Â Â  . The honourable Member asked if the Commissioner agrees with the adjusted interpretation of paragraph 14 of the United Kingdom Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations, 2003, which deals with the use of location data.
Since this question is related to an interpretation of national law, I would refer the honourable Member to Mr Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner in the United Kingdom, who is responsible for enforcing these privacy and electronic communication regulations. The regulations transpose the European directive on privacy and economic communication â the ePrivacy Directive.
As the member of the Commission responsible for this directive, I am pleased to indicate the following elements for the benefit of any national interpretation exercise.
This EU ePrivacy Directive provides that location data may be used, but only with the consent of the subscriber or user.
Prior to that consent, the user or subscriber has to be informed of the types of data processed, the purpose and duration of the processing, and whether the data will be passed on to third parties for the purpose of the service.
However, the Commission is not of the view that the directive requires the user or subscriber to be informed of or consent to the location prior to every single attempt by the locator to locate him.
Nevertheless, the directive requires that subscribers and users, even if they have subscribed to a location-based service, be able to temporarily block the locating facility.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
